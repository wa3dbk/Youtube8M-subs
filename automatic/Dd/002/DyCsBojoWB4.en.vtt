you<00:00:00.179> really<00:00:00.599> don't<00:00:00.780> want<00:00:00.960> you<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.170> know<00:00:01.319> this

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
you really don't want you to know this

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.780 
you really don't want you to know this
stuff<00:00:01.580> right<00:00:02.659> and<00:00:03.799> is<00:00:04.799> do<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.279> think<00:00:05.520> it's<00:00:05.670> in

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
stuff right and is do you think it's in

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.579 
stuff right and is do you think it's in
a<00:00:05.879> different<00:00:06.089> dimension<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:07.230> that's<00:00:07.379> why

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
a different dimension and that's why

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.080 
a different dimension and that's why
people<00:00:08.010> don't<00:00:08.160> see<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.519> as<00:00:08.670> readily<00:00:08.970> as

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
people don't see it as readily as

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.759 
people don't see it as readily as
anything<00:00:09.510> else<00:00:09.780> or<00:00:10.969> a<00:00:11.969> interesting

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
anything else or a interesting

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.390 
anything else or a interesting
interesting<00:00:13.769> question<00:00:14.610> uh<00:00:15.230> no<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.250> do

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
interesting question uh no I but I do

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.620 
interesting question uh no I but I do
believe<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.420> perhaps<00:00:19.080> is

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
believe that it perhaps is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.970 
believe that it perhaps is
interdimensional<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> sense<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.500> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
interdimensional in the sense that and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.880 
interdimensional in the sense that and
this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:24.330> happens<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.529> we're<00:00:25.680> being

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
this is what happens or what we're being

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.679 
this is what happens or what we're being
told<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.970> seems<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.449> happening

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
told and and what seems to be happening

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.009 
told and and what seems to be happening
is<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.970> between<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.359> third<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> fourth

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
is that between the third and the fourth

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.229 
is that between the third and the fourth
because<00:00:31.410> we're<00:00:31.619> moving<00:00:32.040> into<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> four<00:00:32.640> right

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
because we're moving into the four right

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
because we're moving into the four right
there's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.719> movement<00:00:34.230> from<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.190> dimension

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
there's a movement from this dimension

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.170 
there's a movement from this dimension
into<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> next<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.280> we<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.460> able<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
into the next one and and we are able to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.049 
into the next one and and we are able to
see<00:00:39.450> more<00:00:40.370> consequently<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.550> other<00:00:41.670> words<00:00:41.879> if

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
see more consequently in other words if

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.490 
see more consequently in other words if
you're<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> fourth<00:00:42.629> dimension<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.320> can

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you're in the fourth dimension you can

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979 
you're in the fourth dimension you can
see<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> third<00:00:44.129> very<00:00:44.460> clearly<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.239> you're<00:00:45.899> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
see the third very clearly if you're in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
see the third very clearly if you're in
the<00:00:46.079> third<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.500> can't<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.190> four

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the third you can't really see the four

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.340 
the third you can't really see the four
but<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> move<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> other

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
but as you move from one to the other

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
but as you move from one to the other
you're<00:00:49.770> starting<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.300> veil<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.539> lifted

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
you're starting to the veil is lifted

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.900 
you're starting to the veil is lifted
and<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.289> no<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.219> real<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and but but no this is very real in

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
and but but no this is very real in
other<00:00:57.120> words<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.629> happening<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> in

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
other words it's happening in this in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490 
other words it's happening in this in
this<00:00:59.160> dimension<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.000> know<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this dimension that we know of it and a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.570 
this dimension that we know of it and a
lot<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.039> happening<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.920> i<00:01:04.920> have

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
in other words chemtrails let's say they

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.460 
in other words chemtrails let's say they
are<00:01:28.850> obscuring<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> sky<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> can't<00:01:31.110> see

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
are obscuring the sky so you can't see

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.660 
are obscuring the sky so you can't see
what's<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:34.040> that's<00:01:35.040> part<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.520> their

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
what's going on and that's part of their

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.850 
what's going on and that's part of their
part<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.390> their<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.810> reason<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.409> existence

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
part of their the reason for existence

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.300 
part of their the reason for existence
there<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> lot<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> other<00:01:39.240> reasons<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.810> well

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
there are a lot of other reasons as well

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
there are a lot of other reasons as well
and<00:01:42.680> there<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.840> don't<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.930> how<00:01:46.110> they're

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and there are I don't know how they're

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.020 
and there are I don't know how they're
doing<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.250> obscuring<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
doing it but they are obscuring the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240 
doing it but they are obscuring the
night<00:01:48.210> sky<00:01:48.570> their<00:01:48.930> obscure<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.860> able<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
night sky their obscure they are able to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.330 
night sky their obscure they are able to
use<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.360> kinds<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.810> cloaking<00:01:52.740> methods

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
use know all kinds of cloaking methods

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.990 
use know all kinds of cloaking methods
and<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.060> forth<00:01:54.110> right<00:01:55.969> you're<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and so on so forth right you're a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300 
and so on so forth right you're a
machine<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> reason<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.860> guy<00:01:59.070> got

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
machine actually the reason this guy got

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.999 
machine actually the reason this guy got
the<00:01:59.610> footage<00:01:59.850> he<00:02:00.060> did<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.450> because<00:02:00.659> he<00:02:01.560> had<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the footage he did is because he had it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.080 
the footage he did is because he had it
on<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.750> he<00:02:03.960> also<00:02:04.170> had<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:05.040> more<00:02:05.969> than

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
on I think he also had like more than

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.730 
on I think he also had like more than
one<00:02:06.149> camera<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.719> he<00:02:06.899> asked<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
one camera and he asked it's like a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.990 
one camera and he asked it's like a
time-lapse<00:02:08.459> thing<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:11.069> things<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.790> you

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
time-lapse thing and so things that you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.640 
time-lapse thing and so things that you
couldn't<00:02:12.270> normally<00:02:12.510> see<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
couldn't normally see that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
couldn't normally see that
camera<00:02:14.069> sees<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.549> we<00:02:14.700> can't<00:02:14.970> see<00:02:15.090> as<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.750> may

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
camera sees what we can't see as you may

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.350 
camera sees what we can't see as you may
know<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.290> I've<00:02:16.409> had<00:02:16.709> actually<00:02:17.370> evidence<00:02:18.090> is

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
know and I've had actually evidence is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.059 
know and I've had actually evidence is
because<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.900> went<00:02:19.200> out<00:02:19.430> one<00:02:20.430> time<00:02:20.689> I<00:02:21.689> was<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:22.680> I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
a lot of people never go there so they

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.390 
a lot of people never go there so they
never<00:02:49.739> see<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.220> right<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:52.799> couldn't<00:02:53.220> see

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
never see it right but I I couldn't see

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.830 
never see it right but I I couldn't see
with<00:02:53.549> my<00:02:53.700> naked<00:02:53.879> eye<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.629> knew<00:02:54.810> something

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
with my naked eye I just knew something

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.830 
with my naked eye I just knew something
was<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.220> i<00:02:56.340> ended<00:02:56.730> up<00:02:56.879> i<00:02:57.150> guess<00:02:57.599> it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
was going on and i ended up i guess it

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.619 
was going on and i ended up i guess it
was<00:02:57.870> psychic<00:02:58.349> intuition<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:59.629> simultaneously

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
was psychic intuition and simultaneously

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.369 
was psychic intuition and simultaneously
there<00:03:01.079> was<00:03:01.379> what<00:03:02.099> appeared<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.549> be<00:03:02.639> uh<00:03:03.379> some

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
there was what appeared to be uh some

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.699 
there was what appeared to be uh some
kind<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> bizarre<00:03:05.569> take<00:03:06.569> off<00:03:06.780> from<00:03:07.019> vandenberg

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
kind of bizarre take off from vandenberg

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.379 
kind of bizarre take off from vandenberg
which<00:03:08.639> was<00:03:08.879> north<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.359> me<00:03:09.540> i<00:03:09.569> guess<00:03:11.090> but<00:03:12.090> it

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
which was north of me i guess but it

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.689 
which was north of me i guess but it
seems<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.489> more<00:03:14.489> than<00:03:14.549> just<00:03:14.879> your<00:03:15.299> average

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
seems to be more than just your average

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.110 
seems to be more than just your average
whatever<00:03:17.699> they<00:03:17.940> do<00:03:18.000> for<00:03:18.389> off<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.750> Vandenberg<00:03:19.379> I

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
whatever they do for off of Vandenberg I

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.390 
whatever they do for off of Vandenberg I
mean<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.930> fascinating<00:03:22.440> shot<00:03:23.010> they<00:03:23.340> were

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
mean it's a fascinating shot they were

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.689 
mean it's a fascinating shot they were
at<00:03:23.669> great<00:03:24.540> shots<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:26.069> point<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
at great shots it if you point the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.129 
at great shots it if you point the
camera<00:03:26.730> at<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.269> sky<00:03:27.540> if<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.870> think

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
see the planes coming in and out in

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.219 
see the planes coming in and out in
helicopters<00:04:15.209> all<00:04:15.359> around<00:04:15.599> these<00:04:15.750> lights<00:04:16.019> and

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
helicopters all around these lights and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.069 
helicopters all around these lights and
they<00:04:16.289> were<00:04:16.349> stationary<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.220> one<00:04:17.430> spot<00:04:17.699> they

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
they were stationary in one spot they

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.159 
they were stationary in one spot they
they<00:04:19.909> basically<00:04:20.909> i<00:04:21.030> got<00:04:21.299> probably<00:04:21.779> about<00:04:21.870> 10

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
they basically i got probably about 10

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.100 
they basically i got probably about 10
minutes<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.590> them<00:04:22.740> as<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:23.520> shot<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.270> with<00:04:24.900> my

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
minutes of them as a shot and with my

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.970 
minutes of them as a shot and with my
video<00:04:25.860> camera

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
video camera

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.830 
video camera
and<00:04:27.100> we<00:04:27.520> put<00:04:27.730> some<00:04:27.850> stills<00:04:28.180> we<00:04:28.480> made<00:04:28.660> some

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
and we put some stills we made some

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.240 
and we put some stills we made some
stills<00:04:29.140> out<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.560> put<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.830> up<00:04:29.890> on<00:04:30.040> my

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
stills out of it to put it up on my

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.400 
stills out of it to put it up on my
website<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.820> know<00:04:34.090> what<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.810> know<00:04:35.170> what

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
website and so I know what I know what

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.170 
website and so I know what I know what
it<00:04:35.500> wasn't<00:04:35.710> I'm<00:04:36.250> not<00:04:36.460> quite<00:04:36.640> sure<00:04:36.670> what<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.030> was

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
it wasn't I'm not quite sure what it was

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.600 
it wasn't I'm not quite sure what it was
but<00:04:37.240> I'm<00:04:37.750> assuming<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:38.530> was<00:04:38.710> either

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
but I'm assuming that it was either

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.520 
but I'm assuming that it was either
several<00:04:40.180> spaceships<00:04:40.630> or<00:04:40.750> one<00:04:40.900> great<00:04:41.110> big<00:04:41.320> one

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
several spaceships or one great big one

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.600 
several spaceships or one great big one
that<00:04:41.620> all<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:41.860> could<00:04:41.920> see<00:04:42.160> was<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> lights

that all I could see was the lights

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
that all I could see was the lights
driven<00:04:43.090> enough<00:04:44.640> fabulous<00:04:45.640> yeah<00:04:46.000> absolutely

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
course I live on the East Coast and

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.430 
course I live on the East Coast and
almost<00:05:09.460> seems<00:05:09.730> like<00:05:09.820> when<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.410> travel<00:05:11.410> out

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
almost seems like when you travel out

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.660 
almost seems like when you travel out
west<00:05:12.450> Arizona<00:05:13.450> Nevada<00:05:14.220> right<00:05:15.220> around<00:05:15.400> in<00:05:15.580> that

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
west Arizona Nevada right around in that

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.340 
west Arizona Nevada right around in that
area<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:16.270> energies<00:05:16.690> are<00:05:16.870> higher<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.230> can

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
area the energies are higher you can

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.140 
area the energies are higher you can
almost<00:05:17.500> feel<00:05:17.830> them<00:05:18.100> whenever<00:05:18.280> you<00:05:18.460> even<00:05:19.030> when

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
almost feel them whenever you even when

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.690 
almost feel them whenever you even when
you<00:05:19.240> land<00:05:19.480> and<00:05:19.660> you're<00:05:19.810> in<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:21.280> part<00:05:21.550> of

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
you land and you're in the that part of

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.460 
you land and you're in the that part of
the<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:23.470> earth<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:25.140> people<00:05:26.140> are<00:05:26.230> more<00:05:26.440> open

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
the holds a lower energy per se where

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.600 
the holds a lower energy per se where
even<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.900> people<00:05:41.290> there<00:05:41.470> have<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.220> different

will awareness around the world at least
by<00:06:06.910> indications<00:06:07.600> of<00:06:07.780> what<00:06:07.990> we<00:06:08.170> see<00:06:08.410> on<00:06:08.500> Camelot

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
by indications of what we see on Camelot

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 
dimension either although I did

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.309 
dimension either although I did
certainly<00:07:10.740> not<00:07:10.919> as<00:07:11.250> dark<00:07:11.550> as<00:07:11.759> this<00:07:11.970> level<00:07:12.539> but

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319

certainly not as dark as this level but
at<00:07:13.349> any<00:07:13.620> rate<00:07:13.740> that's<00:07:14.699> I<00:07:15.030> guess<00:07:15.479> what<00:07:15.900> I<00:07:15.930> would

say<00:07:16.169> so<00:07:16.650> just<00:07:16.889> keep<00:07:17.009> an<00:07:17.159> open<00:07:17.250> mind<00:07:17.580> and<00:07:17.789> keep

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:17.969 
say so just keep an open mind and keep

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.480 
say so just keep an open mind and keep
exploring<00:07:18.479> keep<00:07:18.900> investigating<00:07:19.500> don't<00:07:20.310> rule

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
exploring keep investigating don't rule
