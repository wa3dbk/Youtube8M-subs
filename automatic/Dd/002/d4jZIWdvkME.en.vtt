00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.930
 Hi, I'm Tuco Marcondes, I'm 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.820
 guitarist of zeca baleiro has a 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.919
 band called coffee breaks the producer 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.660
 musical and also has a solo work 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.759
 Today I'm here to show you one. 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.680
 new concept in terms of acoustic guitar 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.440
 was developed by is to love that the line 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.520
 saillant the villains yamaha site comes in 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.579
 three versions 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.649
 the one that is here with me that sl g 120 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.359
 mw nylon strings 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.530
 the slightly simpler version of it 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.359
 is the slg and the steel ropes that the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.339
 sl jessen s 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.070
 they all have a very characteristic 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.440
 interesting them as you can see him 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.390
 it has no body it is a solid block 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.579
 which virtually makes it impossible 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 any warpage problem of 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.780
 and is an acoustic guitar that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 allows you to play without disturbing 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.430
 no one because he has an entrance to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.470
 headset and you can touch 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.780
 hotel room can play at dawn 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.549
 if you live in apartments is a villain 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.869
 very practical for those who do not want 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.520
 annoy others 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.409
 When I say it 's a guitar that you 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.180
 You can play without disturbing anyone I go. 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.790
 show now why we 're listening 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:36.000
 the sound of it open connected being here by 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 movie and now I'm going to close the sound of it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 You have the feeling of outsiders. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.240
 new practically nothing 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.280
 turning his sound 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.979
 this is the sound you hear on your phone and 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.360
 this is the sound that others hear when 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.770
 Do you have your phone? 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.500
 now we'll see some of the sound of the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.119
 sl jessen s 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.299
 I'll play the song my call let's 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.299
 go 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 op 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.939
 The button 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.040
 all sites have two types of reverb 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.380
 which is a longer one and a shorter one 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.020
 that of that ambience in the sound 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.660
 they have the bass volume control 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.640
 of treble and there is something very cool 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.360
 it has an auxiliary input that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.920
 makes it possible for you to wait for an mp3 on it 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.260
 controls the volume of individual 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.630
 can play along with the recording or 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.800
 can study then this is an advantage 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.830
 very good that few instruments 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.440
 offer beyond the quality of their sound 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.480
 It is exceptional, for example, in the 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.739
 show of zeca baleiro the guitar site of 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.330
 steel because the fact that he has no body 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.370
 not the microphone at all you 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.700
 can play on extremely high volumes that 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.800
 There is a power problem. 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.690
 Good, I told you today about the site 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.630
 tie but before I forget it was a 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.110
 very important thing in these times of 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.000
 portability 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.770
 this instrument is very easy to be 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.160
 transported by which it stands out that 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.770
 this part of him and you condition him 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.170
 do not drink very little that can and 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.450
 up inside the plane 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.030
 now we will see the sound of sl g 120 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.030
 mw I'll play the song my call lax
