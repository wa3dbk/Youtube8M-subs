00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
I found this was definitely something

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.370 
I found this was definitely something
that<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.940> should<00:03:46.150> use<00:03:46.180> as<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> starter<00:03:47.170> class

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380

remember this is the best starter class
in<00:03:49.750> my<00:03:49.930> opinion<00:03:50.290> not<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.070> best<00:03:51.280> overall<00:03:51.489> class

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060
