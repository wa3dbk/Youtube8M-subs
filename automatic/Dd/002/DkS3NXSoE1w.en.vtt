time but I think it's really really nice
for<00:05:30.600> summer<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:31.320> I<00:05:31.350> really<00:05:31.830> like<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.130> finish

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
for summer so I really like the finish

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.159 
for summer so I really like the finish
of<00:05:32.550> this<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:32.940> don't<00:05:33.060> think<00:05:33.150> it's<00:05:33.510> um<00:05:33.810> the

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
of this I don't think it's um the

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.560 
of this I don't think it's um the
overall<00:05:35.070> makeup<00:05:35.310> not<00:05:35.550> just<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.000> vital

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
overall makeup not just the vital

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.800 
overall makeup not just the vital
Lumiere<00:05:36.900> aqua<00:05:37.669> but<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:39.150> whole<00:05:39.390> with<00:05:39.720> the

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
Lumiere aqua but the whole with the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.210 
Lumiere aqua but the whole with the
powder<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:40.140> everything<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.680> just<00:05:40.710> think<00:05:41.070> that

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
powder and everything I just think that

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.340 
powder and everything I just think that
it<00:05:41.340> makes<00:05:41.490> your<00:05:41.970> face<00:05:42.030> look<00:05:42.510> not<00:05:42.930> completely

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
it makes your face look not completely

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.260 
it makes your face look not completely
matte<00:05:43.560> but<00:05:43.710> it's<00:05:43.860> not<00:05:44.040> too<00:05:44.220> oily<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.790> it's

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
matte but it's not too oily and it's

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.580 
matte but it's not too oily and it's
okay<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.660> use<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.870> powder<00:05:46.140> during<00:05:46.500> the

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
okay to use a powder during the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.440
