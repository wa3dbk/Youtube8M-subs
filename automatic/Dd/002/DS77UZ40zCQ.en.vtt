extremely cheap packaging I was really

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.649

hoping<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.670> an<00:01:11.880> actual<00:01:12.119> box

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
hoping for an actual box

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
hoping for an actual box
I<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.140> Zelda<00:01:13.500> puzzles<00:01:13.920> sold<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.280> stores

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
I do see Zelda puzzles sold in stores

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
I do see Zelda puzzles sold in stores
for<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.150> ten<00:01:15.420> dollars<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> cardboard<00:01:16.290> box

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
for like ten dollars in a cardboard box

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.499 
for like ten dollars in a cardboard box
and<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.340> Box<00:01:17.520> shouldn't<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> expensive

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and the Box shouldn't be that expensive

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359 
and the Box shouldn't be that expensive
to<00:01:18.840> produce<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.650> Club<00:01:19.920> Nintendo<00:01:20.040> was

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to produce but I know Club Nintendo was

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.859 
to produce but I know Club Nintendo was
probably<00:01:20.640> trying<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> reduce<00:01:21.119> costs<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
probably trying to reduce costs but this

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.320 
probably trying to reduce costs but this
feels<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.860> cheap<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
feels really really cheap on the back it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
feels really really cheap on the back it
does<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> emblem<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> game<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
you can kind of make out some characters

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.390 
you can kind of make out some characters
on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.509> packaging<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.200> -<00:01:31.470> I'm<00:01:32.100> not

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
on the packaging for this - I'm not

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.859 
on the packaging for this - I'm not
going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> open<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.509> probably<00:01:33.689> gonna

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
going to open this up I'm probably gonna

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
going to open this up I'm probably gonna
keep<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> sealed<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.829> sure<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> display

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
keep it sealed I'm not sure I display

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
keep it sealed I'm not sure I display
something<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.810> maybe<00:01:36.990> I'll<00:01:37.140> just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
something like this so maybe I'll just

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350 
something like this so maybe I'll just
keep<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.710> tucked<00:01:38.009> away<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.640> point<00:01:38.880> but

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
keep it tucked away at some point but

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.850 
keep it tucked away at some point but
this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> puzzle<00:01:40.110> will<00:01:40.439> look<00:01:40.680> like

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
this is what the puzzle will look like

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.280 
this is what the puzzle will look like
so<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.479> colorful<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> looks

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so we do have really colorful it looks

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.719 
so we do have really colorful it looks
pretty<00:01:43.560> awesome<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> poster

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
pretty awesome if this was a poster

pretty awesome if this was a poster
would<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> great<00:01:45.240> poster<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.020> might<00:01:46.200> exist

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
would make a great poster it might exist

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410

basically<00:02:03.240> from<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> original<00:02:03.930> Legend<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
like I think these are the four children

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.410 
like I think these are the four children
from<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.289> Moon<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.370> them<00:02:11.879> each<00:02:12.120> wearing

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
from the Moon we have them each wearing

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.130 
from the Moon we have them each wearing
a<00:02:12.510> mask<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.840> one<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
a mask of one of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660 
a mask of one of
remains<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> bosses<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> four

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
remains of the bosses from the four

pretty high-quality actually it feels

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.820 
pretty high-quality actually it feels
like<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.600> neoprene<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.260> something<00:02:46.680> like

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
like it is neoprene or something like

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.560 
like it is neoprene or something like
that<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.459> almost<00:02:47.700> looks<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.209> green<00:02:48.390> is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
that it almost looks like the green is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.970 
that it almost looks like the green is
darker<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> bottom<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:49.590> lighter<00:02:49.800> on

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
darker on the bottom and then lighter on

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.320 
darker on the bottom and then lighter on
the<00:02:50.070> top<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.459> might<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.940> lighting<00:02:51.239> in

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the top it might just be the lighting in

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.640 
the top it might just be the lighting in
here<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.930> that's<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.200> what<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.470> looks

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
here but that's really what it looks
