00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello guys the other day I was or by 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.640
 twitter I asked if you wanted that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 questions and answers should do so me 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 I knew is a little better the truth is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 there is here here we go who you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.620
 inspired to do a channel and why and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.540
 how many people asked me the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 same question then I put it to the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 not with the truth that no person 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 I just watched videos I had 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.359
 people who made videos I do not know some I 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.119
 they liked and I said good I can 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.949
 do it in another way that I like 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.650
 to people and that I like my 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 not videos and so what but I also that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 we always upload the first video that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.829
 was the cylinder so that people 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.760
 identifies so much with this game to me in 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.710
 my channel and well there I started in August to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 early August 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
 and until the moment of truth and how much 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 time I plan to continue in this because 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.739
 until I get bored the truth when 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.110
 I'll let you bore what's my first game 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 and the best game I've signed for 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.210
 I 'm not going to tell you an anecdote about me 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.460
 childhood I did not have a console let's say 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.119
 a powerful console until 10 years old 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.670
 almost out there and skin talk and 2o but 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.530
 before I on Sundays the chabÃ³n a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.050
 video game program what I did 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.909
 and my brother of the comfortable ones on the couch and 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.679
 we trust the controls and we make like 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.580
 we played to console and like 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:24.330
 I won and that and that era is the truth and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 this one was very happy not good the game that 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.000
 more the first game would be a fifa because 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.979
 I used to play only the fifa and the best 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.979
 game would be 'alan wake' mirror sets 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 the size matters then 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.409
 it depends on the thing there are no people I know if 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.490
 he likes fat cucumbers and the others 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.980
 some of us finer of the person 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.460
 the truth 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.470
 stockings standing or sitting and presented 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.440
 while I do my manicure 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.670
 I am a questions you like some sport 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.229
 and which one do you like 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.970
 I really like sports in general 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.700
 because before I played basketball soccer 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.190
 tennis and practiced swimming but 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.440
 lately as I conago nothing but yes 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.130
 play here almost every weekend played 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.660
 football with friends and that and football 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.240
 I also see it almost always from almost 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.690
 all the matches of madrid 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.760
 what kind of musician do you like to see the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.590
 thing is here, imagine you are 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.630
 alone friends or a person who started 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.340
 with the one that says good we want to enter you 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.260
 like not to stay because I am always the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.150
 typical asshole who says it's not that 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.100
 I listen to individual songs and it's true 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.310
 because I do not follow any group or if it goes 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.590
 to nobody I see an index that singers 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.590
 they are and in name I listen to a song 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.220
 out there or youtube or chain I take the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.240
 I put in the iphone and already in its course the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.300
 I really do not have a style 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.350
 determined I listen to music in general 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.350
 any kind of music 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.930
 what kind of computer do you have and which one 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.000
 would buy if the play four or the xbox or 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.580
 a pc for the truth is that I have a pc 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.220

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.890
 to render and good as I need 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.290
 something of new generation because I 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.530
 I prefer a pc because with it I can 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.820

 simply because classic so clear 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.810
 that yes when there is a week of 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.070
 I liked the class 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.780
 because I've missed my classmates 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.630

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.130
 Well, I'm not surprised by some 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.200
 he decided to participate in some 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.879
 site 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.579

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.840
 I do not like the night out there 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.220
 it does not approach I am matter and I do not know 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.579
 the times you go out at night you can 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.639
 tell what so neither do I 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.499
 it went anywhere 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.400

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:25.689
 you want to get to do something big 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.249

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.590

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:32.110
 big on youtube that to have so much 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.789
 people behind but on the other hand is that 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.590
 I do it because we like the truth what 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.169
