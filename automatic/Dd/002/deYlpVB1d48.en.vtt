00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.260
 the whole smartphone that will watch it 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.110
 just not possible in general such material 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.630
 On an amateur now let's turn on our 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.720

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.640

 with htc sense 4 what with the screens and here if 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.740

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.560
 one x plus has a colder color 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.350
 temperature than its fellow dimensions 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.920

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.200
 inches 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.750

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.970
 the same plan x plus has an amplifier 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.250

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.769
 no , the processor frequency has increased by 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.519
 0.2 gigahertz through the use of new 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:10.180
 revision processor nvidia tegra 3 points 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.130
 1 7 gigahertz and also four cores size 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.660
 internal flash memory doubled 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.060
 up to 64 gigabytes and and part of iwan x plus 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.739
 became the first android-smartphone mb Russia

 him from the first in the world with such volume 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.269
 Memory with which we congratulate him 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.340
 As for the cameras, the number 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.230
 active pixel matrix in front 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.200
 camera increased slightly 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.360
 that's 16 megapixels bathroom x plus 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.720
 against 1 and 3 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.540
 one x and now this camera is working cba 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.030
 post image processing and match chip 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.890
 Now we will check you made 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.950
 2 seems in the program antutu benchmark 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.590
 the test then convinces the bath x plus he 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.760
 shows 16,000 parrots against 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.780
 12000 one x is from 4.000 parrots 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.430
 him 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.750
 battery capacity one x plus 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.950
 compared to ibanez 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.439
 rose to 300 hour world now it's 2100 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.409
 On this our video and probably finish 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.540
 Of course, what a comparison without withdrawal from us 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:14.720
 sure to be here let's see 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.530
 on cost, eat sevan x plus costs 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.419
 around 21,000 rubles van x around 16 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.389
 five thousand difference 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.570
 I made such a conclusion that if you burn 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.389
 wanting to buy van x plus and lebanese x 9 x 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.010
 plus if you have money if money 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.100
 He does not have to take the van x 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.800
 he is not too worse and chase x plus 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.210
 it makes no sense if you have now available 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.039
 there is still sevan x 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.990
 but you want to buy a newer 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.080
 I advise you to look at the device as 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.410
 option and new smartphones 2013 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.510
 among which is eat sevan samsung 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.479
 galaxy s4 lg optimus g 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.699
