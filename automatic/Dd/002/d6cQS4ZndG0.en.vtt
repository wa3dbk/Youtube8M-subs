 samsung we will show you a little 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.070
 very nice rise here in salty version 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.300
 so let's go salmon and leeks and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.710
 of course you can do the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 ingredients that you like is it's 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.930
 party then we attack a little war 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.699
 nor turin agree rdg heat one less 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.369
 little stove what i wore I put a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 little bit scared it's going to hoard very very 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.140
 finely onions and jules and adds 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.270
 in the rich butter bottom of the village 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.219
 and a medium fire I pass that color 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.440
 now I'm going to do exactly the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:50.039
 same thing with leeks are you going 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.020
 add leeks to measure 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 now it will be necessary to add a small 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.449
 little salt in a little while 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 why not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.859
 good idea to scented and a little bit of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.890
 pepper voice during pepper mill 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:10.229
 is very good 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.490
 go we put all the leeks a promoted 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.900
 well we'll put a little bit towards 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.610
 how to simmer for 10 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.909
 minutes 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 here is the fondue take care and of 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.340
 markers of the tower you see there and we go 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.840
 put it flat for her 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.009
 cool down folds possible can 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.270
 too be too hot in the race 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.549
 even then do me during this time there 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.090
 I will take the puff pastry 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.820
 puff and I'm going to garnish I'm going to the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.509
 put that behind exactly there then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.640
 I sting morning and I will realize 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.490
 my approval and that a catch then it's 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.960
 super simple I like a little bit 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.210
 seasoning although they tell us 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.470
 respect his life like that a little bit 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.730
 salt flower 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.160
 I mix everything 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.210
 and I added my cream 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.420
 the artichoke diet 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.280
 I was not with the fresh 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.760
 mix of that's it's over 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.290
 so I'm going to check the seasoning 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.210
 perfect super important and here we go 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.800
 garnish the pie a pie sacem his 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.360
 sword it takes a lot of energy on a 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.380
 okay where were you shown to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.600
 leeks but you can do with 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.030
 other vegetables that you really do 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.120
 make you urge to vote we are great 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.580
 pretty and now I garnish with the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.900
 smoked salmon trimmings then dropped 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.670
 adornments of it's cheaper of course 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.020
 here and then in the end not really 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.040
 okay that's good for them 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.340
 delicacies of small peppers agree 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 I'm going to watch my camera 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.460
 fears of taking I put in the center sava 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.560
 run smoothly the sides the 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.300
 pie and garnish delicately game 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.670
 fold the edges of the dough and I'll go there 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.050
 that's how I'm going to take this 9 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.550
 whole just that I beat 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.470
 in omelette and I'm going to put here a 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.450
 little bit it's a glue salon it's going 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.090
 put a hat 2 so I'm going 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.200
 cut out the hat then to do this 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.200
 I take a plate 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.560
 here are the flax kidneys well 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.250
 obviously we will keep them to make 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.010
 cheese matches for example or 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.860
 at the break delicately proposes on 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.670
 that's what we voluntarily did to some 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.160
 something very small to the biggest 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.410
 sailboats were really worth it 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.080
 really to support also stock market 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:39.200
 in the agreement we will fall back here to 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.730
 do this side but that any encryption 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.790
 and seems to make a little good decor 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:49.069
 alright I'm doing a little tiberi 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:52.670
 gold stick sleeps delicately 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.680
 color always with this strong here is 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.780
 it's well gilded ok did you see it's 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.209
 super simple and there with the back of the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.440
 knife I'm going to do a little 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.440
 grid that's really for art 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.910
 grid that what am I going to do 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.080
 Now it's I'll make lots of 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:22.160
 little holes here in fact it's for everything 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:24.080
 the device inside the dryer and the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.650
 super important has already made a hole well 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.300
 In the center 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.550
 I'm going to put a chimney I put 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.770
 the chimney so as to dry well 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.120
 the device we are sure it will evaporate 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.470
 if you do not doubt as we 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.330
 what can we use at the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.350
 aluminum or just paper 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.970
 greaseproof 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.860
 so we have to preheat your oven to 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.800
 180 Â° and you saw that the pie with 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.419
 a super thick one will cook them 1h to 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.070
 180 degrees it's gone to just now 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.460
 a cooking time rda cooked side was 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.380
 removed the socket without getting burned we go 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.450
 let the pie cool for 20 minutes 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.490
 before gently unmolding it on a 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.690
 grid and there you will have about ten 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.820
 miles to enjoy it again lukewarm 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.090
 alas too beautiful so now it's 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.090
 taboo
