00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
infinity this is just random infinity

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.100 
infinity this is just random infinity
that<00:01:04.120> I<00:01:04.180> got<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:05.880> any<00:01:06.880> evil<00:01:07.300> Smasher<00:01:07.810> as<00:01:07.900> long

as it's the evil Smasher cause like when

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.560 
as it's the evil Smasher cause like when
you<00:01:11.260> reload<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.460> glitch<00:01:12.700> happens<00:01:13.240> it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
you reload it and the glitch happens it

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.230 
you reload it and the glitch happens it
makes<00:01:13.750> this<00:01:13.930> little<00:01:14.200> explosion<00:01:14.860> right<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
makes this little explosion right you

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.090 
makes this little explosion right you
might<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:16.600> do<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:16.990> have<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.140> YY<00:01:17.710> kind

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
might have to do it you have to YY kind

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.219 
might have to do it you have to YY kind
of<00:01:18.190> slow<00:01:18.550> at<00:01:18.790> first<00:01:18.820> but<00:01:19.360> then<00:01:19.540> like<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.050> can

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
of slow at first but then like you can

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.080 
of slow at first but then like you can
pick<00:01:20.410> up<00:01:20.560> pace<00:01:20.830> once<00:01:21.190> it's<00:01:21.369> going<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:21.729> not<00:01:21.880> too

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
pick up pace once it's going but not too

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.830 
pick up pace once it's going but not too
fast

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.779 

and<00:01:25.960> then<00:01:26.109> a<00:01:26.140> little<00:01:26.289> lag<00:01:27.009> a<00:01:27.039> little<00:01:27.429> bit<00:01:27.579> right

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
and then a little lag a little bit right

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.450 
and then a little lag a little bit right
and<00:01:28.030> that's<00:01:28.539> normal<00:01:29.109> because<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.950> more<00:01:30.159> lag

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
and that's normal because the more lag

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.819 
and that's normal because the more lag
the<00:01:30.909> better<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:32.170> you'll<00:01:32.409> probably<00:01:32.439> never

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
the better which you'll probably never

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.929 
the better which you'll probably never
hear<00:01:33.100> again<00:01:33.250> right<00:01:33.640> um<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.979> let's<00:01:36.369> say<00:01:36.549> like<00:01:36.819> I

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
hear again right um so let's say like I

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.999 
hear again right um so let's say like I
get<00:01:37.149> like<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.329> ton<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.630> lag<00:01:37.899> it's<00:01:38.649> better<00:01:38.829> with

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
get like a ton of lag it's better with

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.419 
get like a ton of lag it's better with
like<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.159> laggy<00:01:39.460> game<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.799> your<00:01:42.069> friends<00:01:42.340> are

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
like a laggy game like your friends are

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.249 
like a laggy game like your friends are
someone<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.700> different<00:01:43.090> country<00:01:43.539> join<00:01:44.049> his

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
someone a different country join his

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.050 
someone a different country join his
game<00:01:44.469> and<00:01:44.649> stuff

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.780 

and<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.890> play<00:01:49.250> around<00:01:49.340> with<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.729> a

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
and then I just play around with this a

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.550 
and then I just play around with this a
lot<00:01:50.030> trying<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.570> get<00:01:50.659> like<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.840> new<00:01:51.049> high<00:01:51.200> score

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
lot trying to get like a new high score

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.850 
lot trying to get like a new high score
I<00:01:52.450> had<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.750> 200<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.680> something<00:01:54.920> earlier<00:01:56.860> and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
I had the 200 and something earlier and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.410 
I had the 200 and something earlier and
then<00:01:58.220> I'm<00:01:58.460> just<00:01:58.579> y<00:01:58.820> wang<00:01:59.060> right<00:01:59.390> now<00:02:00.700> 86<00:02:01.700> like

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
then I'm just y wang right now 86 like

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.520 
then I'm just y wang right now 86 like
anything<00:02:02.899> above<00:02:03.170> 50<00:02:03.409> is<00:02:03.770> relatively<00:02:04.280> good<00:02:05.530> but

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
anything above 50 is relatively good but

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.160 
anything above 50 is relatively good but
like<00:02:06.740> once<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.250> get<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.490> hundreds<00:02:08.170> 200

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
like once you get in the hundreds 200

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.839 
like once you get in the hundreds 200
range<00:02:09.349> i<00:02:09.649> had<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:09.800> friend<00:02:10.009> say<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.399> got<00:02:10.610> into

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
range i had a friend say you got into

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.170 
range i had a friend say you got into

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
four hundred and that's pretty much just

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.850 
four hundred and that's pretty much just
ridiculous<00:02:14.720> that's<00:02:14.930> pretty<00:02:15.110> much<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:15.620> shot

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
ridiculous that's pretty much a one shot

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.320 
ridiculous that's pretty much a one shot
for<00:02:16.220> everything<00:02:17.950> except<00:02:18.950> like<00:02:19.340> for<00:02:19.730> some
