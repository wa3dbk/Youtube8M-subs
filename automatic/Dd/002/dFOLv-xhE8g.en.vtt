00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.349
 very good to everyone in these guys 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.480
 Welcome to your destination and my mother 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.580
 I had been trying for a long time 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.110
 record some playstation 4 game but 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.430
 Well, I will tell you what it is that has 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.689
 happened because it took so long in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 bring it but first welcome you 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.350
 to this good to this video that you are 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.660
 seeing in the background that it is a game of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.699
 pvp in a composite event this week 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 the destiny that is called something of the iron 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.000
 and good you have to get the typical 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 of some badges to be able to buy 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.910
 team and the truth is that it is very 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.430
 fun I have a great time with this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.840
 game and well you see a game that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.090
 he got me a good score indeed 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.500
 At the end you will see how it was and such and such 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.850
 I quite liked to share it with 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.350
 fact is the first game I recorded 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.090
 trying the capturing since good 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.490
 I upload this video too so you can 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.140
 see what quality the captor has if 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.390
 you like and also try to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 little how he has recorded see how it looks 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.780
 upload to youtube in case I have to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 change the settings try to give it 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 a little more quality but good the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.540
 video supposedly is at 720p hd that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.800
 I think it looks pretty good so 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.690
 can you put me the comments you know 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 that your comments are very but 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 that very important and is you put me 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.680
 motherfucker versions, I'll leave it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.420
 A) Yes 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 and I can record future games that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.080
 I have thought as much as the demo of 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.760
 silent hill that is the pp that all 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.230
 you know in fact it has gone up a lot 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.060
 people but I for problems that I have 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.700
 had with the calculator and my computer 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.740
 because I could record before the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 playstation 4 games and good too 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.280
 I need to tell you that I have given enough 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.920
 hours to destination and in fact in this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.660
 event they let you stick with your weapons is 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.880
 say of normal at destination and when 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.320
 do pvp reduce you a little bit 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.940
 good as it equals in the team not 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.530
 while in this event they have left 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.750
 that the skills are what we 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 we have and that we go according to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 got on our team this 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.940
 way albeit a man who is very 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.050
 tied because it's going to burst and the truth 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.509
 is that the event is very cool because 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.640
 for themselves to prove how good it is 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.710
 how would the game be if it will be based on a 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.810
 arva set that is said to be saying as 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.700
 when you play something as you acquire 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.470
 played that you know if you have one more 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.210
 team side post face here 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.500
 the same and the truth is that the event I 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.360
 he liked it a lot as well I say 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.580
 got a pretty good game is with 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.229
 the weapon is touching and it really shaped me 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.670
 is the game but well said this 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.250
 I also have to say is that I am level 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.330
 20 at destination the light level is 22 as 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.430
 well I say has given you enough now 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.290
 I'm playing a lot and he 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.599
 apart from having received many criticisms 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.650
 to me I liked very much indeed as 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.510
 well I say I'm having a great time 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.030
 it had not been for so long 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.250
 reed to a console had the xbox 360 and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.079
 I did not use it, it's just always been 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.819
 pc player while the movie 4 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.439
 studying many but many hours 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.599
 this game in particular also 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.459
 very many and good I recommend it and 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.689
 also good as you can see now 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.310
 just killed a tennis player there at the 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.079
 left friend marta homie geithner 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.909
 is home and psn as you want to call it 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.219
 in case you want to add I will go accepting 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.930
 little by little because I have a quantity 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.519
 well I have a list of people by 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.650
 accept and for the end I'm just 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.299
 pressing the whole theme of friends too 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.349
 I have to tell you that I like which one 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.450
 you in fact played with some 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.189
 of you doing some assault 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.450
 heroic and I had a great time so 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.459
 so much this game is very cooperative and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.109
 good and you will be winning me 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.939
 I will accept you as I go 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.129
 evolving the good subject I said 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.409
 this is good if the kind of hunter that 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.389
 I have the filament you're going 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.569
 cutting that is to say the one of body to body 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.069
 subclass since they give you at level 15 and 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.659
 the truth is that the mobile I say is very 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
 fun is a good brutal game 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.329
 removing these I wanted to comment the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.220
 problem that I had with the capturing 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.890
 well I have the capturing 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.630
 of the cat of 60 I think it's called I tried 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.790
 connect it to my computer but because of it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.440
 of not having service pack 1 because I do not 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.720
 they let install in the software that 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.900
 required this capturing and could not 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.580
 capture nothing the issue is that I've 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.170
 got a laptop and I connected it 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.690
 to the laptop but I also had problems 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.550
 because when the monkey was installed the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.650
 software and others but when I put what 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.690
 which is the capture for 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.870
 capture the screen I was blinking 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.610
 totally non-stop was something incredible 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.560
 lie like a week did not know what 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.510
 happened and in the end it turns out that the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.790
 playstation 4 has an option that 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.590
 call http you have to remove it to 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.170
 to be able to capture and in passing if any in my 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.970
 same situation as you already know that for 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.220
 try good to let you capture 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.410
 the apl and 4 you have to remove the hdp 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.420
 which is found in system settings 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.150
 you take that off and you can perfectly 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.130
 calmly capture the truth is that 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.410
 I upload this video to check how well 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.269
 I said the image quality quality 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.500
 of sound that the captor gives me 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.940
 put it in the comments please 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.650
 what do you think about the quality that is 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.660
 pulling out as I plan to upload 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.280
 several playstation 4 games and I still 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.790
 there is a little fight over 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.550
 why 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.960
 since it is this game I thought 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.610
 comment while playing at the same time 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.810
 that many of you asked me when I went up 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.030
 the black ops 2 that in fact I carry a 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.040
 I upload it and it's complicated 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.470
 because he has never recorded with capturing 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.180
 from a laptop then I do not know how 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.220
 square the sound and I have to be still 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.500
 practicing this a bit for 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.180
 bring a display maybe of quality and 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.280
 well done not that the sound is more 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.400
 advance and we have stories 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.320
 several this happens because I also have a 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.450
 micro alone and would have to disconnect it 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.250
 connect it on the laptop and they are good 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.260
 stories that I still have that is what 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.820
 fight a little bit with them to take out 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.440
 the highest possible quality and also of 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.750
 step as I say your comments 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.770
 they are very very important to know if 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.260
 I have to go up a little bit more 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.150
 quality to the capturing 17 looks good 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.490
 since I have found this quality where 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.320
 I consume little hard disk space 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.030
 of the laptop since it does not have much and of 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.520
 step well it's pretty good eh I do not 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.440
 it costs since I have to change I have 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.880
 to pass the laptop video to me 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.400
 desktop computer that is where I 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.780
 edited them and others and well, of course, they weigh 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.710
 a lot of videos and it makes me much more 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.630
 complicated when passing it reuse them 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.430
 and well it 's just that it was for that 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.800
 that you see that I have finally captured 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.930
 of crisis in four that I have thought 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.340
 record the series game and I had you 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.990
 very much desire of a lot 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.340
 time and I could not think I'm going to 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.740
 go pretty bad try to do in 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.180
 2.0 but you can put it to me 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.280
 comments if you like you should this nickname 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.620
 since a lot of people have uploaded it and I'm going 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.900
 to try to upload it also so that 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.580
 see that agar I played it a little bit no 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.340
 I've seen no video like that or just 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.230
 to see who trained and such and has 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.730
 a pint very, very good 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.220
 good as you see studying it with the weapon 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.990
 is supreme that I carry a submachine gun 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.310
 in fact he has already changed equipment as 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.350
 well I say pretty game this game by 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.440
 the nights and I have a very made revolver 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.000
 and that epic game but good apart 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.650
 of this and you have asked others to 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.160
 upload the last of us is a game that does not 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.750
 I will upload more than anything because it has already 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.880
 uploaded on a lot of youtubers and I think 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.410
 that almost nobody would see it because a lot 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.330
 people or he has passed had already seen 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.400
 from other people there is no more coming 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.230
 of playstation3 and the truth is that I 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.000
 the last of us and I played quite a lot 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.680
 I am already close to what is coming is the 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.820
 end of the game not monasterier that 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.470
 Going down down my back 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.400
 I really like this class because it is 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.620
 as very well 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.690
 and he took me to another body to body and 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.970
 I defend the point the truth is that this 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.190
 pvp is also very long compared to 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.449
 the rest of the globs that exist or that 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.310
 this advance capture was typical of 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.840
 I duel for teams and finally my team 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.759
 I ended up being first win as 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.500
 well you see here they give us the points of 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.900
 event that I am commenting that is 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.840
 some of the good iron we left 20 thousand to 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.250
 17 thousand that this one is there and good without more 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.150
 guys the video I think it's over 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.770
 the game I hope you liked it 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.910
 you know that leaving of course I like 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.280
 your comments help me to know 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.720
 what if you like the theme of the movie 4 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.479
 quality with future games 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.300
 that I'm going to go up and finished 22 losses the 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.160
 bonus 22 deaths that I have 22 22 yes I believe 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.350
 that I'm still a water assistance not to the 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.090
 low I have a ratio of 2.2 kilos per 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.229
 every death that they make to me that paints 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.150
 pretty good in fact to look yes 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:25.550
 to know the issue of casualties I do 22 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.090
 deaths and 10 captures is fine so 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.090
 Yes, more or less
