00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
they're just slightly too low so I would

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.950 
they're just slightly too low so I would
raise<00:01:55.979> those<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.660> fall

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
up a little higher the next thing I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.120 
up a little higher the next thing I
would<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> course<00:02:02.880> add<00:02:03.740> lampshades<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
would do is of course add lampshades to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.680 
would do is of course add lampshades to
these<00:02:05.280> lamps<00:02:05.550> I<00:02:05.790> would<00:02:05.910> imagine<00:02:06.150> that's<00:02:06.420> on

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
these lamps I would imagine that's on

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.230 
these lamps I would imagine that's on
your<00:02:06.870> list<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:07.380> things<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:09.060> would

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
your list of things to do and I would

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.840 
your list of things to do and I would
get<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.630> bell<00:02:09.990> shaped<00:02:10.619> lampshade<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.730> these

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
get a bell shaped lampshade for these

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.280 
get a bell shaped lampshade for these
lamps<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> goes<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:12.990> well<00:02:13.110> with

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
lamps because it goes really well with

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.110 
lamps because it goes really well with
this<00:02:13.590> kind<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.920> country<00:02:14.520> French<00:02:14.760> look<00:02:14.850> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
this kind of country French look that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.600 
this kind of country French look that
you<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:15.780> your<00:02:15.989> bed

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.420 

you<00:02:20.240> can<00:02:20.420> add<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.900> piece<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.410> square<00:02:21.830> art<00:02:22.100> in

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
you can add a piece of square art in

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.640 
you can add a piece of square art in
this<00:02:22.970> case<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.540> think<00:02:23.570> I'd<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.530> do

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
this case I think I'd like to do

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.910 
this case I think I'd like to do
something<00:02:24.980> round<00:02:25.610> maybe<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.360> starburst<00:02:27.200> mirror

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
something round maybe a starburst mirror

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.580 
something round maybe a starburst mirror
would<00:02:28.370> really<00:02:28.970> top<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.210> bad<00:02:29.600> off<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
would really top that bad off and the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.990 
would really top that bad off and the
round<00:02:30.740> part<00:02:30.980> can<00:02:31.070> be<00:02:31.100> slightly<00:02:31.490> higher<00:02:31.730> than

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
round part can be slightly higher than

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.710 
round part can be slightly higher than
the<00:02:32.720> frames<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.110> other<00:02:33.320> side<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:35.480> go<00:02:35.600> over

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
the frames on the other side we go over

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.960 
the frames on the other side we go over
to<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.990> next<00:02:36.170> wall<00:02:36.500> here's<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.220> great<00:02:37.520> window

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
to the next wall here's a great window

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.910 
to the next wall here's a great window
first<00:02:38.360> off<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:38.900> remove<00:02:39.290> these<00:02:39.590> things

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
first off I would remove these things

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.520 
first off I would remove these things
right<00:02:40.160> here<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.940> these<00:02:41.120> windows<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:41.870> would

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
right here and on these windows I would

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.090 
right here and on these windows I would
decorate<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.880> address<00:02:44.330> not<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.170> window<00:02:45.590> but

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
decorate or address not the window but

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.120 
decorate or address not the window but
the<00:02:46.459> wall<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:47.120> would<00:02:47.720> add<00:02:47.900> window<00:02:48.650> treatment

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
the wall I would add window treatment

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.760 
the wall I would add window treatment
panels<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:50.270> either<00:02:50.660> side<00:02:51.050> going<00:02:51.470> all<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.740> way

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
panels on either side going all the way

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.400 
panels on either side going all the way
up<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.220> crown<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:53.690> should<00:02:53.959> be<00:02:54.140> and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
up to that crown this should be and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.729 
up to that crown this should be and
maybe<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:55.010> cream-colored<00:02:55.610> linen<00:02:56.450> or<00:02:57.200> taupe

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
maybe a cream-colored linen or taupe

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.740 
maybe a cream-colored linen or taupe
colored<00:02:58.250> something<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.910> stays<00:02:59.209> within<00:02:59.510> this

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
colored something that stays within this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.020 
colored something that stays within this
very<00:02:59.989> monochromatic<00:03:00.560> color<00:03:01.100> scheme<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
very monochromatic color scheme and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.400 
very monochromatic color scheme and
she's<00:03:02.239> already<00:03:02.480> got<00:03:02.750> going

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
she's already got going

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.979 
she's already got going
these<00:03:04.130> can<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.790> straight<00:03:05.150> panels<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.930> I

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
these can be just straight panels and I

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.240 
these can be just straight panels and I
think<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.320> would<00:03:06.440> look<00:03:06.470> really<00:03:06.980> really

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
think that would look really really

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.220 
think that would look really really
pretty<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:07.790> she<00:03:07.850> has<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.239> table<00:03:08.750> over<00:03:08.959> here<00:03:08.989> in

pretty now she has a table over here in

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.680 
pretty now she has a table over here in
the<00:03:09.320> corner<00:03:09.709> she<00:03:09.920> can<00:03:10.610> use<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.420> would

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690
