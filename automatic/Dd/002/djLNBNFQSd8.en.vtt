00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.259 
smaller and because of some interesting
properties<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.740> them<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.250> can<00:00:14.460> use<00:00:14.730> Cepheid

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269

galaxies<00:00:21.650> once<00:00:22.650> people<00:00:22.920> start<00:00:23.250> getting

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
galaxies once people start getting

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.130 
galaxies once people start getting
awesome<00:00:23.760> telescopes<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:24.869> started

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
awesome telescopes and they started

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.400 
awesome telescopes and they started
looking<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.970> distant<00:00:26.970> stars<00:00:27.630> they

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
looking at really distant stars they

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250 
looking at really distant stars they
notice<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> some<00:00:29.880> stars<00:00:30.150> were<00:00:30.900> doing<00:00:31.109> some

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
notice that some stars were doing some

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
notice that some stars were doing some
awesome<00:00:31.590> things<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:32.130> starting<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.090> small

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
awesome things like starting out small

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.020 
awesome things like starting out small
and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:34.469> getting<00:00:34.710> big<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and then getting big and going back to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.330 
and then getting big and going back to
small<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.230> big<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.280> were

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
small and then big and so they were

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.619 
small and then big and so they were
getting<00:00:38.850> bigger<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.270> smaller

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
getting bigger and smaller

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.139 
getting bigger and smaller
they<00:00:39.870> were<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.520> varying<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.730> their

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
they were very varying in their

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.319 
they were very varying in their
brightness<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.860> made<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.550> graph<00:00:45.000> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
brightness and if they made a graph of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.160 
brightness and if they made a graph of
the<00:00:46.260> apparent<00:00:46.829> magnitude<00:00:47.340> versus<00:00:48.270> time<00:00:48.539> they

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the apparent magnitude versus time they

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.430 
the apparent magnitude versus time they
would<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.829> doing<00:00:50.870> something<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.199> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
would see it doing something like this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
would see it doing something like this
with<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.770> right<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.329> then<00:00:57.329> down

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
with up here it is right and then down

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.729 
with up here it is right and then down
here<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.379> dim<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.520> happening<00:00:59.969> over

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
here it was dim this was happening over

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.090 
here it was dim this was happening over
the<00:01:01.739> course<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.190> days<00:01:03.120> maybe<00:01:04.110> anywhere<00:01:04.769> from<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

week to a couple months this was
happening<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.070> different<00:01:08.490> stars<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:11.299> they

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
happening for different stars and they

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
happening for different stars and they
found<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.960> they<00:01:13.380> looked<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.189> graph

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
found if they looked at this graph

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.020 
found if they looked at this graph
enough<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.140> had<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> very<00:01:17.509> regular<00:01:18.509> period

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
enough that it had a very regular period

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.420 
enough that it had a very regular period
that<00:01:21.030> seemed<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.200> never<00:01:23.130> ever<00:01:23.430> change<00:01:24.210> and

that seemed to never ever change and

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.070 
that seemed to never ever change and
different<00:01:26.430> stars<00:01:26.670> had<00:01:27.090> different<00:01:27.720> periods

would<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> party<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:35.790> say<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
would have a party and then say it's a

Cepheid<00:01:36.869> variable<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.619> dim<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.310> then

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
Cepheid variable it's dim and then

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.920 
Cepheid variable it's dim and then
they'd<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.880> another<00:01:39.240> party<00:01:39.509> next<00:01:39.659> week<00:01:39.869> and

they'd have another party next week and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.319 
they'd have another party next week and
then<00:01:40.079> say<00:01:40.229> well<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.979> bright<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:42.119> then

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
then say well now it's bright but then

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
then say well now it's bright but then
someone<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.990> clever<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> they<00:01:44.040> started

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
someone got clever and they started

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780 
someone got clever and they started
making<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.270> graph<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.200> different<00:01:46.790> variable

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
making a graph of different variable

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.260 
making a graph of different variable
stars<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.890> they<00:01:49.890> found<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.729> there's<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
stars and they found out that there's a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.819 
stars and they found out that there's a
relationship<00:01:51.750> between<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.350> different

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
relationship between the different

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
periods of all these different stars and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.740 
periods of all these different stars and
how<00:01:55.740> powerful<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.310> were<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> could<00:01:57.600> on

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
how powerful they were so you could on

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
how powerful they were so you could on
you<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.930> y-axis<00:01:58.649> put<00:01:59.219> luminosity<00:01:59.939> or<00:02:00.770> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you this y-axis put luminosity or you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.480 
you this y-axis put luminosity or you
could<00:02:02.070> put<00:02:02.630> absolute<00:02:03.630> magnitude<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
could put absolute magnitude and you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
could put absolute magnitude and you
could<00:02:05.700> still<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> relationship<00:02:06.899> now

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
could still get a relationship now

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.100 
could still get a relationship now

for<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.260> logarithmic<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.390> even

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
for it it is logarithmic now the even

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.870 
for it it is logarithmic now the even
more<00:02:23.020> awesome<00:02:23.440> thing<00:02:23.830> about<00:02:23.860> Cepheid<00:02:24.520> side

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
more awesome thing about Cepheid side

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.970 
more awesome thing about Cepheid side
just<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.209> novel<00:02:25.630> fact<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.080> they<00:02:26.230> do<00:02:26.800> get

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
just the novel fact that they do get

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.890 
just the novel fact that they do get
bigger<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.400> smaller<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.510> they<00:02:28.630> can<00:02:28.780> be

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
bigger and smaller is that they can be

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.350 
bigger and smaller is that they can be
used<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.410> find<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.830> distance<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.849> distance

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
call them a standard candle so let's say

call them a standard candle so let's say
that<00:02:37.200> step<00:02:38.200> one<00:02:38.410> how<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.510> first<00:02:40.510> you

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
that step one how to do this first you

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.199 
that step one how to do this first you
find<00:02:41.349> yourself<00:02:41.769> yet<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.489> need<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.730> look<00:02:43.060> at<00:02:43.180> a

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
find yourself yet you need to look at a

distant galaxy Andromeda is kind of

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.930 
distant galaxy Andromeda is kind of
close<00:02:47.830> but<00:02:48.100> let's<00:02:48.250> say<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.430> were<00:02:48.519> using<00:02:48.730> that

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
close but let's say you were using that

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.030 
close but let's say you were using that
and<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.450> found<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.989> Cepheid<00:02:50.290> variable<00:02:50.799> star

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
and you found a Cepheid variable star

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.100 
and you found a Cepheid variable star
that<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.760> course<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.330> few<00:02:52.480> weeks<00:02:52.630> became<00:02:52.870> bigger

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
that of course a few weeks became bigger

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.110 
that of course a few weeks became bigger
and<00:02:53.230> smaller<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:54.400> immediately

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
and smaller you then immediately

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660 
and smaller you then immediately

that<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.150> pretty<00:02:58.540> awesome<00:02:58.750> what<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.319> did

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
that is pretty awesome what you just did

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.130 
that is pretty awesome what you just did

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
then you spend some time probably weeks

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.050 
then you spend some time probably weeks

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.990 

25.0<00:04:28.860> at<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.980> top<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.490> looked<00:04:30.670> at<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.820> bottom

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
25.0 at the top I looked at the bottom

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.820 
25.0 at the top I looked at the bottom
and<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.480> took<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.780> average<00:04:31.900> between<00:04:32.620> them

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.990 

you're<00:04:35.830> done<00:04:36.010> with<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.250> graph<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.820> don't

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
you're done with the graph you don't

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.340 
you're done with the graph you don't
need<00:04:37.180> any<00:04:37.390> more<00:04:37.540> but<00:04:37.870> hold<00:04:38.050> on<00:04:38.170> to<00:04:38.230> that

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
need any more but hold on to that

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.080 
need any more but hold on to that
information<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:39.070> you're<00:04:39.550> going<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:39.730> use<00:04:39.910> it

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
information and you're going to use it

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.500 
information and you're going to use it
to<00:04:40.240> find<00:04:40.270> absolute<00:04:41.110> magnitude<00:04:42.040> because<00:04:42.910> you

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
to find absolute magnitude because you

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.170 
to find absolute magnitude because you
now<00:04:43.780> can<00:04:44.470> use<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.070> equation<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:46.030> we<00:04:46.150> wrote

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
now can use the equation that we wrote

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.170 
now can use the equation that we wrote
down<00:04:46.480> before<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.050> says<00:04:47.550> two<00:04:48.550> point<00:04:48.850> seven

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
down before it says two point seven

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.210 
down before it says two point seven
eight<00:04:49.330> times<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.930> log<00:04:50.170> of<00:04:50.200> that<00:04:50.530> period<00:04:50.830> you

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
eight times the log of that period you

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.910 
eight times the log of that period you
plug<00:04:51.460> in<00:04:51.610> your<00:04:51.760> 53<00:04:52.270> days<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:53.640> minus<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:54.870> 1.35

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
plug in your 53 days and minus the 1.35

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.500 
plug in your 53 days and minus the 1.35
plug<00:04:56.920> that<00:04:57.040> into<00:04:57.220> your<00:04:57.490> handy<00:04:57.850> calculator<00:04:58.030> and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
plug that into your handy calculator and

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.830 
plug that into your handy calculator and
it<00:04:58.780> will<00:04:58.870> spit<00:04:59.140> out<00:04:59.170> negative<00:04:59.820> six<00:05:00.820> point<00:05:01.300> one

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
it will spit out negative six point one

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.560 
it will spit out negative six point one
as<00:05:02.110> your<00:05:02.740> absolute<00:05:03.400> magnitude<00:05:04.270> which<00:05:04.450> is

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
as your absolute magnitude which is

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.550 
as your absolute magnitude which is
quite<00:05:04.780> bright<00:05:05.020> but<00:05:05.770> for<00:05:06.010> Sofia<00:05:07.560> bastarz

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
quite bright but for Sofia bastarz

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.500 
quite bright but for Sofia bastarz
compared<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.100> our<00:05:09.190> Sun<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.670> so<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.330> makes

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
compared to our Sun and so it makes

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.790 
compared to our Sun and so it makes
sense<00:05:10.600> they're<00:05:10.870> going<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.050> have<00:05:11.140> a<00:05:11.170> bright<00:05:11.530> or

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
sense they're going to have a bright or

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.060 
sense they're going to have a bright or
negative<00:05:12.310> absolute<00:05:13.060> magnitude<00:05:13.600> now<00:05:14.170> you<00:05:14.890> have

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
negative absolute magnitude now you have

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.770 
negative absolute magnitude now you have
that<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.490> you're<00:05:16.120> going<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.330> use<00:05:16.510> this

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
that and you're going to use this

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.660 
that and you're going to use this
hopefully<00:05:17.290> familiar<00:05:17.860> equation<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.460> you<00:05:18.520> by

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
hopefully familiar equation to you by

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.770 
hopefully familiar equation to you by
now<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:20.020> find<00:05:20.550> how<00:05:21.550> far<00:05:21.940> away<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.360> is<00:05:22.420> or<00:05:22.660> its

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
now to find how far away it is or its

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.510 
now to find how far away it is or its
distance<00:05:23.200> in<00:05:23.410> parsecs

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
distance in parsecs

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.220 
distance in parsecs
so<00:05:25.000> you'll<00:05:25.150> plug<00:05:25.360> in<00:05:25.510> some<00:05:25.690> values<00:05:26.020> here

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
so you'll plug in some values here

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.840 
so you'll plug in some values here
twenty<00:05:26.920> five<00:05:27.130> point<00:05:27.670> zero<00:05:27.840> minus<00:05:28.840> a<00:05:29.080> negative

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
twenty five point zero minus a negative

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.280 
twenty five point zero minus a negative
six<00:05:30.850> point<00:05:31.120> one<00:05:31.330> let's<00:05:31.630> grab<00:05:31.840> your<00:05:32.020> negative

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
six point one let's grab your negative

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.770 
six point one let's grab your negative
signs<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.940> then<00:05:34.240> you're<00:05:34.390> gonna<00:05:34.480> end<00:05:34.570> up<00:05:34.720> with

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780
