00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
is obviously eventually this will

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.749 
is obviously eventually this will
replace<00:02:03.719> mod<00:02:04.259> clubs<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:04.770> sub-series<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
replace mod clubs with sub-series and

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.660 
replace mod clubs with sub-series and
which<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.750> unfortunate<00:02:07.649> unless<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.429> fit

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
both in but I will

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.830 
both in but I will
using<00:02:11.590> my<00:02:11.950> clubs<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.640> subs<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.450> trial

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
using my clubs with subs to trial
