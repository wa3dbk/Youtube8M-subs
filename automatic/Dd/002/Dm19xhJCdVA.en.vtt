00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.059
 barely 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.690
 at the first appearance of the coach of the Porsche Piech then also the 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.659
 Held speech said Merkel March 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.099
 and about a single point to the film we include 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.650
 had produced with percent with 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.090
 It is one of the most famous of the trade of the association of the 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.010
 Radio HR around the coveted Andy has in many places 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.150
 even some not so fallen is a meaningful so that percent 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.879
 Kuttner understood how to do it again. Nano is 2 percent 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.280
 the invisible hand of Adam Smiths that was almost the OGH continuation of the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.030
 Market economy he said well well percent in the market economy has the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.580
 PSone 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.080
 the invisible hand 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.680
 and that actually does it all pretty much alone without the state 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.200
 there what percent 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.520
 In the rain already today are where the system has huge problems 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.560
 dpa and 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.970
 but the movie Womb somewhere the reference 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.480
 where do these problems come from and show that? 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.880
 Nowhere do people have this invisible hand and that too 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.060
 So the monopolies are the power of respect that makes it the fault 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.729
 Markets storms and how Bucher from Globex met it needs it again 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.700
 need a role from the state makes me today the shards the way 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.650
 from these market disruptions arise and 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.750
 he could just as well start the markets fundamentally okay 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.690
 bring and then much better that is based Koppenhöfer said correctly 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.329
 Exactly because one is the OVB it is the honorable to be granted 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.070
 he has all the Allgäu the percent 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.909
 usually if we win and Dortmund would be the purchase price 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.470
 you have that is so that you around 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.520
 Online poker Percentage of capitalism is in the meantime in the meantime 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.500
 become and communicated trumpets 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 and 4 yeah Well then to see where that comes from 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.460
 After a counterattack you can say this topic was also good as they had 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.720
 open were more and something had a long time one of the causes 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.690
 and I have quite a lot of people being hit by consumers all over 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.080
 been achieved by completely new by getting this 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.640
 for the Brandenburg lead 8 percent for the free economy 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.900
 yes so I think the free economy and also the idea the Monika depth 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.950
 still represents one there 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.610
 pretty questionable foundation on as well as festive 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.620
 we can do that too if that's the little Porsche economy 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.259
 to have 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:22.549
 and 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.379
 that we also have a money what is a thing in this economy 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.059
 then pumped running and I am myself an entrepreneur 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.569
 and I had to say I do not take the economy as a few steps 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.779
 but it is much more exciting that you as an entrepreneur of course 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.199
 Precise economic power must therefore precisely finance that 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.169
 actually the exciting me if I am self-employed is not 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.389
 by who often when do I get the Wrabetz to swap but I have to 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.529
 Of course, percent of the affected and the pre-finance and that's yes 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:50.629
 actually that's what 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.069
 what made the thing so exciting that affected customers like not seen 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.779
 the evening sun Mickey Mouse idea of ​​the economy so wants 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:01.189
 Swap the vaccination and so it just is not that practice 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.930
 Road to South Australia is Prettner's exact location which is so greatly simplified 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.439
 that they simply no longer appetite for reality 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.000
 and the deer in reality 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.420
 So there is no netbook money to trade on 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.350
 but in reality there is money only as a balance 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.050
 gives more 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.120
 There is always money only as debt and credit via Steam 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.190
 No, that is always only together so I had had at the same time today 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.450
 also my photo Paul Buck Sweden and 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.250
 For us humans, this is sometimes emotionally very difficult because of it 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.870
 Debt at monthly does not have and have good 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.170
 the Finma really great had word as much as there is anywhere that word 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.560
 now the same thing is sometimes not enough for us emotionally 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.989
 but that is nobody the perpetrator reality why so what led 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.179
 Hike q400 in this is madness 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.529
 Therefore, the connections we have in Germany we agree that 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:53.239
 less debts are made and if however even more and more credits have 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.119
 and that just does not fit together. Balances and debts are the same 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.869
 Thing and percent that has just displaced down there you have to 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.480
 Find answers that maybe 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.959
 that also sports my husband Dieter Buroch described or you soon too 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:05.669
 today with 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.339
 the metallic spur 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:11.199
 Salaam, the Minister of Finance, could have triggered the financial crisis even better 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.599
 The word the man himself must invest percent instead of percent spores in 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.489
 Money Saving money simply means nothing other than Friday's 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.479
 truants 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.069
 Well, if we save money questions still have debt and had that 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.569
 Luck one or the other want to swear but that's the door of the 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:29.620
 Reality authorities arrested power issues talent there it did not help either 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.930
 that he does not know that when most people do not and it will be him 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.110
 yes not said or 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.009
 somewhere RPO 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.139
 it needs to have new answers Mr this one has to be the problem asthma clause too 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.050
 so see the guilty party is similar to our subject but rather 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.050
 solutions 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.259
 that's been around for weeks to solve the protests what is this all banana 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.539
 the press right Kitase and it is we have not reliable the whole 4 3 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.340
 Percent he explains that he will certainly treat me as a contract 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.669
 Watch and hear video 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.340
 not everyone can now rely on that plastic free economic 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.509
 Solution with the 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.820
 He obviously also raised a money where there is money 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.020
 still other alternatives that would be so for example 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.150
 again what social security do that because they have this madness 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.749
 finally stop private retirement 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.469
 that is not and that is this capital coverage is not ours 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.199
 Sovereign debt coverage before convincing everything with the private 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.339
 Pensions a lot of public debt and so are things you just do 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.339
 could change if you could understand them 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.540
 and conquered his information that's what we meet so well 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.270
 for sure 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.460
 the contract continued 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.089
 I can and do become available to Mac's video 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.370
 you can seem high demand then back at me stars 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.540
 In spite of all the benefits we have posted in 2009, we record 4 2 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.099
 Mio or still very much on the subject of IT episode 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.050
 4 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.460
 you can also say there are majorities to book 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.649
 COR
