 so the spirit of yours is you take a cap 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.759

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.269

 then you start cutting it 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.199
 so that it leaves without the white part 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.129
 It's good to take this white part. 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.129
 if she gets a little more salary 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.739
