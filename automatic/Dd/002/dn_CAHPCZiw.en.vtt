I'm<00:00:00.269> going<00:00:00.450> to<00:00:00.570> discuss<00:00:00.989> how<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.620> calculate

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
I'm going to discuss how to calculate

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.880 
I'm going to discuss how to calculate
plan<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.060> number<00:00:03.389> short<00:00:04.380> tricks<00:00:04.680> to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
plan of the number short tricks to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.670 
plan of the number short tricks to
calculate<00:00:05.450> square<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.660> number<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
calculate square of a number so the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.660 
calculate square of a number so the
first<00:00:07.950> number<00:00:09.290> which<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.860> taking<00:00:10.980> example

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
first number which we are taking example

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.650 
first number which we are taking example
of<00:00:11.790> his<00:00:11.969> 42<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> closest<00:00:15.030> 10

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
of his 42 so what is the closest 10

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.800 
of his 42 so what is the closest 10
digit<00:00:16.049> number<00:00:16.470> which<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.279> close<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.850> 40<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.510> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
digit number which is close to 40 do it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.230 
digit number which is close to 40 do it
is<00:00:19.100> 40<00:00:20.779> we'll<00:00:21.779> add<00:00:22.080> 2<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.070> 40<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.730> will<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.949> 42

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
is 40 we'll add 2 to 40 and will get 42

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.320 
is 40 we'll add 2 to 40 and will get 42
okay<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.050> now<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.529> we'll<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.189> add<00:00:29.670> 2<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
okay so now what we'll do just add 2 to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.209 
okay so now what we'll do just add 2 to
this<00:00:30.480> 42<00:00:31.019> you'll<00:00:31.199> get<00:00:31.410> 44<00:00:32.420> multiply<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.660> 2

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
this 42 you'll get 44 multiply these 2

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
this 42 you'll get 44 multiply these 2
we<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.430> 1<00:00:35.780> 7<00:00:36.780> 6<00:00:37.260> 0<00:00:38.180> now<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.600> number<00:00:39.870> which<00:00:39.989> are

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
we get 1 7 6 0 now the number which are

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.889 
we get 1 7 6 0 now the number which are
adding<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:41.040> number<00:00:41.430> square<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.600> number

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
adding this number square that number

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.000 
adding this number square that number
and<00:00:43.290> add<00:00:43.980> him<00:00:46.309> square<00:00:47.309> root<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.670> 40<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and add him square root of 40 to the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
and add him square root of 40 to the
second<00:00:50.399> number<00:00:51.030> which<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> take

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
second number which we are going to take

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.380 
second number which we are going to take
is<00:00:52.110> 96

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
is 96

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.979 
is 96
the<00:00:55.789> closest<00:00:56.789> number<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.660> 100<00:00:59.329> we'll<00:01:00.329> subtract

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the closest number is 100 we'll subtract

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.030 
the closest number is 100 we'll subtract
4<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.410> 100<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.370> we'll<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.090> 96<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> just

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
4 from 100 and we'll get 96 so just

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.219 
4 from 100 and we'll get 96 so just
subtract<00:01:05.610> 4<00:01:05.909> from<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.360> 96<00:01:06.930> midges<00:01:07.700> 92

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
subtract 4 from this 96 midges 92

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.499 
subtract 4 from this 96 midges 92
multiply<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.760> will<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:11.970> 9<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:13.020> double<00:01:13.680> 0<00:01:13.979> add

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
multiply this will get 9 to double 0 add

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.969 
multiply this will get 9 to double 0 add
square<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.259> 4<00:01:17.220> square<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.299> 4<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> 16<00:01:19.229> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
square of this 4 square of 4 is 16 so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.800 
square of this 4 square of 4 is 16 so
we'll<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.250> 9<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.119> 1<00:01:21.420> 6<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.549> answer

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
we'll get 9 to 1 6 this is your answer

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.930 
we'll get 9 to 1 6 this is your answer
the<00:01:26.290> third<00:01:26.590> number<00:01:26.860> which<00:01:27.370> we<00:01:27.550> are<00:01:27.610> going<00:01:27.790> to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
the third number which we are going to

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.160 
the third number which we are going to
take<00:01:28.120> is<00:01:28.920> 109<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.880> closest<00:01:31.360> number<00:01:31.660> we<00:01:31.990> can

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
take is 109 so the closest number we can

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.240 
take is 109 so the closest number we can
take<00:01:32.440> 100<00:01:33.330> or<00:01:34.330> 110<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.170> depends<00:01:35.530> on<00:01:35.620> you<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:36.130> am

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
take 100 or 110 it depends on you I am

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.860 
take 100 or 110 it depends on you I am
taking<00:01:36.610> 100<00:01:36.970> so<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.720> will<00:01:37.870> be<00:01:37.990> 100<00:01:38.410> plus<00:01:38.800> 9<00:01:39.870> so

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
taking 100 so it will be 100 plus 9 so

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.750 
taking 100 so it will be 100 plus 9 so
add<00:01:41.050> 9<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:41.920> 109<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:42.729> will<00:01:42.820> get<00:01:42.940> 1<00:01:43.210> 1<00:01:43.570> 8

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
add 9 to this 109 you will get 1 1 8

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.160 
add 9 to this 109 you will get 1 1 8
multiply<00:01:45.760> it<00:01:45.820> will<00:01:46.540> get<00:01:46.750> 1<00:01:47.410> 1<00:01:47.770> 8<00:01:48.010> double<00:01:48.940> 0<00:01:49.300> plus

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
multiply it will get 1 1 8 double 0 plus

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.750 
multiply it will get 1 1 8 double 0 plus
square<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.520> 9<00:01:52.030> which<00:01:52.450> is<00:01:52.630> 81<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.430> will

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
square of this 9 which is 81 so you will

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.270 
square of this 9 which is 81 so you will
get<00:01:55.470> 1<00:01:56.470> 1<00:01:56.710> 8<00:01:57.130> 8<00:01:57.160> 1<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:59.229> last<00:01:59.410> number<00:01:59.920> which<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.220> am

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
get 1 1 8 8 1 the last number which I am

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.359 
get 1 1 8 8 1 the last number which I am
going<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.580> take<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:01.979> 115<00:02:03.330> so<00:02:04.330> we<00:02:04.479> can<00:02:04.660> take<00:02:05.369> 115

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
going to take is 115 so we can take 115
