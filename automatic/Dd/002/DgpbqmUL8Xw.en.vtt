00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:13.840
 We are now going to talk about the identity of the body fluids 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:15.519
 60% of human beings are water , but 40% and 20% of them come into cells 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.310
 It is extracellular fluid 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:22.520
 We've been off the interstitial fluid and finals in the Yes disturbing role of do's I 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.400
 15% each 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.930
 There is a lot of image that there is a lot of blood divided into the same school percent, but weight 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.620
 About 5% 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:41.210
 Simply put, human body fluid is divided into inside and outside blood vessels and intracellular fluid. 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.510
 In water , this is a mechanism similar to rice fields 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.309
 Blood is from 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 It is around the entire result is referred to in the rice fields and agriculture irrigation canal 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:57.239
 During the summer, water is circulating in the paddy field and it is sending water absolutely 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.860
 At the same with interstitial fluid exits from Ne poked send nutrients to the rice in the water contained in the paddy field 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:06.640
 Recovering the coming waste 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:08.320
 To recover the extra stuff supplies interstitial fluid have also been oozing from the vessel water and oxygen nutrients to cells 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.680
 I'm pouring in a vein 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 I think this is it though and say the cells me what is in the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.880
 Water and nutrients are supplied to the water and nutrients in the body and paddy fields that are growing quickly. 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.170
 The waste 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:29.180
 I'm collecting it, but looking at the contents of each one 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.380
 Intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid, that is, interstitial fluid and final water 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.450
 Don't you guys are different , the intracellular fluid is less sodium 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.870
 On the contrary, the extracellular fluid is rich in sodium. 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.710
 I do not wear potassium 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.730
 In sudden to but problems with blood test 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.190
 Sodium would much 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.430
 Have 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.520
 Potassium solder in Kke example 5 was about 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.700
 About 4 correct answers 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.140
 Suddenly what is a blood test blood 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 In other words, you are testing the finals, so the blood is extracellular fluid, right? 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.800
 When you take blood, sodium is about 140 and potassium is 4 times 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:17.550
 Or to say Summarize in the often overwhelmingly called Do the rim 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:23.370
 Blood, which is extracellular fluid, and interstitial fluid are mainly sodium and intracellular fluid is mainly potassium 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.360
 This is an important thing to remember, so what will you live next? 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 let's study 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.790
 Will the human body was the talk Te look-divided into the outside and the cells in the blood vessels and blood vessels 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.519
 Kess 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:40.810
 Wall between is there but I say blood vessels animals open a small hole Tteyuu the animals this 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:47.140
 In the results, as you all know, 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:49.060
 Since the monthly salary and albumins live and these are larger than the station publicity I said just before, basically 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.780
 We can not protect from blood vessel wall 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.940
 Blood cells and albumin 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:01.610
 But to internal bleeding and or hit the hand it's possible to say who lives only in the result 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.790
 It's because the red blood cells that should be in the result are leaking from the blood vessels. 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.600
 It's that Rutteyuu eye to be confirmed to go is 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.800
 So what about electrolytes like sodium and potassium? 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.790
 More than one episode of Tenka itself 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.969
 Because it is smaller, you can get off the train line 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:24.810
 I can't get through my cell membrane 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:30.000
 Well , water is a substance that can freely pass through the blood vessel walls and cell membranes. 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:34.810
 So it depends on how far you can go in and where you live is different. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.790
 About 60% of people are made up of people 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.849
 The water contains 5% crystals and 15% interstitial fluid 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.970
 It was about 40% in the cells 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.239
 And the extracellular fluid is rich in sodium 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.550
 The intracellular fluid is characterized by high potassium content 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.800
 Design spheres and leukocyte albumin basically can not penetrate the blood vessel wall 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.940
 Kess 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:05.120
 Though it is only in him, the party can cross the wall of the result 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.890
 Water that can not pass through the cell membrane freely can move freely through the wall of the blood vessel and the cell membrane 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.850
 It's there is a feature that say 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.790
 'M very important in on this thing is to understand the drip 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:21.500
 Well, time to see the osmotic pressure and the identity of the body fluid 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.500
 I'm going to talk about physiological saline solution I should not do my best to review well
