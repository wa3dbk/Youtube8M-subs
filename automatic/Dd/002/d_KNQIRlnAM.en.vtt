00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
trying to figure out you know most

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.080 
trying to figure out you know most
people<00:00:49.120> most<00:00:49.330> commentators<00:00:49.810> got<00:00:50.110> a<00:00:50.490> el<00:00:51.490> gato<00:00:51.760> I

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
people most commentators got a el gato I

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.610 
people most commentators got a el gato I
got<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.330> rock<00:00:52.540> seal<00:00:52.780> so<00:00:53.140> things<00:00:53.380> are<00:00:53.500> a<00:00:53.530> little

bit<00:00:53.830> harder<00:00:54.100> but<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:55.000> checked<00:00:55.600> this<00:00:56.020> should<00:00:56.290> be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
bit harder but I checked this should be

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.120 
bit harder but I checked this should be
the<00:00:56.560> only<00:00:56.680> video<00:00:56.980> that<00:00:57.010> has<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.800> as<00:00:59.980> you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.499 
ball trying to put some moves on a
larger<00:01:34.390> section<00:01:34.569> pick<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.799> I'm<00:01:35.920> wide<00:01:36.189> open

and<00:02:24.800> they<00:02:24.890> going<00:02:25.099> double-team<00:02:25.909> so<00:02:26.300> I'll<00:02:26.390> even

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
and they going double-team so I'll even

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.410 
and they going double-team so I'll even
be<00:02:26.690> wide<00:02:26.930> open<00:02:26.959> for<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.530> deep<00:02:27.800> two<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.180> get

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
be wide open for the deep two and I get

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.140 
be wide open for the deep two and I get
her<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.659> fall<00:02:30.190> give<00:02:31.190> me<00:02:31.340> four<00:02:31.640> points<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
her to fall give me four points of the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.149 
her to fall give me four points of the
game<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.390> one's<00:02:35.599> basically<00:02:35.870> over<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.709> my

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
game so this one's basically over and my

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.059 
game so this one's basically over and my
first<00:02:37.519> NBA<00:02:38.450> game<00:02:38.900> getting<00:02:39.170> some<00:02:39.379> minutes<00:02:39.739> I

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
first NBA game getting some minutes I

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.009 
first NBA game getting some minutes I
score<00:02:40.819> four<00:02:41.090> pointing<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.629> get<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> couple

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
score four pointing and get a couple

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.830 
score four pointing and get a couple
assists<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.760> think<00:02:43.940> that's<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.390> great<00:02:44.569> start

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
assists so I think that's a great start

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.610 
assists so I think that's a great start
to<00:02:44.870> my<00:02:44.959> career

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
to my career

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.520 
to my career
no<00:02:46.489> we<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:47.030> demolished<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.200> San<00:02:48.379> Antonio

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
no we just demolished the San Antonio

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.649 
no we just demolished the San Antonio
Spurs<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.840> wasn't<00:02:50.840> even<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.019> contest<00:02:52.390> we<00:02:53.390> got<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
Spurs I wasn't even a contest we got to

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.270 
Spurs I wasn't even a contest we got to
start<00:02:53.810> playing<00:02:53.989> defense<00:02:54.409> giving<00:02:54.590> up<00:02:54.739> 110

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
start playing defense giving up 110

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.800 
start playing defense giving up 110
points<00:02:55.489> that's<00:02:55.819> way<00:02:55.940> too<00:02:55.970> many<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:59.000> after

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
points that's way too many so after

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.780 
points that's way too many so after
sitting<00:03:00.110> two<00:03:00.260> games<00:03:00.500> now<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.250> finally<00:03:01.519> get<00:03:01.730> my

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
sitting two games now I finally get my

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.479 
sitting two games now I finally get my
shot<00:03:02.180> at<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.299> NBA<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:03.829> I<00:03:03.980> think<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.280> made<00:03:04.459> a

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
shot at the NBA and I think I made a

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.460 
shot at the NBA and I think I made a
count<00:03:04.760> as<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.209> see<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.629> difficulty<00:03:05.959> bonus

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
count as you see the difficulty bonus

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.619 
count as you see the difficulty bonus
times<00:03:06.709> two<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.609> am<00:03:07.819> playing<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.150> Hall<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.299> Fame
