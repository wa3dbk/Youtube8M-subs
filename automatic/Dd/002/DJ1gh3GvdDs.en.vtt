00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.410
 hello we want to explain the two 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.110
 schemes that we have for jobs in 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.570
 vinyl the first vinyl cutout 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.580
 it's like this we have vinyl is from 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.099
 various colors of the brand to see and with 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.840
 six years of duration which 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.869
 through a cutting plotter with a 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.340
 micro razor knife in your texts of 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.490
 way you get the vinyl 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.710
 cut and you can shave it for 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.839
 paste on the surface you want 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.000
 the other work scheme is printing 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.010
 in vinyl we have vinyl in white 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.440
 once it gets into the blank 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.150
 plotter to print the image you see 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.010
 on your screen and you are given on roll 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.530
 so you can paste this material 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.190
 on any surface we also have 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.750
 the outline of this printed material 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.350
 put it to the cutting plotter for your 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.330
 lower the outline of your label 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.100
 way that is cut with the shape 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.960
 that you want can be a triangle 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.670
 circle or any irregular shape 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.589
 in either of the two cases 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 you need the design of your work to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.659
 to be able to elaborate it and it is delivered to you as 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.670
 you see here in the case of the cut you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.650
 delivery by sheet plotted and you have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.460
 that depilate that is to remove the excess 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.080
 here 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.000
 in the second case you are given the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.040
 sheet for cuts with ruler and cutter 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 with the third case you are given 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.119
 blocked so that it comes off if it sticks 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.659
 this label on the surface that you 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.659
 you need 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.140
 in the vinyl cut the vinyl remains 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.120
 blocked and depilating refers to withdraw 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 the remaining material so that it remains 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.850
 nothing else 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.610
 the piece that you are going to paste in the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.070
 final surface 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.909
 the rest is left over you can use it 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.530
 for other things is to throw it away 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.119
 so you can pass this vinyl to the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.969
 final surface you can not pass 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.219
 letter by letter you need this ribbon 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.329
 of transport or transfer tape that the 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.329
 you are going to place over 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.860
 to be able to detach the final pieces 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.610
 and you can paste them on the surface that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.760
 you prefer applying pressure so that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.980
 the adhesive is stuck on the metal or 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.470
 wood or the final piece and you can remove 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.420
 the transfer 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.900
 and it is already stuck on the surface 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.900
 dynamic
