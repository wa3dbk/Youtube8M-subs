m gtx video card basically for anyone
that's<00:00:14.009> interested<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.700> maybe<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.179> computer

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
that's interested in maybe this computer

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.450 
that's interested in maybe this computer
or<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.560> Crocs<00:00:16.980> card<00:00:17.279> itself

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
or just in how the Crocs card itself

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.450 
or just in how the Crocs card itself
performs<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.210> computer<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.470> there's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
performs in this computer so there's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.359 
performs in this computer so there's
really<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.730> good<00:00:20.910> demonstration<00:00:21.180> um<00:00:22.189> to<00:00:23.189> see

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
really do good demonstration um to see

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.620 
really do good demonstration um to see
what<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.730> can't<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.090> basically<00:00:24.420> i'm

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
what it can and can't do basically i'm

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.420 
what it can and can't do basically i'm

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:53.119 

let's<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.379> space<00:00:43.800> Knifer<00:00:52.129> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
let's see here this all space Knifer so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
let's see here this all space Knifer so
that's<00:00:53.250> probably<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.640> pretty<00:00:53.699> good<00:00:54.030> shot<00:00:54.210> right

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that's probably a pretty good shot right

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.770 
that's probably a pretty good shot right
there<00:00:54.420> um<00:00:55.129> jumping<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> air<00:00:56.820> um<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
there um jumping out of the air um you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860 
there um jumping out of the air um you
got<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.079> high<00:00:58.469> 20s<00:00:58.949> low<00:00:59.520> 30s<00:00:59.550> going<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> 40

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
got like high 20s low 30s going up to 40

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.709 
got like high 20s low 30s going up to 40
s<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> framerate<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.760> probably<00:01:03.449> let's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
s for the framerate so probably let's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.119 
s for the framerate so probably let's
move<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> setting<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.439> everything<00:01:04.799> cranked

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
move the setting with everything cranked

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.580 
move the setting with everything cranked
