00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.730
 Yes is the Oral 6 very much Welcome to Hello Room channel 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.530
 This time the sound is not enough with this display so I purchased the speakers 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.330
 I hope to open it 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.310
 Yes it is here powered powered speaker system made by onkyo gx 70 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.890
 says the hd one white 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.340
 About 11,000 battles at a price of about 16,000 in the price Amazon 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 It is this video to the other party Chinami that I purchased at 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.320
 I am taking it with the Sony camcorder pj 800, which I just purchased recently 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.290
 It was also possible to take a zoom with this Soko figure who raised the tactical opening video 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.690
 Then we will look at the speakers 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.540
 Yes This item is a hit as you can imagine from what is called 70 hd 2 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.900
 It is a successor model of product 70 hd 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.940
 After being refined is one by one part in roughly seen felt 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.810
 It seems that very clear sound quality can be expected because of hd playback support. 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.810
 I feel like this 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.350
 It is a yes So I think that I want to immediately open 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 Yes I can take out one side of the main body of the speaker. Gray is stronger than seen in the package. 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 I feel like coloring of the feeling 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.999
 Yes let's open the other 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:35.790
 Yes main speakers are here, as you can see there is a simple adjustment knob 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.120
 There is no middle in treble and bass alone, so I feel like making general adjustments with the mix knob 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.120
 is not it 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.610
 Back is such a speaker output for the power switch and sub speaker 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.530
 There are terminals for the hooper, etc. 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:55.930
 Yes and there is an audio cable during the explanation as another package 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 So I would like to immediately setting using these cables 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:04.710
 I feel like this when I set it up 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.710
 The power cord has already been turned on. The black cord here is the power cord 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.850
 And this red and white Japan is connected to the speaker terminal of pc as one cable 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.080
 Masu Tei 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.000
 It is connected with Japan here and Japan here 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.430
 I think the wiring later I want to clean up neatly 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.940
 Yes, it's repeated, but basically it's main and it receives input from pc 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.069
 It is feeling that is being sent to the other speaker 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:38.749
 Cormorant fur There is no plan to use for now 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:43.129
 Yes then I would like to do an audio test of the speaker easily but now 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:47.950
 The sound source of Tesu is a free music material distribution site Music Note . 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.950
 I would like to use a sound source and I will start 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.450
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.870
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.870
 me 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.270
 bal 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.020
 yeah 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.020
 me 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.800
 yeah 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.390
 yeah 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.390
 yeah 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.640
 me 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.760
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.000
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.000
 hey 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.830
 me 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:35.010
 me 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:38.310
 there were 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.390
 Eey 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.390
 me 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.390
 me 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:56.170
 Yes I feel like this 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:00.489
 Yes, so this time I am white house and expensive things as cheap as possible 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.170
 As a result of having searched for product by standard called PC Speaker which can buy for 10,000 yen a little 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.239
 I bought a product 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:10.150
 I am satisfied enough as a vote that the wood cabinet is used partially 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.060
 There is only there to to our next door to the natural feel 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.390
 Needless to say 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.889
 Because it has a much higher sound quality compared to the sound of play speakers 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.730
 Also , I think that I can say that I can do a wide range of sound making as the crisis of the knob is relatively good. 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.480
 Was 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:27.440
 Just next to hate if I wanted you to the optical digital connection correspondence 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.860
 It does not have any problem to say that there is no problem because headphones are used when strictly checking the auto 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.080
 But 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:36.030
 It has never been better for speakers to be able to use optical digital output too 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.870
 Also the same at the end to one of the bits of knowledge I was the speaker purchase of this onkyo made decisive 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.490
 There is 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.789
 Mr. Acoustics is very particular about small-scale production of products , and begins as the foundation that becomes the key to speakers 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.530
 It seems to be a long-established manufacturer who produces many parts in-house 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:51.070
 There is also a feeling that the old Japanese manufacturers are obsessed with this , and this is the deciding factor, and this is my first time 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.690
 The went to buy or want to correct 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.070
 If you are concerned about this product, I will put a link in the explanation section below. 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.180
 Please check it 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.960
 Also So I wish channel Sign up for Tara new video check plain clothes of the the good 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.960
 It was an unusual feeling
