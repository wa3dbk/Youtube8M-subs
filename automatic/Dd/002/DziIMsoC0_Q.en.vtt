00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.870

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.960
 castle class 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.860
 in this video I'm going to open mine 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 beautiful 4 kart legendary hero let's see if 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.680
 I can find the roi I miss 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.980
 I miss pixie and sorcerer though 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.110
 I don't know if you can try it with paper 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 it was legendary considering that on the page 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.170
 facebook didn't say anything to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.970
 about 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.510
 I hope so but even if it really will be 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.820
 impossible to find because with this 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 legendary card is true they said 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.470
 that the new rai can be obtained 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.320
 even with this card I will never write 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.140
 saw no one who took orc dracula 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.300
 Santa Claus all these new heroes but 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.070
 I've never seen anyone who took them ho 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.380
 seen after they took heroes 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 fragmentable so I don't know yet i 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.370
 my doubts however I don't have to do so 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.129
 nothing in the end i have all the heroes 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.650
 let's try a little let's see if I can 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.390
 take pixie or sorcerer as much anyway 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.070
 these are the last four cards here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
 then I won't buy it anymore according to me it is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 really wasted the 13 thousand merits we go 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.610

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.970
