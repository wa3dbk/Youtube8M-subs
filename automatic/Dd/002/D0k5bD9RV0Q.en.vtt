on the way back from the Early Learning
Center<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.169> seen<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.620> one<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:45.690> was

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
Center and I seen this one and it was

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.659 
Center and I seen this one and it was
only<00:03:46.079> five<00:03:46.410> pounds<00:03:46.829> cheaper<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.489> just

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
only five pounds cheaper but it just

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.220 
only five pounds cheaper but it just
comes<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:48.269> more<00:03:48.540> staff<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.349> comes<00:03:49.739> with<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
comes with more staff it comes with the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.949 
comes with more staff it comes with the
magnetic<00:03:52.230> whiteboard<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.980> other<00:03:53.160> side<00:03:53.959> it

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
magnetic whiteboard the other side it

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.640 
magnetic whiteboard the other side it
comes<00:03:55.260> with<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.709> paper<00:03:56.129> roll<00:03:56.810> space<00:03:57.810> for<00:03:58.319> if

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
comes with this paper roll space for if

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.189 
comes with this paper roll space for if
they<00:03:58.799> want<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.099> do<00:03:59.250> normal<00:03:59.669> drawing<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.419> it

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
they want to do normal drawing and it

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.240 
they want to do normal drawing and it
comes<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.620> like<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.980> abacus<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:03.349> letters<00:04:04.349> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
comes of like the abacus the letters the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.670 
comes of like the abacus the letters the
clock<00:04:05.609> when<00:04:06.150> she's<00:04:06.419> a<00:04:06.449> bit<00:04:06.659> older<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.319> she's

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
clock when she's a bit older and she's

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.309 
clock when she's a bit older and she's
learning<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.310> time<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.000> stuff<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.079> comes

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
learning the time and stuff and it comes

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.619 
learning the time and stuff and it comes
with<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.889> letters<00:04:11.519> as<00:04:11.819> well<00:04:11.849> and<00:04:12.389> also

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
with all the letters as well and also

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.219 
with all the letters as well and also
the<00:04:12.870> like<00:04:13.799> numerical<00:04:14.430> signs<00:04:14.729> so<00:04:15.599> again<00:04:16.019> when

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
the like numerical signs so again when

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.770 
the like numerical signs so again when
she's<00:04:16.470> older<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:17.099> can<00:04:17.310> do<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.849> adding<00:04:18.539> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
she's older we can do like adding and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.319 
she's older we can do like adding and
taking<00:04:19.139> away<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.590> things<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.849> I<00:04:21.090> just

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
taking away and things and I just

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.659 
taking away and things and I just
thought<00:04:21.450> for<00:04:21.510> 20<00:04:22.049> pounds<00:04:22.469> this<00:04:22.650> seemed<00:04:23.610> like

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
thought for 20 pounds this seemed like

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.270 
thought for 20 pounds this seemed like
you've<00:04:23.969> got<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> lot<00:04:24.419> more<00:04:24.750> than<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.800> just

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
you've got a lot more than the just

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.840 
you've got a lot more than the just
books

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
books

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.390 
books
andddd<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:28.260> one<00:04:28.410> in<00:04:28.530> early<00:04:28.680> learning<00:04:28.980> center

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
andddd the one in early learning center

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.280 
andddd the one in early learning center
if<00:04:29.490> you've<00:04:29.640> seen<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.120> basically<00:04:30.600> just<00:04:30.750> the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
if you've seen it is basically just the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.260 
if you've seen it is basically just the
board<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:33.210> shelf<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.940> yeah<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:35.970> just

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
board and the shelf so yeah I just

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.640 
board and the shelf so yeah I just
thought<00:04:36.420> this<00:04:36.660> one<00:04:36.900> was<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.110> little<00:04:37.260> bit<00:04:37.410> more

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
thought this one was a little bit more

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.460 
thought this one was a little bit more
educational<00:04:38.490> for<00:04:38.760> her<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.210> because<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.260> comes

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
educational for her and because it comes

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.170 
educational for her and because it comes
with<00:04:40.680> all<00:04:40.770> these<00:04:40.950> bits<00:04:41.250> in<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.550> clock<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:42.060> will

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
with all these bits in the clock it will

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.890 
with all these bits in the clock it will
kind<00:04:42.510> of<00:04:43.160> last<00:04:44.160> her<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:45.390> know<00:04:45.510> when<00:04:45.690> she's

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
kind of last her you know when she's

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.020 
kind of last her you know when she's
older<00:04:46.290> she<00:04:46.530> can<00:04:47.100> get<00:04:47.220> more<00:04:47.460> learning<00:04:47.700> out<00:04:48.000> of

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
older she can get more learning out of

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.590 
older she can get more learning out of
it<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.530> took<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.670> early<00:04:50.910> learning<00:04:51.030> center

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
it so I took the early learning center

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.080 
it so I took the early learning center
one<00:04:51.750> back<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.350> we've<00:04:52.950> got<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.370> one<00:04:53.640> instead
