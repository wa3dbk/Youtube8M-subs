00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.949
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.310
 video for the cardboard school of 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.830
 good collection I am teaching you 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.750
 ways of shuffling that is how 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.500
 principal want to learn we already knew 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.380
 the deck from scratch how is 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.539
 shaped the deck 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.750
 I already showed them in the first video 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.419
 Then I showed him to show the care that 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.149
 they must have and now I am 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.840
 teaching the forms that I used to 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.840
 shuffle the cards 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.670
 then let's look 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.890
 well first let's see what the letters 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.090
 is it so 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.980
 how they arrive from favor organized 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.410
 and they should not be like that in games 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.870
 When you are not going to play the cards you must 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.440
 be well mixed can not be 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.410
 there they were still not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.489
 because most of the board games 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.290
 or so homemade games are like this is the best 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.530
 stairs game 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.150
 the best game is has the same color or 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.220
 the best game is to have not be pairs or 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.320
 good to have those two letters together 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.080
 so it's not good to not have these 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.640
 letters together the same colors together 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.000
 the same 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.870
 number together is good so that the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.860
 letters will carry not this is not good to have 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.850
 the letters like that ask me 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.740
 pretty have asked hours times for 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.659
 the hostels I do not back shufflers 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.329
 it seems terrible to me about the fliers 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.399
 is to make it still a bit useless no 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.710
 be able to shuffle some cards and 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.049
 then I 'm going to show you how 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.909
 take a few cards this time it's going to 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.210
 do with the blacks that are the ones 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.360
 I have orders here 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.960
 then let's see 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.950
 look what is in 8 9 10 j cucadas look 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.950
 j 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.950
 9 10 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.950
 ordered 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.760
 and then to explain 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.729
 at 23 45 another way to shuffle the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.690
 previous is showing you this that is 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.090
 which must be face down so no 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.860
 you always have to see the back the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.700
 earlier that is showing them the way 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.580
 shuffle is this 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.310
 which is to place the big toe here and the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.310
 of the means to catch these two letters and 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.890
 throw them up and down throw them 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.270
 and they are releasing that is the main one as 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.010
 the basic 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.519
 the next one that follows here 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.530
 this is the French that would be with the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.700
 big toe this 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.170
 as in a package 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.550
 in having it 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.550
 now have like this 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.180
 look how three fingers are 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.680
 with these 2 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.230
 they take out 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.230
 and with this one keeps a tiny package 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.950
 in the little teeny park and 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.000
 again they had like this 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.330
 and with this one 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.020
 and they are taking it out because it is going out and you 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.780
 it goes like attracting with this 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.840
 they grab a package and with those two take out 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.750
 the rest then in this 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.900
 this is French is a way of 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.069
 france that is with this poetic grasp 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.319
 and the rest of the package remains in the 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.060
 another hand 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.060
 it's fast it would be something like that 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.109
 in case you are asked if they are 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.450
 shuffling which is not very common here 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.370
 in Colombia but it's a good way to 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.670
 save money 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.920
 the variation of this is a way 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.069
 American that is for the dealer in the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.280
 hand 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.799
 that it would not be with the finger catching the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.039
 poetic so there is the French but 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:22.109
 that would be dropping the packages as 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:24.790
 the little ones are like the Chinese ones and 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.520
 with loose fingers 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.750
 it's a little bit more complicated and I'm going 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.970
 dropping because guys 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.490
 the finger doing us nothing I give him with 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.850
 I would like the best to start with the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.130
 finger because we have more control and it's more 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.009
 easy to learn the game with your finger 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.040
 poetic yes 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.990
 and they take out 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.449
 while that 's a little bit more 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.430
 complicated 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.189
 is because one has to like 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.770
 accustom the fingers to take certain 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.520
 package quantity 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.500
 I'm a bit advanced but do not want 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.569
 say impossible because there is nothing 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.710
 impossible the goal of the street that everything 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:08.860
 that easy to learn and I learned this 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.870
 with you this is not something that comes 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.099
 with me I am born not that any 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.430
 you can learn it there is no 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.590
 problem be remembered 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.790
 we are learning French the formula 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.790
 French here is with your finger 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.810
 and a 5 minute delay doing this 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.600
 Jesus from a nearby appointment is treated 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.009
 very good to be so good speaking there the 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.990
 topic 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.760
 in conversion with friends and while 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.200
 so many years 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.200
 remember fingers 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.200
 and since they ask a person to 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.780
 part because the court cut in the now 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.260
 then put that policy and over 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.040
 it is cut 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.040
 and look 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.569
 in this revolted heart I dare the 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.569
 diamond heart 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.409
 more than clovers with diamonds 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.460
 then it's simple it's nothing 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.520
 complicated do not complicate life with 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.610
 Preparers is a water 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.889
 come back a bit and you do not have then 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.150
 make that simple 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.490
 It is not complicated 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.100
 to the first ones with the finger is the most 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.910
 basic is with the debtor of these that more 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.070
 basic 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.070
 French and it's easy to learn 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:45.150
 It's very simple and do the same with a 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.150
 worker images where they do 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.800
 and this does not make any kind of noise 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:18.830
 I do not do everything anymore 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.080
 speak the subject while with a 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.930
 beached that sounds very hard a long time ago 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.659
 noise mistreating the cards those blows 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.210
 in the corners potatoes mistreats us 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:32.330
 then the gestures with the hand 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:36.880
 they are gently treating you with love 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:39.689
 look darling despite the damn thing they do 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:43.069
 and what I just told you 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:43.069
 it is well shuffled 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.340
 I would say everything 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.310
 I hope you have understood that next 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.310
 occasion chao
