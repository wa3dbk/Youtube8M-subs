both come with same camera capabilities

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
both come with same camera capabilities
so<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.220> 13-megapixel<00:01:27.150> rear-facing

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so you have a 13-megapixel rear-facing

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
so you have a 13-megapixel rear-facing
camera<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.740> both<00:01:28.920> let<00:01:29.130> me<00:01:29.280> take<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> click<00:01:30.180> on

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
camera on both let me take a click on

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.069 
camera on both let me take a click on
both<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.490> side-by-side<00:01:32.759> short<00:01:33.570> of

both so this is a side-by-side short of
the<00:01:34.259> same<00:01:35.090> object<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the same object and as you can see the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
the same object and as you can see the

you a front facing camera sample soil
quickly<00:01:48.210> take<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> selfie<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.869> both<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> these

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
quickly take a selfie with both of these

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.749 
quickly take a selfie with both of these
cameras<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> compare<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> front-facing

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

cameras

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.870 

and<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.320> colors<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.860> looking<00:01:59.219> nicer<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and the colors are looking nicer and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.080 
and the colors are looking nicer and
richer<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.159> Eureka<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.789> can<00:02:02.939> see

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
richer on the you Eureka as you can see

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.719 
richer on the you Eureka as you can see
here<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.049> giving<00:02:04.860> better<00:02:05.159> results

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
here this is giving better results

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.120 
here this is giving better results
compared<00:02:06.179> to<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> note<00:02:07.200> which<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.560> also<00:02:07.890> very

compared to the note which is also very
very<00:02:08.459> close<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.000> both<00:02:09.269> are<00:02:09.509> very<00:02:09.840> close

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649
