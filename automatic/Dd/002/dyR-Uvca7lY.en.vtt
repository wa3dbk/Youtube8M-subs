 keyword goldman or more particularly 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.139

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.740

 that I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.560
 figurine that has nothing to do with the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.500
 context the batman context but everything 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 it's just a watchdogs figurine 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.860
 so legal at the docks what I created 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.399
 so it's very, very simple to do for 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.730
 those who find it well done is the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.170
 cap of the series of poor fig 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 the mobile phone of the series I do not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.460
 know how many mines a girl 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.460
 small gun bricks arms and body 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 of barbossa in the lego pirates of the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.110
 caribbean with a small with a small 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.270
 scarf 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:07.200
 so here is simply in art the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 moc hop with the joker that we could sit down 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 in the background that's good he does not sit down 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.890
 he's not too keen I think he's 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 really more envy jerid go shit 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.390
 there by cons it takes into account the time 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.979
 and we have harley quinn couple is like this 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 we figurines I think I have not 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.970
 need to introduce them to you that's it 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.000
 serves the queens and then we have the joker and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.770
 her little teddy still is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 collector there the joker with his teddy bear 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 Too cute I think we will calm down 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.920
 and we have the moc lego battles up who 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.890
 really light up nice thanks to this 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.020
 little transformers I will not you 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.610
 show how to do it come in very 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.079
 simple you put two round pieces 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.540
 like that so that it presses on the small 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.170
 green button and that's after having 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.869
 found it off to your list 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.299
 nightclub this is what she puts all of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.040
 then we have a little cart that I 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.890
 will show after but first we go 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.250
 take a walk around the whole moc 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.840
 so above we have the batman icon and 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090
 two small aeration just for the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.940
 style oh the stylus to decorate a little 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.670
 the top 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.180
 here we bring it from the entrance of the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.620
 cell 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.220
 so if a cell that is at 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.340
 arkham the cell of the joker in the small 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.250
 focus of the brand and the joker 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.750
 we intercom here so it's not bad 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.170
 in the light we turn on, turn on the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.870
 cell and then and then the plate where he 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.740
 marked this joker it's really nice 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.440
 so greet her here 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.870
 and then we have another light on it 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.140
 do not know very very interesting and so 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.990
 the cell does not see anything 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.300
 So here we will learn to do everything 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.750
 that then we will start with 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.730
 bathroom 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.900
 I will all take you apart live 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.900
 like that it'll go faster 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.260
 it's the hazards of live 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.640
 you will tell me that's it then you 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.020
 take this piece here it is I think that 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.610
 everyone knows and you take a 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.740
 little piece pleads like that you 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.410
 come and put me well below 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.220
 that's it if you take that piece 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.380
 gray gold preferably we give it a 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.430
 little side finally that's it does not 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.200
 all white what is so it's better 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.500
 that too much you take a boat like that 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.120
 everything you're going to be well-being so 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.420
 that it does not go beyond that it is well 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.820
 full here then you recommend 7 pc and 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.970
 you're going there fixed like these 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.010
 and there and it fits perfectly 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.230
 it's really not bad you take a 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.640
 lifebuoy this is a buoy of 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.010
 rescue for toilets 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.250
 but that does not make it really good 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.570
 that's what and you already have your base 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:03.130
 your toilet finally 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:07.090
 in short you brake this piece i and with 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.360
 a small flat piece like that and you 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.150
 put it on the side roughly at 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.190
 middle like this so that's it's the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.070
 toilet button you take this 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.460
 piece there and you put a coin like 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.340
 that you know her well and that makes the 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.169
 back of the lid 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.470
 aulas and there you have your letter his 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.630
 ranks not bad at the scale of the figures 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.520
 really very nice we will remove 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.840
 the roof like that it'll be better could 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 more see a little bit what's going on 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.990
 in how are we going to continue by 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.729
 so read it first to make it 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.070
 you will need this piece if if you 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.070
 want to do exactly the same the same 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.590
 that's why it's to give back 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.270
 the appearance that the bed was floating in the air 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.060
 but who is really held back by the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.090
 chains and so suddenly so moved here 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.300
 here not a medium well and so it looks like 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.919
 really he is he is held by 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.870
 the chains so in fact that's done 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.600
 so that we can see his ranks 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:18.660
 it's actually here you go 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.080
 take this piece there so 2.6 on two 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.320
 developed 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.380
 here you are taking a piece of 2 2 4 on 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.450
 two flat and you put these two 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.960
 small pieces on each side as 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:36.789
 these here and there already you have your base 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.130
 of dully of prisoners you put two 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.250
 other small flat parts like those 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.030
 ci on each side that's the part 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.550
 that he fixed himself like these and you 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.120
 take two chains of small chains 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:58.210
 like that all you are well fixed and 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.430
 that it touches look well that it 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.470
 hit oloron and that 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.270
 you have it perfectly like that and 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.680
 you do that on both sides here and 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.270
 there you put that that's the part 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.960
 the most delicate but one morning I 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:19.120
 the usual up flight and you put the 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:22.389
 chains have to be careful because the 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.910
 those chains there gets involved here there 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.190
 are perfect are well put well 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.790
 nickel and you have after you put 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.790
 the small elements of decoration so 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.630
 blocked with the little sting there we go 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.630
 put it here 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:46.680
 what a man 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.470
 yes so I wanted to say what the fuck 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.110
 I'm going to have it so I wanted to say 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.810
 that there were no videos during 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.150
 these 2 3 weeks I think I had 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.910
 really no time even in 3.5 steps 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.060
 too much to free me to make videos 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.830
 so that was really so here I 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.980
 take I make you a little video 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.990
 nice like that it makes you stuff a 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.730
 little to take my next video I 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.380
 think it will be a burden especially 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.300
 co star wars i think i will make you the 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.430
 box on geonosis because there I have not 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.600
 great thing to introduce to you i think 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.430
 that I will make a mode still stupid 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.600
 but star wars 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.060
 because I want to do it with 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.260
 moment I recovered a little in the 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.430
 star wars i watched the four 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.050
 last rounds 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.130
 I will not tell you my life but it 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.680
 gave me a desire to play your 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.590
 lego star wars 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.540
 so it was the little mode that the lego 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.230
 batman small but still rather 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.670
 nice 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.660
 and then bah I say no more for 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.660
 a new video salt
