hey<00:00:04.470> guys<00:00:04.770> fellow<00:00:05.279> here<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.879> today<00:00:06.629> i<00:00:06.839> have<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
hey guys fellow here and today i have a

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.400 
hey guys fellow here and today i have a
new<00:00:07.710> double<00:00:08.099> piston<00:00:08.250> extender<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:10.170> one

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
new double piston extender and this one

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.749 
new double piston extender and this one
can<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.679> activated<00:00:11.250> from<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.290> back<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.759> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
can be activated from the back of the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
can be activated from the back of the
whole<00:00:15.240> system<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> actual<00:00:16.680> extending

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
whole system of the actual extending

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.870 
whole system of the actual extending
Pistons<00:00:18.380> which<00:00:19.380> makes<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.859> easier<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> work

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
Pistons which makes it easier to work

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.130 
Pistons which makes it easier to work
with<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:22.250> some<00:00:23.600> sim<00:00:24.600> contraptions<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:27.140> yeah

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
with in some sim contraptions so yeah

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.830 
with in some sim contraptions so yeah
the<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.710> benefit<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.580> design<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.330> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the one benefit of this design is that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.540 
the one benefit of this design is that
you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.170> stack<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.009> upwards<00:00:32.520> infinitely<00:00:33.210> as

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
you can stack it upwards infinitely as

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
you can stack it upwards infinitely as
long<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.820> activate<00:00:36.420> both<00:00:36.690> lines

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
long as you activate both lines

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.819 
long as you activate both lines
simultaneously<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:39.000> at<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.040> exact<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.309> time

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
simultaneously so at the exact same time

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.680 
simultaneously so at the exact same time
yeah<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.100> there's<00:00:44.489> basically<00:00:44.670> two<00:00:45.000> versions

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
yeah so there's basically two versions

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
yeah so there's basically two versions
of<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.960> let's<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.039> ahead<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.250> build<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
of this let's go ahead and build one of

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.250 
of this let's go ahead and build one of
them<00:00:48.719> right<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.020> oh<00:00:50.660> yeah<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:51.930> have

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
them right here oh yeah let's just have

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.459 
them right here oh yeah let's just have
two<00:00:52.530> pistons<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.510> now<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
two pistons in now what I like to do is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.569 
two pistons in now what I like to do is
place<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> whole<00:00:55.980> slab<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:57.920> because<00:00:58.920> when

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
place a whole slab there because when

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.840 
place a whole slab there because when
when<00:01:00.149> you're<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.109> stacking<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.010> it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
when you're gonna be stacking it it it's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.960 
when you're gonna be stacking it it it's
gonna<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.589> mess<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.549> don't

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
gonna kind of mess up if you don't don't

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.000 
gonna kind of mess up if you don't don't
have<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.619> there<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
have that so what are they there is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
have that so what are they there is
curving<00:01:08.220> around<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.640> corner<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:10.310> yeah

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
curving around the corner and yeah

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.780 
curving around the corner and yeah
repeater<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.060> tix<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:13.110> into<00:01:13.790> this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
repeater on two tix going into this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.130 
repeater on two tix going into this
redstone<00:01:15.450> dust

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
redstone dust

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.740 
redstone dust
than<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.620> sticky<00:01:18.280> piston<00:01:18.490> with<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.360> redstone

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
than a sticky piston with a redstone

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.440 
than a sticky piston with a redstone
block<00:01:20.110> attached<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.610> also<00:01:24.850> power

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
block attached and you can also power

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.880 
block attached and you can also power
from<00:01:25.810> here<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.750> course<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:29.260> is<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.590> work

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
from here and of course this is the work

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.710 
from here and of course this is the work
you<00:01:30.159> gotta<00:01:30.310> have<00:01:30.760> your<00:01:31.119> repeater<00:01:31.630> on

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
you gotta have your repeater on

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:43.219 
you gotta have your repeater on
toothpicks<00:01:37.500> okay<00:01:39.300> my<00:01:40.300> computer<00:01:40.990> is<00:01:41.020> dying<00:01:41.290> um

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
toothpicks okay my computer is dying um

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.859 
toothpicks okay my computer is dying um
yeah<00:01:44.229> now<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.680> works<00:01:44.890> just<00:01:45.070> fine<00:01:45.400> now<00:01:46.270> if<00:01:46.690> you

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
yeah now it works just fine now if you

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.469 
yeah now it works just fine now if you
want<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> save<00:01:47.259> on<00:01:47.409> one<00:01:47.590> repeater<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
want to save on one repeater and of

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.690 
want to save on one repeater and of
course<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.899> do<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.830> just<00:01:50.890> want<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.340> remove

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
course you do you just want to remove

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.200 
course you do you just want to remove
that<00:01:52.740> repeater<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.830> block<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.640> place<00:01:54.850> a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
that repeater and block and place a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.560 
that repeater and block and place a
torch<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.950> block<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.729> both<00:02:00.090> let's<00:02:01.090> check

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
torch with a block of both let's check

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.300 
torch with a block of both let's check
it<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.679> works<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.600> perfect

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.850 

the<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.459> downside<00:02:08.759> about<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.500> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the one downside about this is that you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.089 
the one downside about this is that you
can't<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:12.269> this<00:02:12.690> piston<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:13.530> why<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.769> had

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
can't but this piston that's why you had

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.199 
can't but this piston that's why you had
to<00:02:14.360> extend<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.629> at<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.930> exact<00:02:16.379> same<00:02:16.650> time

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
to extend it at the exact same time

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.839 
to extend it at the exact same time
because<00:02:18.209> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.840> wouldn't<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.849> it's

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
because if you wouldn't do that it's

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.140 
because if you wouldn't do that it's
just<00:02:23.300> yeah<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.360> kind<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.840> saw<00:02:25.080> right<00:02:25.290> there

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
just yeah you kind of saw right there

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.690 
just yeah you kind of saw right there
this<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.709> retract<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:29.040> fine<00:02:29.340> but

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
this is going to retract just fine but

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.509 
this is going to retract just fine but
when<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:31.040> act<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:32.489> deactivate<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.569> one<00:02:33.870> that

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
when we act or deactivate this one that

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.020 
when we act or deactivate this one that
piston<00:02:35.519> bodies<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:37.190> bottom<00:02:38.190> these

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
piston bodies of this bottom these

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.509 
piston bodies of this bottom these
bottom<00:02:39.420> two<00:02:40.230> pistons<00:02:40.769> are<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.099> update

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
bottom two pistons are going to update

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.330 
bottom two pistons are going to update
that's<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.269> one<00:02:42.510> minun<00:02:42.900> ya<00:02:43.170> chain<00:02:43.739> reaction

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that's this one minun ya chain reaction

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.759 
that's this one minun ya chain reaction
it's<00:02:45.269> going<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.480> happen<00:02:45.599> as<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.019> saw<00:02:46.530> right

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
it's going to happen as you saw right

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.050 
it's going to happen as you saw right
there<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.739> gotta<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.160> at<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.489> exact

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
there so you gotta do it at the exact

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.339 
there so you gotta do it at the exact
right<00:02:51.269> thick<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:53.549> make<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.970> work<00:02:55.579> yeah<00:02:56.579> so

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
right thick to make it work yeah so
