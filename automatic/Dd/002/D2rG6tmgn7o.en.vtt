gonna let him go and it was it was
really<00:05:05.400> really<00:05:05.790> unfortunate<00:05:05.940> because<00:05:06.950> he

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
really really unfortunate because he

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.760 
really really unfortunate because he
really<00:05:08.280> did<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.790> back<00:05:09.000> me<00:05:09.240> up<00:05:09.270> like<00:05:10.020> at<00:05:10.620> the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
really did it to back me up like at the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.970 
really did it to back me up like at the
end<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:10.920> the<00:05:11.010> day<00:05:11.130> he<00:05:11.310> did<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.610> back<00:05:11.760> me<00:05:11.970> up

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
end of the day he did it to back me up

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.420 
end of the day he did it to back me up
so<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.910> really<00:05:15.300> got<00:05:15.540> on<00:05:15.660> my<00:05:15.750> nerves<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.430> last
