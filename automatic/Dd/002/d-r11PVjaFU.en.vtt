00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
actually I thought kind of gross

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.490 
actually I thought kind of gross
so<00:02:14.480> there's<00:02:15.480> your<00:02:15.600> G<00:02:15.750> fill<00:02:15.990> in<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.290> now

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so there's your G fill in there now

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.070 
so there's your G fill in there now
you're<00:02:16.620> gonna<00:02:16.770> grab<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.340> cap<00:02:17.900> twist<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.050> on

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
you're gonna grab your cap twist it on

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.460 
you're gonna grab your cap twist it on
your<00:02:19.350> shaker<00:02:19.620> cup<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:25.020> you're<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.290> gonna

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
your shaker cup and you're just gonna

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.020 
your shaker cup and you're just gonna
shake<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.190> about<00:02:26.340> 30<00:02:26.700> seconds<00:02:32.030> so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
shake that for about 30 seconds so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.390 
shake that for about 30 seconds so
that's<00:02:33.420> about<00:02:33.600> 20-30<00:02:34.470> seconds<00:02:35.010> right<00:02:35.130> there

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
that's about 20-30 seconds right there

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.700
