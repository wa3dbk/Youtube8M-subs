00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:21.880
 Hello, beauty, let's go and play. 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.789
 this genetics we are going to touch this 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.890
 genetics that is coming to an end 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.599
 the purpose of today's class to talk about 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.899
 sex 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.850
 I like it, I like sex, it's nothing. 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.649
 He does not think bullshit because the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.210
 Today's lesson's objective to talk about 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.030
 sex inheritance 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.940
 the inheritance of sex or about genes 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.210
 that are in any way related to the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.020
 the sex of the individual who has it 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.520
 and in this case there are three extremely 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.070
 important are three types of genes 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.600
 quite important is that the cast as 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.210
 abec 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.180
 but let's go for parts, let's say I 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.000
 I got this pardial we're all e 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.560
 this pair of sex chromosomes from a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.399
 single guy 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.020
 Nowadays, we are the author. 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.170
 chromosomes that the man and the woman have 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.130
 the same proportion that do not vary between 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.670
 the sexes 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.280
 or I am a little boy you 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.679
 the little girl, her sister, her mother, who 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.139
 little girl daddy who is a little boy 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:29.229
 always have the same in all are the 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:32.380
 same 22 pairs of chromosomes 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.569
 and the genes that are located 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.810
 on high or are you ever seen are the 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.819
 famous autosomal gene in all 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.999
 other modules that we have seen so far 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.770
 in all other genetic modules 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:47.139
 people talk about genes that are genes 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.950
 its autosomal genes is an 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:52.959
 same way in men and women and we have 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.539
 I took this park from the same guy 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:58.569
 which is the pair of sex chromosomes 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.909
 And then I ask you man if this priest 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.659
 sex chromosomes came from one side the 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.560
 individual 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.490
 this individual is a man or a woman 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.000
 look sexual he is man or woman 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.000
 looking at sex we see that it is a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.470
 man because he is a man because the pair 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.870
 sex chromosomes 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.960
 it's a different size even 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.210
 Now if the birth in different size is 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.120
 that this pair of sex chromosomes 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.370
 he is not totally homologous 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.269
 in the human species nor most of the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.019
 species 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.840
 the male sex is sex is to have the ga 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.170
 doctor because she is a medical 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.159
 sexual partner and thus half of the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.989
 gametes that man will form will be x and a 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.470
 another half of the sperm I 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.260
 I will inform you and then in our case the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.110
 male is a medical theologian because 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.110
 being the man yes villon he will send 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.480
 ox for half the gametes and one for 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.760
 other half while in the species 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.489
 most species 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.890
 the female being xx 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.980
 she will always send the x-chromosome to 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 the gametes and therefore female sex is the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.780
 medical homosexual sex and taking into account 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.109
 The x and y 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.629
 we observe that the x chromosome 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.730
 it is always greater than oy then by 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.510
 I can say that this 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.579
 chromosome is the xis and this chromosome 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.910
 Small is small 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.620
 here are the three main cases of 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.940
 inheritance with some relation to sex 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.269
 that we will present are the case of 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.989
 a gene that is on the chromosome and the case 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.959
 b of a gene that is on the x chromosome and 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.410
 the case is that although it is a gene 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.379
 its expression is varied 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.290
 its expression is conditioned by sex 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.660
 that has this gene and let's understand 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.470
 how does this gene occur 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:09.430
 the so-called gender-restricted inheritance or 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.109
 single holland genes to restricted inheritance 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.919
 to sex or genes the landlord repairs 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.190
 restricted to sex 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:22.180
 now where is the gene a 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:27.849
 the gene is found in y only in the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:31.419
 y no y in a non-homologous region to xe 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:35.860
 when gene is in y y only in y 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:41.529
 non-homologous area at x citation no y is a 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:44.889
 security is restricted to males 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:47.679
 they are in y y only in y y they are cases 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.589
 sex was just the 

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:53.379
 man has this gene that is why 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:55.899
 is also called the gene the landry qo 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:59.999
 today the light is total 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:05:03.249
 male andrus are totally genes 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:06.669
 male a man has a copy zinha 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.689
 we just say that genius is in ms 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.789
 gov 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.809
 because the man will send for only half 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:18.129
 of the sewer and the woman for being xx 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:20.649
 she will never have a gene restricted to sex 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.259
 classic example of landry genius with 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:25.769
 classic inheritance restricted to the 7 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:29.409
 the hair on the ear to hypertrichosis 

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:31.839
 Ear and ear hair as hell 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.119
 I do not know if I've ever seen people have ears. 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:36.429
 so plush kills plush to stay 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:39.279
 looking like bozo is connected with the hair 

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:41.379
 display the sagÃ¼i that little bit with the tuff 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.609
 hair here on your side 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:45.219
 then those individuals who have 

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:47.529
 Molecular men are always hypertrichosis 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:50.379
 what 's up and crazy 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.839
 if I now have my ear plush 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.469
 my son have the ear plush mine 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:58.479
 grandson man ear plush my great-grandson 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:01.199
 man ear plush what today he always 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:06.009
 will be transmitted from the father to the children 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:09.579
 whole men then inheritance restricted to the 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:14.769
 sex genes the landry qos occur only 

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:18.489
 not only in males having 

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:24.479
 now how does it happen is to know a 

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:24.479
 gene that is in x and is not in y
