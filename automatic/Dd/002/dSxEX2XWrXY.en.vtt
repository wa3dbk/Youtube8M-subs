00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.350
 a park according to writing in any 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.340
 for a raw or something like the only 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 What I know is that there is an uncle who is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.150
 escaping a lot and I do not like that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.519

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.420
 about beyond but I really say it 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.420
 is happening 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.320
 of dark black 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.680
 I've done the hardest 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.909
 quiet is calm you and me friends 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.070
 forever you usually see 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.460
 we get in here 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.500
 ok and now it's supposed to jump to the point 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.960
 of control 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.960
 come on, I got it, I got it, we're there 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:38.290
 there it is that it takes us a lot of 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.380
 arequipa down above and above 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:47.579
 mates yes here are these berries 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.579
 means mexico below is the point to 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.060
 I still do not understand what is called 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 Parkour of zombies but hear that 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.710
 if you want to call the parkour of the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.630
 zombies so it's called because of reading 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.490
 I guess it will be because it does not add no 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.439
 I have because it's good because parkour 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.090
 is in two buildings in three buildings 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.860
 and the baseband then like the zombies 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.170
 as they transmit the disease 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.930
 then the mails will be transmitted in the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 illness for this other building is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.370
 one has had a bit strange but hey 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.560
 that by looking for theories that we are missing 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.299
 they are going to see eye because it puts me that I have 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.900
 have to jump here but actually the 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.900
 point is behind 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.319
 What's up 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.010
 when they check metals is 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.900
 traversed a piece of half scam to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.069
 the boy is I do not understand anything or I do not know 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.659
 if the career or the 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.769
 title is worth if we continue here 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.930
 we jump here 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.859
 88 and that it has been short quiet 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.720
 boy because we do it like that look 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.950
 we jump over here that I have there and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.060
 treated here measures then for 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.349
 What are the fences used in the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.090
 letters of gta since I have no idea 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.190
 because really with a motorcycle I 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.480
 you can skip everything and we take over here and 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:08.389
 that's because I see that I already had everything 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.389
 complicated although it is missing but 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.010
 we put this little sticks here 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.060
 charges discovers color colors 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.060
 he is father 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.190
 like the fence 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.450
 let's go one step the god point 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.630
 you have to jump but little more 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.630
 quiet that seemed more than a bird 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.400
 you have to jump here 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.890
 we look 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.950
 and this model part of guys well fine 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.950
 all right 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:21.389
 no no no no I do not shut up but it seems that 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.820
 I already believed that I was going to be responsible for 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.110
 these infinity more guys and up without 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.090
 appear Huelva I played with him 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.380
 Answer I know 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.840
 v almost equal to losing the way 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.889
 I have to suit 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.889
 me here behind 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.690
 fall 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.630
 tranquility 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.740
 tranquility 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.740
 look at his father 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:02.850
 why why why does it seem 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.850
 but this equality where I am left 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.810
 good night 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.090
 here here we are here we are you and 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.090
 me and I had here watching a race 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.800
 man man my mother gave after 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.530
 50,000 millenium finally responded well 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.050
 an applause to a boy here we are another 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.490
 once back the second has already happened 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.560
 the first one already ends the race 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.600
 But I really do not like it 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.000
 I can already believe an air response in the 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.400
 which building you eat you will also know 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.090
 that as originality is original 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:01.050
 it is restores truth arrives the time 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.050
 nowhere 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.130
 the third and the second is 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.270
 waiting for the mind all Spain 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.560
 take care that stuck that has arrived here 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.790
 dismissal was going to win the race but 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.450
 finally I was second because of 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.450
 That country
