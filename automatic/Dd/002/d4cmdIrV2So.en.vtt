00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
pretty regular that's I've been told

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.660 
pretty regular that's I've been told
that<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.989> diamondback<00:00:48.410> rattlesnake<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.129> more

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
that the diamondback rattlesnake is more

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.459 
that the diamondback rattlesnake is more
commonly<00:00:50.059> has<00:00:50.329> kind<00:00:50.660> of<00:00:50.690> broken<00:00:50.989> stripes

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
commonly has kind of broken stripes

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.319 
commonly has kind of broken stripes
stripes<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.399> aren't<00:00:52.579> complete<00:00:52.910> all<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.149> way

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
stripes that aren't complete all the way

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.720 
stripes that aren't complete all the way
around<00:00:53.449> his<00:00:53.690> tail<00:00:53.929> and<00:00:54.460> often<00:00:55.460> thicker

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
around his tail and often thicker

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.090 
around his tail and often thicker
stripes<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.320> if<00:00:57.379> you<00:00:57.469> look<00:00:57.620> on<00:00:57.739> his<00:00:57.859> tail

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
stripes and so if you look on his tail

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.079 
stripes and so if you look on his tail
here<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:59.390> can<00:00:59.539> see<00:00:59.809> that<00:01:00.019> he's<00:01:00.519> got<00:01:01.519> this<00:01:01.789> one

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
here you can see that he's got this one

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.730 
here you can see that he's got this one
broken<00:01:02.600> stripe<00:01:03.140> right<00:01:03.499> there<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:06.590> makes

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
broken stripe right there and that makes

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.230 
broken stripe right there and that makes
me<00:01:06.920> think<00:01:07.130> he's<00:01:07.250> probably<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.910> western

see he's got what is that four buttons
it's<00:02:10.729> like<00:02:11.170> three<00:02:12.170> rattles<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.860> little

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
it's like three rattles and a little

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.009 
it's like three rattles and a little
button<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.519> tip<00:02:13.790> there<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
button on the tip there and so that

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.140 
button on the tip there and so that
means<00:02:15.230> he<00:02:15.379> shed<00:02:15.709> his<00:02:15.739> skin<00:02:15.890> at<00:02:16.550> least<00:02:16.760> that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
means he shed his skin at least that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.390 
means he shed his skin at least that
many<00:02:17.300> times<00:02:17.510> four<00:02:17.930> times<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.099> this<00:02:19.220> guy

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
many times four times and so this guy

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.190 
many times four times and so this guy
probably<00:02:20.030> wasn't<00:02:20.420> born<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:20.720> year<00:02:20.780> probably

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
probably wasn't born this year probably

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.160 
probably wasn't born this year probably
more<00:02:21.410> likely<00:02:21.590> last<00:02:21.980> year<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.990> know<00:02:24.020> he

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170

the<00:05:26.120> monsoon<00:05:26.509> and<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.810> rains<00:05:27.020> come<00:05:27.319> in<00:05:27.470> I

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
the monsoon and the rains come in I

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.320 
the monsoon and the rains come in I
think<00:05:27.919> that<00:05:28.069> to<00:05:28.159> make<00:05:28.280> it<00:05:28.789> a<00:05:28.849> little<00:05:29.000> easier<00:05:29.150> to

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
think that to make it a little easier to
