well<00:00:08.260> here<00:00:08.410> we<00:00:08.559> are<00:00:08.590> at<00:00:08.740> step<00:00:08.980> number<00:00:09.010> four

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.220 
well here we are at step number four

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.799 
well here we are at step number four
figuring<00:00:12.220> how<00:00:12.340> big<00:00:12.580> how<00:00:13.090> many<00:00:13.269> sides<00:00:13.599> were

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
figuring how big how many sides were

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.800 
figuring how big how many sides were
going<00:00:13.870> to<00:00:14.080> put<00:00:14.290> in<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:14.500> project<00:00:15.059> mostly<00:00:16.059> it's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
going to put in the project mostly it's

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.290 
going to put in the project mostly it's
a<00:00:16.930> matter<00:00:17.140> of<00:00:17.200> personal<00:00:17.560> preference<00:00:17.830> I<00:00:18.300> like

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
a matter of personal preference I like

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.040 
a matter of personal preference I like
twelve<00:00:19.810> sides<00:00:20.080> I<00:00:20.880> started<00:00:21.880> out<00:00:22.029> my<00:00:22.539> segmented

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
twelve sides I started out my segmented

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.529 
twelve sides I started out my segmented
life<00:00:23.170> doing<00:00:23.380> 20<00:00:23.940> decided<00:00:24.940> that<00:00:25.060> was<00:00:25.210> too<00:00:25.359> many

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
life doing 20 decided that was too many

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.980 
life doing 20 decided that was too many
night<00:00:25.869> back<00:00:26.230> down<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:26.650> I<00:00:26.710> ended<00:00:27.010> up<00:00:27.130> with

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
night back down and I ended up with

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.280 
night back down and I ended up with
12:30<00:00:28.990> I<00:00:29.020> bawled<00:00:29.289> about<00:00:30.220> 16<00:00:30.869> most<00:00:31.869> of<00:00:32.019> the<00:00:32.080> time

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
12:30 I bawled about 16 most of the time

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.680 
12:30 I bawled about 16 most of the time
I'm<00:00:33.040> sure<00:00:33.309> he<00:00:33.400> does<00:00:33.580> other<00:00:33.760> sizes<00:00:34.210> too<00:00:34.449> though

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.240 

but<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.989> give<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:38.290> an<00:00:38.440> idea<00:00:38.620> of<00:00:38.800> some<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.100> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
but to give you an idea of some of the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.219 
but to give you an idea of some of the
considerations<00:00:39.760> for<00:00:40.089> determining<00:00:41.080> how<00:00:41.170> many

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
considerations for determining how many

sides<00:00:41.589> you<00:00:41.710> really<00:00:41.949> should<00:00:42.159> use<00:00:42.390> I've<00:00:43.390> got

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
sides you really should use I've got

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.140 
sides you really should use I've got
this<00:00:43.750> set<00:00:44.019> of<00:00:44.670> segments<00:00:45.670> here<00:00:45.790> out<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:45.970> a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
this set of segments here out of a

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.490 
this set of segments here out of a
recent<00:00:46.510> project<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:49.750> here<00:00:49.930> at<00:00:49.989> this<00:00:50.110> end<00:00:50.350> we

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
recent project down here at this end we

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.680 
recent project down here at this end we
have<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:51.010> very<00:00:51.670> wide<00:00:54.059> big<00:00:55.059> wall<00:00:55.269> thickness

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
have a very wide big wall thickness

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.130 
have a very wide big wall thickness
segment<00:00:56.409> this<00:00:56.500> is<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.739> bottom<00:00:57.299> piece<00:00:58.299> that's

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
segment this is the bottom piece that's

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.479 
segment this is the bottom piece that's
the<00:00:59.350> next<00:00:59.589> to<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.710> bottom<00:01:00.010> that's<00:01:00.159> probably

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
the next to the bottom that's probably

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.939 
the next to the bottom that's probably
the<00:01:00.580> next<00:01:00.850> one<00:01:00.940> up<00:01:01.059> after<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:01.860> working<00:01:02.860> our

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
the next one up after that working our

way up the project up towards the
maximum<00:01:06.310> diameter<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.909> project<00:01:07.360> you<00:01:07.479> end

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
maximum diameter of the project you end

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.420 
maximum diameter of the project you end
up<00:01:07.750> with<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> long<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.009> skinny<00:01:09.899> piece<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:12.369> of

up with a long and skinny piece all of

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.200 
up with a long and skinny piece all of
these<00:01:12.670> were<00:01:13.170> based<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.409> having<00:01:15.310> what<00:01:15.640> turned

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
these were based on having what turned

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.060 
these were based on having what turned
wall<00:01:16.509> thicknesses<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.200> about<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.469> quarter<00:01:17.710> inch

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.480 

now<00:01:21.070> all<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.429> these<00:01:21.520> at<00:01:21.850> 12<00:01:22.090> sites<00:01:23.189> make<00:01:24.189> very

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
now all of these at 12 sites make very

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.160 
now all of these at 12 sites make very
good<00:01:24.549> circles<00:01:25.060> if<00:01:25.179> you<00:01:25.210> clamp<00:01:25.539> above<00:01:25.840> good<00:01:26.049> and

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
good circles if you clamp above good and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
good circles if you clamp above good and
tight

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
tight

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.289 
tight
but<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:30.100> sides<00:01:30.429> that<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.729> put<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.119> the

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
but the more sides that you put in the

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.940 
but the more sides that you put in the
less<00:01:31.479> likely<00:01:31.929> it<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.109> that<00:01:32.229> that's<00:01:32.619> going<00:01:32.859> to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
less likely it is that that's going to

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.870 
less likely it is that that's going to
be<00:01:33.070> enough<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.710> hold<00:01:35.859> it<00:01:36.070> into<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.310> true<00:01:36.520> circle

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
be enough to hold it into a true circle

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.709 
be enough to hold it into a true circle
and<00:01:36.999> you<00:01:37.060> may<00:01:37.210> have<00:01:37.329> to<00:01:37.509> help<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:42.719> another

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
and you may have to help it another

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.099 
and you may have to help it another
consideration<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:46.119> you're<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
consideration if you're is it's the

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.779 
consideration if you're is it's the
process<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.560> you're<00:01:47.890> going<00:01:48.189> to<00:01:48.219> use<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.490> make

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
process that you're going to use to make

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.480 
process that you're going to use to make
the<00:01:49.030> segments<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.109> first<00:01:50.289> place<00:01:50.499> I<00:01:50.740> don't

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
the segments in the first place I don't

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.809 
the segments in the first place I don't
sand<00:01:51.909> by<00:01:52.149> segments<00:01:52.719> so<00:01:53.109> this<00:01:53.700> whether<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.789> use

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
sand by segments so this whether I use

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.469 
sand by segments so this whether I use
12<00:01:55.630> sides<00:01:55.899> or<00:01:56.079> 16<00:01:56.439> or<00:01:56.469> 24<00:01:56.890> or<00:01:57.159> 36<00:01:57.399> whatever<00:01:57.909> it

really doesn't matter it's just a matter

really doesn't matter it's just a matter

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
of how much time it takes to do it more

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.320 
better the approximation to a circle it

it is to be a true circle because you

doesn't really make a lot of difference
though<00:03:15.630> because<00:03:15.840> you're<00:03:16.110> not<00:03:16.470> using<00:03:16.680> that

which wood to start with you're using so

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.990 
which wood to start with you're using so
much<00:03:19.020> wood<00:03:19.260> less<00:03:19.560> than<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.860> would<00:03:20.070> be<00:03:20.250> if<00:03:20.940> you

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
much wood less than you would be if you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.039 
much wood less than you would be if you
were<00:03:21.209> working<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.630> solid<00:03:22.049> chunk<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.380> wood

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
were working on a solid chunk of wood

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.560 
were working on a solid chunk of wood
one<00:03:25.049> other<00:03:25.200> consideration<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:26.330> got<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> couple

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
one other consideration I got a couple

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.920 
one other consideration I got a couple
more<00:03:27.810> yet<00:03:28.100> but<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.160> next<00:03:29.220> one<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.760> how<00:03:30.750> you're

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
more yet but the next one is how you're

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.190 
more yet but the next one is how you're
processing<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.860> like<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.459> you're<00:03:32.670> sanding<00:03:33.200> if

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
processing and like if you're sanding if

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.360 
processing and like if you're sanding if
you're<00:03:34.380> working<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:35.720> things<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.900> this

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
you're working on things like this

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.530 
you're working on things like this
sanding<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.489> real<00:03:38.640> easy<00:03:38.820> if<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.209> work<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.510> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
sanding is real easy if you work on a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.900 
sanding is real easy if you work on a
piece<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:41.400> much<00:03:41.580> more<00:03:41.760> difficult

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
piece like this it's much more difficult

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.979 
piece like this it's much more difficult
I'll<00:03:42.750> show<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.019> what<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> mean<00:03:44.690> now<00:03:45.690> here's<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.770 

and<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.459> this<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.850> orientation<00:03:54.660> you're

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
and this is this the orientation you're

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.759 
and this is this the orientation you're
going<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.959> be<00:03:55.080> in<00:03:55.170> when<00:03:55.320> you're<00:03:55.440> trying<00:03:55.650> to

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
going to be in when you're trying to

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.280 
going to be in when you're trying to
sand<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.130> face<00:03:56.340> you've<00:03:57.269> got<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.420> nice<00:03:57.660> long<00:03:57.930> face

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
sand a face you've got a nice long face

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.860 
sand a face you've got a nice long face
here<00:03:58.880> then<00:03:59.880> you've<00:04:00.209> got<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.390> good<00:04:00.630> place<00:04:00.840> to

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
here then you've got a good place to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.440 
here then you've got a good place to
rest<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.640> can<00:04:02.640> be<00:04:02.760> assured<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.150> getting<00:04:03.269> a

rest and you can be assured of getting a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.050 
rest and you can be assured of getting a
pretty<00:04:03.630> darn<00:04:03.840> good<00:04:03.900> good<00:04:04.350> angle<00:04:05.060> accurate

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
pretty darn good good angle accurate

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.690 
pretty darn good good angle accurate
angle<00:04:06.680> but<00:04:07.680> take<00:04:07.890> one<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.130> these<00:04:08.220> long<00:04:08.459> skinny

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
angle but take one of these long skinny

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.440 
angle but take one of these long skinny
pieces<00:04:09.209> now<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:11.370> now<00:04:11.519> you're<00:04:11.760> expected<00:04:12.299> to

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
pieces now and now you're expected to

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.930 
pieces now and now you're expected to
hold<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.900> flat<00:04:13.530> across<00:04:13.860> this<00:04:14.100> point<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:14.730> so

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
hold this flat across this point here so

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.509 
hold this flat across this point here so
that<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.840> can<00:04:15.930> get<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> right<00:04:16.320> angle<00:04:17.100> they're

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
that you can get the right angle they're

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.009 
that you can get the right angle they're
much<00:04:18.390> harder<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.840> do

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
much harder to do

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.570 
much harder to do
and<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.169> last<00:04:21.379> consideration<00:04:21.709> I<00:04:22.159> want<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.460> to

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and the last consideration I want you to

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.029 
and the last consideration I want you to
think<00:04:22.879> about<00:04:23.349> is<00:04:24.349> what<00:04:24.530> do<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.740> want<00:04:24.919> your

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
think about is what do you want your

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.790 
think about is what do you want your
project<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.610> look<00:04:25.729> like<00:04:26.169> that's<00:04:27.169> a<00:04:27.379> big<00:04:27.560> point

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
project to look like that's a big point

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.350 
project to look like that's a big point
in<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:30.940> now<00:04:31.940> here's<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.240> picture<00:04:32.449> of<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:34.520> cereal

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
in it now here's a picture of a cereal

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.550 
in it now here's a picture of a cereal
bowl<00:04:36.280> -<00:04:37.280> about<00:04:37.460> nine<00:04:37.669> inches<00:04:38.349> this<00:04:39.349> is<00:04:39.530> a

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
bowl - about nine inches this is a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.749 
bowl - about nine inches this is a
twelve<00:04:39.979> sites<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.780> ring<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.650> our<00:04:43.520> waist

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
twelve sites the ring and our waist

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.950 
twelve sites the ring and our waist
figure<00:04:44.360> is<00:04:44.479> around<00:04:44.780> 29%<00:04:45.259> as<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.800> said<00:04:46.009> before

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
figure is around 29% as I said before

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.869 
figure is around 29% as I said before
now<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.139> wraps<00:04:48.770> around<00:04:48.919> pretty<00:04:49.280> fast<00:04:49.370> using

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
now that wraps around pretty fast using

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:56.409 
now that wraps around pretty fast using
a<00:04:50.060> half<00:04:50.240> lap<00:04:54.460> assembly<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:55.759> rings<00:04:55.940> one

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
a half lap assembly of the rings one

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.969 
a half lap assembly of the rings one
ring<00:04:56.599> to<00:04:56.629> another<00:04:59.289> that<00:05:00.289> might<00:05:00.500> look<00:05:00.650> like<00:05:00.710> it

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
ring to another that might look like it

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.320 
ring to another that might look like it
wraps<00:05:01.159> a<00:05:01.310> little<00:05:01.490> bit<00:05:01.610> too<00:05:01.759> fast<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.240> too

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
wraps a little bit too fast and too

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.350 
wraps a little bit too fast and too
tight<00:05:02.569> for<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:04.780> so<00:05:05.780> this<00:05:05.930> next<00:05:06.139> picture<00:05:07.120> is<00:05:08.120> of

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
tight for you so this next picture is of

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.010 
tight for you so this next picture is of
a<00:05:08.539> 16<00:05:09.199> sided<00:05:10.180> object<00:05:11.180> it's<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.389> same<00:05:11.599> object

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
a 16 sided object it's the same object

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.610 
a 16 sided object it's the same object
but<00:05:12.050> now<00:05:12.319> we<00:05:12.379> have<00:05:12.590> 16<00:05:13.039> sites<00:05:13.310> per<00:05:13.750> ring<00:05:14.750> and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
but now we have 16 sites per ring and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.189 
but now we have 16 sites per ring and
notice<00:05:15.919> we've<00:05:16.870> unwounded<00:05:17.870> it<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.050> little<00:05:18.259> bit

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
notice we've unwounded it a little bit

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.779 
notice we've unwounded it a little bit
finally<00:05:22.240> take<00:05:23.240> a<00:05:23.270> look<00:05:23.509> at<00:05:24.250> 24<00:05:25.250> signs<00:05:25.520> and

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
finally take a look at 24 signs and

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.129 
finally take a look at 24 signs and
we've<00:05:25.909> considerably<00:05:26.419> unwounded<00:05:26.900> as<00:05:27.110> a

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
we've considerably unwounded as a

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.890 
we've considerably unwounded as a
graphically<00:05:27.740> different<00:05:28.190> appearance<00:05:28.880> than<00:05:28.969> it

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
graphically different appearance than it

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:41.909 
graphically different appearance than it
did<00:05:30.020> back<00:05:30.229> at<00:05:30.259> 12<00:05:30.650> sites<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.990> one<00:05:37.509> 16<00:05:38.509> 12<00:05:39.490> this

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
did back at 12 sites that one 16 12 this

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:50.110 
did back at 12 sites that one 16 12 this
one<00:05:42.919> at<00:05:43.039> 16<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:48.550> think<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.639> all<00:05:49.729> ends<00:05:50.000> up

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
one at 16 so I think it all ends up

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.959 
one at 16 so I think it all ends up
being<00:05:50.300> personal<00:05:50.719> preference<00:05:51.139> or<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:52.580> needs

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
being personal preference or the needs

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.550 
being personal preference or the needs
of<00:05:53.120> a<00:05:53.240> particular<00:05:53.360> piece<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.139> what<00:05:54.289> kind<00:05:54.500> of

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
of a particular piece and what kind of

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.240 
of a particular piece and what kind of
design<00:05:54.889> you<00:05:55.039> want<00:05:55.159> to<00:05:55.279> use<00:05:55.430> in<00:05:55.669> it<00:05:55.819> for<00:05:56.659> this

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
design you want to use in it for this

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.670 
design you want to use in it for this
spiraling<00:05:58.250> design<00:05:58.610> actually<00:05:59.539> I<00:05:59.779> think<00:06:00.080> 16<00:06:00.529> or

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
spiraling design actually I think 16 or

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.490 
spiraling design actually I think 16 or
24<00:06:00.949> might<00:06:01.310> be<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.490> better<00:06:01.699> looking<00:06:02.029> object<00:06:02.900> than

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
24 might be a better looking object than

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.939 
24 might be a better looking object than
the<00:06:03.620> one<00:06:03.770> at<00:06:03.889> 12<00:06:04.129> what<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.150> 12<00:06:05.360> works<00:06:05.599> -<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:08.949> go

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
the one at 12 what the 12 works - so go

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.159 
the one at 12 what the 12 works - so go
have<00:06:10.129> fun
