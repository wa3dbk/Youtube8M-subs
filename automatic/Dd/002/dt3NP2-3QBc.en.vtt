mind<00:00:54.870> don't<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.410> confused<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.550> here's<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
mind don't get confused so here's the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.010 
mind don't get confused so here's the
motion<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.870> doing

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
motion that you're going to be doing

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
motion that you're going to be doing
with<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.530> head<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.070> shoulders<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.149> like

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
with your head and shoulders just like

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.560 
with your head and shoulders just like
any<00:01:01.010> trick<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.280> has<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> 180<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.270> very

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
any trick that has a 180 it's very

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.899 
any trick that has a 180 it's very
important<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.589> where<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.460> head<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
important to know where your head and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.120 
important to know where your head and
shoulders<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.570> doing<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.830> going

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
shoulders are doing because you're going

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
shoulders are doing because you're going
to<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> turn<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.150> upper<00:01:09.479> body<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.990> order

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to have to turn your upper body in order

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.130 
to have to turn your upper body in order
for<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.590> lower<00:01:10.920> body<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.430> legs<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.869> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
for your lower body your legs to do that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.100 
for your lower body your legs to do that
motion<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.360> probably<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> best

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
motion so this is probably the best

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.140 
motion so this is probably the best
practice<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.700> trick<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
practice that there is for this trick is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.289 
practice that there is for this trick is
just<00:01:18.450> rolling<00:01:18.810> fakie<00:01:19.549> popping<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.729> turning

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
just rolling fakie popping it turning

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
just rolling fakie popping it turning
your<00:01:21.420> head<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.720> shoulders<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.470> then

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
your head and shoulders and then

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.219 
your head and shoulders and then
stepping<00:01:23.100> off<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.820> back<00:01:24.030> foot<00:01:24.360> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
stepping off with your back foot it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
stepping off with your back foot it's
very<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.950> very<00:01:26.280> important<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> leave<00:01:27.150> your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
very very very important to leave your

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.969 
very very very important to leave your
front<00:01:27.630> foot<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.350> during<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.799> whole

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
front foot on there during the whole

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
front foot on there during the whole
thing<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.909> when<00:01:30.360> you're<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.720> doing

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
thing because when you're actually doing

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.319 
thing because when you're actually doing
the<00:01:31.380> trick<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.280> point<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.790> control

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the trick that is your point of control

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.890 
the trick that is your point of control
so<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.560> very<00:01:34.890> big<00:01:35.280> deal<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.180> leave<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so it is a very big deal to leave that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.319 
so it is a very big deal to leave that
front<00:01:37.200> foot<00:01:37.380> closed<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.850> get

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
front foot closed you want it to not get

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.850 
front foot closed you want it to not get
too<00:01:39.540> far<00:01:39.570> away<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.380> board

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
too far away from the board

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.499 
too far away from the board
because<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> does<00:01:41.939> then<00:01:41.970> you're<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
because if it does then you're going to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
because if it does then you're going to
be<00:01:42.720> landing<00:01:43.110> primo<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.220> board<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
be landing primo the board is going to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
be landing primo the board is going to
be<00:01:44.790> spinning<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
be spinning and it's just going to be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.069 
be spinning and it's just going to be
really<00:01:46.590> hard<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.040> land<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> pretty

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
really hard to land so this is pretty

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
really hard to land so this is pretty
much<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.530> main<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.250> most<00:01:50.490> important

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
much the main and most important

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.679 
much the main and most important
practice<00:01:51.750> step<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.740> roll<00:01:53.009> fakie<00:01:53.420> pop<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
practice step just roll fakie pop it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.469 
practice step just roll fakie pop it
scoop<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.310> foot<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.240> turn

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
scoop it with your back foot as you turn

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
scoop it with your back foot as you turn
your<00:01:57.689> head<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.049> shoulders<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:59.130> board

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
your head and shoulders and your board

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.630 
your head and shoulders and your board
should<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.180> 360<00:02:00.869> motion<00:02:01.219> while<00:02:02.219> you're

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
should do the 360 motion while you're

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
should do the 360 motion while you're
leaving<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.270> front<00:02:03.509> foot<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.990> there<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
leaving your front foot on there the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.740 
leaving your front foot on there the
whole<00:02:04.619> time<00:02:04.759> another<00:02:05.759> practice<00:02:06.299> step<00:02:06.540> that's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
whole time another practice step that's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.440 
whole time another practice step that's
really<00:02:07.110> helpful<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.829> just<00:02:08.190> taking<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> pop

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
really helpful is just taking the pop

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.630 
really helpful is just taking the pop
out<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.200> doing<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.709> no<00:02:10.950> pop<00:02:11.250> just

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
out and just doing it with no pop just

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
out and just doing it with no pop just
like<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:12.030> done<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.620> see<00:02:13.650> I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
like it's done right here so you see I

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
like it's done right here so you see I
just<00:02:14.069> scoop<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.459> really<00:02:14.760> hard<00:02:15.000> throw<00:02:15.510> my<00:02:15.660> head

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
just scoop it really hard throw my head

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.630 
just scoop it really hard throw my head
and<00:02:15.930> shoulders<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.530> take<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> pop<00:02:17.069> out<00:02:17.310> so

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and shoulders and take the pop out so

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.190 
and shoulders and take the pop out so
once<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.940> get<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.540> then<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.020> can

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
once you get it like that then you can

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
once you get it like that then you can
put<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.620> pop<00:02:19.830> back<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:21.450> snap<00:02:21.930> your

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
put the pop back in and just snap your

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.839 
put the pop back in and just snap your
tail<00:02:22.349> on<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.620> ground<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.340> board's<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
tail on the ground the board's going to

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.350 
tail on the ground the board's going to
go<00:02:23.970> around<00:02:24.239> super<00:02:24.629> fast<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.560> got<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.360> cool

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
go around super fast and you got it cool

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.150 
go around super fast and you got it cool
so<00:02:27.569> let's<00:02:27.599> break<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.110> down<00:02:28.170> step<00:02:28.680> by<00:02:28.860> step

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
so let's break this down step by step

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550 
so let's break this down step by step
notice<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.150> head<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:31.080> shoulders<00:02:31.110> are

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
notice my head and my shoulders are

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.790 
notice my head and my shoulders are
coming<00:02:32.489> around<00:02:32.790> already<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.349> it's<00:02:34.500> kind<00:02:34.739> of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
coming around already and it's kind of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.920 
coming around already and it's kind of
interesting<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.580> board<00:02:35.940> almost<00:02:36.239> comes

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
interesting that the board almost comes

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.110 
interesting that the board almost comes
out<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> 90<00:02:37.560> degree<00:02:37.830> angle<00:02:37.860> by<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.340> time<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.730> pop

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
out a 90 degree angle by the time I pop

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.350 
out a 90 degree angle by the time I pop
my<00:02:39.150> back<00:02:39.629> foot<00:02:39.989> then<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:41.040> scoop<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.760> right

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
my back foot then I just scoop it right

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.710 
my back foot then I just scoop it right
away

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
away

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.140 
away
a<00:02:43.140> lot<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.410> banging<00:02:43.620> about<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.920> boom<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.550> it's

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
a lot of banging about a boom and it's

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.600 
a lot of banging about a boom and it's
pretty<00:02:45.360> much<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.230> shoving<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.550> I'm

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
pretty much just like a shoving so I'm

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.979 
pretty much just like a shoving so I'm
going<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.819> land<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.239> shove<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.720> would<00:02:48.870> be

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
going to land the shove it would be

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.199 
going to land the shove it would be
right<00:02:49.349> there<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.280> full<00:02:50.489> shove<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.970> motion

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
right there is the full shove it motion

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.290 
right there is the full shove it motion
and<00:02:51.720> then<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:51.989> see<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:52.319> turn<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.370> second

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
and then you see I just turn that second

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.880 
and then you see I just turn that second
90<00:02:54.870> catch<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:56.099> land<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.360> roll<00:02:57.690> away<00:02:57.860> now<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
90 catch it land and roll away now a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.440 
90 catch it land and roll away now a
couple<00:02:59.400> points<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.849> want<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.120> make<00:03:00.239> that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
couple points that I want to make that

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.940 
couple points that I want to make that
are<00:03:00.569> very<00:03:00.810> important<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.409> this<00:03:01.530> trick<00:03:01.800> is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
are very important for this trick is

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
of a beginner trick although it looks

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
it's one of those ones that it just kind

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.990 
it's one of those ones that it just kind
of<00:03:38.610> comes<00:03:39.180> together<00:03:40.099> weirdly<00:03:41.099> it's<00:03:41.310> not<00:03:41.640> as

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
of comes together weirdly it's not as

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.910 
of comes together weirdly it's not as
hard<00:03:42.299> as<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.569> would<00:03:42.720> think<00:03:42.989> at<00:03:43.290> all

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
hard as you would think at all

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.220 
hard as you would think at all
so<00:03:44.400> yeah<00:03:44.610> just<00:03:44.640> practice<00:03:45.629> practice<00:03:45.750> practice

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.979 
so yeah just practice practice practice
practice<00:03:46.709> practice<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.849> you<00:03:48.299> will<00:03:48.510> get<00:03:48.750> this

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
practice practice and you will get this

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.710 
practice practice and you will get this
trick<00:03:49.349> down<00:03:49.620> again<00:03:50.610> make<00:03:50.909> sure<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.239> have<00:03:51.269> your

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
trick down again make sure you have your

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.890 
trick down again make sure you have your
half<00:03:52.290> cabs<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.099> your<00:03:53.489> fake<00:03:53.700> shove-its<00:03:54.299> and

half cabs and your fake shove-its and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.300 
half cabs and your fake shove-its and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
then it's basically just putting those

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.520 
then it's basically just putting those
two<00:03:56.580> things<00:03:56.879> together<00:03:57.180> but<00:03:58.110> make<00:03:58.290> sure<00:03:58.319> you

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
two things together but make sure you

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.289
