00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.380 
know I don't want to sound arrogant but
I<00:00:25.050> don't<00:00:25.230> go<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.859> pointers<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.580> actually<00:00:27.029> go

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
I don't go to get pointers I actually go

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.259 
I don't go to get pointers I actually go
to<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.689> how<00:00:27.900> far<00:00:28.230> people<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.769> gone<00:00:29.269> street

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
to see how far people have gone street

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.229 
to see how far people have gone street
from<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:30.990> should<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.439> doing<00:00:31.470> actually

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
from what they should be doing actually

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.229 
from what they should be doing actually
and<00:00:33.440> what<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.640> something<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and what I see is that something is

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.110 
and what I see is that something is
simple<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.860> shadowboxing<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.520> proper<00:00:38.969> way

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
simple as shadowboxing and a proper way

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.799 
simple as shadowboxing and a proper way
to<00:00:39.149> shadowbox<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.399> being<00:00:41.700> taught<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.390> any

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

right<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> generally<00:00:54.570> see

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
right so this is what I generally see

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.380 
right so this is what I generally see
all<00:00:55.590> right<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
all right now I'm going to do it from a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
all right now I'm going to do it from a
southpaw<00:00:57.870> position<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:59.070> more

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
southpaw position because it's more

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.970 
southpaw position because it's more
natural<00:00:59.520> for<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.180> even<00:01:00.930> though<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> did<00:01:01.590> switch

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
natural for me even though I did switch

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.390 
natural for me even though I did switch
alright<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.949> show

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
alright so what I'm going to do is show

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
alright so what I'm going to do is show
you<00:01:05.430> basically<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.659> when<00:01:07.110> people<00:01:07.170> are

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you basically what I see when people are

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.270 
you basically what I see when people are
shadowboxing<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.680> alright<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
shadowboxing it's this alright it's a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.969 
shadowboxing it's this alright it's a
lot<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.540> movement<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.799> lot

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
lot of this kind of movement and a lot

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.609 
lot of this kind of movement and a lot
of<00:01:14.010> bouncing<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.930> type<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.229> thing

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
of bouncing you know this type of thing

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.670 
of bouncing you know this type of thing
and<00:01:17.000> largely<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.270> reason<00:01:18.479> why<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.380> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and largely the reason why a lot of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.859 
and largely the reason why a lot of
young<00:01:19.979> fighters<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:21.060> won't<00:01:21.360> say<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
young fighters do it they won't say it

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.440 
young fighters do it they won't say it
but<00:01:22.049> largely<00:01:23.040> why<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> lot<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> young<00:01:24.000> fighters

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
but largely why a lot of young fighters

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.080 
but largely why a lot of young fighters
do<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.680> audience

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
do that is because they have a audience

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
do that is because they have a audience
okay<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.290> audience

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
okay it's because they have audience

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
okay it's because they have audience
there<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.189> people<00:01:29.549> looking<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.630> they

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
there are people looking at them so they

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
there are people looking at them so they
feel<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.710> bouncing<00:01:32.250> around

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
feel like you know by bouncing around

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.910 
feel like you know by bouncing around
and<00:01:32.759> moving<00:01:32.970> around<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.900> doing<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.619> Floyd

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and moving around it and doing it Floyd

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
and moving around it and doing it Floyd
Mayweather<00:01:35.400> jr.<00:01:36.979> imitation<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:39.060> something

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
Mayweather jr. imitation is something

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
Mayweather jr. imitation is something

too<00:01:45.630> many<00:01:45.659> older<00:01:46.560> trainers<00:01:47.130> who<00:01:47.280> are<00:01:47.399> looking

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
too many older trainers who are looking

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.109 
too many older trainers who are looking
for<00:01:48.030> someone<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.659> latch<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.880> don't<00:01:50.880> have

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
for someone to latch on to don't have

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the courage to tell that young man he's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.139 
the courage to tell that young man he's
not<00:01:53.670> properly<00:01:55.310> shadowboxing<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:56.909> he's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
not properly shadowboxing because he's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.850 
not properly shadowboxing because he's
hoping<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.630> young<00:01:57.810> man<00:01:58.079> will<00:01:58.320> let<00:01:58.530> him<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.829> in

hoping that young man will let him be in

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.370 
hoping that young man will let him be in
his<00:01:59.040> corner<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.610> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.180> take<00:02:00.420> him<00:02:00.689> along

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
his corner and kind of take him along
