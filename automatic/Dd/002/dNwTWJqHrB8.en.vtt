00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.490
 this is a massacre 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.490
 they will all die before they can reach pals 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 that's the idea 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.169

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.169
 serve to end a threat 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.900
 that is to say 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.370
 why they wanted to take the covers 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 because in eliminating it on the way 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.740
 an execution disguised as an exile 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 that's what force does 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 relocation of ties 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
 how they come up with such a hoax 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.010
 the flea is a sadistic thing 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 the private troops of the saints do not guard 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.910
 saiz with the pure 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 a soldier is a soldier not 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.580
 Both he looks like the fans and they are enemies of the state 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.470
 if they order a soldier to kill his rival without caring about the uniform that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.320
 I carried 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.570
 Maybe that is the ETA environment 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 he could not shoot and it was he who ended up dead 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.120

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.780

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.269
 the number of citizens of Romanian nationality 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.250

 with these antiaircraft weapons immediately 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.369
 those wishes of the inhabitants of the globe that you are of cover 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.859
 right away he did well 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.859

 just what we were looking for 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.269
