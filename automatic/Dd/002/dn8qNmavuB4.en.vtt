00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.299
 hi guys welcome back to my channel 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.240
 this video is about applying 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.580
 simple basic eye shadow and eye shadow 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.230
 can actually be applied to three 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.880
 ways in three different steps 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.730
 I won't show you in that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.609
 starting with primers and primer 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.800
 meant to make the color of your eye makeup 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.630
 continue to show in the color yes 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.460
 visible 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.670
 but also that the color stays longer 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.670
 to sit 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 you can do this with your finger tips 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.100
 applying in the beginning it can still be finished 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.809
 be admonished with eye shadow but you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.820
 actually only need two colors to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.770
 create tomorrow look 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.450
 in the first color with a rose to the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.000
 second is with dark color and 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.370
 third color is a color that is between the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.020
 two in it without shimmer is one 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.190
 transitioning color 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.200
 for applying the shimmer 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.200
 use a flat eye shadow brush 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.190
 I always finish your quest for it 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.190
 to prevent failure 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.070
 apply the first eye shadow in one 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.460
 dabbing motion just have slowly 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.560
 worry about eyelid if you apply this 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.630
 make sure you just go total so 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.369
 beginning with a layer in then, after the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.510
 second layer because you see that you 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.850
 sufficient product about you also good because 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.890
 applying shimmer is quite difficult 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.540
 mind and I for something on another 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.420
 way can do and it is through 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.729
 of water simply tap water 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.340
 the spray on your magic brush was already one 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.970
 slightly damp and then pat it in again 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.970
 your makeup 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.990
 another advantage of your wet brush 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.569
 make that the color is just that little bit more 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.569
 pigmentation told on your eyelid 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.289
 you can use the same color to 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:19.400
 below to make your eyebrows 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:21.530
 the inner corner of you also with one 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.260
 Round blending brush you can change the color 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.370
 soften are not too loud or the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 striking 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.440
 the next step is to apply 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.030
 a color type you can use a club for this 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.079
 with a bit of a real shimmer 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.690
 use 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.489
 and you apply that in a light v 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.879
 from the corners of your eyes 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.760
 to the top of your eyelid and that 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.470
 bring your very gently no further 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.470
 then a middle part of your eye 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.600
 so there you stop 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.250
 grinding blame sharpeners 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:14.970
 look very soft and faded in color 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:17.040
 you for that you will want one 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.769
 create balance then you can take this step 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.510
 and of course it optional and 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.459
 so you bring the color to what i like 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.980
 just specified and transitioning color 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.719
 just use it to whole things 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.030
 make a whole of it and you do that 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.200
 all are separate parts and these 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.069
 color you can also at the bottom 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.069
 apply 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.750
 use the actions of your eyebrows 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.750
 diversion pounds 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.569
 apply with mascara to finish it off 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.310
 I make applying eyeliner but 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.510
 I will tell more about that in someone else 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.040
 movie 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.050
 and this was a complete run it is 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.300
 very simple and easy especially for 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.400
 beginner do you have any questions please ask them 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.000
 Thanks we look next time 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.000
