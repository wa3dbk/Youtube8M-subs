00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.970
 Hello to you the truth I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.970
 attack and today we have to turn immediately 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.699
 three dishonest groups groups essentially 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.340
 look like one to another i won't today 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.949
 long groan explain why this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 a group like that if she 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.189
 hit my video means I already I think 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.670
 scam 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.649
 Well, I will not take much time 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.309
 let's go straight to the first time group 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 as always we see wound subscribers 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.020
 fake jokes in the ballista into the wall in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 discussions we have a topic 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.960
 what to do if you won the draw 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 and here we have the same prikolyukha that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.090
 things worth more than 3 cues need 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.530
 pick up for 1 hour is another topic 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.210
 discussions leave us a reputation reputation 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.119
 here we see a rally or little things 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 The winnings are mostly unsubscribed. 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.850
 who has not participated in the sweepstakes writes 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.250
 like 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.130
 I won nothing here but I think that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 group good things like that won't 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.990
 for a long time to explain it so everything is clear 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.119
 move on to the second group see 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 fixed record of this public already 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.290
 I see that this is a complete mess 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.530
 about the sheet in the wall with sweepstakes here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.869
 we also have a mega draw all everything 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.869
 top items are played out 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.000
 he even guys didnâ€™t stint and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 alpine set played reviews with us in 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 this group is quite a bit 8 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.880
 pages 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.460
 it very much could such a group if there 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.159
 really draws and most likely 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.340
 the prices here are also fake as well 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.700
 spun and group subscribers 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.310
 fake go to the third group on the wall 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.799
 we have a lot of jokes here but 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.069
 for some reason we have no winners 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.049
 where did the winners get to 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.739
 discuss someone there is such an interesting 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 the topic is called the group scammers 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.900
 Yes, I think I need the first post 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.450
 add exactly this group about which 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 Now I speak now and my husband will add a 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.500
 there can not be added but somebody has to 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.690
 tried for me and also even 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.370
 look in this thread we have this 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.799
 Group 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.500
 Again, we wound subscribers 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.000
 there are few of them besides the twisted ones 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.760
 there are normal users 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.209
 people who are also filmed in these publics 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.840
 and a question for these people why are you there 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.150
 sit down 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.139
 that there might be interesting you think 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.880
 that you play and either something else just 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:00.569
 there is no sense to sit in this group 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.280
 ask yourself the question where are admins from 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.400
 take such expensive things 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.269
 the second question is why are they just like that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.829
 give thought to it but it's in 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.290
 principle and all i wanted you today 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.750
