to get not only 100 crimson charms but
decay<00:00:23.880> ranged<00:00:24.300> experience<00:00:24.779> every<00:00:25.140> hour<00:00:25.340> this

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
decay ranged experience every hour this

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040 
decay ranged experience every hour this
isn't<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:26.699> good<00:00:26.820> as<00:00:26.939> drop<00:00:27.150> lobsters<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.720> admit

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
isn't as good as drop lobsters I admit

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
isn't as good as drop lobsters I admit
but<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.130> good<00:00:29.279> thing<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.730> method<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
but the good thing about this method is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.089 
but the good thing about this method is
that<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.019> done<00:00:31.170> by<00:00:31.380> pills<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> lower

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that it can be done by pills and lower

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.750 
that it can be done by pills and lower
levels<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> yeah<00:00:33.960> let's<00:00:34.170> begin<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:35.370> method

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
levels so yeah let's begin this method

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.370 
levels so yeah let's begin this method
is<00:00:35.850> pretty<00:00:36.149> simple<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.630> doesn't<00:00:36.899> need<00:00:37.170> many

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
is pretty simple and doesn't need many

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
is pretty simple and doesn't need many
requirements<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.370> said<00:00:38.430> pures

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
requirements because like I said pures

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.360 
requirements because like I said pures
can<00:00:39.090> use<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.420> during<00:00:40.110> requirements<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:40.980> fully

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
can use it during requirements are fully

two more for equipment we're ever going
to<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.110> method<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to be going for this method is going to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
to be going for this method is going to
be<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.489> foreign<00:00:51.030> area<00:00:51.180> dungeon<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.199> kill<00:00:52.440> the
