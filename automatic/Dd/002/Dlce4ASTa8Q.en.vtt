00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
honestly picking your own topic I think

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.480 
honestly picking your own topic I think
it's<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.139> be<00:00:13.320> more<00:00:13.530> enjoyable<00:00:13.679> for<00:00:14.160> you

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
that way it really should be interesting

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.019 
that way it really should be interesting
argumentative<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.990> scholarly<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> also

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
argumentative and scholarly so I also

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.060 
argumentative and scholarly so I also
recommend<00:00:21.630> picking<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.199> topic<00:00:22.619> within<00:00:22.830> your

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070

that's an excellent topic and a lot of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
that's an excellent topic and a lot of
research<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.789> support<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.960> criminal

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
research to support that to criminal

the exercise science

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.370 
the exercise science
I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.810> Yoga<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.460> treating<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> lot<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.600> even

Meditation was a very good one for
engineering<00:01:26.549> technology<00:01:27.950> fracking<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.100> very

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
engineering technology fracking was very

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.060

interesting<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:31.259> offshore<00:01:31.680> wind

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
interesting and the offshore wind

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.160 
interesting and the offshore wind
turbines<00:01:32.490> were<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.060> too<00:01:33.299> because<00:01:33.600> that
