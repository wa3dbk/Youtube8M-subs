go into detail about this map I just
really<00:00:16.289> quickly<00:00:16.500> want<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> say<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.310> map

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
really quickly want to say that this map

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.760 
really quickly want to say that this map
is<00:00:17.730> not<00:00:17.910> confirmed<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.690> all<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> person

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
is not confirmed at all but the person

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
is not confirmed at all but the person
who<00:00:19.890> wrote<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.430> goes<00:00:20.699> into<00:00:20.910> depth<00:00:21.300> in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
who wrote this really goes into depth in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.200 
who wrote this really goes into depth in
the<00:00:22.080> whole<00:00:22.230> map<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.850> explains<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.939> lot<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the whole map and explains a lot of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.640 
the whole map and explains a lot of
stuff<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.630> definitely<00:00:24.990> seems<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
stuff so it definitely seems like it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.339 
stuff so it definitely seems like it
could<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.039> legitimate<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:26.970> opinion<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.720> by

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
could be legitimate in my opinion and by

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.830

that<00:01:07.320> attacks<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> boat<00:01:08.010> kind<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.460> like

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that attacks the boat kind of like

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
that attacks the boat kind of like
George<00:01:08.970> from<00:01:09.180> called<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> dead<00:01:09.900> but

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
George from called the dead but

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
George from called the dead but
obviously<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.369> lot<00:01:11.640> bigger<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.299> more

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
obviously a lot bigger and more

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.289 
obviously a lot bigger and more
problematic<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.340> article<00:01:14.729> states<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
problematic the article states that the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
problematic the article states that the
whale<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.750> try<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:16.259> holes<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
whale will try and make holes in the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.390 
whale will try and make holes in the
boat<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.670> fix<00:01:18.020> but<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.350> actually<00:01:19.710> can't

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
boat you can fix but you actually can't

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.859 
boat you can fix but you actually can't
attempt<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> kill<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> whale<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
attempt to kill the whale so it

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.359 
attempt to kill the whale so it
definitely<00:01:22.259> seems<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.560> it'll<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
definitely seems like it'll be a lot of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.060 
definitely seems like it'll be a lot of
fun<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:24.479> will<00:01:24.810> also<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.320> an<00:01:25.590> Easter<00:01:25.950> Egg

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
fun there will also be an Easter Egg

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
fun there will also be an Easter Egg
within<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> map<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> kind<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.299> explains<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
within the map that kind of explains the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
within the map that kind of explains the
Bermuda<00:01:28.350> Triangle<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> whole

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
Bermuda Triangle and what the whole

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.030 
Bermuda Triangle and what the whole
story<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.409> definitely<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
story of it is and it's definitely not a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
story of it is and it's definitely not a
surprise<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.850> regardless<00:01:33.329> seems<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> lot

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
surprise but regardless seems like a lot

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.340 
surprise but regardless seems like a lot
of<00:01:34.140> fun<00:01:34.409> yet<00:01:34.740> again<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:36.079> there<00:01:37.079> will<00:01:37.290> be

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of fun yet again so there will be

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
of fun yet again so there will be
multiple<00:01:37.770> areas<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.640> explore<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.270> include

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
multiple areas to explore that include

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.050 
multiple areas to explore that include
the<00:01:39.780> outside<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.560> inside<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.400> boat<00:01:41.640> these

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
boat would have so that's pretty much it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.389 
boat would have so that's pretty much it
for<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> area's<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.770> final<00:01:59.100> thing<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
