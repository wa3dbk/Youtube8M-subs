00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.600
 how can we get ourselves called back to 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.540
 phone immediately without that 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.240
 the other person puts up defenses or that 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799
 have or that or without what we owe 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.450
 ask to say it because obviously in the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.289
 moment when we ask for something 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.170
 someone 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.769
 let's start already loser instead we have to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.350
 to let him look for without without 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.880
 be it for any reason of course 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.529
 this can interest us here we must 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.529
 assume a fundamental characteristic 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.070
 of the human being than that of no 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.100
 tolerate having open guests 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.280
 what is an open gestalt is a form 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 guest from German means form 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.710
 unfinished unfinished ie beings 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.210
 humans do not tolerate things that are not closed 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.520
 not concluded 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.649
 so here we have to send a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.420
 message or leave on the answering machine 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.379
 telephone 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 a message that creates a gestalt 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.640
 open that creates a confusion that he 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.260
 don't know what to take this between 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 the other a very used technique 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.409
 also in advertisements for short to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.670
 example on the web to open the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.490
 application of files 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.409
 however it is one thing they could 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.030
 simply leave a message of 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.720
 secretary or send a message from 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.860
 kind oh look I appreciated very much 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.530
 what the fact for me have me 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.060
 spoke very well of you then 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.540
 we will deepen when it is time 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.159
 we will deepen the discussion one thing 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.049
 what of this kind raises 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.820
 immediately in curiosity for which 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.630
 the person will be instinctively brought to 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 call you back a message from 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.590
 gender 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.930
 I'm sure you'll like this a lot 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.009
 what they told me all that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.450
 you have the right features 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:10.280
 then we'll talk about that again, too 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.280
 another message of the type 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.750
 open gestalt including people 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.360
 they will instinctively be inclined ha 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.010
 immediately recalled messages e 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.700
 such messages are happy 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.740
 a beautiful thing was strong for you 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.250
 point 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.300
 obviously we must keep in mind that 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.570
 then when the other person calls us back 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.880
 we must find them an excuse with when the 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.150
 to the message we left e 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.870
 especially as this type of 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.120
 message generates a bit of tension 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.460
 because it was generally opened there 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.230
 always tension we must know that 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.870
 the other person when he calls us back 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.420
 will be a little more suggestible than the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.790
 usually so we can pass gods 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.250
 messages to pass messages that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.990
 they will tend to become suggestions 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.050
 that is, to betray him to translate into 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.459
 mechanism we say in behavior 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.290
