 video about gta 5 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.779
 a little tutorial to explain 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 how to go in the amap snowy 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.820
 that we do at the beginning of the game in the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.289
 prologue 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.230
 so you just have to be offered 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 start I play again your toys on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.559
 prologue the very first mission of the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.300
 play then want to play you play it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 not all for those who want 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.320
 not play me right at the beginning you 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.850
 when you are in the snow and that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.620
 until a friend of you are you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.030
 join him and on a surrender on 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 invitation because I do not know that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 walk when I do them on disposals 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.620
 his invitation 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.780
 after others I do not know it works 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 so this association his invitation and 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.800
 you join your friend offered himself a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.239
 loading everything normal so I have 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.829
 even accelerated because I had it's a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.559
 a little long commented all that you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.520
 join a friend either 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.229
 bringing the time she's on a 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 housing transfer will work for 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.979
 those who want to check if the bug has 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.090
 well been carried you go to 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.310
 the airport and see if there are any 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.350
 buggy mountains so I decided to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.350
 take a buggy cargo with a car 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 because you have to know that where you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 have not call your mechanic you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.799
 can talk about car this is 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.360
 really far so advise you to 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.310
 take 1 car bomb and go with your 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.750
 other bedroom roofing daley eye your 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.070
 friends it's more fun because if you're there 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.390
 go alone like a hillock 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.250
 not do it if you are alone 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.079
 like an asshole is useless we have 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.689
 been to three we managed to gather three 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.600
 quarters boboc gta v cooking plays on 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.829
 managed to go on the map years with 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.240
 the quarters or bug we saw a little trouble 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.380
 my arrival here so for those who 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.229
 want to see if the bug has worked open 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.450
 Normally towards and mountains bill 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.360
 mountains a little through 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.909
 say transparent like that you them 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 will see bugge so if you see on 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.729
 this long and successful and if you see 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.860
 not that you leave you start again 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.570
 dismiss start I join the mission 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.189
 joined prologue and you expect 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.360
 capota invites you to actually 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.649
 be careful when you step in 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.299
 put your car in something 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.069
 invisible says you see that the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.509
 textures and are poorly made you can 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.160
 not put your feet on it for example 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.890
 the textures it's done well I managed 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.410
 to ask my opinion 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.540
 on it but follows the textures are bad 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.810
 do as one side there you can not 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.150
 put down your vehicle and you will fall 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.440
 in the void and you will fall into the water 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.400
 because below 7 3 and then to 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.080
 water and you will fall into the water and 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.530
 that it will be necessary to repay the mutual 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.209
 your car and to pay your 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.500
 car is recalled a boat for 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.300
 that they come to pick you up I you 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.459
 will explain in the end how to leave so 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.870
 we were four in arts did the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.200
 city ​​tour had to go not very 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.820
 great 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.620
 know that not very big and there 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.450
 does not really have activity a donkey to do 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.850
 after I do not know it maybe maybe 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.010
 later a dlc a map pack knows it 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.620
 not where it can be the continuity of 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.269
 solo so in this map there are several 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.769
 things 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.300
 there is the key extraterrestrial under the bridge 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.390
 ice cream if you see what I want 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.390
 say 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.709
 the alien who the little thing 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.110
 secret there under the ice but who is on 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.850
 the ice below a point and there is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.290
 the bank that you have break at the beginning 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.180
 so to go there it's very difficult 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.610
 you have to make a little bug with the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.660
 phone mission all that it will take you 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.280
 just 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 if you die you reappear at a 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.000
 side is not very serious to die of which 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.930
 you can commit suicide but do 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.150
 be careful not to fall into the holes 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.079
 blacks that I said otherwise you did not 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.610
 more car and you 're in the water 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.049
 like a con and you know what to do 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.340
 so we can go to the bank of the 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.720
 early the cause is the mission you 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.980
 did in the beginning for those who want 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.329
 go a little further thanks but in 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.730
 the corner to pick up the phone using 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.079
 in activity and the launch a mission is 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.360
 small and the mission could be 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.510
 the other side also in you lived allies 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.019
 in the little hangar you were out 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.690
 my call 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.549
 that's why they did the mission 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.510
 is also the cemetery where brad is dead 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.790
 for what they did the kind 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.930
 dentist at the end of the game where you trevor 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.630
 go into the cemetery dig to see 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.980
 his little one was still there or not 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.150
 we do at the end of the game but do not go 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.040
 not in the hole otherwise you will fall and 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.329
 then you will fall into the water then sadr 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.739
 remembered is neither for you 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.360
 recover your car or plane or 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.489
 echo all that we did 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.930
 many cons at once I 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.750
 advise you to take two cars 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.269
 Powerful enough like the titi and xfx 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.900
 not how much there and there at an hour because 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.700
 if you take a car 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.680
 a car not very fast you'll be 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.150
 not bad stuck in the east in the snow 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.400
 all that that patinates really enough 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.780
 well done I think it was thought 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.950
 still because it's not for 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.740
 nothing will be used later in the game 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.730
 so then for to leave from the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.070
 mark because you argue between 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.410
 in a map one is blocked must know 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.300
 that you call the merriweather full 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.000
 and you ask for a pickup in 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.470
 boat so it costs 250 euros I do not 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.760
 do not know how much market does not unlock 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.590
 and you jump into the void 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.510
 you will fall into the water you will not have 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.500
 not to worry you and you call 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.090
 a boat and a onlooker that I have to come 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.730
 pick you up and who will you come 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.280
 regain your footing after you do not roll 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.160
 up to life and then you are 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.590
 well near the city quietly 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.520
 you go back to your normal activities 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.990
 I just advise you to kill the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.610
 driver for rick perry boat because 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.110
 that if not this one takes you and that's it 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.580
 these helmets yes I prefer to ride so 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.890
 I goals and then I took my friends 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.840
 and we have been living so I hope that 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.360
 it's little tutorial will have helped you to 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.520
 go in the amap snowy north newton 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.680

 green thumb if he did not want to leave a 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.770
