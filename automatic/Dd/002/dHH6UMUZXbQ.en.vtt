it<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.469> clicks<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> know<00:00:41.610> done<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it like clicks in so you know done it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.779 
it like clicks in so you know done it
ties<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.629> meant<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.579> more<00:00:44.579> like

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
ties you're meant to do it so more like

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.850 
ties you're meant to do it so more like
you<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> makes<00:00:46.050> sense<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you do that if that makes sense so you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
you do that if that makes sense so you
don't<00:00:47.010> dry<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.360> about

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
don't dry out that's what I like about

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.520 
don't dry out that's what I like about
that<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> brush<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> comb

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that and then the brush is just a comb

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.880 
that and then the brush is just a comb
plastic<00:00:53.190> brush<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.379> has<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> two

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
plastic brush and and it has the two

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:08.780 
plastic brush and and it has the two
butterfly<00:00:56.460> effect<00:00:57.030> pieces<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.809> there<00:01:07.790> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
butterfly effect pieces on there and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.870 
butterfly effect pieces on there and
then<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.010> separate<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
then you separate them with the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
then you separate them with the
butterfly<00:01:12.330> bit<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.600> helped<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> helps

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
butterfly bit I helped think that helps

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.820 
butterfly bit I helped think that helps
deafness<00:01:13.979> separate<00:01:14.520> them<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.619> really<00:01:16.619> does

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
deafness separate them and really does

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.330 
deafness separate them and really does
and<00:01:17.759> why<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.979> do

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and why don't we do that I do this I do

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
and why don't we do that I do this I do
this<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.320> they're

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
this and then go back so when they're

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
this and then go back so when they're
trying<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.890> dry<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:23.850> on

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
trying to be dry and then put it more on

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.460 
trying to be dry and then put it more on
and<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> better<00:01:25.049> look<00:01:27.320> but<00:01:28.320> yeah

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and then you get a better look but yeah

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
and then you get a better look but yeah
