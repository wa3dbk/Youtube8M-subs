is<00:00:12.320> Rosewood<00:00:14.290> pick<00:00:15.290> pick<00:00:16.219> guard<00:00:16.429> bridge

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
is Rosewood pick pick guard bridge

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.499 
is Rosewood pick pick guard bridge
fretboard<00:00:18.830> even<00:00:19.759> up<00:00:19.849> here<00:00:19.880> at<00:00:20.179> the<00:00:20.300> headstock

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
fretboard even up here at the headstock

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.290 
fretboard even up here at the headstock
I<00:00:20.839> guess<00:00:21.289> it's<00:00:21.499> kind<00:00:21.919> of<00:00:21.980> rosewood<00:00:22.460> rosewood

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
I guess it's kind of rosewood rosewood

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.970 
I guess it's kind of rosewood rosewood
down<00:00:23.480> here<00:00:23.779> but<00:00:24.439> it's<00:00:24.619> also<00:00:24.829> now<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:26.980> laminated

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
down here but it's also now a laminated

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.599 
down here but it's also now a laminated
top<00:00:28.249> press<00:00:29.210> top<00:00:29.569> sides<00:00:30.229> and<00:00:30.470> back<00:00:30.649> it<00:00:31.159> doesn't

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
top press top sides and back it doesn't

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.490 
top press top sides and back it doesn't
have<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:32.060> flame<00:00:32.620> of<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:33.680> back<00:00:34.190> there<00:00:35.410> so<00:00:36.410> you

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
have the flame of the back there so you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.880 
have the flame of the back there so you
can<00:00:36.680> see<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:37.240> it's<00:00:38.240> not<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.450> flam<00:00:38.870> flamed<00:00:39.530> out

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
can see that it's not a flam flamed out

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:51.390 
can see that it's not a flam flamed out
laminate<00:00:40.520> maple<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:42.340> it's<00:00:43.340> pretty<00:00:43.640> much<00:00:49.690> I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
laminate maple so it's pretty much I

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.440 
laminate maple so it's pretty much I
think<00:00:52.400> it's<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.700> little<00:00:52.970> brighter<00:00:58.450> it

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
think it's a little brighter it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.920 
think it's a little brighter it
definitely<00:00:59.930> has<00:01:00.110> its<00:01:00.140> own<00:01:00.530> voice<00:01:01.840> compared<00:01:02.840> to

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
definitely has its own voice compared to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.790 
definitely has its own voice compared to
the<00:01:03.079> 503

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
the 503

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.190 
the 503
I<00:01:04.250> like<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.850> shimmer<00:01:05.119> move<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.750> little<00:01:05.990> bit

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
I like the shimmer move a little bit

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.350 
I like the shimmer move a little bit
more<00:01:06.470> 5:03<00:01:08.979> but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
more 5:03 but

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:38.630 
more 5:03 but
alright<00:01:11.260> that's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 

real<00:01:39.210> nice<00:01:39.450> sounding<00:01:39.930> guitar<00:01:40.280> all<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
real nice sounding guitar all the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
real nice sounding guitar all the
dimensions<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.180> everything<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.020> same

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
just like the the 503 it's just a little

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.310 
just like the the 503 it's just a little
difference<00:01:49.830> in<00:01:49.980> Sal<00:01:50.690> Fiona<00:01:51.690> is<00:01:51.930> pretty<00:01:52.140> much
