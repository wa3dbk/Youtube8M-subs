00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.120
 short technology like video and that goes 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.030
 it's about various cases for your ipad 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.030
 I do not care about major ipad version 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.280
 and what the scratch what 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 Resistance affects both the display as well 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.460
 from the back I have in my 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 time maybe here and there you scratch 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.310
 and in which even a bump in the corner 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.830
 but I knew where from 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.359
 but that comes in the normal in the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.550
 normal use see the things too 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.199
 after years still reasonable with me 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 that's why I usually wear it that way 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.090
 But there are enough people around me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.820
 then also the smart cover smart cases 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 and keyboard things and i pick up 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.940
 I thought I have a brief here now 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.050
 heap with me at the same time at home to 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.930
 fly then maybe worth it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.399
 so a short video, a smartCase have 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 Unfortunately, I do not think of apple 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.559
 for well I'd say cheese so much 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 how the back is protected needs 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.170
 Not really where I use that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.300
 it is clear with the smart cover 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.210
 less of the screen protector even if that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.489
 but much more important in the case of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.340
 set up to watch a video 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.450
 or even when tapping on the ipad of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.890
 tap play on screen 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.930
 I have to say that here are the ones 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 two variants of this polycarbonate of 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.820
 apple and the lega variant the apple 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.740
 for a pig from made must 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.750
 you really say so what that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.530
 dinger apple cost and what apple 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.970
 for that it demands that I want the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.409
 I do not really want a profit margin 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.640
 know the profit margin but it is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.009
 of course, a whole corner more 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 I have to say for years now, too 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.810
 with different leather cases whether it is red 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.430
 whether she is the black version is the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.159
 songs cover are really a tick 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.630
 fancier but so I'm there 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.189
 really pleased that the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 extra charge then to the polycarbonate 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.390
 things are not really there 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.680
 if you take those things every two three 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 weeks makes even clean then see them 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.549
 even after years still reasonable 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 of course this is due to 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.479
 also the light gray out a bit 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.340
 forgive so what do I want with it 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.929
 the smart cover for say for it 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.239
 then pack to the wrap and to the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.430
 to look or to wind and then 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.719
 I think it's alright for typing 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.540
 they have their authority 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.219
 where I bing the mine bigler after 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.959
 that folds inside will be true 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.659
 a whole corner unstable while standing 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.090
 but I have that except the outside 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.469
 outside and does not suck me out of here 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.969
 fabric with full and packs on the 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.530
 Dirty fabric on the display and have 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.319
 then here on the grooves without end 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.389
 you just have to look at the leather 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.680
 cover, I do not tell you anything 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:44.450
 There's another thing that's exactly the same 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.239
 what exactly is just yes yes this 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.780
 year so the same principle I have to 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.510
 not say 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.709
 If that's enough, I think that's good 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.780
 then the things if you the whole 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.730
 works and then with it a few sentences 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.739
 writes that works great 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.540
 So then when I got the things that 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.319
 pack things on the table and then there 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.669
 zooms is okay but it fits in the entertainment 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.409
 You certainly will not be more than five 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.959
 Then you get sentences after that 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.389
 yes or it or you get used to it 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.099
 really, I already have people 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.540
 really blatant with this keyboard 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.090
 it only with the thumb or both 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.159
 Seeing it together so it's all 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.409
 a thing of getting used to is there a lot 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.060
 possible 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.019
 and then there are those who but who 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.310
 the frequent tipper does not lead to this 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.319
 these diverse so keyboard cases 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.909
 So you have it in the end 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.269
 is just in smart case here as a cover 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.590
 should also take the magnet side 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.689
 so in smart cache now you can do it 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.790
 do not want but has a keyboard 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.709
 in there and usually then any such 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.689
 rail where you wrap the thing then 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.819
 then there's the things one more thing 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.739
 number bigger and then with 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.689
 backside protection where to find the thing 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.819
 then completely packed and then 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:02.180
 the backside compact is your ipad 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.919
 then it is completely protected as it separates 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.169
 but now also the chaff from 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.819
 wheat less at the cave less 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.799
 the processing of the weight but there 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.560
 where you have to look then is just at 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.569
 Tap how well you can tap on it 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.630
 and we just in Germany with 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.340
 our additional buttons on the side 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.570
 need a bit more space and 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.230
 You can already see logitech here 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.000
 that is smaller 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.770
 obtain and especially if you then 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.260
 cheap at any online china 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.940
 Shippers have ordered then 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.690
 mostly with qwerty keyboard, a 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.980
 English keyboard layout where then stop 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.480
 absence 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.130
 and of course they have other things too 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.490
 keyboard layout normally there are 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.560
 as here keys in addition but there are 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.480
 enough china manufacturers let that go 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.440
 they simply click away or grab the 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.210
 on another side 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.500
 this has the problem for us 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.240
 Of course prompt if you only English 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.100
 Keyboard takes in the iPad German poses 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.140
 and then the button presses then would be 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.720
 the same as when you practice or when 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.390
 you then rather in or close that fits but 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.530
 you get inner problem if this 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.090
 then touch me there you have to 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.220
 lead for the umlaut stop either 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.750
 the ipad to the umlaut ast so the 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.210
 Press letters and by hand 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.840
 select and that is not the point and 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.700
 purpose of the matter 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.590
 or you have it down here somewhere 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.640
 umlaut and get used to it blindly 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.830
 tap her life 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.450
 unless they just write with it 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.490
 then okay then you can do that 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.940
 get used to typing or you catch up 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.260
 to write once in ab and c and 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.660
 to rewrite the umlauts 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.520
 not so that as a tip 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.890
 is a warning then what then 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.660
 be careful blind writer no fear 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.400
 used to this keyboard layout 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.540
 Above all, what you use is the big one 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.640
 Special keys then he notices you then 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.450
 sometime the eight and nine the the 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.360
 are clinging 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.760
 you will notice sometime where the edi the 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.320
 At the moment, you can use more 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.610
 not really and otherwise you look 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.720
 But it is a matter 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.460
 there you can get used to it 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.390
 There you can also mature at low prices 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.940
 Of course I have the right one now 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:01.670
 high end products logitech cross back and forth 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:03.140
 belkin repkin ultimate but that should 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.030
 it really had to be 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.010
 It is also wonderful in my eyes 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.290
 I will not be without a cover 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.020
 problematic when I compare it with others 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.490
 then throw things in the bag where 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.400
 Hold something I never knew of one 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.110
 folder pins or something with a sharp tip 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.150
 It will also display on the one 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.920
 could scratch since then only began 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.010
 then you want for his ipad too 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.080
 Reasonably protect with a cover 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.340
 that goes with the apple cheese with the 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.110
 the apps with the apple cases 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.980
 friendly greeting at the apple was 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.720
 we have not seen each other for too long 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.470
 by the way 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.930
 right at the gamescom it does not matter 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.790
 of course, wonderful as it is also 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.930
 without end cheap cases for few euros 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.060
 You can do that where you can be easy 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.410
 ipad re- packed like sand by the sea me 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.790
 I'm not that fan of me now 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.740
 just do not raise or the slides 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.500
 I am a club where I am a big fan 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.150
 by bin are sharing these keypads when 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.980
 I know I take my ipad with me and 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.330
 not even a macbook and has to stop 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.790
 still write an article 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.140
 or really stop where I video 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.050
 description alone because they are yes 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.540
 even 67 lines long or sentences 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.690
 long and then and to type 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.280
 that's personal then I'm not like that 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.800
 the ipad always i think i guess then 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.210
 faster on may of these sentences that 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.400
 then sync over iCloud and 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.910
 put that in the ipad but only on the 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.470
 the edge 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.510
 So soon it is tapping I am 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:23.290
 Also a great friend of this one 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.700
 screen keyboard keyboard case is that 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.740
 I just wanted to say 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.100
 thanks for the video makes it good and 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.100
 Until next time
