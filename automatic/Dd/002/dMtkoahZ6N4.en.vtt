can do it all yourself
two<00:00:31.509> things<00:00:31.720> that<00:00:31.869> you'll<00:00:32.140> need<00:00:32.290> one<00:00:32.980> is<00:00:33.280> a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
two things that you'll need one is a

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.460 
two things that you'll need one is a
pressure<00:00:33.760> gauge<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.930> ones<00:00:35.140> we<00:00:35.290> have

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
pressure gauge the ones we have

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.670 
pressure gauge the ones we have
available<00:00:36.100> on<00:00:36.700> our<00:00:36.880> site<00:00:36.910> are<00:00:37.500> special<00:00:38.500> low

available on our site are special low
pressure<00:00:39.130> pressure<00:00:39.820> gauges<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:41.410> start<00:00:41.680> off

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
pressure pressure gauges they start off

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.790 
pressure pressure gauges they start off
with<00:00:41.800> one<00:00:42.130> PSI<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:42.790> go<00:00:42.910> 220<00:00:43.420> in<00:00:43.570> one<00:00:44.140> PSI

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
with one PSI and go 220 in one PSI

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.200 
with one PSI and go 220 in one PSI
increments<00:00:45.400> and<00:00:47.760> anybody<00:00:48.760> that<00:00:48.940> has<00:00:49.180> a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
increments and anybody that has a

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.600 
increments and anybody that has a
reverse<00:00:49.600> osmosis<00:00:49.780> system<00:00:50.260> needs<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:51.070> low

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
reverse osmosis system needs a low

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.610 
reverse osmosis system needs a low
pressure<00:00:51.880> pressure<00:00:52.270> gauge<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:53.170> next<00:00:53.470> thing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
pressure pressure gauge the next thing

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.940 
pressure pressure gauge the next thing
you'll<00:00:53.800> need<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.220> pump<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.870> we<00:00:56.020> use<00:00:56.290> are

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
you'll need is a pump what we use are

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.840 
you'll need is a pump what we use are
these<00:00:57.730> electric<00:00:58.570> pumps<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.580> you<00:01:00.580> can<00:01:00.700> get

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
these electric pumps that you can get

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.700 
these electric pumps that you can get
any<00:01:01.540> hardware<00:01:01.810> store<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.170> think<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.530> was

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
any hardware store I think this was

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.950 
any hardware store I think this was
about<00:01:02.890> 15<00:01:03.400> dollars<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.360> they're<00:01:04.689> not<00:01:04.780> that

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
about 15 dollars so they're not that

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.080 
about 15 dollars so they're not that
expensive<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.340> thing<00:01:06.520> that's<00:01:06.610> real<00:01:06.880> neat

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
expensive but the thing that's real neat

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.870 
expensive but the thing that's real neat
about<00:01:07.359> these<00:01:07.600> is<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:08.740> they<00:01:09.310> plug<00:01:09.549> into<00:01:09.729> your

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
about these is that they plug into your

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.669 
about these is that they plug into your
car<00:01:10.060> cigarette<00:01:10.359> lighter<00:01:10.810> or<00:01:10.899> power<00:01:11.229> outlet

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
car cigarette lighter or power outlet

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.679 
car cigarette lighter or power outlet
and<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.939> know<00:01:12.999> they<00:01:13.090> just<00:01:13.149> make<00:01:13.450> things

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
and you know they just make things

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.899 
and you know they just make things
really<00:01:14.049> simple<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.740> know<00:01:15.039> you<00:01:15.100> can<00:01:15.579> use<00:01:15.880> a

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
really simple you know you can use a

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.480 
really simple you know you can use a
bicycle<00:01:16.270> tire<00:01:16.749> to<00:01:17.049> do<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.439> you<00:01:18.369> know<00:01:18.460> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
bicycle tire to do this you know a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.139 
bicycle tire to do this you know a
bicycle<00:01:18.969> tire<00:01:19.090> pump<00:01:19.359> to<00:01:19.539> do<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:19.780> but<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:21.149> makes

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
bicycle tire pump to do it but it makes

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.550 
bicycle tire pump to do it but it makes
it<00:01:22.299> a<00:01:22.359> little<00:01:22.420> bit<00:01:22.630> tougher<00:01:22.869> but<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.319> is

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
it a little bit tougher but it is

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.980 
it a little bit tougher but it is
possible<00:01:24.069> now<00:01:24.969> let<00:01:25.210> me<00:01:25.299> explain<00:01:25.329> how<00:01:25.659> this

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
possible now let me explain how this

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.709 
possible now let me explain how this
tank<00:01:26.289> works<00:01:26.530> on<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:27.640> top<00:01:27.850> here<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.179> will<00:01:28.450> see

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
tank works on the top here you will see

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.419 
tank works on the top here you will see
a<00:01:28.960> water<00:01:29.770> valve<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.770> one<00:01:32.979> happens<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.340> be

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
a water valve and this one happens to be

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.940 
a water valve and this one happens to be
on<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.909> side<00:01:34.179> here<00:01:34.569> to<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.319> shutoff<00:01:35.590> valve

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
on the side here to the shutoff valve

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.550 
on the side here to the shutoff valve
for<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.159> system<00:01:36.609> for<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.659> water<00:01:37.899> some

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
for the system for the water some

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.620 
for the system for the water some
systems<00:01:39.039> have<00:01:39.249> the<00:01:39.429> water<00:01:39.670> valve<00:01:39.909> up<00:01:40.179> on<00:01:40.509> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
systems have the water valve up on the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.959 
systems have the water valve up on the
top<00:01:40.869> it<00:01:41.770> doesn't<00:01:42.039> matter<00:01:42.219> they<00:01:42.369> work<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.729> same

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
top it doesn't matter they work the same

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.529 
top it doesn't matter they work the same
way<00:01:42.999> now<00:01:43.990> at<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.289> bottom<00:01:44.649> of<00:01:44.799> this<00:01:44.889> tank<00:01:45.539> you

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
way now at the bottom of this tank you

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.050 
way now at the bottom of this tank you
have<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.929> air<00:01:47.709> valve<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.579> one<00:01:48.759> happens<00:01:48.999> to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
have the air valve this one happens to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.929 
have the air valve this one happens to
be<00:01:49.119> right<00:01:49.299> here<00:01:49.479> on<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.689> side<00:01:49.899> once<00:01:50.229> again

be right here on the side once again
some<00:01:51.939> some<00:01:52.359> of<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.569> tanks<00:01:53.139> you<00:01:53.799> will<00:01:53.950> find

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
some some of this tanks you will find

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.550 
some some of this tanks you will find
this<00:01:54.670> located<00:01:55.209> right<00:01:55.479> at<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.780> very<00:01:55.810> center<00:01:56.049> at

valve
you<00:02:06.850> know

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
you know

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.380 
you know
nothing<00:02:07.840> different<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.670> tank<00:02:09.910> what<00:02:10.240> you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
nothing different in the tank what you

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.800 
nothing different in the tank what you
have<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.950> between<00:02:12.459> these<00:02:12.880> two<00:02:13.180> compartments

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
have in between these two compartments

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.920 
have in between these two compartments
is<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.959> rubber<00:02:14.319> bladder<00:02:14.590> separating<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.459> water

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
is a rubber bladder separating the water

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.260 
is a rubber bladder separating the water
from<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> air<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.680> how<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.610> works<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:19.090> that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
from the air and how this works is that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.960 
from the air and how this works is that
as<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.959> water<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.920> being<00:02:21.190> processed<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.850> it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
as the water is being processed that it

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.820 
as the water is being processed that it
enters<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.420> tank<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.930> pressed<00:02:23.290> against<00:02:23.739> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
enters the tank is pressed against the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.460 
enters the tank is pressed against the
bladder<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.510> pushes<00:02:25.510> against<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> air<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
bladder and pushes against the air and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.340 
bladder and pushes against the air and
then<00:02:27.370> when<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.670> open<00:02:27.700> your<00:02:28.090> faucet<00:02:28.630> what

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
then when you open your faucet what

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.110 
then when you open your faucet what
happens<00:02:29.770> it's<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.459> air<00:02:30.700> pressure<00:02:31.000> that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
happens it's this air pressure that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.750 
happens it's this air pressure that
pushes<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.720> water<00:02:31.900> out<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.500> tank<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.010> out

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
pushes the water out of the tank and out

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.510 
pushes the water out of the tank and out
your<00:02:34.000> faucet<00:02:34.420> now<00:02:34.540> obviously<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:36.310> take

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
your faucet now obviously if you take

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.490 
your faucet now obviously if you take
his<00:02:36.700> loss<00:02:36.880> at<00:02:37.090> air<00:02:37.239> pressure<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:38.140> water<00:02:38.380> is

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
his loss at air pressure the water is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.440 
his loss at air pressure the water is
not<00:02:38.620> going<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.830> come<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.310> tank<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.790> so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
not going to come out of the tank and so

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.750 
not going to come out of the tank and so
what<00:02:41.170> we're<00:02:41.260> going<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.410> explain<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.220> exactly

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
what we're going to explain is exactly

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.430 
what we're going to explain is exactly
how<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.450> only<00:02:43.600> take<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.019> should

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
how to do it and only take it should

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.650 
how to do it and only take it should
take<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.739> about<00:02:44.769> five<00:02:45.130> ten<00:02:45.400> minutes<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:46.510> you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
take you about five ten minutes what you

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.810 
take you about five ten minutes what you
want<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.930> do<00:02:47.050> first<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.560> shut<00:02:48.250> off<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.610> water

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
want to do first is shut off the water

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.309 
want to do first is shut off the water
to<00:02:48.940> your<00:02:49.269> system<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.610> shut<00:02:51.610> off<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.810> valve<00:02:53.080> to

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
to your system and shut off the valve to

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.770 
to your system and shut off the valve to
the<00:02:53.440> holding<00:02:53.769> tank<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.700> open<00:02:55.420> your<00:02:55.450> water

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the holding tank then open your water

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.630 
the holding tank then open your water
faucet<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.470> relieve<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.890> pressure<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.310> then

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
faucet to relieve the pressure and then

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.790 
faucet to relieve the pressure and then
remove<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.120> tank<00:02:58.360> from<00:02:58.480> under<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> sink<00:02:59.080> it's

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
remove the tank from under the sink it's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.400 
remove the tank from under the sink it's
a<00:02:59.950> lot<00:03:00.100> easier<00:03:00.519> with<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.850> tank<00:03:01.120> out<00:03:01.630> up<00:03:02.050> where

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
a lot easier with the tank out up where

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.220 
a lot easier with the tank out up where
you<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.709> work<00:03:03.400> on<00:03:03.580> it<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.940> try<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.230> service

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
you can work on it and try to service

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.100 
you can work on it and try to service
this<00:03:05.410> thing<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:06.040> under<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.959> cramped<00:03:07.959> kitchen

of<00:03:16.450> there<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:16.870> some<00:03:17.049> systems<00:03:17.290> out<00:03:17.650> there<00:03:17.890> that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
of there are some systems out there that

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.590 
of there are some systems out there that
do<00:03:18.190> not<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.579> shutoff<00:03:19.000> valve<00:03:19.269> for<00:03:19.510> their

do not have a shutoff valve for their

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.550 
do not have a shutoff valve for their

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
tank and if that's yours I would highly

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.170 
tank and if that's yours I would highly
recommend<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.220> order<00:03:24.640> one<00:03:24.790> from<00:03:25.030> our

recommend that you order one from our
website<00:03:25.420> because<00:03:26.140> not<00:03:26.860> only<00:03:26.890> does<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.190> make

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
website because not only does it make

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.729 
website because not only does it make
servicing<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.360> tank<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.780> lot<00:03:28.930> easier<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
servicing the tank a lot easier and

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.800 
servicing the tank a lot easier and
simpler<00:03:30.130> but<00:03:30.519> it'll<00:03:31.269> help<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.570> to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
simpler but it'll help you to

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.569 
simpler but it'll help you to
troubleshoot<00:03:32.440> other<00:03:32.680> areas<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.340> may<00:03:33.519> be

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
troubleshoot other areas that may be

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.090 
troubleshoot other areas that may be
going<00:03:33.820> on<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:34.239> your<00:03:34.390> system<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.049> so<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.859> you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
going on with your system and so if you

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.190 
going on with your system and so if you
don't<00:03:36.310> have<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.489> shut<00:03:36.700> off<00:03:36.730> valve<00:03:36.850> get<00:03:37.329> one<00:03:37.480> but

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
don't have a shut off valve get one but

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.729 
don't have a shut off valve get one but
anyway<00:03:39.540> once<00:03:40.540> your<00:03:40.660> tank<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:40.989> out<00:03:41.140> open<00:03:41.680> the

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
anyway once your tank is out open the

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.099 
anyway once your tank is out open the
water<00:03:41.950> valve<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.430> let<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.850> water<00:03:43.109> start

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
water valve and let the water start

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.890 
water valve and let the water start
draining<00:03:44.380> because<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.250> properly

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
draining because to properly

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.420 
draining because to properly
repressurize<00:03:46.900> your<00:03:47.109> tank<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.650> tank<00:03:47.980> needs<00:03:48.220> to

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
repressurize your tank the tank needs to

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.870 
repressurize your tank the tank needs to
be<00:03:48.579> completely<00:03:49.060> empty<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.510> water<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.459> open

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
be completely empty of water and so open

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.160 
be completely empty of water and so open
the<00:03:51.940> valve<00:03:52.120> let<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:52.510> water<00:03:52.720> out<00:03:52.840> now

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
the valve let the water out now

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.130 
the valve let the water out now
obviously<00:03:53.799> if<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:55.209> tank<00:03:55.480> has<00:03:55.600> lost<00:03:55.810> its<00:03:55.989> air

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
obviously if the tank has lost its air

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.660 
obviously if the tank has lost its air
pressure<00:03:56.410> not<00:03:56.769> all<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.130> water<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.489> going<00:03:57.579> to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
pressure not all the water is going to

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.699 
pressure not all the water is going to
come<00:03:57.880> out<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:58.540> what<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.870> do<00:03:59.109> is<00:03:59.320> just

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
come out of it so what you do is just

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.400 
come out of it so what you do is just
take<00:04:00.100> your<00:04:00.160> pump<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.780> hook<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.930> up<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
take your pump and hook it up to the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.240 
take your pump and hook it up to the
tank<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.810> start<00:04:04.810> pumping<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.230> air<00:04:05.440> pumping

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
tank and start pumping the air pumping

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.599 
tank and start pumping the air pumping
air<00:04:06.459> into<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.970> as<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.900> do<00:04:08.049> this<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:09.160> water<00:04:09.430> is

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
air into it as you do this the water is

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.370 
air into it as you do this the water is
going<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.820> drain<00:04:09.880> from<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.329> tank<00:04:10.660> then<00:04:11.290> you

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
going to drain from the tank then you

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.590 
going to drain from the tank then you
want<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.650> keep<00:04:11.829> adding<00:04:12.070> air<00:04:12.600> continually

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
want to keep adding air continually

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.770 
want to keep adding air continually
until<00:04:14.530> all<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.550> water<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:16.060> drained<00:04:16.570> from<00:04:16.690> the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
until all the water is drained from the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.379 
until all the water is drained from the
tank

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
tank

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.559 
tank
and<00:04:17.479> it's<00:04:17.629> light<00:04:17.959> easy<00:04:18.409> to<00:04:18.650> lift<00:04:19.209> once<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.359> got

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:20.569 
and it's light easy to lift once you got

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.909 
and it's light easy to lift once you got
reached<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:21.019> point<00:04:21.490> keep<00:04:22.490> adding<00:04:22.939> air<00:04:23.919> until

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
reached that point keep adding air until

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.320 
reached that point keep adding air until
you<00:04:25.039> get<00:04:25.189> to<00:04:25.340> seven<00:04:25.699> pounds<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.180> air<00:04:26.300> pressure

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
you get to seven pounds of air pressure

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.800 
you get to seven pounds of air pressure
and<00:04:26.930> that's<00:04:27.650> why<00:04:27.889> you<00:04:28.370> need<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.550> gauge<00:04:28.909> special

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
and that's why you need to gauge special

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.239 
and that's why you need to gauge special
low<00:04:29.930> pressure<00:04:30.199> gauge<00:04:30.499> that<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.830> can<00:04:31.039> read

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.249 
low pressure gauge that you can read

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.390 
low pressure gauge that you can read
seven<00:04:31.759> pounds<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.150> air<00:04:32.270> pressure<00:04:33.189> just<00:04:34.189> keep

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
seven pounds of air pressure just keep

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.399 
seven pounds of air pressure just keep
adding<00:04:34.580> air<00:04:35.800> when<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:36.889> get<00:04:37.009> to<00:04:37.069> seven<00:04:37.370> pounds

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
adding air when you get to seven pounds

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.330 
adding air when you get to seven pounds
stop<00:04:39.409> put<00:04:40.219> the<00:04:40.340> cap<00:04:40.520> back<00:04:40.550> on<00:04:40.969> the<00:04:40.999> air<00:04:41.240> valve

stop put the cap back on the air valve

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.439 
stop put the cap back on the air valve
then<00:04:43.340> all<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.639> need<00:04:43.669> to<00:04:43.909> do<00:04:44.060> is<00:04:46.090> put<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.210> tank

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
then all you need to do is put the tank

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.450 
then all you need to do is put the tank
back<00:04:47.509> under<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> sink<00:04:48.349> reconnect<00:04:49.159> the<00:04:49.279> water

have water come out of the air valve
that<00:05:11.839> means<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.229> bladder<00:05:12.500> in<00:05:12.770> between<00:05:13.159> is

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
that means the bladder in between is

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.570 
that means the bladder in between is
ruptured<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:14.029> you<00:05:14.539> need<00:05:14.719> to<00:05:14.870> get<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.020> new<00:05:15.229> tank

ruptured and you need to get a new tank
it's<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.729> rare<00:05:16.939> thing<00:05:16.969> but<00:05:17.389> it<00:05:17.479> does<00:05:17.689> happen<00:05:18.110> but

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
it's a rare thing but it does happen but

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.409 
it's a rare thing but it does happen but
that's<00:05:19.400> how<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.639> know<00:05:19.789> if<00:05:19.999> you<00:05:20.089> have<00:05:20.210> water

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
that's how you know if you have water

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.059 
that's how you know if you have water
coming<00:05:20.629> out<00:05:20.810> of<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.050> air<00:05:21.169> valve<00:05:21.409> or<00:05:21.620> area<00:05:21.919> that
