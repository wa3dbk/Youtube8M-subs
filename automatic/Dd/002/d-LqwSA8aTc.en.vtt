bit lucky and this is a change that I've

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.010 
bit lucky and this is a change that I've
already<00:00:34.530> made<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.130> switched<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.210> j<00:00:36.450> dams<00:00:36.690> after

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
already made I switched to j dams after

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110 
already made I switched to j dams after
this<00:00:37.140> round<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> i<00:00:37.739> had<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> lot<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.550> fun<00:00:38.940> with

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this round and i had a lot of fun with

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
this round and i had a lot of fun with
those<00:00:39.239> bad<00:00:39.480> boys<00:00:39.510> including<00:00:40.010> killing<00:00:41.010> two

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
those bad boys including killing two

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.709 
those bad boys including killing two
different<00:00:41.670> bomb<00:00:41.879> centers<00:00:42.329> while<00:00:42.540> playing

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
different bomb centers while playing

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
different bomb centers while playing
obliteration<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> pretty<00:00:44.700> good

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
obliteration that was a pretty good

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
obliteration that was a pretty good
feeling<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.809> clutch<00:00:46.079> moment<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.649> it's

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
feeling and a clutch moment because it's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.639 
feeling and a clutch moment because it's
really<00:00:47.039> hard<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.940> help<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.239> other<00:00:48.510> than

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
really hard to help out other than

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
really hard to help out other than
vehicles<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> attack<00:00:50.879> jet

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
vehicles when you're in the attack jet

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
vehicles when you're in the attack jet
so<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> nice<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.410> run<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.800> i<00:00:52.860> had

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
so this is a nice little run that i had

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
so this is a nice little run that i had
playing<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:53.550> obliteration<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
playing some obliteration on one of the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
playing some obliteration on one of the
naval<00:00:55.530> strike<00:00:55.739> maps<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> trying<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> keep<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
naval strike maps and trying to keep the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540 
naval strike maps and trying to keep the
air<00:00:57.180> down<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.410> team<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.920> dominate<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
air down so my team can dominate the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
air down so my team can dominate the
ground<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.449> worst<00:01:00.870> thing<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> world<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
ground the worst thing in the world is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.439 
ground the worst thing in the world is
something<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.489> used<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> call<00:01:02.879> air<00:01:03.149> rape

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
something that we used to call air rape

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.870 
something that we used to call air rape
in<00:01:03.629> battlefield<00:01:04.110> 3<00:01:04.170> where<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> Jets<00:01:05.339> were<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
in battlefield 3 where the Jets were the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.210 
in battlefield 3 where the Jets were the
powerful<00:01:06.570> thing<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> server<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:08.070> they

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
powerful thing in the server and if they

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
powerful thing in the server and if they
had<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> good<00:01:08.670> jet<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.600> means<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.900> could

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
had a good jet that means they could

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
had a good jet that means they could
dominate<00:01:10.200> probably<00:01:10.710> both<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.250> jets<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
dominate probably both your jets and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.219 
dominate probably both your jets and
there<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> helicopter<00:01:12.210> could<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.810> free<00:01:13.049> now

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
there a helicopter could be free now

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.039 
there a helicopter could be free now
that's<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> ac-130<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.580> question<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.090> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that's the ac-130 my question is this is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
that's the ac-130 my question is this is
this<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> tweak<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:16.830> made<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> CTE<00:01:17.490> because

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this a tweak they made in CTE because

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.660 
this a tweak they made in CTE because
that's<00:01:18.509> not<00:01:18.720> even<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.110> full<00:01:19.470> strafe<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that's not even a full strafe on the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.340 
that's not even a full strafe on the
ac-130<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> can't<00:01:21.840> tell<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.049> how<00:01:22.140> many<00:01:22.200> times

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
ac-130 I can't tell you how many times

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
ac-130 I can't tell you how many times
have<00:01:22.619> been<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> ac-130<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.000> I've<00:01:24.150> been

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
have been the ac-130 and I've been

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
have been the ac-130 and I've been
double<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.780> triple<00:01:25.049> straight<00:01:25.259> by<00:01:25.439> attack

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
alive I highly doubt the pilots were

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.880 
alive I highly doubt the pilots were
that<00:01:30.240> bad<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.960> let's<00:01:31.110> talk<00:01:31.200> about<00:01:31.259> classic

seconds your health is still not going
to<00:02:20.490> regen<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.180> that's<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.690> good<00:02:21.840> moment<00:02:22.020> where

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
to regen and that's a good moment where

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.660 
to regen and that's a good moment where
I<00:02:22.350> could<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.680> used<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.010> J<00:02:23.190> dams<00:02:23.460> maybe

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
I could have used the J dams maybe

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.980 
I could have used the J dams maybe
pulled<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.120> little<00:02:24.330> bit<00:02:24.450> earlier<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.870> I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
pulled up a little bit earlier and I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.720 
pulled up a little bit earlier and I
can't<00:02:25.260> stress<00:02:25.470> how<00:02:25.770> much<00:02:26.160> fun<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.430> had<00:02:26.550> with

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
those little buggers because they could

certain multi kills with those things so

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.240 
certain multi kills with those things so
there<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.630> no<00:02:39.810> auto<00:02:40.020> regen<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.590> next<00:02:40.980> thing<00:02:41.160> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
there is no auto regen the next thing I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.300 
there is no auto regen the next thing I
love<00:02:41.490> about<00:02:41.750> classic<00:02:42.750> mode<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.170> there<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.650> no

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
love about classic mode is there is no

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.150 
love about classic mode is there is no
3d<00:02:44.700> spotting<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:46.380> brings<00:02:46.620> me<00:02:46.739> back<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.130> my

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
3d spotting which brings me back to my

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.979 
3d spotting which brings me back to my
competitive<00:02:47.790> roots<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.360> kind<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.630> morph

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
competitive roots which is kind of morph

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.229 
competitive roots which is kind of morph
of<00:02:49.200> classic<00:02:49.950> mode<00:02:50.160> there<00:02:50.580> was<00:02:50.820> no<00:02:51.000> health

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
of classic mode there was no health

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.050 
of classic mode there was no health
regen<00:02:51.690> there<00:02:51.900> was<00:02:52.230> friendly<00:02:52.770> fire<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.340> there

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
regen there was friendly fire and there

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.090 
regen there was friendly fire and there
was<00:02:54.300> no<00:02:54.480> 3d<00:02:54.780> spotting<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.620> still<00:02:55.890> had<00:02:56.070> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
was no 3d spotting but you still had the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
was no 3d spotting but you still had the
mini-map<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.820> therefore<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.270> still<00:02:57.510> pays<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
mini-map so therefore it still pays the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.810 
mini-map so therefore it still pays the
spot<00:02:58.380> try<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.860> alert<00:02:59.100> your<00:02:59.250> teammates<00:02:59.700> of

spot try to alert your teammates of
what's<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:01.110> other<00:03:01.230> thing<00:03:01.410> that's

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
what's going on the other thing that's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.470 
what's going on the other thing that's
different<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.920> there<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> base<00:03:02.730> 100<00:03:03.270> health

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
different is there is a base 100 health

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.300 
different is there is a base 100 health
and<00:03:03.660> classic<00:03:04.020> mode<00:03:04.200> which<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.560> really<00:03:05.010> like

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
and classic mode which I really like

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.650
