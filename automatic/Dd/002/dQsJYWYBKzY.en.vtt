00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 hi the quads today we're going 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.770
 learn 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.059
 I'm a flat tire so here to get 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.640
 break a small leak 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.710
 you still have to find it so I have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.180
 on inflated my tire 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.160
 I passed him in a big water tank and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.150
 I searched for my escape 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.100
 this step I already did I go when 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.720
 even you show it here is joined a 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:35.670
 we see little bones which finds 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.620
 so here is once you found 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.800
 your escape 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:47.600
 we 're just going to make the mark and we understand a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.600
 cloth we hear well where the cleans 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.559
 frozen 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.790
 and as she is very small 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.790
 to not lose it I put some white 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:07.320
 that's how I scored already 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 where it is and if indeed 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.110
 my tire falls but hey I know where 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 go here is the first operation the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.050
 second operation we will deflate the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.050
 tire then we go but shhh 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.109
 So here are so use a wick 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.439
 a rasp and pointed it to put the 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.939
 wick 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.649
 we understand Arabic so the hole is 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.119
 always there then the goal is to 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.670
 find lax input ie 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.539
 how your menu was pierced like that 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.459
 right across and so putting him 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.459
 you will see you will not see too much 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:46.250
 but now the bubble stops if you 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.950
 that's how we see it flees 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.209
 always like that too 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.140
 so the goal is to find the right place 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:58.610
 once we have the right axis in 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:05.090
 go back slowly we get in 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.259
 slowly we see that it starts to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.869
 go back since I always left 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.650
 under pressure the tire 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.480
 from there if we want from there 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.500
 on them 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.620
 we can bridge can start the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 deflate one little deflated tires or 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.840
 let it swell for phase 2 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 so we get the grater we rappe a small 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.299
 little and after we take them includes 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.299
 the pointed the wick 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.749
 for the rest nothing exceptional 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.889
 includes the wick the wick 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:40.370
 we put country mass on 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:43.340
 the pointed then we come either in the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.930
 center where one pushes one makes enter the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.840
 wick but inside we can claim 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.639
 fed in three cases we turn and we 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.639
 the euro comes under the referrals 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.750
 so that's what it gives you got in 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.560
 the eil we see the end of the wick 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.560
 the two ends of matches that they come out 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:15.450
 so we can go back again by turning 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:20.490
 gently you back is there 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.350
 turn, turn, turn, exit, at the same time 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.490
 at the same time the referrals 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:36.080
 she'll come all of a sudden gold the way bank 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:40.890
 and here it is to remove these but at 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:47.280
 so here's that wick the goal but what 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:49.620
 rest we let good collar so after 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.600
 there is the technique it is normally 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.030
 cut them to me what I do I the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.190
 couple has a little bit below 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.920
 history that it does not exceed the tire 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.260
 of history it does not exceed the crampon 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.520
 we can see it here I cut it a whole 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.970
 little bit below was I let the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.130
 bit of wick 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.690
 we do not care is a piece of her tits 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.570
 Rubber tip that exceeds it's not 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.000
 it's not very important 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.700
 once you did that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.480
 your tire and by logic repair so he 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.880
 you just have to put it under 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.070
 pressure you put at a bar a bar 5 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.740
 wanted to swing water and you check 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.670
 you make sure it does not take 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.440
 not water 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.820
 I want to do that in an hour 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.090
 will leave for the moment to put in 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.430
 square 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.630
 the coupe and within an hour a little 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.070
 pressure shot a cost from above and 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.020
 we look at whether his bubble or not if his 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.150
 bubble ben is not that good well 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.040
 operated and by logic it's at the pub 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.930
 bull and that's tires a tire repair my 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.200
 of repair to everyone and then the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.200
 next
