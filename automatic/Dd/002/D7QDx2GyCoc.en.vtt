tighten this down you want tighten it to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.410 
tighten this down you want tighten it to
13<00:04:01.870> Newton<00:04:02.230> meters<00:04:02.650> which<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:06.300> right<00:04:07.300> in

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
13 Newton meters which is right in

00:04:07.420 --> 00:05:03.390 
13 Newton meters which is right in
between<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:08.260> Shimano<00:04:08.920> recommended<00:04:09.640> 12

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:25.060 

so<00:05:04.400> that's<00:05:04.580> installed<00:05:16.270> calibrate<00:05:20.530> a<00:05:24.070> little

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
so that's installed calibrate a little

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:50.670 
so that's installed calibrate a little
pedal<00:05:25.280> back<00:05:25.430> on<00:05:41.169> there<00:05:42.169> we<00:05:42.260> go<00:05:42.380> all<00:05:42.620> installed

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.439 

so<00:05:50.800> once<00:05:50.949> you've<00:05:51.070> installed<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.789> stages

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
so once you've installed the stages

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.120 
so once you've installed the stages
power<00:05:52.660> meter<00:05:52.930> what<00:05:53.259> you<00:05:53.350> want<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.620> do<00:05:53.770> is

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
power meter what you want to do is

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.189 
power meter what you want to do is
calibrate<00:05:54.550> it<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.120> make<00:05:55.270> sure<00:05:55.300> it's<00:05:55.660> all<00:05:55.840> ready

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
calibrate it to make sure it's all ready

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.129 
calibrate it to make sure it's all ready
to<00:05:56.259> go<00:05:56.470> this<00:05:56.800> kind<00:05:57.039> of<00:05:57.130> zero<00:05:57.460> reset<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.990> I'm

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
to go this kind of zero reset so I'm

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:07.760 
to go this kind of zero reset so I'm
using<00:05:59.380> a<00:05:59.650> Garmin<00:06:00.310> Edge<00:06:02.729> 520

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.590 

that<00:06:08.770> that's<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:09.070> correct<00:06:09.190> bike<00:06:09.550> which<00:06:09.880> is<00:06:10.060> my

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
that that's the correct bike which is my

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.550 
that that's the correct bike which is my
pivot<00:06:11.020> less<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:13.690> then<00:06:14.080> we're<00:06:14.289> going<00:06:14.410> to<00:06:14.440> go

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
pivot less and then we're going to go

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.650 
pivot less and then we're going to go
down<00:06:14.680> to<00:06:14.740> amp<00:06:14.979> us<00:06:15.160> plower<00:06:15.460> but<00:06:16.060> to<00:06:16.240> make<00:06:16.419> sure

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
down to amp us plower but to make sure

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.860 
down to amp us plower but to make sure
that<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.220> the<00:06:18.220> actual<00:06:18.639> power<00:06:18.820> meter<00:06:19.120> is<00:06:19.270> on<00:06:19.449> we

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
that the the actual power meter is on we

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.670 
that the the actual power meter is on we
want<00:06:20.050> to<00:06:20.110> do<00:06:20.199> a<00:06:20.229> full<00:06:20.759> rotation<00:06:22.259> that<00:06:23.259> wakes<00:06:23.500> it

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
want to do a full rotation that wakes it

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.999 
want to do a full rotation that wakes it
up<00:06:23.770> and<00:06:24.520> then<00:06:24.729> you<00:06:24.849> want<00:06:25.030> to<00:06:25.090> be<00:06:25.270> straight<00:06:25.630> down

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
up and then you want to be straight down

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.270 
up and then you want to be straight down
so<00:06:27.009> it's<00:06:27.759> a<00:06:28.139> perpendicular<00:06:29.139> to<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.620> ground<00:06:29.800> go

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
so it's a perpendicular to the ground go

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.159 
so it's a perpendicular to the ground go
to<00:06:30.340> an<00:06:30.520> plus<00:06:30.699> power<00:06:33.840> we're<00:06:34.840> going<00:06:34.960> to<00:06:35.050> say

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
to an plus power we're going to say

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:45.020 
to an plus power we're going to say
power<00:06:35.470> meter<00:06:35.770> present<00:06:38.490> yes

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.430 

says<00:06:46.030> power<00:06:46.300> meter<00:06:46.509> detected<00:06:47.020> so<00:06:47.349> it

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
says power meter detected so it

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.490 
says power meter detected so it
automatically<00:06:47.889> found<00:06:48.129> it<00:06:48.900> then<00:06:49.900> we<00:06:50.050> just<00:06:50.259> go

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
automatically found it then we just go

00:06:50.500 --> 00:07:06.050 
automatically found it then we just go
down<00:06:51.419> to<00:06:52.419> calibrate

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.140 

we'll<00:07:06.600> give<00:07:06.780> it<00:07:06.810> a<00:07:06.900> second<00:07:07.320> here<00:07:07.650> and<00:07:10.970> then<00:07:11.970> you

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
we'll give it a second here and then you

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.300 
we'll give it a second here and then you
have<00:07:12.480> the<00:07:12.690> calibration<00:07:13.230> successful<00:07:13.740> so<00:07:14.130> we're

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
have the calibration successful so we're

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.760 
have the calibration successful so we're
all<00:07:14.430> set<00:07:14.580> to<00:07:14.730> go
