ski<00:03:30.599> this<00:03:31.599> is<00:03:31.660> meant<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.169> work<00:03:32.319> with<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:32.620> N<00:03:32.799> is

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
ski this is meant to work with this N is

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.849 
ski this is meant to work with this N is
plate<00:03:33.340> where<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.790> binding<00:03:34.209> actually<00:03:34.859> slides

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
plate where the binding actually slides

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.909 
plate where the binding actually slides
onto<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:37.239> track<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:39.000> locks<00:03:40.000> into<00:03:40.299> place<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
onto a track and locks into place and

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.170 
onto a track and locks into place and
the<00:03:41.919> nice<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.370> benefit<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:42.849> is<00:03:43.030> one

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
the nice the benefit of this is one

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.120 
the nice the benefit of this is one
you're<00:03:43.299> not<00:03:43.359> putting<00:03:43.540> holes<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.049> ski<00:03:44.290> you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
you're not putting holes in the ski you

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.330 
you're not putting holes in the ski you
get<00:03:45.370> really<00:03:45.790> good<00:03:46.319> contact<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.099> ski

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
get really good contact to the ski

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.210 
get really good contact to the ski
you're<00:03:48.849> connected<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.720> edges<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:50.349> it

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
you're connected on the edges so it

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.170 
you're connected on the edges so it
actually<00:03:51.370> does<00:03:51.609> give<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:51.849> little<00:03:51.940> more<00:03:52.060> edge

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
actually does give you little more edge

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.509 
actually does give you little more edge
pressure<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:53.049> can<00:03:53.169> actually<00:03:53.290> move<00:03:53.650> the

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
pressure and you can actually move the

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.789 
pressure and you can actually move the
balance<00:03:55.329> point<00:03:55.569> forward<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.169> backward<00:03:56.620> if

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
balance point forward and backward if

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.699 
balance point forward and backward if
that<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.639> your<00:03:57.760> thing<00:03:58.500> won't<00:03:59.500> get<00:03:59.590> too

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
that is your thing won't get too

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:00.990 
that is your thing won't get too
complicated<00:03:59.919> there<00:04:00.340> but<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.549> idea<00:04:00.819> is<00:04:00.880> you

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
complicated there but the idea is you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.099 
complicated there but the idea is you
can<00:04:01.150> actually<00:04:01.239> move<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.630> forward<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.049> back

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
can actually move it forward and back

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.479 
can actually move it forward and back
depending<00:04:02.680> on<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.799> snow<00:04:02.980> conditions<00:04:03.190> which

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
depending on the snow conditions which

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.339 
depending on the snow conditions which
actually<00:04:03.819> can<00:04:04.090> help<00:04:04.269> your<00:04:04.510> performance<00:04:04.750> and

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
actually can help your performance and

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.080 
actually can help your performance and
if<00:04:05.950> you're<00:04:06.069> training<00:04:06.370> ski<00:04:06.609> some<00:04:06.819> little<00:04:07.000> bit

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
if you're training ski some little bit

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.580 
if you're training ski some little bit
heavier<00:04:07.389> than<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.660> are<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.139> get<00:04:08.260> actually

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
heavier than you are you get actually

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.289 
heavier than you are you get actually
with<00:04:08.889> a<00:04:08.919> little<00:04:09.099> tool<00:04:09.250> slide<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.060> binding

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
with a little tool slide the binding

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.420 
with a little tool slide the binding
back<00:04:10.450> or<00:04:10.720> forward<00:04:10.959> ahead<00:04:11.500> or<00:04:11.889> behind<00:04:12.040> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
back or forward ahead or behind the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.979 
back or forward ahead or behind the
balance<00:04:12.730> point<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.030> ski<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.359> get<00:04:13.810> better

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
balance point of the ski and get better

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.969 
balance point of the ski and get better
performance<00:04:14.109> that's<00:04:14.919> the<00:04:15.069> idea<00:04:15.370> there<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.660> so

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
performance that's the idea there and so

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.969 
performance that's the idea there and so
any<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.340> these<00:04:18.519> skis<00:04:18.940> are<00:04:19.349> perfect<00:04:20.349> for<00:04:20.590> your

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
however being a pretty wide ski this is

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.120 
however being a pretty wide ski this is
kind<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:37.960> like<00:04:38.140> yeah<00:04:38.380> you're<00:04:38.710> thinking<00:04:39.040> of

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
kind of like yeah you're thinking of

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.130 
kind of like yeah you're thinking of
going<00:04:39.550> beyond<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.120> touring<00:04:40.390> Center<00:04:40.600> then<00:04:40.930> you

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
going beyond the touring Center then you

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.300 
going beyond the touring Center then you
would<00:04:41.230> certainly<00:04:41.560> want<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.860> benefit<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.250> that

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
would certainly want the benefit of that

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.550 
would certainly want the benefit of that
cuff<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:43.150> really<00:04:43.420> turn<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.990> wider<00:04:44.230> ski

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
cuff to really turn in that wider ski

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.160 
cuff to really turn in that wider ski
and<00:04:45.310> then<00:04:45.490> how<00:04:45.850> peanut<00:04:46.300> we<00:04:46.540> got<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.810> control

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
and then how peanut we got the control

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.870 
and then how peanut we got the control
and<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.620> sports<00:04:47.950> torque<00:04:48.280> which<00:04:48.580> are<00:04:48.730> both

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.330 
videos to get more behind the scenes of
these<00:04:55.570> guys<00:04:55.810> but<00:04:56.350> we're<00:04:56.620> talking<00:04:56.890> about<00:04:57.010> boots

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
these guys but we're talking about boots

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.580 
these guys but we're talking about boots
so<00:04:57.610> once<00:04:57.940> again<00:04:58.060> think<00:04:58.990> about<00:04:59.080> where<00:04:59.440> you're

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
so once again think about where you're

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.370 
so once again think about where you're
going<00:05:00.150> what<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.270> your<00:05:01.420> priority<00:05:01.660> well<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.080> would

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
going what is your priority well I would

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.600 
going what is your priority well I would
say<00:05:02.500> your<00:05:02.710> priority<00:05:03.070> is<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.310> warmest

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
say your priority is the warmest

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.120 
say your priority is the warmest
comfortable<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.600> feet<00:05:04.810> possible<00:05:05.470> so

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
comfortable is the feet possible so

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.930 
comfortable is the feet possible so
hopefully<00:05:06.760> this<00:05:06.910> will<00:05:07.030> help<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.360> out<00:05:07.650> and

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940
