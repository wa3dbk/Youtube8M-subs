很快便來到今天音樂會的尾聲

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.000
就是大合唱

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.200
事不宜遲，我們將時間交給全體表演的小朋友、家長

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.950
以及特別嘉賓林一峰

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.500
為我們唱出今晚的大合唱《You Raise Me Up》，有請

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.600
Woo ...

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.700
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.500
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.650
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.000
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.150
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:17.300
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.500
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.300
There is no life - no life without its hunger;

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.750
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.500
But when you come and I am filled with wonder,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.150
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.200
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.850
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.700
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.000
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.000
You raise me up …

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.000
(You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You raise me up …

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
(You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.300
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.600
You raise me up …

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.600
(You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;)

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.200
You raise me up …

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.200
(You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;)

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.650
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:47.000
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.400
