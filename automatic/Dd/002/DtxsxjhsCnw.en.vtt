love the fact that it gives color so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.889 
love the fact that it gives color so
that's<00:01:56.490> why<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:56.969> want<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> try<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.600> lip

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
gonna take this and I'm gonna put a lot

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:18.309 
gonna take this and I'm gonna put a lot
on<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:02.909> look<00:02:03.329> it

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.660 

and<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:19.129> I<00:02:19.159> had<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.400> my<00:02:19.489> bottom<00:02:19.760> lip<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.680> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
and so I had on my bottom lip so you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.819 
and so I had on my bottom lip so you
can't<00:02:23.030> see<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.599> as<00:02:23.750> good<00:02:24.019> as<00:02:24.109> in<00:02:24.230> person

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
can't see it as good as in person

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.250 
can't see it as good as in person
but<00:02:25.010> literally<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.969> changes<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.109> color

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
but literally it changes the color

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:38.610 
but literally it changes the color
really<00:02:34.689> not<00:02:35.689> a<00:02:35.720> single<00:02:36.079> thing<00:02:36.500> came<00:02:36.769> up<00:02:36.920> I

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
really not a single thing came up I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.940 
really not a single thing came up I
think<00:02:40.180> nothing<00:02:41.180> came<00:02:41.689> off<00:02:41.959> after<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> put<00:02:42.859> on

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
think nothing came off after I put on

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.229 
think nothing came off after I put on
the<00:02:43.099> lip<00:02:43.220> stain<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.549> I<00:02:43.579> usually<00:02:43.849> just<00:02:43.970> put<00:02:44.030> on

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
the lip stain and I usually just put on

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.569 
the lip stain and I usually just put on
some<00:02:44.420> chapstick<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.109> moisturize<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.430> can

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
some chapstick to moisturize and you can

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.770 
some chapstick to moisturize and you can
put<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.849> gloss<00:02:47.150> too

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
put on a gloss too

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.649 
put on a gloss too
I<00:02:47.810> liked<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.349> a<00:02:48.590> lot<00:02:48.859> this<00:02:49.819> specific<00:02:50.269> kind<00:02:50.480> it

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
I liked it a lot this specific kind it

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.569 
I liked it a lot this specific kind it
doesn't<00:02:50.840> last<00:02:51.079> me<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.379> full<00:02:51.680> entire<00:02:52.129> day<00:02:52.370> I

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
doesn't last me the full entire day I

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.729 
doesn't last me the full entire day I
would<00:02:53.030> probably<00:02:53.989> put<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.319> in<00:02:54.439> my<00:02:54.530> backpack

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
would probably put this in my backpack

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.949 
would probably put this in my backpack
and<00:02:55.250> reapply<00:02:55.609> it<00:02:55.670> but<00:02:55.939> I<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.150> I'm<00:02:56.629> too<00:02:56.810> lazy

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
and reapply it but I just I'm too lazy

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.800 
and reapply it but I just I'm too lazy
to<00:02:57.109> do<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.379> so<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:58.000> find<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.150> easy<00:02:59.329> to<00:02:59.540> take<00:02:59.629> off

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
to do that so I find it easy to take off

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.390 
to do that so I find it easy to take off
I<00:03:00.079> don't<00:03:00.139> really<00:03:00.439> even<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:01.040> take<00:03:01.189> it<00:03:01.280> off

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
I don't really even have to take it off

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.159 
I don't really even have to take it off
ever<00:03:01.609> because<00:03:02.000> it's<00:03:02.389> already<00:03:02.599> off<00:03:02.720> when<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.959> get

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
ever because it's already off when I get

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.099 
ever because it's already off when I get
home<00:03:03.319> from<00:03:03.349> school<00:03:03.560> um<00:03:04.359> but<00:03:05.359> I<00:03:05.389> feel<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:05.810> try
