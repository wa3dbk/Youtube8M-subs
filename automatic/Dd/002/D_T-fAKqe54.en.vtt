00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.459
 we return to the second part of the 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.650
 crazy theories of adventure time I want 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.630
 remind participants that only 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.750
 10 theories were chosen from among a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.580
 estimated of more than 200 comments 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.710
 some were good but those that enter 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.250
 in this top would be the best and most 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.529
 crazy theories so we start with the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.460
 latest and best theories of this top 10 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.460
 of crazy theories 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.480
 my theory many speculated that 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.100
 bonnie the betis and it turned out that it was not me 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 I thought this because the sweet princess 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.130
 he knows too much but he looks like something else 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.470
 an example the zombies their origins and 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.540
 how to create them the emergence of lychee 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.520
 his imprisonment also by the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.739
 security that you have in the sweet kingdom and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.900
 for all your battle strategies already 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.540
 that she knows what things can attack her 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.030
 the extreme use of technology and such 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.800
 time until the end story but since 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 we know it's not betty it takes me to 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.229
 think that she is human but she of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 some form or another has human DNA and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.580
 that he was able to find with the father of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 order since martín also tried 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.690
 defeat the lidge and resorted to sweet 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.610
 princess to help him create a 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.070
 weapon but something happened between the sweet 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.680
 princess and the end father and I do not know if 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.170
 I think related based on your DNA or if you could 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.300
 pregnant that is the least likely and by 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.570
 a carelessness they lost it or it was a plan 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.330
 of bonn and well that's my theory for 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.159
 please sponsor my channel and the new plan 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.159
 the clan of the knights 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.509
 generally it has always been thought 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.249
 bondi is human was human still so the 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.039
 Betty's theory was ruled out with the 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:55.840
 episode this changed many things in the 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.490
 series and destroyed many of the theories 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.590
 based on these facts 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.689
 even so your theory that bonnie met 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.700
 I defined the father that she could be a 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.700
 mutated human is very interesting 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.840
 my theory fin and fiona are brothers to the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.910
 that I saw and decided to send to dimensions 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.160
 parallel since the last wish of his 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.500
 mother at death was that they were 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.870
 saved and his father wanted to go but the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.450
 portal was unstable sending his dad 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.700
 to a different dimension the crystal 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.310
 and closing before it ended 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.860
 bill and seeing this he decided to take with 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.390
 joshua old biden companion arrived 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.640
 in order and to save them 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.500
 Billy and faked Joshua's death and he 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.500
 erased the memories of end and his family 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.519
 this story is very similar to that of 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.400
 star wars but it's also valid since 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.560
 as you think end has a sister the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.659
 which could be fiona so your theory 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.610
 it's good but I think in the end what 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.260
 you wanted to imply is that billy 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.420
 erased the end memories about his 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.620
 father and the death of his mother that's why he 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.620
 he was with joshua jake 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.100
 the origin of the ich el lecce is a being 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.440
 mythical that supposedly was created by the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.290
 bomb that ended terno exploded but 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.510
 I have my own theory the lic 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.330
 before being the current lidge he was 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.820
 human met hot sounded the air already 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.680
 simon pretty cof but for the war of 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.400
 the mushrooms caused many 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.650
 misfortunes 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.500
 hodson a vader became a 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.110
 demon simón pétrikov for the crown and 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.870
 the lic by mutation and hate I explain 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.760
 they three were investigating things 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.410
 about him in kiel and jon but jobson and 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.110
 Simon were the ones who took the 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.820
 leeds merit and was set aside so 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.460
 to take revenge he took radioactive liquid 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.680
 from the lab where betty worked and 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.140
 He decided to throw himself over to hotz in 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.140
 Simón was smart and fled with him in kill 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.420
 language the repentant lic created a 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.820
 poison substance of green color and what 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.220
 drank becoming the being that is 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.140
 currently because they believe that the king 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.180
 ice cream in the deadly episode was there not 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.580
 it seemed strange not to see Aldridge 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.680
 scared or nothing because Simon already knew that 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.300
 he had taken that substance and as the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.230
 ice king has still a little 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.230
 charisma of the past 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.569
 the origin of the ich is one of the theories 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.820
 most mentioned by terrorists you 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.440
 theory is very smoked but still 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.329
 has some parts that could 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.470
 match the true story of 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.570
 the creation of the lic 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.139
 in fact I would say that it has more bases than 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.120
 the theory of what is the end 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.740
 from here we will see the one that 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.349
 could consider as the most original 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.599
 crazy and the only mention of a character 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.639
 that many seem to have forgotten like this 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.379
 that without further analysis the theory that 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.330
 won the first place is one of my 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:44.819
 favorites and I would like to know your opinion 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.819
 about this theory and if it could be true 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.890
 life or past lives after xoco 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.230
 until end and the shock box or as 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.300
 we saw in the episode the trunk at the time 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.410
 of shock or was out there about 300 years 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.690
 from the actuality 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.150
 when dying show that some 50 passed 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.430
 years were born other past lives of end 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.060
 some could be humanoid and others 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.980
 animals 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.290
 well one of those lives could see the 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.660
 ghost of xoco since only the lives 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.790
 past finn could see her as well as 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.950
 end that person when he saw her painted 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.840
 in a box apparently that person 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.240
 she lived very lonely and she felt that yoko 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.610
 did company then began to have 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.740
 She cares for her when he saw her picture is 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.510
 I felt good since I saw her one day 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.820
 I needed food and I had no money 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.950
 Then he decided to sell the painting to Maya 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.310
 Maya knew that the painting had large 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.200
 feelings and I accept it then that 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.360
 would be the reason why you saw a 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.820
 picture of choco in the house of maya a 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.440
 last life of the end he painted it since only 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.440
 Choco's lives could see her 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.860
 of all the theories this was the 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.020
 more interesting and unique so I do not 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.419
 I would like you to think that it is mega 11 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.610
 he made a trap to win if they see the 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.699
 theory and they have criteria they will know that their 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.260
 theory is one of the best in this top 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.360
 now let's analyze some of it 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.520
 many focus on the most theories 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.800
 famous but this was fixed in a fact 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.780
 very few questioned the like 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.639
 maya was made with the painting is one of the 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.949
 things that are still unanswered 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.020
 some theories agree that yoko 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.789
 could be a family member of mesh that 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.370
 when it hit it came out of the debris 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.710
 radioactive someone who happened to saw her and 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.570
 he decided to immortalize it in a painting with 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.250
 this we can see that choco is a 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.740
 character little studied by the 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.930
 terrorists so friends I hope and they 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.020
 have liked this top 10 of theories 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.250
 more crazy but do not worry because 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.900
 there will be another very soon 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.729
 so start thinking about your 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.680
 theories and write them so that 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.720
