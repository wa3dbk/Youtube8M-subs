00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
definitely as a teenager when you're

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.800 
definitely as a teenager when you're
first<00:01:38.719> driving<00:01:39.140> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
first driving you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.950

you<00:01:39.899> do<00:01:40.409> feel<00:01:40.680> invincible<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.810> driving<00:01:42.810> can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you do feel invincible and driving can

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.510 
you do feel invincible and driving can
become<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> secondary<00:01:43.710> task<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.310> whatever

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
become a secondary task to whatever

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280

a<00:01:46.560> weapon<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.579> people<00:01:47.850> need<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
a weapon and I think that people need to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
a weapon and I think that people need to
realize<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.509> they're<00:01:49.439> operating<00:01:49.890> something

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
realize that they're operating something

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
realize that they're operating something
that<00:01:50.340> has<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> power<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.880> change<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.659> was

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
