00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
sure if they say there but I ok so us a

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.969 
sure if they say there but I ok so us a
low<00:01:19.049> kicks<00:01:20.869> there's<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.530> compared<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
low kicks there's that compared to a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.850 
low kicks there's that compared to a
tech<00:01:23.189> deck<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.509> mellower<00:01:25.790> I

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
tech deck a little bit mellower I

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.950 
tech deck a little bit mellower I
believe<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.890> he<00:01:29.400> used<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.909> mold<00:01:30.420> once<00:01:30.689> on

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
believe that he used this mold once on

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.130 
believe that he used this mold once on
this<00:01:31.200> step<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:32.750> some<00:01:33.750> reason<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.110> not

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
this step and then some reason I'm not

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.149 
this step and then some reason I'm not
sure<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> was<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.740> purpose<00:01:34.920> or

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
sure if it was on purpose or

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.060 
sure if it was on purpose or
accidentally<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.020> he<00:01:37.020> destroyed<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.860> mold

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
accidentally but he destroyed the mold

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
accidentally but he destroyed the mold
so<00:01:39.979> but<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> order<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.030> won't<00:01:42.119> be
