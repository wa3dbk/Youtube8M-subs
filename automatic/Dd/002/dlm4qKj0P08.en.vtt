response my favorite thing about this is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.589 
response my favorite thing about this is
actually<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:29.910> running<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.269> an<00:00:30.390> open

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
actually that it's running on an open

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
actually that it's running on an open
API<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.439> anyone<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.920> actually<00:00:32.219> access<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
API so anyone can actually access this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.090 
API so anyone can actually access this
data<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.390> any<00:00:33.570> time<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.530> even<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.860> stuff

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
data at any time they even have stuff

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.889

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.780 
which is kind of actually cool also it
has<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> release<00:01:34.320> date<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.590> August<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.670> if

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
has a release date of August so if

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.920 
has a release date of August so if
you're<00:01:35.909> looking<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.509> pick<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> up

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you're looking for it you can pick it up

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.690 
you're looking for it you can pick it up
then<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> they're<00:01:38.009> still<00:01:38.220> working<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> few

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
then and they're still working out a few

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
then and they're still working out a few
different<00:01:39.630> little<00:01:39.900> things<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.380> where<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
different little things like where to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.889 
different little things like where to
place<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.369> sensors<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.210> isn't<00:01:42.720> really

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
place the sensors this isn't really

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
place the sensors this isn't really
going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.229> work<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.619> super<00:01:44.159> great<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.640> me

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
going to work out super great for me

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.389 
going to work out super great for me
specifically<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.920> claw

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
specifically because I actually claw

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
specifically because I actually claw
grip<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:48.060> much<00:01:48.210> every<00:01:48.810> Mouse<00:01:49.020> I've<00:01:49.350> ever

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
grip pretty much every Mouse I've ever

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.670 
grip pretty much every Mouse I've ever
used<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.970> having<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.630> sensor<00:01:52.200> position<00:01:52.530> for

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
used so having a sensor position for

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.810 
used so having a sensor position for
someone<00:01:52.860> who's<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> claw<00:01:53.549> grip

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
someone who's going to claw grip

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
someone who's going to claw grip
everything<00:01:54.210> aggressively<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.100> little

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
everything aggressively is a little

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.399 
everything aggressively is a little
weird<00:01:56.340> now<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.149> palming<00:01:57.450> or<00:01:57.899> doing

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
weird now if you're palming or doing

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
weird now if you're palming or doing
kind<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.860> more<00:01:59.100> relaxed<00:01:59.610> claw<00:01:59.909> grip<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
kind of like a more relaxed claw grip it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.600 
kind of like a more relaxed claw grip it
might<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.380> too<00:02:01.799> bad<00:02:01.829> I've<00:02:02.219> seen<00:02:02.399> two

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
might not be too bad I've seen two

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.649 
might not be too bad I've seen two
different<00:02:02.850> positions<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.299> they've<00:02:03.479> used

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
different positions that they've used

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.760 
different positions that they've used
that<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:03.960> pretty<00:02:04.229> good<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.469> both

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that are actually pretty good for both

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.679 
that are actually pretty good for both
of<00:02:04.979> those<00:02:05.070> grips<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.820> hopefully<00:02:06.270> their<00:02:06.390> final

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
of those grips so hopefully their final

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.119 
of those grips so hopefully their final
position<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.200> fairly<00:02:07.469> well<00:02:07.710> optimized

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
position will be fairly well optimized

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.010 
position will be fairly well optimized
for<00:02:08.250> most<00:02:08.520> people<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.450> you're<00:02:09.539> interested<00:02:09.959> in

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.880 
for most people if you're interested in
that<00:02:10.080> Mouse<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.560> check<00:02:10.709> out<00:02:10.739> their

that Mouse you can check out their

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.170 
that Mouse you can check out their
Kickstarter<00:02:11.340> page<00:02:11.489> which<00:02:11.730> should<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.090> the
