well I'm over the worst of it now
getting<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.850> hub<00:00:02.970> off<00:00:03.350> all<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.560> sorted<00:00:05.720> and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
getting the hub off all that sorted and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.919 
getting the hub off all that sorted and
I<00:00:06.779> got<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.319> prop<00:00:07.529> back<00:00:08.220> on<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:09.450> time<00:00:09.510> with<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
I got the prop back on this time with a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.360 
I got the prop back on this time with a
no<00:00:10.139> thicker<00:00:10.500> put<00:00:11.160> plate<00:00:12.740> that's<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.980> old<00:00:14.099> one

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
no thicker put plate that's the old one

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.800 
no thicker put plate that's the old one
it's<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> lot<00:00:14.759> thinner

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.670 

and<00:00:18.500> I<00:00:18.830> was<00:00:18.920> not<00:00:19.010> quite<00:00:19.220> happy<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:21.410> way<00:00:21.560> it<00:00:21.590> was

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
and I was not quite happy the way it was

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.029 
and I was not quite happy the way it was
set<00:00:21.890> up<00:00:21.920> sorry<00:00:22.849> that's<00:00:22.970> not<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.300> other<00:00:23.390> one

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
set up sorry that's not the other one

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.700 
set up sorry that's not the other one
that's<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.250> old<00:00:25.400> one<00:00:26.020> coming<00:00:27.020> at<00:00:27.110> me<00:00:27.259> as<00:00:27.470> these

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
that's the old one coming at me as these

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.079 
that's the old one coming at me as these
things<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:31.180> so<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.210> add<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.660> eat<00:00:33.699> wheat<00:00:34.699> up<00:00:34.940> the

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.089 
things and so I add to eat wheat up the

things and so I add to eat wheat up the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
chunky bolt and fortunate because this

bolt is at this point this pro plate
this<00:00:51.080> plate<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.409> a<00:00:51.589> lot<00:00:51.739> thicker<00:00:52.390> all<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
this plate is a lot thicker all the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.000 
this plate is a lot thicker all the
bolts<00:00:53.960> I've<00:00:54.110> chopped<00:00:54.470> down<00:00:55.299> to<00:00:56.299> size<00:00:56.540> to<00:00:57.260> go

to<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.740> longer<00:01:07.040> ones<00:01:07.189> i'll<00:01:07.369> just<00:01:07.520> put<00:01:07.640> into<00:01:08.409> to

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
to the longer ones i'll just put into to

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.760 
to the longer ones i'll just put into to
line<00:01:09.890> everything<00:01:10.040> up<00:01:11.200> those<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.409> enter<00:01:12.619> line

line everything up those to enter line
everything<00:01:12.950> up<00:01:13.070> first<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:14.630> then<00:01:14.689> I<00:01:15.170> put<00:01:15.290> the

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
everything up first and then I put the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.170 
everything up first and then I put the
junk<00:01:15.590> going<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:15.950> everything's<00:01:16.610> turned<00:01:17.000> up

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
junk going in everything's turned up

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.469 
junk going in everything's turned up
quite<00:01:17.390> well<00:01:17.420> I<00:01:18.460> might<00:01:19.460> even<00:01:19.490> be<00:01:19.670> able<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.970> just

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
quite well I might even be able to just

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.249 
quite well I might even be able to just
get<00:01:20.689> it<00:01:20.780> running<00:01:21.380> ticking<00:01:21.710> over<00:01:21.860> as<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.460> is

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.010 

probably<00:01:27.259> all<00:01:27.380> right<00:01:28.570> now<00:01:29.570> that's<00:01:29.930> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
probably all right now that's the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.300 
probably all right now that's the
modified<00:01:30.829> hope

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.190 

in<00:01:36.820> heaven<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.119> merits<00:01:37.420> employing<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.840> future

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
in heaven on merits employing the future

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.130 
in heaven on merits employing the future
because<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.500> got<00:01:38.619> these<00:01:38.740> extra<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:40.840> holes

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
because I got these extra these holes

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.760 
because I got these extra these holes
had<00:01:41.979> machined<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:44.020> much

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
had machined too much

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.569 
had machined too much
I<00:01:45.909> think<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.969> pulley<00:01:47.180> on<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.329> Corsair<00:01:47.840> engine

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
I think the pulley on the Corsair engine

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.349 
I think the pulley on the Corsair engine
would<00:01:49.579> have<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.850> option<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.119> fit<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.850> PPG

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
would have the option to fit the PPG

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.719 
would have the option to fit the PPG
standard<00:01:53.869> type<00:01:54.079> props<00:01:54.380> later<00:01:55.250> date<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.520> that

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
standard type props later date and that

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.630 
standard type props later date and that
would<00:01:55.880> be

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.160 

what<00:02:04.850> looks<00:02:05.850> fairly<00:02:06.090> solid<00:02:06.360> does<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.810> anyway

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
what looks fairly solid does that anyway

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.309 
what looks fairly solid does that anyway
so<00:02:07.970> I'm<00:02:08.970> gonna<00:02:09.090> pester<00:02:09.479> something<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.200> me

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
so I'm gonna pester something get me

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.559 
so I'm gonna pester something get me
another<00:02:11.660> another<00:02:12.660> six<00:02:13.370> m6<00:02:14.370> beer<00:02:15.800> 80<00:02:16.800> volts<00:02:17.569> and

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
another another six m6 beer 80 volts and

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.160 
another another six m6 beer 80 volts and
I'll<00:02:18.810> chop<00:02:19.020> them<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.260> suit<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.740> hub

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
I'll chop them to suit the hub

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.559 
I'll chop them to suit the hub
and<00:02:21.709> took<00:02:22.160> them<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.150> should<00:02:23.330> look<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
and took them in and it should look the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.050 
and took them in and it should look the
bee's<00:02:23.750> knees<00:02:23.780> then

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.820 

of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.000 

you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.550> eyes<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.910> one<00:02:36.030> don't<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.950> I'll

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
you can eyes that one don't you so I'll

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.530 
you can eyes that one don't you so I'll
go<00:02:38.100> all<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.400> back<00:02:38.550> together<00:02:38.730> clean<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.420> all

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
go all this back together clean it all

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.559 
go all this back together clean it all
up<00:02:39.570> got<00:02:39.840> all<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.960> bits<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.350> off

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.600 

so<00:02:45.079> that's<00:02:45.230> ready<00:02:45.409> to<00:02:45.469> go<00:02:45.590> as<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.219> one

in<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.660> meantime<00:02:49.840> we'll<00:02:50.200> still<00:02:50.410> keep<00:02:50.560> using

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
in the meantime we'll still keep using

let's try this prop so if you have any
