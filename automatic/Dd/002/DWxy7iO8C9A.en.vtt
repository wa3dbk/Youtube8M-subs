00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
me that kind of sounds like maybe a

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.410 
me that kind of sounds like maybe a
transmission<00:01:15.320> gone<00:01:15.950> wrong<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.000> can<00:01:17.180> hear

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
a bunch of weird sound effects as the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.929 
a bunch of weird sound effects as the
waltz<00:01:20.810> music<00:01:20.990> stops<00:01:21.619> almost<00:01:22.610> sounds<00:01:22.790> like<00:01:22.850> a

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
waltz music stops almost sounds like a

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.730 
waltz music stops almost sounds like a
tape<00:01:23.270> that's<00:01:23.509> been<00:01:23.720> stopped<00:01:24.140> or<00:01:24.320> something

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
tape that's been stopped or something

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.550

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
but could this link to the diner that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.770 
but could this link to the diner that
we've<00:01:27.799> seen<00:01:28.100> in<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.640> very<00:01:29.030> first<00:01:29.420> video

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
we've seen in the very first video

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.440 
we've seen in the very first video
showing<00:01:30.290> zombies<00:01:30.799> I'm<00:01:31.490> not<00:01:31.670> too<00:01:31.820> sure<00:01:32.030> some

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
showing zombies I'm not too sure some

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.700 
showing zombies I'm not too sure some
people<00:01:32.750> would<00:01:32.840> say<00:01:32.900> that<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.229> might<00:01:33.439> be<00:01:33.590> new

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
people would say that this might be new

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.679 
people would say that this might be new
music<00:01:34.040> for<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.220> perk<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:35.000> could<00:01:35.150> well<00:01:35.329> be<00:01:35.359> by

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
music for a perk and it could well be by

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.630 
music for a perk and it could well be by
I<00:01:35.960> doubt<00:01:36.469> it<00:01:36.499> because<00:01:36.770> we<00:01:37.039> wouldn't<00:01:37.310> have<00:01:37.460> this

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
I doubt it because we wouldn't have this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.459 
I doubt it because we wouldn't have this
interference<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.810> would<00:01:38.929> be<00:01:39.049> just<00:01:39.289> a

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
interference it would be just a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.370 
interference it would be just a
straight-up<00:01:39.770> song<00:01:40.420> you<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.600> definitely<00:01:41.840> hear

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
straight-up song you can definitely hear

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.099 
straight-up song you can definitely hear
some<00:01:42.710> sort<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:43.270> zombie<00:01:44.270> interference<00:01:44.899> right

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
some sort of zombie interference right

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.609 
some sort of zombie interference right
at<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.409> end<00:01:45.560> there<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.009> I<00:01:46.850> think<00:01:47.179> maybe<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.929> am

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
at the end there and I think maybe I am

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.010 
at the end there and I think maybe I am
not<00:01:49.009> too<00:01:49.189> sure<00:01:49.219> that<00:01:50.149> obviously<00:01:50.840> we're<00:01:50.960> not

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
not too sure that obviously we're not

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.389 
not too sure that obviously we're not
going<00:01:51.079> to<00:01:51.229> be<00:01:51.289> waltzing<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.920> characters

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
going to be waltzing the characters

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.090 
going to be waltzing the characters
waltzing<00:01:53.359> that<00:01:53.539> would<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.719> ridiculous<00:01:54.100> but

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
waltzing that would be ridiculous but

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.130 
waltzing that would be ridiculous but
obviously<00:01:55.609> people<00:01:55.850> are<00:01:55.999> having<00:01:56.179> enjoying<00:01:57.020> a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
obviously people are having enjoying a

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.870 
obviously people are having enjoying a
nice<00:01:57.319> time<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:58.009> all<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.369> sudden<00:01:58.700> it

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
nice time and then all of a sudden it

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.749 
nice time and then all of a sudden it
