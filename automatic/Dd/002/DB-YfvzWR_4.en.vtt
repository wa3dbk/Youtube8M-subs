out<00:01:55.040> for<00:01:55.070> these<00:01:55.310> pokey<00:01:55.820> things<00:01:55.850> here<00:01:56.420> could<00:01:57.350> go

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
out for these pokey things here could go

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.080 
out for these pokey things here could go
under<00:01:57.920> them<00:01:58.040> but<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.340> think<00:01:58.550> it's<00:01:58.670> easier<00:01:59.030> just

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
under them but I think it's easier just

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.220 
under them but I think it's easier just
to<00:01:59.360> jump<00:01:59.660> over<00:02:00.050> them<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.500> we'll<00:02:00.680> do<00:02:00.890> that

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
and coming up here i'll be using a trick

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.990 
and coming up here i'll be using a trick
that<00:02:06.710> we're<00:02:06.980> going<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.130> be<00:02:07.190> using<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.640> lot<00:02:07.820> in

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
that we're going to be using a lot in

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.420 
that we're going to be using a lot in
this<00:02:08.150> level<00:02:08.450> that's<00:02:09.080> using<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.560> fly<00:02:09.860> command

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
this level that's using the fly command

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.470 
this level that's using the fly command
to<00:02:10.790> cross<00:02:11.450> over<00:02:11.690> these<00:02:12.080> gaps<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:14.000> interesting

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
to cross over these gaps the interesting

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.690 
to cross over these gaps the interesting
part<00:02:14.750> about<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.140> flight<00:02:15.410> command<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.250> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
part about the flight command is that it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.670 
part about the flight command is that it
doesn't<00:02:17.000> actually<00:02:17.120> cost<00:02:17.630> any<00:02:17.870> coins<00:02:18.260> unless

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
doesn't actually cost any coins unless

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.250 
doesn't actually cost any coins unless
you<00:02:18.860> flap<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.370> wings<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.450> if<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:21.020> call

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
you flap the wings so if you just call

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.560 
you flap the wings so if you just call
the<00:02:21.440> command<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.160> use<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.000> glide<00:02:23.360> over

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
the command and use it to glide over

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.020 
the command and use it to glide over
gaps<00:02:23.990> like<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:25.460> don't<00:02:25.670> actually<00:02:25.850> have

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
gaps like this you don't actually have

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.360 
gaps like this you don't actually have
to<00:02:26.180> pay<00:02:26.480> anything<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.830> cross<00:02:28.100> these

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
to pay anything and you can cross these

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.030 
to pay anything and you can cross these
large<00:02:28.730> gaps<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.450> otherwise<00:02:29.870> would<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.380> very

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
large gaps that otherwise would be very

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.130 
large gaps that otherwise would be very
difficult<00:02:31.370> or<00:02:31.850> even<00:02:31.970> impossible<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.900> jump

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
difficult or even impossible to jump

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.880 
difficult or even impossible to jump
over<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> nice<00:02:34.850> little<00:02:35.090> feature

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
over so it's a nice little feature

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.809 
over so it's a nice little feature
intentional<00:02:36.890> or<00:02:37.010> not

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
intentional or not

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.589 
intentional or not
cross<00:02:39.599> over<00:02:39.989> this<00:02:40.109> last<00:02:40.379> gap<00:02:40.879> your<00:02:41.879> burger<00:02:42.359> for

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
cross over this last gap your burger for

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.989 
cross over this last gap your burger for
good<00:02:42.719> measure<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.109> here<00:02:44.069> we<00:02:44.249> are<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.639> the<00:02:44.730> next

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:44.999 
good measure and here we are in the next

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.470 
good measure and here we are in the next
elevator<00:02:45.889> these<00:02:46.889> traps<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.549> air<00:02:47.700> pretty<00:02:48.180> easy

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
elevator these traps the air pretty easy

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.690 
elevator these traps the air pretty easy
to<00:02:48.749> manage<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.499> keep<00:02:49.799> walking<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.459> right

to manage just keep walking to the right

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.110 
to manage just keep walking to the right
and<00:02:51.090> it'll<00:02:51.689> be<00:02:51.810> fine<00:02:52.519> now<00:02:53.519> we'll<00:02:53.730> use<00:02:53.969> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
and it'll be fine now we'll use the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.410 
and it'll be fine now we'll use the
flying<00:02:54.420> command<00:02:54.930> again<00:02:55.849> watch<00:02:56.849> out<00:02:57.090> for<00:02:57.120> these

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
flying command again watch out for these

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.630 
flying command again watch out for these

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.080 

and<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:07.200> does<00:03:07.439> it<00:03:07.590> for<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.769> section<00:03:08.189> into

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and that does it for this section into

robot cannon thing and beat him up and
that's<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.980> end<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.310> part<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> level

that's the end of this part of the level
so<00:03:36.650> another<00:03:37.650> elevator<00:03:38.720> here<00:03:39.720> we've<00:03:39.900> got<00:03:39.930> some

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
so another elevator here we've got some

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.500 
so another elevator here we've got some
more<00:03:40.410> enemies<00:03:40.890> these<00:03:41.160> jumping<00:03:41.610> spring<00:03:42.000> robots

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
more enemies these jumping spring robots

more enemies these jumping spring robots
it<00:03:43.290> can<00:03:43.470> be<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> little<00:03:43.830> annoying<00:03:44.190> if<00:03:44.670> they<00:03:45.020> jump

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
it can be a little annoying if they jump

here and now this part is a little

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.900 
here and now this part is a little
tricky<00:04:23.230> because<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:24.190> pretty<00:04:24.430> much<00:04:24.580> have<00:04:24.880> to
