and<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:57.989> he<00:02:58.080> makes<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> seem<00:02:58.620> very

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and I think he makes it seem very

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.770 
and I think he makes it seem very
dynamic<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.550> interesting<00:03:00.060> every<00:03:00.420> time<00:03:00.630> he

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
dynamic and interesting every time he

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.320 
dynamic and interesting every time he
does<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.920> second<00:03:02.430> observation<00:03:02.760> is

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
does it now the second observation is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.720 
does it now the second observation is
that<00:03:03.630> The<00:03:04.080> Maze<00:03:04.260> Runner<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.890> getting<00:03:05.340> kind<00:03:05.610> of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
that The Maze Runner is getting kind of

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.790 
that The Maze Runner is getting kind of
like<00:03:05.880> wayward<00:03:06.360> Pines<00:03:06.840> right

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
like wayward Pines right

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.070 
like wayward Pines right
nobody<00:03:08.430> ruined<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> season<00:03:09.360> finale<00:03:09.540> from

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
nobody ruined the season finale from

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.470 
nobody ruined the season finale from
last<00:03:10.290> night<00:03:10.640> because<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.670> haven't<00:03:11.970> watched<00:03:12.239> it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
last night because I haven't watched it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.729 
last night because I haven't watched it
yet<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:12.870> I've<00:03:12.959> been<00:03:12.989> really<00:03:13.290> enjoying

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
yet but I've been really enjoying

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.160 
yet but I've been really enjoying
wayward<00:03:14.160> Pines<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.640> Fox<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.810> kind<00:03:16.080> of

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
wayward Pines on Fox and it kind of

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.160 
wayward Pines on Fox and it kind of
seems<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.890> similar<00:03:17.130> set<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.170> never

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
seems to have a similar set up I never

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.080 
seems to have a similar set up I never
made<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.440> connection<00:03:19.769> until<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.910> new

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
made that connection until this new

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.360 
made that connection until this new
trailer<00:03:21.360> which<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.200> plays<00:03:22.530> up<00:03:22.769> what's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
trailer which really plays up what's

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.340 
trailer which really plays up what's
going<00:03:23.670> on<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.239> know<00:03:24.360> with<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.810> experiment

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
going on you know with this experiment

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.310 
going on you know with this experiment
overall<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.120> that's<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.079> real

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
overall and that that's I think the real

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.900 
overall and that that's I think the real
only<00:03:28.650> real<00:03:28.829> changer<00:03:29.340> with<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.549> second

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
only real changer with the second

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.699 
only real changer with the second
trailer<00:03:30.239> where<00:03:30.630> they're<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:31.019> look<00:03:31.290> we

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
trailer where they're going look we

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.350 
trailer where they're going look we
spent<00:03:32.010> even<00:03:32.160> more<00:03:32.430> money<00:03:32.640> on<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.000> sequel

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
spent even more money on the sequel

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.789 
spent even more money on the sequel

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
didn't we then you thought well that we

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.310 
didn't we then you thought well that we
did<00:03:35.040> as<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.209> said<00:03:36.239> with<00:03:36.600> my<00:03:36.720> review<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
did as I said with my review of the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.110 
did as I said with my review of the
first<00:03:37.530> trailer<00:03:37.829> for<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.220> Scorch<00:03:38.489> Trials<00:03:38.549> it

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
first trailer for the Scorch Trials it

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.699 
first trailer for the Scorch Trials it
looks<00:03:39.299> like<00:03:39.480> they've<00:03:39.660> upped<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.140> budget<00:03:40.560> I'm

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
looks like they've upped the budget I'm

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.440 
looks like they've upped the budget I'm
pretty<00:03:41.070> impressed<00:03:41.459> with<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.730> turnaround<00:03:42.269> for

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
pretty impressed with the turnaround for

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.259 
pretty impressed with the turnaround for
the<00:03:42.510> second<00:03:42.959> film<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:43.920> also<00:03:44.040> again<00:03:44.489> with<00:03:45.060> how

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
the second film but also again with how

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.819 
the second film but also again with how
they<00:03:45.510> seem<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.019> be<00:03:46.140> spending<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.530> lot<00:03:46.650> more

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
they seem to be spending a lot more

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.080 
they seem to be spending a lot more
money<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.579> they're<00:03:47.700> putting<00:03:47.910> that

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
money on it and they're putting that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.330 
money on it and they're putting that
money<00:03:48.269> up<00:03:48.420> on<00:03:48.600> screen<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:49.769> here<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.130> see

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
money up on screen but here you see

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.460 
money up on screen but here you see
these<00:03:50.760> weird<00:03:51.120> entities<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.930> they<00:03:52.049> have<00:03:52.230> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
these weird entities that they have to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.289 
these weird entities that they have to
fight<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.280> think<00:03:53.489> that's<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.850> good<00:03:54.030> addition

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
fight so I think that's a good addition

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.380 
fight so I think that's a good addition
you<00:03:54.690> know<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:55.590> funny<00:03:55.769> not<00:03:56.519> only<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:57.239> we

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
you know but it's funny not only have we

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.120 
you know but it's funny not only have we
seen<00:03:57.600> those<00:03:57.750> guys<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.200> wayward<00:03:58.380> Pines<00:03:58.560> or

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
seeing the same kind of fleshy human

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.259

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.689 
trailer do you prefer on the Mockingjay
trailer<00:04:39.990> or<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.290> Maze<00:04:40.560> Runner<00:04:40.590> trailer<00:04:41.580> I

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
trailer or the Maze Runner trailer I

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.219 
trailer or the Maze Runner trailer I
think<00:04:42.000> they're<00:04:42.150> there<00:04:42.540> they're<00:04:42.900> just<00:04:43.080> such

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
think they're there they're just such

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.050 
think they're there they're just such
different<00:04:43.590> entities<00:04:43.979> in<00:04:44.010> terms<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.550> scope<00:04:44.850> and

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
different entities in terms of scope and

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.540 
different entities in terms of scope and
budget<00:04:45.900> for<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.229> franchise's<00:04:46.889> overall<00:04:47.280> it's

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
budget for the franchise's overall it's

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.100 
budget for the franchise's overall it's
a<00:04:47.580> little<00:04:47.790> bit<00:04:47.910> hard<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.120> compare<00:04:48.479> them<00:04:48.690> but<00:04:49.050> I

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
a little bit hard to compare them but I

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.840 
a little bit hard to compare them but I
think<00:04:49.169> Maze<00:04:49.470> Runner<00:04:49.500> holds<00:04:50.190> its<00:04:50.340> own<00:04:50.490> against

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
think Maze Runner holds its own against

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.879 
think Maze Runner holds its own against
Mockingjay<00:04:51.540> which<00:04:51.750> follower<00:04:52.199> lines<00:04:52.410> get<00:04:52.740> I'd

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
Mockingjay which follower lines get I'd

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.830 
Mockingjay which follower lines get I'd
be<00:04:53.040> like<00:04:53.220> what<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.729> hell<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.120> spent<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> lot<00:04:54.810> more

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
be like what the hell I spent a lot more

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.490 
be like what the hell I spent a lot more
money

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500
