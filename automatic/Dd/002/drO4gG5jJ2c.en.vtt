damn you loading screen you can park a
car<00:02:54.269> in<00:02:54.329> front<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> convoy<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.530> that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.399 
car in front of the convoy and that
stops<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.400> or<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.870> follow<00:02:58.109> the

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
stops it or you can just follow the

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.410 
stops it or you can just follow the
convoy<00:02:58.829> from<00:02:58.980> behind<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.670> they<00:02:59.790> don't<00:02:59.970> see<00:03:00.269> you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
convoy from behind so they don't see you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.229

part where they come to a stop at a
donut<00:03:07.109> shop<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.560> think<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.010> when<00:03:08.700> they<00:03:08.849> do<00:03:08.909> that

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
donut shop I think and when they do that

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.240 
donut shop I think and when they do that
all<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.690> vehicles<00:03:10.079> stop<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.920> person

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
all the vehicles stop and the person

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.949 
all the vehicles stop and the person
inside<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.730> tank<00:03:11.970> gets<00:03:12.150> out<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.480> go<00:03:12.599> get<00:03:12.780> them

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
inside the tank gets out to go get them

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.259 
inside the tank gets out to go get them
donuts<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.430> use<00:03:14.609> either<00:03:14.639> of<00:03:15.150> those

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
donuts so you can use either of those

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.500 
donuts so you can use either of those
two<00:03:15.329> times<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.859> get<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.669> convoy<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> come<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.480> a

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
I think what you have to do is you might

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.580 
I think what you have to do is you might
need<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.940> damage<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.510> door<00:04:34.660> I'm<00:04:35.050> not<00:04:35.350> entirely

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
need to damage the door I'm not entirely

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.110 
need to damage the door I'm not entirely
certain<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.160> that

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
certain of that

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.730 
certain of that
I'm<00:04:37.450> just<00:04:37.660> want<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.900> take<00:04:38.200> out<00:04:38.350> all<00:04:38.380> these<00:04:38.680> guys

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
I'm just want to take out all these guys

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.770 
I'm just want to take out all these guys
here<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.490> maybe<00:04:39.670> once<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:40.000> take<00:04:40.210> out<00:04:40.360> enough<00:04:40.660> of

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
here and maybe once I take out enough of

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.960 
here and maybe once I take out enough of
them<00:04:40.930> then<00:04:41.230> I<00:04:41.320> can<00:04:41.470> get<00:04:41.590> inside<00:04:41.920> of<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.220> if<00:04:42.790> you

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
them then I can get inside of it if you

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.340 
them then I can get inside of it if you
keep<00:04:43.150> your<00:04:43.330> distance<00:04:43.510> then<00:04:43.960> they<00:04:44.080> can't

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
keep your distance then they can't

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.250 
keep your distance then they can't
really<00:04:44.710> do<00:04:44.890> too<00:04:44.920> much<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.150> looks<00:04:47.110> like

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
really do too much to you so looks like

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.960 
really do too much to you so looks like
their<00:04:47.410> fire<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.980> starting<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.460> slow<00:04:48.730> down<00:04:48.760> I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
their fire is starting to slow down I

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.550 
their fire is starting to slow down I
