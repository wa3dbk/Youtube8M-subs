00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.710
 Customs Union may be the largest 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.600
 economic union on the planet 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.370
 sensational news came from Minsk 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 where is the second day going on 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 official event with chapters 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 cis states have learned that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.430
 join the alliance astana moscow and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
 Minsk wish ankara deal with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.810
 intentions of Turkey have already been supported by Nursultan 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 Nazarbayev and India offer Vladimir 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.099
 Putin, however, the topic of customs techniques 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 union of new member countries 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.140
 will raise only after they eliminate 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.210
 disagreements among themselves and there are still many 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 special correspondent of the CTC in Minsk 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.270
 Yaroslavka Russian woman watched as 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 the president and not only argue and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.710
 discuss we plant trees together 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.710
 throw off for gifts to colleagues 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.890
 long time president of belarus 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.660
 Alexander Lukashenko was very worried 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.239
 visiting some colleagues 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.340
 across the cis they all had huge palaces 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.899
 he was gone but now it's a misunderstanding 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.250
 in the past we are today in the back of Lukashenko 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.829
 got the opportunity to show my new 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 residence all at once and here on 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.219
 protocol meeting ceremony became 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 I understand why being in Astana 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.790
 Belarusian leader demanded helpers 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.799
 memorize every detail it turns out 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.159
 so as not to lose face here 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.159
 yourself at home 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.070
 until the owner themselves before met colleagues on 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.110
 ground floor everyone else was waiting 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 presidents on the second everyone was engaged 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.890
 useful affairs someone led informal 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.320
 negotiate someone with great zeal 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.330
 preparing yourself a place more comfortable then 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
 the president came and found out that everything was not 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.720
 different moods are full 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 the opposition of Islam is Karimov like 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.370
 someone is very offended and Ilham Aliyev him 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.530
 it's like it's birthday today 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.040
 already congratulated on another election on 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.040
 presidency 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 Later, Mr. Lukashenka said that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.060
 this bouquet was dropped all the presidents and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.740
 it was obviously a rare decision question 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.400
 which was taken without any 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.440
 disagreement 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.300
 but the themes are more serious all wrong 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.479
 smoothly present Belarus this very 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 not always grieves our countries 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.050
 speak with one voice regret it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.300
 manifests itself even on the site of the organization 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.950
 united nations 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.680
 sometimes our partners support 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.360
 decisions are directed against the community 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.990
 or its individual members 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.489
 can hardly be considered this practice 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.230
 productive in the near future 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.030
 it may happen that the president 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.160
 will have to develop common positions in 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.140
 much broader it is about 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.360
 possible expansion of the customs union 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.950
 turned out to be potential members this 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.780
 not only armenia and kyrgyzstan 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.910
 sensational averages unexpectedly 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.820
 shared with the general public 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.230
 Nursultan Nazarbayev and Vladimir Putin 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.830
 I will hear already many say already 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.320
 the north wants to enter for example the president 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.140
 simply world erdogan turkey minister 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.140
 turned to me is it possible 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.980
 Turkey can understand this advice but here 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.500
 big country at all from the hollow criticism 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.780
 where you will not go to the west immediately a question 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 asks you that you are creating the Soviet 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.400
 Union or under Russia you are there something 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.440
 creates and has to explain what 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.050
 nothing like there can be turkey 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.200
 understand the question will end large 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.120
 economy big hotel words like 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 inform you dear colleagues about 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.819
 that you are showing the same interest 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.080
 another 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.500
 large economy is one of the largest 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.850
 the economy in the world is india just that 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.780
 our guest was our big friend 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.620
 india prime minister yes he asked me 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.320
 put a question on our today's 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.870
 meeting about what india would like 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.060
 consider signing up 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.080
 free trade agreement with 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.730
 customs union 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.519
 all other questions after such 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.350
 statements were resolved quickly in 2015 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.970
 CIS countries have decided to declare the year 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.680
 veterans of the Great Patriotic War 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.500
 make the 70th anniversary of the victory 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.880
 uniform commemorative medals and post chapters 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.500
 The state says to bring in 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.660
 youth respect for veterans and 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.489
 build a new common house left 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.350
 only plant a tree area for 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.470
 this was kindly provided by alexander 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.470
 Lukashenko 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.420
 change in composition opportunity await and 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.610
 oldest integration union 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.609
 in the post-soviet space after 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.590
 famous events of 2008 cis left 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.210
 georgia and today the countries that 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.290
 Commonwealth remained officially 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.080
 asked Tbilisi 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.210
 return turns out without Georgia cis and 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.340
 not the cis at all but the answer to that 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.280
 the proposal has not yet arrived and quite 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.410
 it is possible that the Georgians will voice their answer 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.810
 at the next summit of heads of state of the CIS 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.850
 which will take place in Kiev Ukraine 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.950
 integration with the European Union 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.720
 does not interfere to participate in the CIS and even 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.690
 be its chairman 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.080
 Yaroslav Russian woman grew up raising CTC from 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.080
