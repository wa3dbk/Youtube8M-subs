 he's a guy that we recognize just by looking and everyone already knows that he's a 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.450
 period that few know who it is that after five years even with good 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.450
 appearance it no longer offers so much security yes 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.099
 The validity period is already a known branch north but it is not only 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.300
 food in home-made restaurants you have to keep an eye on 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.310
 in what gave 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.740
 How do you identify years 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.200
 your tire the date of manufacture 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.880
 you have is that these lyrics duarte follows in some moments and in this case 05 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.110
 02 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.510
 the 5th week of 2002 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.070
 this tire is already overdue to one and a half meter unit over 5 years is not 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.690
 because it has never been used because you can rely on their performance who 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.199
 surprised it has a very good drawing almost a thousand but it already presents a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.050
 series of criticisms it is already expired 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.030
 this period 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
 maximum seven pairs pt 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.820
 after the deadline set by the manufacturer 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.890
 the car can be exposed paulo 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 the risks 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.700
 we still do not have a car in perfect condition my updated improved 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.259
 but not the people did not succeed 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.340
 if you are an agreement with the expiration date the first good 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.509
 chance to score is the tram riding the steering wheel of great beauty of the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.480
 presenter instead 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.110
 How is that? 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.780
 will put on the labels free to complete there is no back to give 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.500
 of course from now on you do not have to wait to get to this point 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.300
 just look here on that occasion if you look at anything sad 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.280
 you have an expiration date it can be missing 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.030
