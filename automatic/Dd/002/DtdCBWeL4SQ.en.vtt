00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
well I'm just going to show you how I

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.619 
well I'm just going to show you how I
made<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:03.020> trial<00:00:04.020> sort<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.650> electric<00:00:05.069> fence

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:05.629 
made a trial sort of electric fence

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.690 
made a trial sort of electric fence
deterrent<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:06.810> slugs<00:00:07.080> now<00:00:07.919> obviously<00:00:08.250> if<00:00:08.610> you

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
deterrent for slugs now obviously if you

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.009 
deterrent for slugs now obviously if you
if<00:00:08.880> you've<00:00:09.000> seen<00:00:09.179> any<00:00:09.300> more<00:00:09.510> or<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.690> ones<00:00:09.870> on

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
if you've seen any more or the ones on

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.140 
if you've seen any more or the ones on
YouTube<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.950> bit<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.370> ripoff<00:00:11.730> from<00:00:12.000> one

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
YouTube it's a bit of a ripoff from one

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.629 
YouTube it's a bit of a ripoff from one
that<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.330> saw<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.719> YouTube<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.400> same

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
that I saw on YouTube so it's the same

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.450 
that I saw on YouTube so it's the same
sort<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.910> idea<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.599> what<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.139> done<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.460> he's

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
sort of idea so what I've done is he's

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.870 
sort of idea so what I've done is he's
just<00:00:17.550> some<00:00:17.760> wire<00:00:17.970> some<00:00:18.270> galvanized<00:00:18.750> wire<00:00:19.020> I've

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
just some wire some galvanized wire I've

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.670 
just some wire some galvanized wire I've
put<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> ring<00:00:21.270> right<00:00:21.660> around<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> outside<00:00:22.650> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
put a ring right around the outside of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.679 
put a ring right around the outside of
the<00:00:22.859> raised<00:00:23.039> bed<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> inside<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.449> ward

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the raised bed on the inside of the ward

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.160 
the raised bed on the inside of the ward
right<00:00:25.080> round<00:00:26.180> 20<00:00:27.180> meters<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> way<00:00:27.840> around

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
right round 20 meters all the way around

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.620 
right round 20 meters all the way around
and<00:00:28.439> then<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> outside<00:00:29.789> I've<00:00:30.510> done

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and then on the outside I've done

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.560 
and then on the outside I've done
another<00:00:30.810> ring<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.969> will<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.390> will<00:00:33.510> be

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
another ring so that will be one will be

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
another ring so that will be one will be
the<00:00:33.660> positive<00:00:33.870> charge<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> other<00:00:34.829> hood

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the positive charge and the other hood

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
the positive charge and the other hood
will<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> negative<00:00:35.670> charge<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.360> battery

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
will be the negative charge the battery

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.330 
will be the negative charge the battery
so<00:00:37.410> basically<00:00:37.710> well<00:00:37.860> then<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.219> will<00:00:38.309> happen

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so basically well then what will happen

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.000 
so basically well then what will happen
is<00:00:38.760> when<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> slug<00:00:39.629> crosses<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
is when the slug crosses that and that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.470 
is when the slug crosses that and that
it<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.520> an<00:00:41.610> electric<00:00:41.969> shock<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it will get an electric shock and it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.889 
it will get an electric shock and it
won't<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:43.680> over<00:00:43.800> tap<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.250> buff

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
won't go in and then over tap some buff

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.360 
won't go in and then over tap some buff
to<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.200> 9-volt<00:00:46.559> battery<00:00:46.950> down<00:00:47.100> there

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to a little 9-volt battery down there

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
to a little 9-volt battery down there
that<00:00:48.360> couldn't<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.660> easier<00:00:48.960> I've<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.170> tapped

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that couldn't be easier I've just tapped

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.490 
that couldn't be easier I've just tapped
them<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.879> ideal<00:00:51.300> size<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> would<00:00:52.230> say<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
them on the ideal size I would say it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.799 
them on the ideal size I would say it
would<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:53.039> ten<00:00:53.910> mil<00:00:54.149> between<00:00:54.600> them

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
would be about ten mil between them

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.619 
would be about ten mil between them
because<00:00:55.079> then<00:00:55.579> otherwise<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.449> tiny

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
because then otherwise a little tiny

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.260 
because then otherwise a little tiny
slug<00:00:57.989> matvey<00:00:58.350> across<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:59.030> get<00:01:00.030> into<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
slug matvey across one get into the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689 
slug matvey across one get into the
middle<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:00.989> lose<00:01:01.949> contact<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
middle and then lose contact with that

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.009 
middle and then lose contact with that
and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.059> cross<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.660> other<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.899> without

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and then cross the other one without

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.050 
and then cross the other one without
getting<00:01:04.339> zapped<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.240> about<00:01:06.840> 10<00:01:07.170> mils<00:01:07.409> ideal<00:01:08.060> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
getting zapped so about 10 mils ideal so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.010 
getting zapped so about 10 mils ideal so
I<00:01:09.090> could<00:01:09.330> say<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.810> matter<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I could say it's just a matter of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.750 
I could say it's just a matter of
tacking<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> along<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> way

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
tacking it along like so all the way

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
tacking it along like so all the way
around<00:01:12.260> staple<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.549> come

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
around staple it down and then come

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.230 
around staple it down and then come
right<00:01:14.820> round<00:01:15.240> from<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> other<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:17.240> making

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
right round from the other side making

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.760 
right round from the other side making
sure<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.689> none<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> wires<00:01:19.200> touch<00:01:19.350> each

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
sure that none of the wires touch each

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.929 
sure that none of the wires touch each
other<00:01:20.070> none<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.400> positives<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
other none of the positives and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.280 
other none of the positives and
negatives<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:21.810> twist<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.110> together

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
negatives and then twist them together

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.830 
negatives and then twist them together
and<00:01:22.619> attach<00:01:22.799> them<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> battery<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> give<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and attach them to a battery so give it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.300 
and attach them to a battery so give it
a<00:01:24.960> bit<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> test<00:01:25.500> I'll<00:01:25.799> show<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
a bit of a test I'll show you with a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.770 
a bit of a test I'll show you with a
slug<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.820> snail<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.360> we'll<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.689> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
slug and a snail and we'll see if it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.910 
slug and a snail and we'll see if it
works<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> first<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.530> don't

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
works it's on to the first one or don't

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
works it's on to the first one or don't
like<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:02:10.280 

going<00:01:47.170> across<00:01:47.260> oh<00:01:47.800> wow

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.780 

they<00:02:11.290> can<00:02:11.440> give<00:02:11.530> another<00:02:11.650> girl<00:02:12.070> some<00:02:12.370> really

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
they can give another girl some really

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:22.680 
they can give another girl some really
silly<00:02:13.030> snow<00:02:21.180> try<00:02:22.180> again

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
silly snow try again

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:40.839 
silly snow try again
ow<00:02:30.930> again

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.599 

now<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.749> there<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:41.989> go<00:02:42.439> it<00:02:42.829> does<00:02:43.099> work<00:02:43.340> that

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
now so there you go it does work that
