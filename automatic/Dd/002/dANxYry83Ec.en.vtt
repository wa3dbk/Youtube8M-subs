you need to pull the grill vent out and
this<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.740> already<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> pulled<00:01:30.000> out

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this one I already got it pulled out

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
this one I already got it pulled out
here<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.799> look<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.369> there's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
here and if you look at this there's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.929 
here and if you look at this there's
some<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:33.180> locking<00:01:33.570> tabs<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.340> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
some little locking tabs on the top and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.020 
some little locking tabs on the top and
on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> bottom<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.520> cause<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
on the bottom and this can cause it to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
on the bottom and this can cause it to
hang<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.840> you'll<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.950> once<00:01:41.159> it's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
hang up and you'll see it once it's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.580 
hang up and you'll see it once it's
there<00:01:41.549> once<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.380> that's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
there once it's up here and so that's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.859 
there once it's up here and so that's
where<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.130> little<00:01:44.640> pick<00:01:44.909> tool<00:01:45.180> might<00:01:45.479> come<00:01:45.720> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
where the little pick tool might come in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
where the little pick tool might come in
handy<00:01:46.110> or<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.130> screwdriver<00:01:47.460> because

you can see down inside of here or you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
you can see down inside of here or you
can<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.170> kind<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> wedge<00:01:52.710> them<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
can get in and kind of wedge them up a
