right<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.470> acrylic<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> cover<00:00:32.760> with<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
right here the acrylic so I cover with a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
bucket you see the cell has a lotta

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.010 
bucket you see the cell has a lotta
buildup<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.300> one's<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.629> easy<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
buildup and this one's really easy to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.180 
buildup and this one's really easy to
clean<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.010> simply<00:00:38.460> unscrew<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:40.190> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
clean you just simply unscrew this and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.940 
clean you just simply unscrew this and
it<00:00:41.850> comes<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.590> pretty<00:00:43.590> easy<00:00:45.829> make<00:00:46.829> sure

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it comes right off pretty easy make sure

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.680 
it comes right off pretty easy make sure

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
gloves okay so we stood in a bucket of
water<00:00:57.239> Alec<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:57.930> wires<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.649> possible<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
water Alec the wires out if possible and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
water Alec the wires out if possible and
I'm<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.390> pour<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.660> acid<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
I'm going to pour some acid in there I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.070 
I'm going to pour some acid in there I
like<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> pour<00:01:02.790> just<00:01:03.090> enough<00:01:03.239> acid<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
like to pour just enough acid to get it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.440 
like to pour just enough acid to get it
bubbling<00:01:04.259> I<00:01:04.649> don't<00:01:04.800> like<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.009> overdo<00:01:05.399> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
bubbling I don't like to overdo it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.990 
bubbling I don't like to overdo it
the<00:01:07.050> jacks<00:01:07.289> acid<00:01:07.950> make<00:01:08.100> sure<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> damages<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the jacks acid make sure to damages the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.389 
the jacks acid make sure to damages the
plate<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> force<00:01:10.500> them<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.130> we

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
plate can you force them in there and we

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.920 
plate can you force them in there and we
see<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> thing<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.690> start

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
see if this thing is going to start

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.740 
see if this thing is going to start
bubbling<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.649> and<00:01:14.180> of<00:01:15.180> course<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.600> more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
bubbling here and of course the more

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.779 
bubbling here and of course the more
Indians<00:01:16.110> want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> sizable

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
Indians want to get it to a sizable

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.320 
Indians want to get it to a sizable
bubble<00:01:18.209> on<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:20.789> that's<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> good<00:01:21.179> amount

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
bubble on there and that's a good amount

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.590 
bubble on there and that's a good amount
of<00:01:21.450> acid<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:22.050> there<00:01:22.670> give<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.000> bit

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of acid right there give it a little bit

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.690 
of acid right there give it a little bit
more<00:01:26.209> and<00:01:27.209> I'm<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.420> let<00:01:27.539> this<00:01:27.720> one

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.760 

that's<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.940> one<00:01:33.209> six<00:01:33.690> mixture<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.349> acid

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that's about a one six mixture of acid

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.919 
that's about a one six mixture of acid
to<00:01:34.890> water<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.209> it<00:01:36.330> gently<00:01:36.569> starting

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
to water you can see it gently starting

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.719 
to water you can see it gently starting
to<00:01:36.990> bubble<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.429> to<00:01:38.520> release

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to bubble now and it's going to release

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.460 
to bubble now and it's going to release
all<00:01:38.910> that<00:01:38.940> calcium<00:01:39.690> they<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.170> either<00:01:40.259> one

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
all that calcium they can either one

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.749 
all that calcium they can either one
over<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.099> ass<00:01:41.190> because<00:01:41.399> it<00:01:41.550> damages

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
over do with the ass because it damages

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.270 
over do with the ass because it damages
the<00:01:42.090> plates<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.289> that<00:01:43.440> gentle<00:01:43.830> bubbling

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the plates you want that gentle bubbling

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.550 
the plates you want that gentle bubbling
being<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> acid<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.349> why<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
being going with the acid it's why you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
being going with the acid it's why you
gradually<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.160> it<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.179> I'll<00:01:48.569> come

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
gradually put it in there and I'll come

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.389 
gradually put it in there and I'll come
back<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.080> one<00:01:49.259> probably<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:49.709> 20<00:01:50.099> minutes

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
back this one probably about 20 minutes

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.999 
back this one probably about 20 minutes
it's<00:01:50.580> just<00:01:50.729> pretty<00:01:50.940> dirty<00:01:51.349> again<00:01:52.349> that<00:01:52.649> acid

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it's just pretty dirty again that acid

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's just pretty dirty again that acid
mixture<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.369> very<00:01:53.399> important<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> overdo

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
mixture is very important not to overdo

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.449 
mixture is very important not to overdo
it<00:01:54.539> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.289> actually<00:01:55.470> after<00:01:56.310> about

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
it you can see it's actually after about

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.430 
it you can see it's actually after about
a<00:01:56.520> minute<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.209> starting<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> bubble<00:01:57.690> and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
a minute see it starting to bubble and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.660 
a minute see it starting to bubble and
that's<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.709> kind<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> effect<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.489> if

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that's the kind of effect you want if

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
that's the kind of effect you want if
you<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.880> rapid<00:02:00.239> bubbling<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.929> too<00:02:01.050> much

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you get rapid bubbling you have too much

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.290 
you get rapid bubbling you have too much
acid<00:02:01.440> as<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.429> more<00:02:02.580> water<00:02:02.789> because<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.209> can

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
acid as to more water because you can

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.499 
acid as to more water because you can
really<00:02:03.479> damage<00:02:03.690> this<00:02:04.080> also<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.270> course

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
really damage this also and of course

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
really damage this also and of course
make<00:02:06.750> sure<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.739> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> come

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
make sure that this is not going to come

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.800 
make sure that this is not going to come
back<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.489> turn<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.880> time<00:02:09.119> timer<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
back and I turn this time timer and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.420 
back and I turn this time timer and
purpose<00:02:10.170> away<00:02:10.590> from<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> off

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
purpose away from the off

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.430 
purpose away from the off
don't<00:02:12.970> want<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.150> come<00:02:13.299> back<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.690> while<00:02:14.319> you're

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
don't want to come back on while you're

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.660 
don't want to come back on while you're
doing<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.769> because<00:02:14.890> water<00:02:15.159> will<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:15.370> shoot

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
doing this because water will just shoot

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
doing this because water will just shoot
out<00:02:15.790> everywhere<00:02:16.620> okay<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:17.769> been<00:02:17.890> about

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
out everywhere okay it's been about

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.699 
out everywhere okay it's been about
actually<00:02:18.700> 35<00:02:19.540> minutes<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.200> one<00:02:20.409> was<00:02:20.530> pretty

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
actually 35 minutes this one was pretty

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.050 
actually 35 minutes this one was pretty
dirty<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.129> let<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.280> soak<00:02:21.430> longer<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.970> it's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
dirty so I let it soak longer and it's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.550 
dirty so I let it soak longer and it's
pretty<00:02:22.269> clean<00:02:22.540> I'm<00:02:23.049> going<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.260> pull<00:02:23.409> it<00:02:23.500> out

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
pretty clean I'm going to pull it out

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.339 
pretty clean I'm going to pull it out
and<00:02:23.620> rinse<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.950> off<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.310> reinsert<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.349> again

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
and rinse it off and reinsert it again

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.080 
and rinse it off and reinsert it again
you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.799> crack<00:02:27.370> forming<00:02:27.879> this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
you can see that crack forming this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.149 
you can see that crack forming this
would<00:02:28.239> happen<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.510> be<00:02:28.569> previous<00:02:29.079> cell<00:02:29.409> just

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
would happen to be previous cell just

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.789 
would happen to be previous cell just
forms<00:02:30.700> cracks<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.540> acrylic<00:02:32.260> plastic

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
forms cracks in this acrylic plastic

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.180 
forms cracks in this acrylic plastic
here<00:02:34.290> okay<00:02:35.290> as<00:02:35.349> you<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.560> see<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.829> fairly

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
here okay as you can see it's fairly

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.710 
here okay as you can see it's fairly
clean<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.879> little<00:02:37.060> bit<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.209> calcium<00:02:37.629> on

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
clean just a little bit of calcium on

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.390 
clean just a little bit of calcium on
the<00:02:37.810> back<00:02:38.049> but<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.799> plates<00:02:39.099> are<00:02:39.280> actually

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
the back but the plates are actually

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.789 
the back but the plates are actually
really<00:02:39.819> clean<00:02:40.390> I'm<00:02:41.079> going<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> turn<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.680> on

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
really clean I'm going to turn it on

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:51.870 
really clean I'm going to turn it on
real<00:02:42.040> quick<00:02:45.359> check<00:02:46.359> for<00:02:46.540> any

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.430 

here<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> o-rings<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:54.060> perfect<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
here in the o-rings so perfect and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.140 
here in the o-rings so perfect and
so<00:02:57.980> again<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.460> a<00:02:58.550> really<00:02:58.790> good<00:02:58.940> system

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
so again this is a really good system

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.530 
so again this is a really good system
for<00:02:59.710> $20,000<00:03:00.710> or<00:03:00.860> less<00:03:01.010> pool<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.670> it's<00:03:02.270> this

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
for $20,000 or less pool and it's this

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.670 
for $20,000 or less pool and it's this
you<00:03:02.720> know<00:03:02.750> eight<00:03:02.990> years<00:03:03.020> old<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.650> still

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
you know eight years old and it's still

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.650 
you know eight years old and it's still
functioning<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.760> just<00:03:04.970> has<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> little<00:03:05.390> bit<00:03:05.570> of

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
functioning it just has a little bit of

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.910 
functioning it just has a little bit of
the<00:03:05.780> cell<00:03:05.990> defect<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:08.570> one<00:03:09.440> last<00:03:09.710> thing<00:03:09.860> about

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the cell defect and one last thing about

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.860 
the cell defect and one last thing about
cleaning<00:03:10.850> cells<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.390> don't<00:03:11.510> want<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.690> take

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
cleaning cells you don't want to take

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.260 
cleaning cells you don't want to take
any<00:03:11.990> kind<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.260> screwdriver<00:03:12.770> or<00:03:13.130> any<00:03:14.030> kind<00:03:14.210> of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
any kind of screwdriver or any kind of

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.150 
any kind of screwdriver or any kind of
butter<00:03:15.140> knife<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.620> there<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.800> get<00:03:15.920> those

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
butter knife and there to get those

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.560 
butter knife and there to get those
calcium<00:03:16.490> out<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.820> plates<00:03:17.150> you'll<00:03:17.330> ruin

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
calcium out of the plates you'll ruin

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.600 
calcium out of the plates you'll ruin
the<00:03:17.870> system<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:18.560> just<00:03:18.800> let<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:18.950> acid<00:03:19.370> do<00:03:19.460> its

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
the system so just let the acid do its

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.760 
the system so just let the acid do its
work<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.150> if<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.900> needs<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:21.110> second<00:03:21.440> cleaning

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
work and if it needs a second cleaning

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.080 
work and if it needs a second cleaning
wait<00:03:22.130> about<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.370> month<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.820> do<00:03:22.910> another

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
wait about a month and do another

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.570 
wait about a month and do another
cleaning
