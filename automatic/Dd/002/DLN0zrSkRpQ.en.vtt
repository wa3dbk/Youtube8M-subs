different meanings we use them all the

different meanings we use them all the

motivation<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.859> talk<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
motivation I want to talk about the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.769 
motivation I want to talk about the
difference<00:00:20.730> between<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.180> two<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.570> how<00:00:21.720> you

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
difference between the two and how you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
difference between the two and how you
can<00:00:22.109> put<00:00:22.260> both<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.560> them<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.039> good<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.279> for

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
can put both of them to good use for

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.730 
can put both of them to good use for
yourself<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.420> whatever<00:00:24.900> endeavors<00:00:25.590> you're

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
yourself and whatever endeavors you're

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.390 
yourself and whatever endeavors you're
involved<00:00:26.189> now<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.880> belief<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:28.099> when<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.250> have

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
involved now a belief is when you have

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.640 
involved now a belief is when you have
an<00:00:29.609> expectation<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.660> something<00:00:31.109> happening

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
an expectation of something happening

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.040 
an expectation of something happening
because<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.329> proof<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
because there is some proof of it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.870 
because there is some proof of it
whether<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.649> proof<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:35.579> past

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
whether that's proof from your past

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
whether that's proof from your past
proof<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.899> something<00:00:37.079> us<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> your<00:00:37.710> present

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
proof of something us and your present

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
proof of something us and your present
proof<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.640> some<00:00:38.820> ability<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
proof of some ability that you have if I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.690 
proof of some ability that you have if I
asked<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.770> could<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.040> put<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.489> shoes

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
asked you could you put on your shoes

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
asked you could you put on your shoes
and<00:00:41.969> tie<00:00:42.149> your<00:00:42.360> shoes<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.960> double<00:00:43.379> knot

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and tie your shoes into a double knot

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.500 
and tie your shoes into a double knot
you<00:00:44.129> probably<00:00:44.520> would<00:00:44.730> say<00:00:44.879> yeah<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you probably would say yeah because you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
you probably would say yeah because you
have<00:00:45.660> belief<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> could<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> because

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
have belief you could do it because

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040 
have belief you could do it because
there's<00:00:47.219> an<00:00:47.370> example<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.600> pet<00:00:48.809> last

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
there's an example of the pet last

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.560 
there's an example of the pet last
hundreds<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.890> has<00:00:50.370> hundreds<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.000> thousands<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
hundreds I has hundreds and thousands of

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
hundreds I has hundreds and thousands of
times<00:00:51.809> you've<00:00:52.110> done<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.800> life<00:00:52.980> that's

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
times you've done it in your life that's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.400 
times you've done it in your life that's
a<00:00:53.460> belief<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.000> means<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.899> reason

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a belief that means you have some reason

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
a belief that means you have some reason
to<00:00:55.530> expect<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> happen

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to expect that this is going to happen

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.229 
to expect that this is going to happen
there's<00:00:58.050> something<00:00:58.500> around<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> says<00:00:59.430> yes

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there's something around you to says yes

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
there's something around you to says yes
not<00:01:00.719> only<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.440> mind<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:01.949> expecting<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
not only in my mind and my expecting it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
not only in my mind and my expecting it
but<00:01:02.609> here's<00:01:02.969> artist<00:01:03.570> proof<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
but here's artist proof that is going to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
but here's artist proof that is going to
happen<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> belief<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.360> faith

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
happen that's what a belief is now faith

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.940 
happen that's what a belief is now faith
on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> other<00:01:07.229> hand<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.650> something

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
on the other hand is something

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.000 
on the other hand is something
completely<00:01:08.369> different<00:01:08.610> faith<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.860> also<00:01:10.860> an

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
completely different faith is also an

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
completely different faith is also an
expectation<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.570> faith<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.869> an<00:01:13.170> expectation

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
expectation but faith is an expectation

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
expectation but faith is an expectation
that<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.820> no<00:01:14.850> proof

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that you have when there is no proof

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
that you have when there is no proof
that<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> happen<00:01:16.950> there's<00:01:17.369> nothing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that is going to happen there's nothing

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
that is going to happen there's nothing
around<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> guarantees<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
around you that guarantees is going to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.399 
around you that guarantees is going to
happen<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.909> still<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:21.960> expectation

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
happen but you still have an expectation

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.270 
happen but you still have an expectation
that<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.549> good<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.720> positive

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
that is going to go good is a positive

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.740 
that is going to go good is a positive
expectation<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:27.360> people<00:01:27.600> talk

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
expectation it's like when people talk

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990 
expectation it's like when people talk
about<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.229> positive<00:01:28.650> positive<00:01:29.280> mindset

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
about a positive positive mindset

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
about a positive positive mindset
instead<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> negative<00:01:30.780> mindset<00:01:31.530> or

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
instead of a negative mindset or

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
instead of a negative mindset or
positive<00:01:32.640> thinking<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.570> have

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
positive thinking is when you just have

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
positive thinking is when you just have
an<00:01:34.560> expectation<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.490> something<00:01:35.880> good

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
an expectation of something good

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
an expectation of something good
happening<00:01:36.659> even<00:01:36.930> though<00:01:37.079> there's<00:01:37.470> no<00:01:37.770> proof

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
happening even though there's no proof

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.039 
happening even though there's no proof
that<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.299> good<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.750> could<00:01:39.900> just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that is going to be good it could just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.350 
that is going to be good it could just
as<00:01:40.229> well<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.650> bad<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.220> much<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.030> could<00:01:42.150> go

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
as well go bad as much as it could go

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
as well go bad as much as it could go

guarantee<00:01:53.970> they're<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.360> win<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:54.750> could

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
guarantee they're gonna win they could

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.719 
guarantee they're gonna win they could
just<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.320> well<00:01:55.350> who's<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.250> easily<00:01:56.490> as

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
just as well who's just as easily as

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.550 
just as well who's just as easily as
they<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:57.060> win<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.290> faith

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
they can win that's when you have faith

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
they can win that's when you have faith
or<00:01:59.040> even<00:01:59.610> better<00:01:59.790> example<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.630> you're

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
or even better example is if you're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.929 
or even better example is if you're
looking<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.200> something<00:02:01.469> where<00:02:01.829> there's<00:02:02.579> never

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
looking at something where there's never

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.490 
looking at something where there's never
been<00:02:03.060> any<00:02:03.329> success<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.079> you're<00:02:04.200> looking<00:02:04.409> at

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
been any success if you're looking at

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
been any success if you're looking at
two<00:02:04.649> sports<00:02:04.979> teams<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> championship<00:02:05.880> they

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
two sports teams in a championship they

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
two sports teams in a championship they
both<00:02:06.329> done<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> lot<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.869> winning<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.439> there's<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
both done a lot of winning so there's a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.290 
both done a lot of winning so there's a
reason<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:08.759> could<00:02:08.910> both<00:02:09.030> win

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
reason to think that they could both win

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.040 
reason to think that they could both win
so<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> could<00:02:09.720> also<00:02:09.929> call<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> belief

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
so you could also call that a belief

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.430 
so you could also call that a belief
a<00:02:11.170> faith<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:12.040> when<00:02:12.280> faith<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:13.030> when<00:02:13.450> there's<00:02:14.080> no

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
a faith is when faith is when there's no

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.430 
a faith is when faith is when there's no
proof<00:02:14.770> whatsoever<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.600> certain<00:02:16.960> thing<00:02:17.290> is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
proof whatsoever that a certain thing is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960 
proof whatsoever that a certain thing is
going<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.740> happen<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.490> still<00:02:18.730> have<00:02:18.850> the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
going to happen but you still have the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.360 
going to happen but you still have the
positive<00:02:19.510> expectation<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.070> could<00:02:21.250> talk

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
positive expectation if I could talk

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.010 
positive expectation if I could talk
about<00:02:21.640> faith<00:02:21.940> if<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.270> talk<00:02:22.480> about<00:02:22.510> something

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
about faith if I talk about something

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.480 
about faith if I talk about something
from<00:02:23.170> my<00:02:23.260> own<00:02:23.410> life<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.920> wanted<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.370> get

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
from my own life and I wanted to get

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.170 
from my own life and I wanted to get
into<00:02:24.750> playing<00:02:25.750> even<00:02:26.650> college<00:02:27.070> basketball<00:02:27.640> but

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
into playing even college basketball but

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.430 
into playing even college basketball but
I<00:02:28.210> can<00:02:28.330> talk<00:02:28.420> about<00:02:28.660> every<00:02:28.870> level<00:02:29.140> my<00:02:29.260> mother

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
I can talk about every level my mother

I can talk about every level my mother

that next level when I finally made the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
team in high school before I made the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
team I didn't really have much proof in

team I didn't really have much proof in

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
my life that said I was good enough to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.000 
my life that said I was good enough to
make<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.750> team<00:02:50.050> actually<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.650> had<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> lot<00:02:50.950> of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
make the team actually I had a lot of

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.190 
make the team actually I had a lot of
negative<00:02:51.490> proof<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.390> said<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> wasn't<00:02:52.960> good

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
negative proof that said I wasn't good

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.930 
negative proof that said I wasn't good
enough<00:02:53.230> because<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.650> tried<00:02:53.920> out<00:02:54.070> for<00:02:54.190> 33<00:02:54.820> years

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
enough because I tried out for 33 years

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.300 
enough because I tried out for 33 years
straight<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.450> didn't<00:02:56.140> make<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.620> then

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
straight and didn't make it and then

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.950 
straight and didn't make it and then
when<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.610> was<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.120> go<00:02:58.240> into<00:02:58.420> college

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
when I was going to go into college

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.720 
when I was going to go into college
there<00:02:59.680> was<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.830> lot<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.070> negative<00:03:00.520> proof

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
there was a lot of negative proof

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.070 
there was a lot of negative proof
because<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:00.970> hadn't<00:03:01.330> been<00:03:01.450> recruited<00:03:01.930> no

anybody<00:03:11.770> else<00:03:12.190> there<00:03:12.760> was<00:03:12.940> no<00:03:13.120> proof<00:03:13.450> there

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
anybody else there was no proof there

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.870 
anybody else there was no proof there
was<00:03:13.780> no<00:03:13.960> reason<00:03:14.320> for<00:03:14.500> me<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.620> believe<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.550> I

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
was no reason for me to believe that I

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.550 
was no reason for me to believe that I
can<00:03:16.120> make<00:03:16.270> that<00:03:16.450> team<00:03:16.690> until<00:03:17.020> I<00:03:17.080> walked<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
can make that team until I walked in the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.990 
can make that team until I walked in the
Germans<00:03:17.950> started<00:03:18.070> proving<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.730> with<00:03:18.850> my

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
Germans started proving it with my

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.510 
Germans started proving it with my
skills<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.750> had<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.470> faith<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.739> walk<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:21.280> and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
skills I had the faith to walk in and

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.979 
skills I had the faith to walk in and
say<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.640> can<00:03:21.970> do<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.270> even<00:03:22.540> though<00:03:22.660> there<00:03:22.870> was

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
say I can do this even though there was

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.140 
say I can do this even though there was
no<00:03:23.140> proof<00:03:23.440> now<00:03:23.950> once<00:03:24.190> i<00:03:24.310> started<00:03:24.640> proving<00:03:25.060> it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
no proof now once i started proving it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.850 
no proof now once i started proving it
before<00:03:25.570> tryouts<00:03:25.840> then<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.350> start<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.709> have<00:03:26.770> a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
before tryouts then I start to have a

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.160 
before tryouts then I start to have a
belief<00:03:27.250> because<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.640> saw<00:03:27.880> y'all<00:03:28.720> better<00:03:28.959> than

about<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.400> proves<00:03:33.670> there's<00:03:34.030> also<00:03:34.300> a<00:03:34.540> lot<00:03:34.660> of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
about the proves there's also a lot of

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.690 
about the proves there's also a lot of
negative<00:03:35.290> belief<00:03:35.890> there<00:03:36.160> was<00:03:36.280> negative

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
negative belief there was negative

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.160

going to happen but I had faith that it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.520 
going to happen but I had faith that it
was<00:04:07.180> going<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.510> happen<00:04:07.600> once<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.170> started

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
was going to happen once I started

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.729 
was going to happen once I started
taking<00:04:08.680> action<00:04:09.400> based<00:04:10.060> on<00:04:10.390> my<00:04:10.570> faith<00:04:10.900> then<00:04:11.709> I

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
taking action based on my faith then I

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.520 
taking action based on my faith then I
was<00:04:12.010> able<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.459> generate<00:04:13.120> belief<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.959> myself

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
was able to generate belief in myself

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.560 
was able to generate belief in myself
first<00:04:15.220> once<00:04:15.580> i<00:04:15.700> generated<00:04:16.090> belief<00:04:16.330> in<00:04:16.450> myself

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
first once i generated belief in myself

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.810 
first once i generated belief in myself
and<00:04:17.109> other<00:04:17.620> people<00:04:17.739> saw<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.280> they<00:04:18.459> saw<00:04:18.760> the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
and other people saw it they saw the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.279 
and other people saw it they saw the
actions<00:04:19.270> I<00:04:19.359> was<00:04:19.479> taking<00:04:19.750> because<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.049> that

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
actions I was taking because of that

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.170 
actions I was taking because of that
belief<00:04:20.440> then<00:04:21.130> other<00:04:21.400> people<00:04:21.609> started<00:04:22.090> to

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
belief then other people started to

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.629 
belief then other people started to
believe<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:22.660> it's<00:04:22.810> kind<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.050> like

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
believe so it's kind of like

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.219 
believe so it's kind of like
it's<00:04:24.030> kind<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.240> like<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.389> snowball<00:04:24.719> going

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
it's kind of like a snowball going

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.920 
it's kind of like a snowball going
downhill<00:04:25.499> so<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> point<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.300> us<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.659> you<00:04:27.780> can

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
downhill so the point of us that you can

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.469 
downhill so the point of us that you can
take<00:04:28.139> from<00:04:28.289> this<00:04:28.499> is<00:04:29.120> even<00:04:30.120> if<00:04:30.270> there's

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
take from this is even if there's

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.149 
take from this is even if there's
nothing<00:04:30.719> in<00:04:31.050> your<00:04:31.080> orbit<00:04:31.499> nothing<00:04:32.039> has

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
nothing in your orbit nothing has

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.769 
nothing in your orbit nothing has
happened<00:04:32.490> in<00:04:32.580> your<00:04:32.699> past<00:04:32.729> nothing<00:04:33.419> happening

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:33.779 
happened in your past nothing happening

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.170 
happened in your past nothing happening
in<00:04:33.930> your<00:04:34.110> present<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:35.189> is<00:04:35.430> proof<00:04:35.789> that<00:04:35.819> you

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
in your present that is proof that you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.730 
in your present that is proof that you
can<00:04:36.330> make<00:04:36.629> something<00:04:36.900> happen<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.379> you<00:04:37.469> can

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
can make something happen that you can

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.800 
can make something happen that you can
do<00:04:37.889> something<00:04:38.189> that<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.610> can<00:04:38.819> acquire

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
do something that you can acquire

practice faith you can use the law of
faith<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.669> you<00:04:48.419> can<00:04:48.629> start<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.069> when<00:04:50.069> you<00:04:50.189> have

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
faith and you can start to when you have

faith and you can start to when you have

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
though there's no proof you can start to

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.580 
though there's no proof you can start to
take<00:04:54.029> actions<00:04:54.569> on<00:04:54.719> your<00:04:54.749> faith<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.379> when<00:04:55.529> you

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
take actions on your faith and when you

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.260 
take actions on your faith and when you
take<00:04:55.800> actions<00:04:56.250> on<00:04:56.400> your<00:04:56.430> faith<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:56.819> you<00:04:57.029> start

take actions on your faith and you start

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.179 
take actions on your faith and you start
to<00:04:57.300> make<00:04:57.479> positive<00:04:57.719> things<00:04:58.229> happen<00:04:58.680> you'll

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
to make positive things happen you'll

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.709 
to make positive things happen you'll
start<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.520> develop<00:04:59.729> a<00:05:00.090> small<00:05:00.389> amount<00:05:00.659> of

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
start to develop a small amount of

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.570 
start to develop a small amount of
belief<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.199> yourself<00:05:01.430> there's<00:05:02.430> the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
belief in yourself there's the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.890 
belief in yourself there's the
difference<00:05:02.909> between<00:05:03.000> faith<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.449> belief

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
difference between faith and belief

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.379 
difference between faith and belief
there's<00:05:04.259> no<00:05:04.469> proof<00:05:04.770> than<00:05:05.009> its<00:05:05.159> faith<00:05:05.370> now<00:05:06.180> once

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
there's no proof than its faith now once

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.939 
there's no proof than its faith now once
you<00:05:06.479> start<00:05:06.750> doing<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.169> you<00:05:07.379> had<00:05:07.529> some<00:05:07.740> proof

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
you start doing it you had some proof

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.610 
you start doing it you had some proof
then<00:05:08.189> it<00:05:08.279> becomes<00:05:08.580> belief<00:05:09.000> once<00:05:09.719> you<00:05:09.870> start<00:05:10.590> to

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
then it becomes belief once you start to

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.769 
then it becomes belief once you start to
generate<00:05:10.889> that<00:05:11.219> belief<00:05:11.520> in<00:05:11.699> yourself<00:05:11.819> the

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
generate that belief in yourself the

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.360 
generate that belief in yourself the
actions<00:05:13.229> that<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.409> take<00:05:13.560> because<00:05:14.129> of<00:05:14.250> that

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
actions that you take because of that

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
start to generate some actual proof some

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.679 
start to generate some actual proof some
tangible<00:05:20.310> proof<00:05:20.639> that<00:05:20.939> other<00:05:21.120> people<00:05:21.509> can<00:05:21.659> see

of you being able to do something they

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.279 
of you being able to do something they

start believing they start believing in

believing in you there's a snowball

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.760 
believing in you there's a snowball
effect<00:05:32.789> it<00:05:33.210> just<00:05:33.419> keeps<00:05:33.659> going<00:05:33.750> as<00:05:34.110> momentum

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
effect it just keeps going as momentum

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.769 
effect it just keeps going as momentum
and<00:05:34.949> we<00:05:35.490> talked<00:05:35.759> about<00:05:35.879> momentum<00:05:36.300> in<00:05:36.629> these

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
and we talked about momentum in these

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.300 
and we talked about momentum in these
videos<00:05:36.930> before<00:05:37.319> you've<00:05:37.560> been<00:05:37.860> looking<00:05:37.979> one<00:05:38.250> of

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
videos before you've been looking one of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.249 
videos before you've been looking one of
my<00:05:38.370> old<00:05:38.580> working<00:05:39.330> motivations<00:05:39.899> where<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.050> talk

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
my old working motivations where I talk

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.600 
my old working motivations where I talk
about<00:05:40.289> momentum<00:05:40.800> once<00:05:41.159> you<00:05:41.310> get<00:05:41.490> that

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
about momentum once you get that

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.610 
about momentum once you get that
momentum<00:05:42.000> moving<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.659> the<00:05:42.810> law<00:05:42.930> of<00:05:42.960> inertia<00:05:43.319> is

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
momentum moving is the law of inertia is

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.170 
momentum moving is the law of inertia is
just<00:05:43.830> going<00:05:43.949> to<00:05:44.039> keep<00:05:44.219> going<00:05:44.279> and<00:05:44.789> going<00:05:44.849> and

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
just going to keep going and going and

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.240 
just going to keep going and going and
going<00:05:45.270> so<00:05:46.020> that's<00:05:46.259> how<00:05:46.379> you<00:05:46.439> can<00:05:46.560> use<00:05:46.860> faith

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
going so that's how you can use faith

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.980 
going so that's how you can use faith
and<00:05:47.520> belief<00:05:47.849> you<00:05:48.029> got<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.300> start<00:05:48.569> with<00:05:48.779> faith

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
and belief you got to start with faith

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.079 
and belief you got to start with faith
there's<00:05:49.319> no<00:05:49.589> proof<00:05:49.889> the<00:05:50.520> faith<00:05:50.729> becomes

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.089 
there's no proof the faith becomes

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:53.179 
there's no proof the faith becomes
belief<00:05:51.449> in<00:05:51.629> yourself<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:52.289> I<00:05:52.740> belief<00:05:53.039> in

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
belief in yourself and I belief in

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.159 
belief in yourself and I belief in
yourself<00:05:53.279> and<00:05:53.849> turn<00:05:54.149> transfer<00:05:54.779> itself<00:05:55.050> to

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
yourself and turn transfer itself to

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.629 
yourself and turn transfer itself to
belief<00:05:55.500> in<00:05:55.620> other<00:05:55.830> people<00:05:56.250> so<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.460> more

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
belief in other people so the more

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.059 
belief in other people so the more
belief<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:56.939> have<00:05:57.089> in<00:05:57.449> yourself<00:05:57.870> because<00:05:58.740> it

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
belief you have in yourself because it

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:00.800 
belief you have in yourself because it

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
you had in yourself the more you'll be

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.100 
you had in yourself the more you'll be
able<00:06:02.849> to<00:06:03.000> transfer<00:06:03.389> that<00:06:03.419> belief<00:06:03.810> to<00:06:03.960> other

people<00:06:04.500> and<00:06:04.560> more<00:06:04.830> people<00:06:04.889> start<00:06:05.399> to<00:06:05.490> believe

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
people and more people start to believe
