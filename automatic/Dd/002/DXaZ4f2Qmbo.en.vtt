that<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.759> maze<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.000> actually<00:00:12.509> pretty<00:00:12.990> good

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
that this maze is actually pretty good

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.259 
that this maze is actually pretty good
so<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.280> might<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.549> worth<00:00:14.700> your<00:00:14.849> while<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.030> do

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
so it might be worth your while to do

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.090 
so it might be worth your while to do
especially<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.740> probably<00:00:16.890> one

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
especially because this is probably one

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.010 
especially because this is probably one
of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> easiest<00:00:17.279> legendary<00:00:18.270> items<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.779> farm

of the easiest legendary items to farm

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.740 
of the easiest legendary items to farm
in<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> game<00:00:19.470> because<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.760> one<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.240> drops<00:00:21.539> off

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
in the game because for one it drops off

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.370 
in the game because for one it drops off
of<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:23.119> mallet<00:00:24.119> Lord<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.170> you're<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
of a mallet Lord and so if you're a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.529 
of a mallet Lord and so if you're a
range<00:00:25.710> class<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.310> my<00:00:26.490> Lords<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.090> basically

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
range class like my Lords are basically

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.640 
range class like my Lords are basically
like<00:00:28.010> just<00:00:29.359> big<00:00:30.359> useless<00:00:30.929> pieces<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.439> shit

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
like just big useless pieces of shit

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.959 
like just big useless pieces of shit
that<00:00:31.830> don't<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.130> anything<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.790> don't<00:00:32.850> even

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
that don't do anything like I don't even

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.580 
that don't do anything like I don't even
have<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.450> believe<00:00:33.960> you're<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.230> easy<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
kill is what I'm trying to say and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
kill is what I'm trying to say and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
basically you have to check in the apt

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.360 
basically you have to check in the apt
for<00:00:38.790> bounties<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> basically<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.920> act<00:00:41.160> 4

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
for bounties and basically because act 4

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.819 
for bounties and basically because act 4

rift bounty like I've never done it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.109 
rift bounty like I've never done it
where<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> didn't<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> hell<00:01:41.670> Rick<00:01:41.820> bounty

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
where I didn't get a hell Rick bounty

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
where I didn't get a hell Rick bounty
and<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.170> want<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> high

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and so you want to do this on a high

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
and so you want to do this on a high
torment<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.850> again<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> also<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
torment but again you also want to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.929 
torment but again you also want to
maximize<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.590> efficiency<00:01:47.130> because<00:01:47.790> you're

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
maximize for efficiency because you're

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.460 
maximize for efficiency because you're
going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.180> doing<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.659> many<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.020> these<00:01:49.140> runs

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
going to be doing so many of these runs

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.539 
going to be doing so many of these runs
it<00:01:49.740> sound<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.280> fighting

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it sound like if you're fighting

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.399 
it sound like if you're fighting
something<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.420> difficult<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.110> find

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
something that's very difficult to find

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
something that's very difficult to find
and<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.829> finally<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.250> find<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and so finally you find it and so you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.889 
and so finally you find it and so you
won't<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:54.360> best<00:01:54.540> chance<00:01:54.720> possible

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
won't have your best chance possible

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
won't have your best chance possible
you're<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> million<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.520> these

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you're going to do in a million of these

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.359 
you're going to do in a million of these
and<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.390> honestly<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.079> by<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.920> way<00:01:59.070> like

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and so honestly like by the way like

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.249 
and so honestly like by the way like
that<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.090> those<00:02:00.299> demonic<00:02:00.659> vessels

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that so you see those demonic vessels

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.870 
that so you see those demonic vessels
I'm<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> tell<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.770> guys<00:02:01.979> something<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
I'm going to tell you guys something is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.630 
I'm going to tell you guys something is
that<00:02:03.149> they<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:03.479> count<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.110> vases<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.950> so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that they now count as vases and so

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.359 
that they now count as vases and so
because<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.659> count<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.049> basis<00:02:07.590> they're<00:02:08.160> not

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
because they count as basis they're not

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.710 
because they count as basis they're not
really<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> give<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.090> very<00:02:09.300> good<00:02:09.390> loot

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
really going to give you very good loot

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.059 
really going to give you very good loot
and<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.200> there's<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:10.739> much<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and so there's not really much of a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.290 
and so there's not really much of a
point<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.580> opening<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> demonic<00:02:12.840> vessel

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
point of opening the demonic vessel

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.790 
point of opening the demonic vessel
there's<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.320> much<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.620> point<00:02:14.710> of

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
there's just as much of a point of

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.140 
there's just as much of a point of
opening<00:02:15.100> demonic<00:02:15.400> vessels<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.820> see<00:02:16.000> there

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
opening demonic vessels to see there

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.000 
opening demonic vessels to see there
would<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.420> point<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.780> like<00:02:16.930> opening<00:02:17.590> bases

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
would be a point of like opening bases

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.310 
would be a point of like opening bases
and<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.460> really<00:02:19.390> it's<00:02:19.630> not<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.990> big<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.200> a

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
and so really it's not that big of a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.770 
and so really it's not that big of a
deal<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.740> anymore<00:02:20.980> little<00:02:21.790> fact<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.660> might

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
deal to do anymore little fact you might

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.020 
deal to do anymore little fact you might
want<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.080> when<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.010> not<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.550> other<00:02:24.580> chest

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
want to when I not do it the other chest

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.130 
want to when I not do it the other chest
that<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.270> one<00:02:25.390> up<00:02:25.480> above<00:02:25.600> me<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.110> just

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that the one up above me that I just

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.470 
that the one up above me that I just
ignored<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.830> forgot<00:02:27.130> about<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.910> one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
ignored and forgot about that one

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.420 
ignored and forgot about that one
actually<00:02:28.720> would<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.160> possibly<00:02:30.160> got<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
actually would have possibly got the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.400 
actually would have possibly got the
legendary<00:02:30.820> for<00:02:31.000> me<00:02:31.090> maybe<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.540> zoo<00:02:32.200> wrath

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
legendary for me maybe the zoo wrath

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.170 
legendary for me maybe the zoo wrath
that<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.680> wanted<00:02:33.010> since<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.580> before<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> game

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
