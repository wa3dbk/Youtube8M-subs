really<00:01:20.460> odd<00:01:20.909> having<00:01:21.210> eyebrows<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
really odd having eyebrows out here I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.870

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so why don't we say you should put it on

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.640 
so why don't we say you should put it on
the<00:01:26.040> side<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.520> nose<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> making<00:01:28.439> other

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the side of your nose so making other

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
the side of your nose so making other
keeps<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.009> side<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.460> eye<00:01:29.610> but

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
angular in was slightly well you can do

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
angular in was slightly well you can do
to<00:01:33.060> put<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> mark<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.280> hope<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.850> can

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
put a line there as well

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
put a line there as well
so<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.539> sure<00:02:09.569> these<00:02:09.959> two<00:02:10.289> lines

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
so you need to make sure these two lines

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
so you need to make sure these two lines
exactly<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.370> same<00:02:11.580> line<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
exactly the same line this one is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.120 
exactly the same line this one is
slightly<00:02:12.989> longer<00:02:13.319> just<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> can

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
slightly longer just so then you can

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.460 
slightly longer just so then you can
have<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> thickness<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.970> business<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.319> what

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
have a thickness and a business so what

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.140 
have a thickness and a business so what
you<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.770> it's<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.220> much<00:02:18.050> these<00:02:19.050> lines

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you do it's just much these lines

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.660 
you do it's just much these lines
together<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.850> can<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:26.340> mama
