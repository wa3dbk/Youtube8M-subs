like<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.770> angelic<00:01:55.700> dusting<00:01:56.030> hand<00:01:56.300> but<00:01:56.630> he<00:01:57.320> does

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
like a angelic dusting hand but he does

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.120 
like a angelic dusting hand but he does
have<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:58.070> stalker<00:01:58.880> but<00:01:59.290> I<00:02:00.290> think<00:02:00.530> he<00:02:00.860> also<00:02:00.980> has

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
have a stalker but I think he also has

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.080 
have a stalker but I think he also has
the<00:02:01.220> spectral<00:02:01.550> flight<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:01.820> i<00:02:01.880> think<00:02:01.940> you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
the spectral flight so i think you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.850 
the spectral flight so i think you
should<00:02:02.150> play<00:02:02.360> special<00:02:02.780> flight<00:02:02.990> rather<00:02:03.380> than<00:02:03.590> a

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
should play special flight rather than a

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.760 
should play special flight rather than a
second<00:02:04.430> stalker<00:02:04.670> here<00:02:05.380> yeah<00:02:06.380> he<00:02:06.470> does<00:02:06.590> have<00:02:06.680> a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
second stalker here yeah he does have a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.719 
second stalker here yeah he does have a
spectral<00:02:07.070> flight<00:02:07.250> right<00:02:07.370> there<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.580> go<00:02:07.670> to

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
spectral flight right there you go to

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.940 
spectral flight right there you go to
the<00:02:07.909> second<00:02:08.269> stalker<00:02:08.509> instead<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.319> think

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
the second stalker instead I think

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.729 
the second stalker instead I think
spectral<00:02:10.340> flight<00:02:10.550> just<00:02:10.789> start<00:02:11.060> racing

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
spectral flight just start racing

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.740 
spectral flight just start racing
against<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:13.780> delver<00:02:14.780> might<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.620> better<00:02:16.750> thought

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
against a delver might be better thought

the mana but that just feels kind of
wasted<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.350> me<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.709> think<00:04:07.130> needs<00:04:07.280> some<00:04:07.459> sort<00:04:07.670> of

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
wasted to me I think needs some sort of

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.569 
wasted to me I think needs some sort of
draw<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.600> think<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.959> bat<00:04:09.290> type<00:04:09.799> agritech<00:04:10.310> can

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
draw but I think a bat type agritech can

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.710 
draw but I think a bat type agritech can
get<00:04:10.820> there<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.209> think<00:04:12.010> maybe<00:04:13.329> not<00:04:14.329> so<00:04:14.450> much<00:04:14.510> go

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
get there I think maybe not so much go

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.690 
get there I think maybe not so much go
the<00:04:14.840> hex<00:04:15.019> proof<00:04:15.260> route<00:04:15.500> maybe<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.280> know<00:04:16.370> slap

a warrant piece next turn and start

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.719 
a warrant piece next turn and start
slamming<00:05:24.840> in<00:05:24.930> with<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.340> it's<00:05:26.340> definitely

slamming in with that it's definitely

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.360 
slamming in with that it's definitely
much<00:05:26.819> better<00:05:27.139> for<00:05:28.139> it<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.379> be<00:05:28.500> on<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.710> coasting

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
much better for it to be on a coasting

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.140

traffic than eight invisible stalker so

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.969 
traffic than eight invisible stalker so
let's<00:05:33.389> see<00:05:33.599> what<00:05:33.629> he<00:05:33.810> does<00:05:33.870> here<00:05:33.990> if<00:05:34.710> he<00:05:34.770> takes

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
let's see what he does here if he takes

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.089 
let's see what he does here if he takes
it<00:05:35.219> it'll<00:05:35.430> go<00:05:35.520> down<00:05:35.550> for<00:05:36.389> I<00:05:36.629> feel<00:05:37.469> block<00:05:37.740> so<00:05:37.949> go

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
it it'll go down for I feel block so go

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.790 
it it'll go down for I feel block so go
down<00:05:38.279> to<00:05:38.430> six<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.930> i<00:05:39.990> assume<00:05:40.169> he's<00:05:40.379> just<00:05:40.710> going

is man is rough and there's no real

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.760 
is man is rough and there's no real
removal<00:06:08.029> definitely<00:06:09.029> something<00:06:09.149> that<00:06:09.770> needs

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
removal definitely something that needs

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.149 
removal definitely something that needs
to<00:06:11.159> be<00:06:11.490> in<00:06:11.580> there<00:06:11.610> stex<00:06:12.180> just<00:06:12.360> looking<00:06:12.599> at<00:06:12.719> you

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
to be in there stex just looking at you

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.200 
to be in there stex just looking at you
get<00:06:14.159> those<00:06:14.279> hexproof<00:06:14.550> creatures<00:06:15.060> out<00:06:15.180> there

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
get those hexproof creatures out there

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.659 
get those hexproof creatures out there
and<00:06:15.659> start<00:06:16.319> slamming<00:06:16.800> and<00:06:16.889> damage<00:06:17.159> as<00:06:17.310> fast<00:06:17.520> as

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
and start slamming and damage as fast as

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.889 
and start slamming and damage as fast as
possible<00:06:17.879> it's<00:06:18.210> kind<00:06:18.389> of<00:06:18.419> like<00:06:18.539> a<00:06:18.599> deck<00:06:18.870> that

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:18.899 
possible it's kind of like a deck that

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:22.939 
possible it's kind of like a deck that
just<00:06:19.199> races<00:06:19.909> although<00:06:20.909> not<00:06:21.319> top<00:06:22.319> decking<00:06:22.740> very

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
just races although not top decking very

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.519 
just races although not top decking very
well<00:06:23.159> at<00:06:23.310> all<00:06:23.430> and<00:06:23.810> Powell<00:06:24.810> split<00:06:25.169> huntmaster

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529 
well at all and Powell split huntmaster

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.740 
well at all and Powell split huntmaster
so<00:06:26.039> that<00:06:26.819> makes<00:06:27.029> the<00:06:27.149> race<00:06:27.300> a<00:06:27.330> little<00:06:27.659> bit

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
so that makes the race a little bit

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.070 
so that makes the race a little bit
harder<00:06:28.050> especially<00:06:28.229> with<00:06:28.589> just<00:06:28.770> two<00:06:28.949> stalkers

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
harder especially with just two stalkers

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.909 
harder especially with just two stalkers
stalkers<00:06:31.080> one<00:06:31.259> of<00:06:31.349> those<00:06:31.439> cars<00:06:31.620> that<00:06:31.710> I've

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
stalkers one of those cars that I've

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.290 
stalkers one of those cars that I've
played<00:06:32.159> with<00:06:32.339> in<00:06:32.460> the<00:06:32.520> past<00:06:32.669> and<00:06:33.000> different

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
played with in the past and different

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.749 
played with in the past and different
delver<00:06:33.569> builds<00:06:33.899> and<00:06:34.649> I've<00:06:34.740> just<00:06:34.949> never<00:06:35.279> really

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
delver builds and I've just never really

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.529 
delver builds and I've just never really
liked<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.919> to<00:06:37.919> of<00:06:38.159> is<00:06:38.460> probably<00:06:39.300> the<00:06:39.419> right

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
liked it to of is probably the right

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.379 
liked it to of is probably the right
amount<00:06:39.839> in<00:06:39.930> this<00:06:40.050> deck<00:06:40.729> lotsa<00:06:41.729> like<00:06:42.060> i<00:06:42.180> said

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
amount in this deck lotsa like i said

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.879 
amount in this deck lotsa like i said
earlier<00:06:42.539> so<00:06:42.930> lots<00:06:43.169> of<00:06:43.289> ways<00:06:43.439> you<00:06:43.469> can<00:06:43.710> mess

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
earlier so lots of ways you can mess

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.089 
earlier so lots of ways you can mess
around<00:06:43.919> this<00:06:44.250> deck<00:06:44.490> i<00:06:44.729> do<00:06:45.240> like<00:06:45.569> the<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:46.860> base

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
around this deck i do like the the base

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:49.999 
around this deck i do like the the base
of<00:06:47.339> it<00:06:47.430> but<00:06:48.120> i<00:06:48.449> think<00:06:48.810> the<00:06:48.960> shell<00:06:49.199> needs<00:06:49.439> to<00:06:49.710> get

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
of it but i think the shell needs to get

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.119 
of it but i think the shell needs to get
tweaked<00:06:50.789> a<00:06:50.879> little<00:06:50.909> bit<00:06:51.210> here<00:06:51.620> james<00:06:52.620> that<00:06:52.830> six

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.129 
tweaked a little bit here james that six

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.019 
tweaked a little bit here james that six
here<00:06:53.370> facing<00:06:53.610> our<00:06:53.849> master<00:06:54.479> and<00:06:54.659> delvers

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
here facing our master and delvers

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:00.619 
here facing our master and delvers
so<00:06:57.029> if<00:06:57.210> Pat<00:06:57.479> can<00:06:58.460> get<00:06:59.460> a<00:06:59.490> vapor<00:06:59.819> snake<00:07:00.150> here<00:07:00.449> he

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:00.629 
so if Pat can get a vapor snake here he

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.679 
so if Pat can get a vapor snake here he
can<00:07:00.779> swing<00:07:01.229> in<00:07:01.379> for<00:07:01.409> game<00:07:02.219> but<00:07:03.150> does<00:07:03.509> it<00:07:03.629> look

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:03.689 
can swing in for game but does it look

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.450 
can swing in for game but does it look
like<00:07:03.809> he<00:07:03.930> has<00:07:04.110> that<00:07:04.379> so<00:07:04.740> he's<00:07:04.919> gonna<00:07:05.009> swing<00:07:05.249> for

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
like he has that so he's gonna swing for

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.399 
like he has that so he's gonna swing for
three<00:07:05.759> if<00:07:06.599> he<00:07:06.689> doesn't<00:07:06.839> play<00:07:07.020> anything<00:07:07.289> you

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
three if he doesn't play anything you

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:10.369 
three if he doesn't play anything you
just<00:07:07.559> passed<00:07:07.919> the<00:07:08.009> turn<00:07:08.249> it's<00:07:09.180> the<00:07:09.449> Geist<00:07:10.080> and

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:10.379 
just passed the turn it's the Geist and

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.480 
just passed the turn it's the Geist and
then<00:07:10.889> hits<00:07:11.369> james<00:07:11.669> also<00:07:12.649> so<00:07:13.649> it'll<00:07:14.099> be<00:07:14.129> down<00:07:14.279> to

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
then hits james also so it'll be down to

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.939 
then hits james also so it'll be down to
one<00:07:14.520> and<00:07:14.999> if<00:07:15.389> James<00:07:15.809> draws<00:07:16.139> a<00:07:16.199> birdie<00:07:16.740> him

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:16.949 
one and if James draws a birdie him

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:19.689 
one and if James draws a birdie him
possibly<00:07:17.399> block<00:07:18.080> but<00:07:19.080> I<00:07:19.110> don't<00:07:19.289> really<00:07:19.379> think

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:19.699 
possibly block but I don't really think

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.399 
possibly block but I don't really think
you<00:07:20.699> want<00:07:20.819> to<00:07:20.849> be<00:07:20.939> top<00:07:21.119> taking<00:07:21.449> birds<00:07:21.659> here<00:07:21.930> at

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:22.409 
you want to be top taking birds here at

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.070 
you want to be top taking birds here at
this<00:07:22.710> point<00:07:23.210> he<00:07:24.210> has<00:07:24.330> another<00:07:24.569> abundant

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
this point he has another abundant

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.959 
this point he has another abundant
growth<00:07:25.259> and<00:07:25.619> looks<00:07:26.069> like<00:07:26.189> a<00:07:26.219> throne<00:07:26.580> in<00:07:26.729> hand

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:26.969 
growth and looks like a throne in hand

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.029 
growth and looks like a throne in hand
thrown<00:07:27.749> super<00:07:28.080> good<00:07:28.229> against<00:07:28.469> any<00:07:28.680> sort<00:07:28.949> of

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 
thrown super good against any sort of

thrown super good against any sort of
Dover<00:07:29.370> was<00:07:29.969> all<00:07:30.180> that<00:07:30.330> earlier<00:07:30.629> and<00:07:30.809> then<00:07:31.680> slap

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 
Dover was all that earlier and then slap

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.549 
Dover was all that earlier and then slap
on<00:07:32.159> dr.<00:07:32.909> flight<00:07:33.089> on<00:07:33.210> that<00:07:33.419> could<00:07:34.409> have<00:07:34.499> been

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:34.559 
on dr. flight on that could have been

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:37.369 
on dr. flight on that could have been
good<00:07:34.710> but<00:07:35.159> that'll<00:07:36.059> be<00:07:36.149> Game<00:07:36.300> one<00:07:36.509> I<00:07:36.749> hope<00:07:37.229> you
