00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.930 
start out with 6 snowballs and you can
throw<00:00:15.719> these<00:00:15.929> snowballs<00:00:16.260> at<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.070> player<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
ground to spawn cobwebs these snowballs

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
ground to spawn cobwebs these snowballs
can<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.170> replenished<00:00:22.529> from<00:00:22.920> snow<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.609> do

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
can be replenished from snow so you do

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.420 
can be replenished from snow so you do
have<00:00:23.910> an<00:00:24.060> infinite<00:00:24.449> supply<00:00:25.010> but<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.279> only

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
before the person can get to you if they

before the person can get to you if they

kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> screwed<00:00:45.800> ah<00:00:46.969> one<00:00:47.969> thing<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.239> did

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
kind of screwed ah one thing I did

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.510 
kind of screwed ah one thing I did
notice<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:49.079> i<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.320> using<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.829> kit<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
notice when i was using this kit is that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970 
notice when i was using this kit is that
when<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.030> shoot<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> block<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
when you actually shoot at a block the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
when you actually shoot at a block the
cobweb<00:00:53.430> goes<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.329> behind<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.989> block<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
cobweb goes just behind the block you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799 
cobweb goes just behind the block you
shoot<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:57.149> hard<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.600> aim

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
shoot at so it's a little hard to aim

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.590 
shoot at so it's a little hard to aim
and<00:00:58.280> actually<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.489> people<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> cobweb

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and actually get people in the cobweb

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
and actually get people in the cobweb
and<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.829> best<00:01:02.100> way<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> sneak

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and it the best way to do it is to sneak

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.100 
and it the best way to do it is to sneak
up<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.080> someone<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.739> really<00:01:05.869> take<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> time

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
up on someone and really take the time

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.399 
up on someone and really take the time
to<00:01:07.740> focus<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.939> where<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.630> cobwebs<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
to focus on where your cobwebs going to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.399 
to focus on where your cobwebs going to
go<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.240> then<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.510> kill<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:12.930> once<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
go and then you can kill them once you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
go and then you can kill them once you
have<00:01:13.650> gotten<00:01:13.860> them<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> cobweb<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
have gotten them in the cobweb so it's a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.730 
have gotten them in the cobweb so it's a
little<00:01:15.390> inconsistent<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.380> where<00:01:16.590> your

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
little inconsistent on where your

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.300 
little inconsistent on where your
cobwebs<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> hard<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
cobwebs go and it's kind of hard to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.249 
cobwebs go and it's kind of hard to
actually<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.759> people<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.180> cobweb<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:21.960> far

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
actually get people in cobweb from far

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.420 
actually get people in cobweb from far
away<00:01:22.549> or<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.909> they're<00:01:24.060> moving<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.600> general<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
away or if they're moving in general and

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
away or if they're moving in general and
this<00:01:26.430> cobweb<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.479> break<00:01:27.689> cobweb

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this cobweb if you do break cobweb

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.499 
this cobweb if you do break cobweb
obviously<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.310> strings<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.329> make

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
obviously make strings so you can make

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.039 
obviously make strings so you can make
it<00:01:30.570> into<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> bow<00:01:31.430> if<00:01:32.430> you're<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:33.060> guy<00:01:33.540> who<00:01:33.600> likes

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
it into a bow if you're a guy who likes

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
it into a bow if you're a guy who likes
to<00:01:34.350> use<00:01:34.439> bow<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.860> arrows<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:35.970> happen

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
to use bow and arrows or you just happen

someone<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> sky<00:01:38.430> base<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> does<00:01:39.570> open

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
someone off the sky base so it does open

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.950 
someone off the sky base so it does open
up<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.229> whole<00:01:40.640> opportunity<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:42.270> using<00:01:42.600> bow<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
up a whole opportunity for using bow and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.039 
up a whole opportunity for using bow and
arrows<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.439> kit<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.720> use<00:01:45.899> these
