00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
abuse of public resources so these three

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.970 
abuse of public resources so these three
areas<00:02:46.010> are<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.090> top<00:02:47.300> priorities<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.800> is

areas are the top priorities and this is
what<00:02:49.160> we<00:02:49.340> feel<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> base<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
what we feel that is a base the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.790 
what we feel that is a base the
foundation<00:02:52.040> for<00:02:52.790> many<00:02:53.480> more<00:02:53.750> issues<00:02:54.320> that<00:02:54.620> to
