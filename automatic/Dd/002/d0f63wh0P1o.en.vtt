in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.810> video<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.530> be<00:00:01.620> talking<00:00:01.979> about

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
in this video we're to be talking about

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.830 
in this video we're to be talking about
the<00:00:02.340> effects<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.909> displacement<00:00:03.270> map<00:00:03.540> on

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
the effects of a displacement map on

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.800 
the effects of a displacement map on
earth<00:00:03.990> on<00:00:04.110> our<00:00:04.170> three-dimensional<00:00:05.009> objects

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
earth on our three-dimensional objects

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.299 
earth on our three-dimensional objects
inside<00:00:06.810> my<00:00:07.020> shader<00:00:07.290> tree<00:00:07.500> here<00:00:07.740> I've<00:00:07.980> applied

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
inside my shader tree here I've applied

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.000 
inside my shader tree here I've applied
a<00:00:08.429> stucco<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.480> kind<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.690> base<00:00:10.019> procedural

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
a stucco just kind of base procedural

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.560 
a stucco just kind of base procedural
texture<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.370> really<00:00:11.610> haven't<00:00:11.759> modulated<00:00:12.389> much

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
texture I really haven't modulated much

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.730 
texture I really haven't modulated much
haven't<00:00:12.900> messed<00:00:13.019> around<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.679> is

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
haven't messed around with it this is

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.980 
haven't messed around with it this is
kind<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.250> stock<00:00:14.610> stucco<00:00:15.360> procedural

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
kind of the stock stucco procedural

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.109 
kind of the stock stucco procedural
texture<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.470> I've<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.710> using<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> diffuse

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
texture and I've just using the diffuse

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.330 
texture and I've just using the diffuse
color<00:00:18.330> effect<00:00:18.779> right<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.439> speed<00:00:20.100> map

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.990 
spherically to my to my object looks
pretty<00:00:22.500> cool<00:00:22.650> get<00:00:22.949> some<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:23.519> white<00:00:23.730> spots

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
pretty cool get some some white spots

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.790 
pretty cool get some some white spots
and<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.600> black<00:00:24.869> spots<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.500> some<00:00:25.619> nice

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and some black spots and some nice

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040 
and some black spots and some nice
shades<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.279> gray<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.269> previous<00:00:27.449> videos<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
shades of gray now in previous videos I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.509 
shades of gray now in previous videos I
talked<00:00:28.289> about<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.680> bump<00:00:28.920> map<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
talked about the bump map and what a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.130 
talked about the bump map and what a
bump<00:00:29.760> map<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
bump map is going to do is it's going to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.410 
bump map is going to do is it's going to
take<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:32.160> grayscale<00:00:32.730> image<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
take this grayscale image it's going to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420 
take this grayscale image it's going to
analyze<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.079> pixel<00:00:34.440> colors<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> areas

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
analyze the pixel colors so the areas

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
analyze the pixel colors so the areas
that<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.670> white<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.719> get

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that are white are going to get

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740 
that are white are going to get
influenced<00:00:37.520> 100%<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.149> areas<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.510> are

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
influenced 100% in the areas that are

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.440 
influenced 100% in the areas that are
black<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> get<00:00:40.800> influenced<00:00:41.399> 0%<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
black are going to get influenced 0% the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.569 
black are going to get influenced 0% the
shades<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.140> grey<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.559> between<00:00:43.920> those<00:00:44.129> values

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
shades of grey in between those values

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340 
shades of grey in between those values
so<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.360> some<00:00:45.539> Gray's<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.200> got

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so in here we got some Gray's and got

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
so in here we got some Gray's and got
some<00:00:46.469> Gray's<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.890> over<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> get

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
some Gray's all over are going to get

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.569 
some Gray's all over are going to get
are<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> influence<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.980> relief<00:00:50.340> or

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
are going to influence the the relief or

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.270 
are going to influence the the relief or
the<00:00:50.670> perceived<00:00:51.120> height<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> our<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.079> our

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
the perceived height of our of our

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.939 
the perceived height of our of our
object<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:54.239> their<00:00:54.480> percentage<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> gray<00:00:55.379> now

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
object by their percentage of gray now

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.200 
object by their percentage of gray now
let's<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.340> change<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> show<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
let's just change it I want to show you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.000 
let's just change it I want to show you
the<00:00:57.510> difference<00:00:57.840> between<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.440> bump<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the difference between a bump and a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
the difference between a bump and a
displacement<00:00:59.629> inside<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> stucco<00:01:01.050> procedure

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
displacement inside the stucco procedure

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.660 
displacement inside the stucco procedure
I'm<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:01.980> click<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.309> diffuse

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I'm going to right click on diffuse

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
I'm going to right click on diffuse
color<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.390> down<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> surface<00:01:04.019> shading<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
color go down to surface shading and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.010 
color go down to surface shading and
choose<00:01:04.830> bump<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> here's<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> effects

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
choose bump so here's what the effects

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.330 
choose bump so here's what the effects
looks<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> give<00:01:08.070> us<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
looks like it's going to give us the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.660 
looks like it's going to give us the
perceived<00:01:08.909> illusion<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.770> height<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.520> we're

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
perceived illusion of height now we're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.649 
perceived illusion of height now we're
getting<00:01:11.850> some<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.180> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> looks<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
getting some it kind of looks like a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.109 
getting some it kind of looks like a
terrain<00:01:13.049> almost<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.250> bumpy<00:01:14.970> all

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
terrain almost kind of little bumpy all

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.249 
terrain almost kind of little bumpy all
around<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.080> it's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
around you know it's it's it's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.980 
around you know it's it's it's
definitely<00:01:17.009> giving<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> illusion<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.540> peaks

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
definitely giving the illusion of peaks

show<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.759> happens<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.360> change<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
show you what happens when we change it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.490 
show you what happens when we change it
from<00:01:36.840> bump<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:38.009> displacement<00:01:39.170> same<00:01:40.170> area

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
from bump to displacement same area

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770 
from bump to displacement same area
surface<00:01:40.770> shading<00:01:41.159> displacement<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
surface shading displacement this is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
surface shading displacement this is
going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> take<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> minute<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.590> update<00:01:43.979> because

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
going to take a minute to update because

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.090 
going to take a minute to update because
displacement<00:01:45.240> maps<00:01:45.420> take<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> long<00:01:46.079> time<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
displacement maps take a long time to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.830 
displacement maps take a long time to
render<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.729> go<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> major

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
render and here we go so the major

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
render and here we go so the major
difference<00:01:49.320> between<00:01:49.439> displacement<00:01:50.009> maps<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
difference between displacement maps and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.060 
difference between displacement maps and
bump<00:01:50.850> maps<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> displacement<00:01:52.500> map<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
bump maps is that a displacement map is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.950 
bump maps is that a displacement map is
physically<00:01:53.640> physically<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> change

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
physically physically going to change

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.870 
physically physically going to change
the<00:01:55.259> location<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> polygons<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.579> our<00:01:56.670> mesh

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the location of the polygons on our mesh

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.340 
the location of the polygons on our mesh
you<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.840> we're<00:01:57.960> no<00:01:58.140> longer

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you can see that we're no longer

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.649 
you can see that we're no longer
perfectly<00:01:59.250> circular<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.390> we're

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
perfectly circular here now we're

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.660 
perfectly circular here now we're
actually<00:02:00.920> influencing<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> location<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.579> our

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
actually influencing the location of our

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.719 
actually influencing the location of our
polygons<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.420> our<00:02:03.869> scene<00:02:04.579> displacement<00:02:05.579> maps

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
polygons in our scene displacement maps

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
polygons in our scene displacement maps
do<00:02:05.939> an<00:02:06.060> excellent<00:02:06.689> excellent<00:02:07.170> job<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
do an excellent excellent job of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
do an excellent excellent job of
producing<00:02:08.039> organic<00:02:08.700> results<00:02:09.149> based<00:02:09.780> off<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
producing organic results based off of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.080 
producing organic results based off of
that<00:02:10.229> grayscale<00:02:11.009> image<00:02:11.340> let<00:02:11.730> me<00:02:11.819> show<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that grayscale image let me show you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.830 
that grayscale image let me show you
what<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.270> looks<00:02:12.390> like

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
what it looks like

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.770 
what it looks like
change<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.129> look<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.550> our<00:02:14.819> displacement

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
change it to look at our displacement

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.869 
change it to look at our displacement
map<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.950> really<00:02:17.220> what<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> computer<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
map so really what the computer is

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.880 
map so really what the computer is
looking<00:02:18.150> at<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.230> analyzing

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
looking at here is that it's analyzing

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.320 
looking at here is that it's analyzing
that<00:02:19.980> original<00:02:20.459> grayscale<00:02:20.879> image<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
that original grayscale image and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.390 
that original grayscale image and
physically<00:02:22.290> pushing<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.920> pulling<00:02:23.129> our

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
physically pushing and pulling our

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.240 
physically pushing and pulling our
pixels<00:02:23.819> depending<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:24.870> their<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.349> their<00:02:25.709> pixel

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
pixels depending on their on their pixel

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.040 
pixels depending on their on their pixel
intensity<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.970> white<00:02:27.180> pixels<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> can

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
intensity so the white pixels as you can

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.780 
intensity so the white pixels as you can
see<00:02:28.200> here<00:02:28.500> are<00:02:28.769> getting<00:02:29.010> pushed<00:02:29.340> all<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.580> way

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
see here are getting pushed all the way

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.600 
see here are getting pushed all the way
out<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.510> black<00:02:30.750> pixels<00:02:31.099> are<00:02:32.099> not<00:02:32.160> getting

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
out the black pixels are not getting

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.150 
out the black pixels are not getting
pushed<00:02:32.879> at<00:02:33.030> all<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.780> pixels<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.500> our<00:02:34.680> bump<00:02:34.920> are

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
pushed at all the pixels in our bump are

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.949 
pushed at all the pixels in our bump are
excuse<00:02:35.430> me<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.640> our<00:02:35.700> displacement<00:02:36.299> map<00:02:36.450> that

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
excuse me in our displacement map that

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.170 
excuse me in our displacement map that
were<00:02:37.080> having<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.680> were<00:02:37.860> gray<00:02:38.220> are<00:02:38.519> getting

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
were having that were gray are getting

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.150 
were having that were gray are getting
influenced<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:39.989> their<00:02:40.290> percentage<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.980> gray

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
influenced on their percentage of gray

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.259 
influenced on their percentage of gray
so<00:02:41.489> if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.209> had<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.540> pixel<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.410> 50%<00:02:44.269> he

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
so if you had a pixel that was 50% he

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.479 
so if you had a pixel that was 50% he
would<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.599> 50%<00:02:46.260> influenced<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
would get 50% influenced here in the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.240 
would get 50% influenced here in the
skin<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> final<00:02:48.959> displacement<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
skin in the in the final displacement so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.069 
skin in the in the final displacement so
that's<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.549> major<00:02:50.760> difference<00:02:51.209> between<00:02:51.329> bump

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
that's the major difference between bump

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.380 
that's the major difference between bump
and<00:02:52.319> displacement<00:02:52.799> bump<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.700> illusion<00:02:54.090> it's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and displacement bump is illusion it's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.360 
and displacement bump is illusion it's
going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.720> retain<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.170> original<00:02:55.290> shape<00:02:55.829> but<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
going to retain the original shape but a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.309 
going to retain the original shape but a
displacement<00:02:56.880> map<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.450> physically<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
displacement map is physically going to

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.699 
displacement map is physically going to
change<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.160> geometry<00:02:59.450> in<00:03:00.450> our<00:03:00.690> scene<00:03:00.989> it

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
change the geometry in our scene it

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.350 
change the geometry in our scene it
takes<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.010> long<00:03:02.190> time<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.459> render<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.269> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
takes a long time to render but the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.290 
takes a long time to render but the
results<00:03:03.780> are<00:03:03.930> pretty<00:03:04.170> cool
