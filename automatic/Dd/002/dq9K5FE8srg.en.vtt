character has their own to lose so it

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.370 
character has their own to lose so it

their weapons it's very different from
other<00:03:31.670> games<00:03:31.879> where<00:03:32.569> you<00:03:32.780> think<00:03:32.959> about<00:03:33.019> it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
other games where you think about it

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.509 
other games where you think about it
other<00:03:33.409> action<00:03:33.829> means<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.129> kind<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.370> run

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
other action means you kind of run

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.550 
other action means you kind of run
around<00:03:34.670> with<00:03:35.480> kind<00:03:35.719> of<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.870> basic<00:03:36.049> set<00:03:36.500> of

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
around with kind of a basic set of

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.770 
around with kind of a basic set of
weapons<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:37.189> then<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.700> kind<00:03:37.909> of<00:03:37.939> pick<00:03:38.150> up<00:03:38.359> the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
weapons and then you kind of pick up the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.720 
weapons and then you kind of pick up the
flamethrower<00:03:39.409> or<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.829> pick<00:03:40.069> up<00:03:40.219> the<00:03:40.400> machine

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
flamethrower or you pick up the machine

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.580 
flamethrower or you pick up the machine
gun<00:03:41.000> well<00:03:41.599> you<00:03:41.930> know<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:42.139> didn't<00:03:42.319> want<00:03:42.439> to<00:03:42.500> go

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
gun well you know we didn't want to go

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.110 
gun well you know we didn't want to go
that<00:03:42.739> approach<00:03:43.069> because<00:03:43.310> each<00:03:43.519> character<00:03:44.090> is

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
that approach because each character is

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.809 
that approach because each character is
so<00:03:44.420> defined<00:03:44.870> with<00:03:45.590> their<00:03:45.739> own<00:03:45.859> weaponry<00:03:46.250> so

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
so defined with their own weaponry so

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.339 
so defined with their own weaponry so
again<00:03:47.299> you<00:03:47.510> really<00:03:47.629> want<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.019> go<00:03:48.139> back<00:03:48.319> to

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
again you really want to go back to

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.069 
again you really want to go back to
leveraging<00:03:49.099> each<00:03:49.370> Joe<00:03:49.790> their<00:03:50.299> unique<00:03:50.659> skills

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
leveraging each Joe their unique skills

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.159 
leveraging each Joe their unique skills
and<00:03:51.319> abilities<00:03:51.739> but<00:03:52.579> certainly<00:03:53.030> working<00:03:53.870> as<00:03:54.139> a

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
and abilities but certainly working as a

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.679 
and abilities but certainly working as a
team<00:03:54.500> there's<00:03:54.799> incentives<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.970> work<00:03:56.540> together

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
team there's incentives to work together

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.270 
team there's incentives to work together
and<00:03:57.139> and<00:03:57.319> then<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.590> have<00:03:57.709> some<00:03:57.919> other<00:03:58.069> cool
