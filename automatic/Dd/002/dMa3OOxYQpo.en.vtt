 fresh 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.029
 during the cold season I do not like 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.470
 actually eat salmon tartare 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.300
 just because it's a success 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 refreshing but I think it says 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.020
 been done that we have to find 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.140
 alternatives for times the recipes with 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.210
 Salmon grill over the baby spo 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.220

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.949
 cakes of soaps today that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.879
 I appreciate it enormously 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.660
 which is too easy to do here we are 500 g 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.300
 salmon 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.180
 we will start by removing the skin of a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 other salon to sink october nx10 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.460
 we will go along the white line a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.729
 called center of our salmon giragos 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.350
 lead gaap goes along the skin using 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.510
 of our knife like that we see 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 remove the maximum of choice by eliminating 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.150
 the losses you have to climb remove the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.880
 skin we will cut our salmon into small 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 cubes as if we were making a tartare a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.400
 time that our salmon and all well cut 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 we will add the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.049
 first big mess would have bought the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.000
 is a lime of people's input even 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.700
 I do not have anything else at home for 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.890
 stay but citrus so I use the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.520
 good old cheese dress close and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.400
 use the small side of the roma our 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.160
 exit we will repeat the same operation 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.940
 but this time with a bit of 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.700
 ginger 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.580
 we will even go get two types of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.430
 young people from here who follows on for 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.830
 buy the rest of our ingredients on 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.860
 will start with egg white 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.850
 a little reminder kamango we speak the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.610
 egg yolk blog 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.230
 we break the cac and gently in two 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.290
 and just capsized the yellow of a hull 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.700
 and to the other we see that white is 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.099
 pick up in our little bowl here ah 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 yeah my little last job if we 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.269
 can keep the egg yolk for a 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.680
 more distant reaction certainly we were 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.510
 good make a custard for a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.690
 dessert we would have young people in yellow 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.209
 of the egg the joust our bhl announced mans 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.260
 but also to help the admire we go 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.950
 buy back 75 8 and 3 tablespoons of 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.930
 flour 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.030
 because we do a little the same principle 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.319
 that if we made burgers we 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.830
 does not need anything for 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.080
 we 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.490
 all we put a little colors 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.620
 also in our small sofas 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.930
 of today did that I took and 1.6 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.540
 the three years we see our famous 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.970
 shallots in Quebec that we will buy the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.580
 date did not know already done at home 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.560
 it's a center that's ugly because 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.500
 we will use our hands to mix 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.330
 all a bit like a good mix well 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.520
 that going to the site at the end of the game 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.430
 preferred area certainly 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.120
 shaped our little balls we go after 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.490
 potro about 1 you go as if we 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.710
 just wants the step is slightly in hand 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.080
 for it makes her a little ball 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.760
 pause nor russia series has a burger 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.830
 minced meat should not be expected 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.050
 that the result we want is 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.330
 exactly this makes all of our 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.880
 balls are well fashioned everything he 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.640
 still to do is cook them we already have 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.440
 a skillet here heat up a maximum in 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.350
 which we will pour a little oil 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.690
 olive and we'll grab each side 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.240
 our soap cake it takes about 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.040
 a minute she but do not deny side 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.739
 once all our patties are 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.019
 well seized on each side we will 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.870
 gently remove them from the pan on 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.480
 can deposit on a plate that is worth at 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.500
 oven what are we going to finish their cooking 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.290
 in an oven preheated to 350 degrees by 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.090
 about 5 to 6 knots game that makes 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.040
 make sure our salmon are not too 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.040
 dared in the middle of his couch 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.060
 stop our finished leather sofas at 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.030
 bottom the price you have prepared a small 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.550

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.190
 years of jersey a little lime juice and 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.820
 then curry wish we rest 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.640
 just a few drops here exposed on the 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.680
 above each of our little patties 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.970
 and since it's sofas we 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.570
 want to buy liver 1 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.470

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.300
 this everyone to complete everything and everything 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.050
