00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.340 
interesting theory I don't know if
that's<00:01:55.799> true<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.700> ok<00:01:57.600> because<00:01:57.990> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's true but so it is ok because you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.399 
that's true but so it is ok because you
have<00:01:59.390> it's<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.540> different<00:02:01.020> neurological
