filming location for my videos which I'm

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.759 
filming location for my videos which I'm
really<00:00:24.720> excited<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
really excited because I think that

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.170 
really excited because I think that
looks<00:00:25.830> kinda<00:00:26.160> nice<00:00:26.340> i<00:00:26.580> set<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.970> really

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
looks kinda nice i set it up really

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
looks kinda nice i set it up really
nicely<00:00:27.420> back<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.590> i<00:00:28.650> moved<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:28.980> about

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
nicely back there so i moved in about

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
nicely back there so i moved in about
two<00:00:29.429> weeks<00:00:29.460> ago<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.880> think<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> park<00:00:30.599> it's

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
two weeks ago I think so the park it's

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.299 
two weeks ago I think so the park it's
still<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.080> empty<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> don't<00:00:32.040> think<00:00:32.219> I'll

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
still pretty empty so I don't think I'll

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.740 
still pretty empty so I don't think I'll
do<00:00:32.430> an<00:00:32.520> apartment<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.030> right<00:00:33.329> away<00:00:33.570> i'll

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
do an apartment or right away i'll

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.240 
do an apartment or right away i'll
probably<00:00:33.989> wait<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> little<00:00:34.590> bit<00:00:34.770> i'm<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.040> sure

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
probably wait a little bit i'm not sure

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.190 
probably wait a little bit i'm not sure
when<00:00:35.550> exactly<00:00:35.910> i'm<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.690> doing<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.050> i

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
when exactly i'm going to be doing it i

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
when exactly i'm going to be doing it i
think<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.829> far<00:00:38.040> i'm<00:00:38.219> leaning<00:00:38.520> more<00:00:38.760> towards

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
think so far i'm leaning more towards

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180 
think so far i'm leaning more towards
like<00:00:39.390> September<00:00:40.020> ish<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:40.770> that's<00:00:40.950> when

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
like September ish because that's when

I<00:02:47.110> really<00:02:47.440> like<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> detailing<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.549> a

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
I really like the detailing on it as a

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.309 
I really like the detailing on it as a
little<00:02:48.910> bit<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.120> detailing<00:02:49.420> at<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.690> top<00:02:49.810> here

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
little bit of detailing at the top here

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.960 
little bit of detailing at the top here
so<00:02:50.769> this<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.069> supposed<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.579> candle

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so this is supposed to be a candle

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.250 
so this is supposed to be a candle
holder<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.420> think<00:02:52.599> it'd<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.810> really<00:02:53.019> pretty

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
holder and I think it'd be really pretty

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.020 
holder and I think it'd be really pretty
to<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.769> light<00:02:53.980> shine<00:02:54.280> through<00:02:54.310> all<00:02:54.970> of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
to have the light shine through all of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.699 
to have the light shine through all of
these<00:02:55.540> little<00:02:55.840> holes<00:02:55.989> but<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.260> also<00:02:56.440> thought

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
these little holes but I also thought

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.280 
these little holes but I also thought
about<00:02:56.769> having<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.849> a<00:02:58.000> flower<00:02:58.690> bouquet<00:02:59.140> in

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290

about having just a flower bouquet in
here<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.620> that'd<00:02:59.829> be<00:02:59.950> really<00:03:00.129> pretty<00:03:00.340> as

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
something I must have been a decoration

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.020 
something I must have been a decoration
from<00:04:05.829> Easter<00:04:06.250> but<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.459> just<00:04:06.639> kind<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.819> ripped

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
from Easter but I just kind of ripped

that<00:04:07.239> out<00:04:07.299> and<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:07.959> think<00:04:08.139> I'm<00:04:08.200> just<00:04:08.230> going<00:04:08.440> to

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500

that out and I think I'm just going to
paint<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.889> and<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.069> thought<00:04:09.220> about<00:04:09.430> putting<00:04:09.639> TV

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349

it's<00:04:16.150> kind<00:04:16.329> of<00:04:16.389> tarnished<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.500> little<00:04:17.709> bit<00:04:17.799> I

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
it's kind of tarnished a little bit I

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.840 
it's kind of tarnished a little bit I
don't<00:04:18.070> even<00:04:18.130> know<00:04:18.310> if<00:04:18.340> that's<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.639> right<00:04:18.730> word

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
don't even know if that's the right word

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.060 
don't even know if that's the right word
but<00:04:19.600> some<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.049> gold<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.590> showing<00:04:20.859> through
