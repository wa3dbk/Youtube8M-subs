the<00:01:22.920> best<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.490> Titan<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.450> favorite<00:01:24.840> from

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the best the Titan was my favorite from

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.240 
the best the Titan was my favorite from
the<00:01:25.020> batter<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.619> felt<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.950> was<00:01:26.040> really

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the batter because I felt it was really

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.950 
the batter because I felt it was really
well-rounded<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> still<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.570> three<00:01:27.810> new

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
well-rounded but I still have three new

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.929 
well-rounded but I still have three new
classes<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.740> haven't<00:01:29.009> played<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
classes which I haven't played it all so

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.310 
classes which I haven't played it all so
I'm<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.240> looking<00:01:30.600> forward<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.930> leveling

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I'm really looking forward to leveling

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.660 
I'm really looking forward to leveling
up<00:01:31.409> them<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.920> try<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.280> those<00:01:32.430> bad<00:01:32.640> boys

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
up them so I can try at those bad boys

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
up them so I can try at those bad boys
but<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.869> mean<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.290> choosing<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:35.070> class<00:01:35.369> come

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
but I mean in choosing your class come

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
but I mean in choosing your class come
to<00:01:35.820> become<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> final<00:01:36.960> game<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.369> think

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
to become the final game if you think

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
to become the final game if you think
using<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.360> throwing<00:01:39.780> knife<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.200> cool<00:01:40.500> use<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
using a throwing knife is cool use a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
using a throwing knife is cool use a
hunter<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.170> doing

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
hunter if you think you know doing

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.620 
hunter if you think you know doing
massive<00:01:43.799> high<00:01:44.280> amounts<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> damage<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.390> cool

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
massive high amounts of damage is cool

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
massive high amounts of damage is cool
then<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:45.990> probably<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> suit<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
then you're probably going to suit to a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
then you're probably going to suit to a
wall<00:01:47.850> off<00:01:48.090> plus<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.869> bad<00:01:49.200> are<00:01:49.439> special

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
wall off plus it's got a bad are special

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.249 
wall off plus it's got a bad are special
and<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.970> mean<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> you're<00:01:51.810> looking<00:01:52.079> for

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
offensively good defensively then you

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
offensively good defensively then you
might<00:01:57.119> want<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> play<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> tight<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.200> fact<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
might want to play as a tight in fact I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.170 
might want to play as a tight in fact I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
mean pretty sure that no one's going to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
mean pretty sure that no one's going to
know<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.600> their<00:02:00.780> favorite<00:02:00.960> class<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.380> until

you've<00:02:02.040> tried<00:02:02.189> them<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.579> yourself<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.240> i

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
you've tried them out yourself so i

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.780 
you've tried them out yourself so i
really<00:02:03.750> suggest<00:02:03.869> doing<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.430> second

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
really suggest doing that the second

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.920 
really suggest doing that the second
thing<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:05.939> i<00:02:06.090> wanted<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.420> talk<00:02:06.570> about<00:02:06.630> in

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
thing that i wanted to talk about in

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.660 
thing that i wanted to talk about in
this<00:02:06.990> video<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> radar<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.580> bit

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
this video is the radar and a little bit

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
this video is the radar and a little bit
about<00:02:08.849> how<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> works<00:02:09.420> now<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> did<00:02:10.800> play

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
about how it works now if you did play

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.010 
about how it works now if you did play
the<00:02:11.160> beta<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.970> seen<00:02:12.239> footage<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the beta or if you seen footage then you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.730 
the beta or if you seen footage then you
probably<00:02:13.319> would<00:02:13.560> have

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
probably would have

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530 
probably would have
notice<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> radar<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:15.360> red

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
notice the radar and the little red

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.970 
notice the radar and the little red
bleep<00:02:15.810> popping<00:02:16.290> up<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.770> there<00:02:16.950> but

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
bleep popping up here and there but

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.350 
bleep popping up here and there but
there<00:02:17.310> are<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> couple<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.790> things<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.090> should

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
there are a couple of things you should

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.140 
there are a couple of things you should
know<00:02:18.570> when<00:02:19.140> looking<00:02:19.470> at<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.620> radar<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.310> radar

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
know when looking at the radar the radar

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.300 
know when looking at the radar the radar
is<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.390> same<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:21.900> player<00:02:22.110> versus<00:02:22.530> player<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
is the same for player versus player and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.850 
is the same for player versus player and
PvE<00:02:23.790> except<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:24.930> special<00:02:25.380> feature<00:02:25.410> in

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
PvE except for one special feature in

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.770 
PvE except for one special feature in
PvP<00:02:26.400> which<00:02:26.610> I'll<00:02:26.790> talk<00:02:27.000> about<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.390> second

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
PvP which I'll talk about in a second

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.200 
PvP which I'll talk about in a second
right<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.890> radar<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.340> blank<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:30.060> are

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
right so if the radar is blank there are

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.510 
right so if the radar is blank there are
no<00:02:30.360> enemies<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.900> your<00:02:31.020> immediate<00:02:31.230> area<00:02:31.830> then

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
no enemies in your immediate area then

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.040 
no enemies in your immediate area then
there<00:02:32.760> are<00:02:32.790> sort<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.150> three<00:02:33.450> different<00:02:33.600> enemy

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
there are sort of three different enemy

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.080 
there are sort of three different enemy
ranges<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.530> will<00:02:34.740> pop<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.520> an<00:02:35.700> enemy<00:02:35.850> is

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
ranges that will pop up if an enemy is

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.300 
ranges that will pop up if an enemy is
far<00:02:36.360> away<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.870> may<00:02:37.050> pop<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.620> your<00:02:37.650> radar<00:02:37.980> as

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
far away it may pop up on your radar as

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.310 
far away it may pop up on your radar as
a<00:02:38.370> red<00:02:38.670> line<00:02:38.940> surrounding<00:02:39.360> one<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> pieces

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
a red line surrounding one of the pieces

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.860 
a red line surrounding one of the pieces
of<00:02:40.620> your<00:02:40.740> radar<00:02:41.130> if<00:02:41.700> an<00:02:41.880> enemy<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.330> starting<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
of your radar if an enemy is starting to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.450 
of your radar if an enemy is starting to
get<00:02:42.990> close<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.860> one<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> pieces

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
get close to you then one of the pieces

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.880 
get close to you then one of the pieces
of<00:02:44.730> your<00:02:44.760> radar<00:02:45.270> will<00:02:45.480> fill<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.900> red<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.770> an

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
enemy is super close to you probably

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.210 
enemy is super close to you probably
within<00:02:48.810> Mel<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> distance<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> middle

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
within Mel a distance then the middle

on<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.760> radar<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.330> don't<00:03:15.810> really<00:03:15.990> like<00:03:16.170> this

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
on the radar I don't really like this

on the radar I don't really like this
feature<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:16.740> I'm<00:03:17.100> gonna<00:03:17.520> play<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> lot<00:03:18.000> of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
and and that it will fail because of how

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.270 
and and that it will fail because of how
hyped<00:03:45.690> up<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.140> going<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.590> but<00:03:46.980> let's<00:03:47.130> look

at<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.460> few<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.700> facts<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.510> destiny<00:03:48.870> has<00:03:48.960> been

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
at a few the facts so destiny has been

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.780 
at a few the facts so destiny has been
in<00:03:49.290> development<00:03:49.440> for<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:50.130> think<00:03:50.400> about<00:03:50.580> five

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
in development for I think about five

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.580 
in development for I think about five
years<00:03:51.000> now<00:03:51.150> that's<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.660> very<00:03:51.690> long<00:03:51.960> time<00:03:52.170> time

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
years now that's a very long time time

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.560 
years now that's a very long time time
for<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> game<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.310> development<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.360> it's

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
for a game to be in development but it's

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.570 
for a game to be in development but it's
not<00:03:54.750> how<00:03:54.900> long<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.380> who<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.920> developing<00:03:56.220> it

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
not how long the who is developing it

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.130 
not how long the who is developing it
that's<00:03:56.760> important<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.720> team<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.930> brought

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
that's important the team that brought
