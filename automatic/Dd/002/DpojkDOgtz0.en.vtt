00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 very good everyone is welcome to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.870
 understand your champion to elche zeros 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.760
 they surrender to the primordial powers 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.440
 of nature renouncing everything 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.259
 when they are learning from magic 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.700
 she is one of these sorceresses who 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.160
 learned magic as an orphan when 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.990
 He is growing up amid the chaos of the city 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.449
 life was hard and dangerous for a girl 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.369
 young and beautiful so she survived to base 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.350
 of wit and steal when the wit 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.180
 it was not enough with the goal of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.950
 put an end to the injustice of the world 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.380
 He brought his talent to the league of legends 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:37.540
 yes it's true for only 295 the minute you 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.570
 I leave without someone 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.000
 Ladies and gentlemen , I do not understand your 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.890
 champion is no longer a champion that is going to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.660
 provide a very high amount of 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.460
 utility for our team from a 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.650
 knock up in a straight line until a 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.450
 individual slowdown in addition to a 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.840
 shield with damage bonus and for 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.829
 course our precious and beautiful 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.570
 definitive 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.609
 with which we will be able to have a 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.219
 coupling capacity as well as 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.320
 tremendous disengagement one of the best 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.240
 of the whole game obviously besides the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.640
 healing that this definitive proposes us 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.200
 last and not least our 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.850
 passive that gives us speed of 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.770
 movement to all our champions 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.840
 allies as everyone will know our 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.729
 dear sorceress is obviously support 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.409
 for everything previously named and 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.939
 for many more things to use 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.470
 correctly trowel skills 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.119
 will be very relevant in each of 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.070
 team battles is no longer the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.479
 third champion with the highest probability of 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.460
 victory of the whole game throughout the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.590
 world and obviously is the first support 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.600
 with greater probability of victory and today 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.250
 you will realize why for 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.140
 start let's talk a little bit about the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.090
 work to fill the triumphant with 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.470
 It also has the possibility of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.630
 make a protection to our cars 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 very high level as I said before 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.429
 We will have an excellent capacity to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.860
 initiation against initiation and 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.659
 obviously an excellent unhooking that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.799
 I mean with this very well let's say 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.409
 in mind that our definitive 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.720
 moves out of your range to 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.549
 any enemy that is inside so 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.490
 that if we are a little bit smart 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.619
 we will be able to stop whoever we want 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.479
 where we want there are a thousand and one ways to 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.979
 correctly use the definitive 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.140
 she can not create many 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.430
 functions since separating the enemy well 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.140
 as we can also use it for 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.819
 repel it or to move them to where 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.380
 we want and besides that never but 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.300
 never that his last in healing that 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.730
 offers us our definitive know that 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.840
 it could become crucial well let's 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.700
 talk a little bit about the mechanics 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.040
 basic and tips with hannah 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.540
 first of all for phase lines there are 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.700
 to keep in mind that our was going to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.980
 grant from our lane a shield to the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.720
 time that an increase of a of so 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.000
 you have to use our game just before 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.620
 to start a trade usually when 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.260
 your car is about to give it the last blow 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.420
 dominion the enemy ads try trade 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.549
 hurt him that's the moment when he 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.950
 our game makes the difference and 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.350
 give our to carry an increase of and a 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.030
 shield to be able to turn the trade to 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.650
 our favor must be taken into account 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.780
 besides that our whirlwind makes 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.940
 more damage goes further and has a 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.010
 Higher no cap according to charging time 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.810
 you have before being released 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.819
 if we do not touch it it takes 3 seconds in 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.440
 get out with your potential to the fullest but 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.239
 we can still touch it so that the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.930
 skill comes almost instantaneous 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.549
 so 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.859
 you have to try to give it the most 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.840
 possible potential to our q in the 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.459
 team fights as well as in 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.349
 line to try to have older 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.120
 odds of winning the fight you have to 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.439
 try to wait a second for the new one 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.500
 that our compact on the enemy 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.150
 before pulling our w because I already 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.650
 that we only do instantaneously when 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.120
 enemies have the air we would be 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.129
 reducing the time it is effective 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.450
 the slowdown another advice is that 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.010
 our and besides being very useful 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.450
 tickets can also be used 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.829
 about the towers so you have to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.810
 use it well to be able to cushion 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.310
 a lot of damage from the minions and so 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.870
 be able to increase the duration of our 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.950
 tower sent another of the things that there 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.419
 to bear in mind is that the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.950
 displacement that causes our 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.319
 definitive can get to displace 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.180
 up through the walls so 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.220
 you have to think very well how and when 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.260
 we are going to stop for before using 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.239
 our final many times we can 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.219
 surprise the minimum flash going behind 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.349
 of him lying to bring him closer to 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.489
 our allies we can also apply 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.859
 these for team battles 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.650
 reposition us with an unexpected flash 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.780
 and separate our mercy to all its 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.150
 team may sound very repetitive 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.949
 but you have to understand that our 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.120
 definitive is who makes us so 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.470
 special 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.900
 ability to move in our taste to 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.850
 whoever we want to where we want to 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.500
 what makes such decisive profit and 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.660
 what makes her be where she is 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.460
 with it we will be able to start a fight 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.440
 they separated their team we can against 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.760
 start we can disengage we can 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.680
 to do practically what we want 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.840
 do with it so if we want 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.240
 master the genre we're going to have to be 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.070
 very smart with its definition well 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.419
 that nothing people that was all for today they 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.340
 I apologize for this week in 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.930

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.139

 but everything is in order, so 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.010
 From now should be no more 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.380
