through<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.000> easy<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> cook<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.469> almost

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
through and easy to cook but you almost

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.680 
through and easy to cook but you almost
always<00:00:38.489> need<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> wrap<00:00:38.940> bacon<00:00:39.180> around<00:00:39.390> the

out of it
whereas<00:00:42.719> brisket<00:00:43.170> negative<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.950> stuff

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
whereas brisket negative this stuff

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
whereas brisket negative this stuff
plain<00:00:44.430> doesn't<00:00:44.850> need<00:00:45.000> sauce<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.510> comes<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
plain doesn't need sauce it comes in the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.270 
plain doesn't need sauce it comes in the
bread<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> doesn't<00:00:46.559> need<00:00:46.680> any<00:00:46.829> condiments

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
bread it doesn't need any condiments

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.939 
bread it doesn't need any condiments
it's<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> grape<00:00:48.780> flavored<00:00:49.260> meat

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.490 

so<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> whole<00:00:54.239> brisket

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
so this is a this is a whole brisket

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
so this is a this is a whole brisket
there's<00:00:55.500> actually<00:00:55.829> two<00:00:56.190> muscles<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.820> make

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
there's actually two muscles that make

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540 
there's actually two muscles that make
up<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> brisket<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.739> bottom<00:00:59.160> muscle

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
up the brisket the the bottom muscle

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.950 
up the brisket the the bottom muscle
that<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.030> down<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.780> runs

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that you see down here that kind of runs

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
that you see down here that kind of runs
throughout<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> entire<00:01:01.710> brisket<00:01:02.219> it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
throughout the entire brisket it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
throughout the entire brisket it's
called<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> flat<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.500> leaner<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
called the flat it's the leaner of the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.219 
called the flat it's the leaner of the
two<00:01:05.369> muscles<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.420> also<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:06.869> ten<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
two muscles it's also the more ten to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
two muscles it's also the more ten to
the<00:01:07.260> two<00:01:07.470> muscles<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.460> people<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the two muscles some people like to just

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630 
the two muscles some people like to just
cook<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:11.010> cooks<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> little<00:01:11.549> bit

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
cook with that it it cooks a little bit

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.770 
cook with that it it cooks a little bit
easier<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:13.380> easy<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> slice<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
easier it's easy to slice because it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.560 
easier it's easy to slice because it
holds<00:01:15.780> together<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.470> well<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.920> slicing

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
holds together very well for slicing

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
holds together very well for slicing
we've<00:01:18.570> had<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> opposite<00:01:19.380> there's<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
we've had you the opposite there's a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
we've had you the opposite there's a
second<00:01:20.759> muscle<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> called<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
second muscle here that is called the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.260 
second muscle here that is called the
point<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> fat<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:23.820> muscles

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
point and it's the fat of your muscles

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
point and it's the fat of your muscles
really<00:01:24.540> nicely<00:01:24.869> marbled<00:01:25.439> got<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> lot<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
really nicely marbled got a lot of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.399 
really nicely marbled got a lot of
flavor<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.659> its<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> shame<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
flavor in it and its really a shame that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
flavor in it and its really a shame that
more<00:01:28.590> people<00:01:28.710> don't<00:01:29.009> use<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.729> does<00:01:29.939> make

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
more people don't use it it does make

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.490 
more people don't use it it does make
the<00:01:30.240> brisket<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.869> tougher<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> cook

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the brisket a little tougher to cook

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.810 
the brisket a little tougher to cook
because<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.369> here<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.579> you've<00:01:32.729> got

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
because what you see here is you've got

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
because what you see here is you've got
a<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.030> thin<00:01:33.329> part<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> brisket<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
a very thin part of the brisket and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
a very thin part of the brisket and
you've<00:01:34.799> got<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.670> thicker<00:01:35.939> part<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you've got a much thicker part of the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
you've got a much thicker part of the
brisket<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.290> tough<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.650> those

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
brisket here so it's tough to get those

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.330 
brisket here so it's tough to get those
two<00:01:37.950> cookies

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
two cookies

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.730 
two cookies
but<00:01:40.540> we<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:41.870> it's<00:01:42.020> worth<00:01:42.170> what<00:01:42.350> happens<00:01:42.650> is

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
but we think it's worth what happens is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.760 
but we think it's worth what happens is
that<00:01:42.860> set<00:01:43.160> that<00:01:43.630> patty<00:01:44.630> or<00:01:44.870> cut<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.380> sits<00:01:45.680> on

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
that set that patty or cut that sits on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.730 
that set that patty or cut that sits on
top<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.280> point<00:01:47.050> actually<00:01:48.050> keeps<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.440> rest

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
top of the point actually keeps the rest

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.260 
top of the point actually keeps the rest
of<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:48.980> brisket<00:01:49.310> moist<00:01:49.580> as<00:01:49.880> you're<00:01:50.090> cooking

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
of the brisket moist as you're cooking

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.940 
of the brisket moist as you're cooking
so<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:50.750> really<00:01:50.870> important<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:51.410> barbecue<00:01:51.920> a

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so it's really important for barbecue a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.040 
so it's really important for barbecue a
particular<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.490> use<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.760> whole<00:01:52.910> brisket<00:01:53.120> what

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
particular to use the whole brisket what

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.670 
particular to use the whole brisket what
we<00:01:54.140> do<00:01:54.290> is<00:01:54.410> we<00:01:54.560> take<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:55.760> leaner<00:01:56.270> portion<00:01:56.840> that

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
we do is we take the leaner portion that

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.160 
we do is we take the leaner portion that
kind<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:57.950> extends<00:01:58.400> out<00:01:58.520> here<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.570> we<00:01:59.690> sweet<00:02:00.050> we

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
kind of extends out here and we sweet we

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.050 
kind of extends out here and we sweet we
chop<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.680> up<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.340> sell<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.700> as<00:02:01.790> chopped

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
chop that up and you sell it as chopped

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.200 
chop that up and you sell it as chopped
brisket<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.900> reason<00:02:03.140> for<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:04.210> while

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
brisket the reason for that is while

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.460 
brisket the reason for that is while
it's<00:02:05.390> going<00:02:05.510> to<00:02:05.600> be<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.690> little<00:02:05.930> bit<00:02:06.050> leaner<00:02:06.229> and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
it's going to be a little bit leaner and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.160 
it's going to be a little bit leaner and
therefore<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.860> little<00:02:07.100> bit<00:02:07.190> drier<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.899> chopped

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
therefore a little bit drier the chopped

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.320 
therefore a little bit drier the chopped
brisket<00:02:09.470> absorbs<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.160> little<00:02:10.340> more<00:02:10.490> sauce<00:02:10.759> so

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
brisket absorbs a little more sauce so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.510 
brisket absorbs a little more sauce so
it<00:02:11.540> kind<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.290> compensates<00:02:12.860> for<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.070> dryness<00:02:13.310> a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
it kind of compensates for the dryness a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.540 
it kind of compensates for the dryness a
little<00:02:13.730> bit<00:02:13.850> but<00:02:14.270> also<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.600> get<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:14.900> nice

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
little bit but also you get this nice

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.430 
little bit but also you get this nice
you<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.700> better<00:02:17.180> ratio<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.840> nice<00:02:17.959> crusty

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
you get a better ratio of a nice crusty

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.920 
you get a better ratio of a nice crusty
bark<00:02:18.910> mixing<00:02:19.910> with<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.480> also<00:02:20.600> kind

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
bark mixing with that so that also kind

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.260 
bark mixing with that so that also kind
of<00:02:20.959> compensate<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.620> dryness<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
of compensate the dryness this is the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.360 
of compensate the dryness this is the
bread<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:23.720> put<00:02:23.900> our<00:02:24.050> sandwich<00:02:24.709> towel<00:02:25.130> we

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
bread that we put our sandwich towel we

bread that we put our sandwich towel we

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
departed a little bit from tradition on

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.540 
departed a little bit from tradition on
this<00:02:27.050> traditionally<00:02:27.620> barbecue<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.340> served

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
this traditionally barbecue is served

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.830 
this traditionally barbecue is served
with<00:02:28.640> white<00:02:28.910> bread<00:02:29.120> or<00:02:29.240> just<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.600> plain<00:02:29.810> old

hamburger<00:02:30.440> bun<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.820> inevitably<00:02:32.239> falls<00:02:32.510> apart

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
hamburger bun it inevitably falls apart

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.790 
hamburger bun it inevitably falls apart
when<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:32.989> eat<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.320> we<00:02:33.440> wanted<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.709> do

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
when you eat it we wanted to do

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.780 
when you eat it we wanted to do
something<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.130> little<00:02:34.190> bit<00:02:34.430> more<00:02:34.459> substantial

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
something a little bit more substantial

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.100 
something a little bit more substantial
so<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.540> actually<00:02:35.870> eat<00:02:35.989> your

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
so that you can actually eat your

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.930 
so that you can actually eat your
sandwich<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.680> sandwich<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:37.880> of

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
sandwich like a sandwich this is more of

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.860 
sandwich like a sandwich this is more of
a<00:02:38.030> brioche<00:02:38.810> bun

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
a brioche bun

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.360 
a brioche bun
breo's<00:02:41.409> couldn't<00:02:41.739> handle<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.099> brioche

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
breo's couldn't handle like a brioche

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.610 
breo's couldn't handle like a brioche
it's<00:02:43.060> got<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> little<00:02:43.780> bit<00:02:43.900> more<00:02:43.959> body<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.409> it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it's got a little bit more body to it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.920 
it's got a little bit more body to it
but<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.129> doesn't<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.849> our<00:02:46.060> opinion

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
but really doesn't in our opinion

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.100 
but really doesn't in our opinion
get<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.530> way<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.540> flavor<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.989> meat

get in the way of the flavor of the meat

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.330 
get in the way of the flavor of the meat
it<00:02:50.260> really<00:02:50.440> doesn't<00:02:50.680> let<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.890> meat<00:02:51.069> be<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
it really doesn't let the meat be the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.830 
it really doesn't let the meat be the
star<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.760> show

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 

the<00:02:55.290> nice<00:02:55.440> soft<00:02:55.680> bread<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.130> don't<00:02:56.160> want

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the nice soft bread you don't want

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.010 
the nice soft bread you don't want
anything<00:02:56.640> really<00:02:56.790> crusty<00:02:57.239> with<00:02:57.510> barbecue

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
anything really crusty with barbecue

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.390 
anything really crusty with barbecue
because<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.410> does<00:02:58.560> tend<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.830> overpower<00:02:59.280> that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
because it does tend to overpower that

because it does tend to overpower that
meets<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.819> little<00:02:59.940> bit<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:00.569> do<00:03:00.660> when<00:03:00.810> we

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
meets a little bit so we do when we

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.150 
meets a little bit so we do when we
start<00:03:01.110> working<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> brisket<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.950> try<00:03:02.099> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
start working with a brisket we try to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.559 
start working with a brisket we try to
kind<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.459> cut<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.760> down<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> little<00:03:03.120> bit<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.450> they

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
kind of cut it down a little bit so they

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.420 
kind of cut it down a little bit so they
can<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.900> slices<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.250> right

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
can get the slices to the to the right

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.130 
can get the slices to the to the right
size<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.940> sandwich<00:03:06.390> we're<00:03:06.810> gonna<00:03:06.930> cut

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
size for the sandwich we're gonna cut

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.330 
size for the sandwich we're gonna cut
off<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.440> portion<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.830> we're<00:03:08.010> gonna<00:03:08.099> use<00:03:08.190> for

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
off the portion that we're gonna use for

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.960 
off the portion that we're gonna use for
chakras<00:03:09.090> yet

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.630 

this<00:03:14.970> nice<00:03:15.209> slicing<00:03:15.780> portion<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.920> half<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.610> we

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
this nice slicing portion in half so we
