00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.180
 and my dad 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.529
 my mind with yes this one is unique and 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 of course there are basic principles 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.700
 good position at one point or another 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.700
 let's say this is some kind of navel 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.950
 near with great depth with avatar headlights 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.930
 depths up but this navel on 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.000
 watering 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.770
 either it's pretty cool brow she 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.970
 maybe zakari wife and maybe in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.190
 shell rock 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.290
 or some kind of board which is sharp 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
 breaks into the mainstream these are all good places 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.480
 to search for big fish so here's a classic 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.460
 genre it is of course get up for more 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.879
 depth and throw shallower but 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:58.710
 far from always this classic works 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:01.079
 let's say very important when the scoreboard 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.819
 pour in some concrete snag like 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.360
 you have a bait regarding 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:09.030
 this snag happens very long 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 reasoning that a colleague lies like this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.270
 way the twigs she has directed here in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.580
 this side therefore 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.440
 well let's say she went with the flow and branches 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.770
 she is also directed with the flow 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.880
 accordingly so as not to thrust us 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.460
 load along with a slingshot bait from 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.800
 sticks we need to stand not top but 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.590
 Respectively below and throw up stream 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.540
 licking as it were these squirts with one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.560
 hand to catch so probably more convenient 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 hooks least but not the fact that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.040
 this position is most like 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 fish so in fact I most often 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.020
 repelled by simple banal 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.380
 of experiments if i find some 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.290
 good point i prefer to get up in 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.260
 depth get up right to the right under 90 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.200
 degrees are under 90 degrees if this 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.900
 the point is really quality if you 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.770
 you feel the potential but you feel 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.849
 what well how to say it of course it is on 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.769
 faces of feelings that is impossible to see 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.269
 place and say oh I stand wrong 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.860
 so I don't catch anything now I 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.860
 I will move there and I will catch 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.620
 so never happens to me so 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.200
 never happens you constantly 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.370
 try you got up so got up so got up 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.440
 so and then you 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.420
 reveals for this point the most 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.239
 optimal position repeatedly happened 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.750
 so that lies some subject let's say 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.760
 on 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.560
 there easy flow you get up on top and 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.140
 accordingly throw the classics down 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.800
 adrift jack well let's say it 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.720
 Jack against bites stream no 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.330
 move 180 degrees 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.980
 regarding this obstacle and throw 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.200
 respectively up stream and pull 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.420
 bait downstream start biting 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.660
 so here I would advise more 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.630
 experiment more trying 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.450
 different formulation of the boat exactly 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.269
 so be able to fully assess 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.610
 the potential of this that is especially if in 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.920
 this point is something you are attracted to it there 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.130
 very hard bottom who likes zander 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.709
 or the presence of feed fish which is good 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.350
 you can see waha lot some pretty snag 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.780
 at optimum depths of 3 4 5 6 meters 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.260
 all these are great places that 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.350
 require a certain unique in themselves 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.570
 approach and sometimes many anglers and in 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.090
 including athletes can not unravel 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.980
 some particular place just by 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.049
 one banal reason that they 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.840
 tried from one of two directions and 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.840
 this direction for the fish turned out 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.840
 uncomfortable
