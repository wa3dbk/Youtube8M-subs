00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.719
 but guys in this video we will only do 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.920
 the rom 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 ROM for do not know how to speak 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 but it is the name that this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.750
 rom which is a rock 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.830
 we will install next whose 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.130
 requirements are the same as always 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.869
 root and album recovery cost to which 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.029
 they pick up records are always what 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.899
 leave in the description as well as 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.579
 the rice in a mega link 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 so let's go basically to which 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.680
 it would be the installation of our breaker 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.390
 to start better said and always 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.960
 we will be entering our recovery 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.550
 either I'll touch him again touch 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.070
 As you know, they can be any of the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 two in this case, we oppress the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 volume keys plus and power to 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.050
 access to this menu where it will give us 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 then to choose our start mode 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.330
 which we will choose 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.760
 then recovery and here we have to do 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.930
 the simple waves which are to go 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 our web menu give you apart free 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.220
 we hope or good only I do not know why 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.860
 what do we just go to the next web 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.420
 which is street we're going to equal 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.400
 format and then likewise 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.430
 we get wait it's a pretty process 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.070
 short and we 're going to the last of the big 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.340
 sky and we go back to where it says moon and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.340
 storage let's form system 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.850
 and then this step is to make a 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.729
 clean installation I've sat down this 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.520
 step in many roms and we will recommend 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.759
 again, do this step because then 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.850
 avoid future webs failures in development 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.869
 and now we are going to urge them 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.320
 from building and then here we have the rom 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.979
 is already here is the one that is marked on 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.659
 reach there is therefore we have to flyer 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.070
 in this case we have to wait for 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.200
 then install in our rom 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.440
 to start with an albert scent and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.720
 we emphasize that if it is next and we hope 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.209
 now so you can finish the process 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.190
 of installation good guys we already have 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.370
 installed development the next would be 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:26.540
 give to next and then to direct us 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.540
 new to our menu by menu 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.850
 and now if we have to realize our 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.490
 device so that we can already 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.220
 enjoy development 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.400
 we see it has an annex style animation 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.970
 I do not know good attachments reminds me 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.550
 colors to the annexes 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.050
 but then we wait for them to start not 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.560
 we know the first clue is the most 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.959
 covered that we're going there 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.150
 and well guys we have installed then 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.930
 development in this case then give us the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.959
 welcome then with something quite short 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.530
 but good in the shortcut I do not know if 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.420
 I made a failure of my rom phone 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.340
 entire 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.670
 and good guys here we have a wallpaper 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.880
 quite weird and then we see that they are 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.610
 pretty big icons which then we 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.220
 leads to infer that they have the same 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.069
 density of pixels in the same density 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.590
 of screen then what came from the factory 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.150
 when is the phone and it is a 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.580
 rom android style 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.690
 lollipop 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.430
 which is therefore quite acceptable 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.460
 You could say that it is not the most 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.380
 floridas that you can we can try in 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.460
 this device which is for widgets 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.550
 120 but yes that's great and say the 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.970
 option to those of us who want to have style 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.520
 in lollipop but yes that is a rom 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.260
 lollipop in which they also leave a 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.180
 link in the description of what is the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.010
 better than I have tried for then this 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.280
 device which is the emulsion 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.080
 lollipop so I say goodbye here 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.730
 remember to subscribe because this channel 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.209
 we will be uploading more content then 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.190
 well and I say goodbye to see here not like that 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.190
