of any kind of bacteria and help with
variables<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.079> well<00:01:46.670> um<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.119> mean<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.840> know

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
variables as well um I mean I don't know

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.120 
variables as well um I mean I don't know
for<00:01:49.920> sure<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.229> guess<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.470> who's<00:01:52.770> making

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
for sure but I guess so who's making

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
for sure but I guess so who's making
your<00:01:53.220> skin<00:01:53.340> soft<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.360> supple<00:01:54.780> been

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.889 
your skin soft and you know supple been
I<00:01:54.960> guess<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.439> why<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.979> basically<00:01:56.430> use<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
I guess so why do you basically use this

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.120 
I guess so why do you basically use this
performance<00:01:57.899> I'm<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.259> keep<00:01:58.469> my<00:01:58.560> skin<00:01:58.829> soft
