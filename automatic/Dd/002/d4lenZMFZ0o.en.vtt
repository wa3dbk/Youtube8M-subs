just in case so I'm not sure what small
amount<00:00:57.239> means<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:58.109> gonna<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.500> assume

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
amount means but I'm gonna make assume

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
amount means but I'm gonna make assume
that<00:00:59.250> means<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.199> like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that means just a little it just like

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.000 
that means just a little it just like
that<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.190> becoming<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.640> damp<00:01:04.010> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that see it's becoming a damp so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.830 
that see it's becoming a damp so
actually<00:01:05.460> gonna<00:01:05.580> zoom<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.299> gave<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.689> guys

a<00:01:06.869> closer<00:01:07.260> shot<00:01:07.530> off<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.799> Charlie's<00:01:08.220> uh

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
a closer shot off with Charlie's uh

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.359 
a closer shot off with Charlie's uh
tear-stained<00:01:09.810> looks<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
tear-stained looks like I think the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
tear-stained looks like I think the
reason<00:01:11.640> why<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.150> bad<00:01:12.299> right<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
reason why it's so bad right now is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
reason why it's so bad right now is
because<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.049> actually<00:01:13.590> trimmed<00:01:14.100> around<00:01:15.060> his

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
because I actually trimmed around his

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.539 
because I actually trimmed around his
eyes<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:16.140> i<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.470> means<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.790> tear

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
eyes which i think means that the tear

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.480 
eyes which i think means that the tear
wetness<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.409> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.740> spreads<00:01:23.130> more

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
wetness it it kind of spreads more

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.800 
wetness it it kind of spreads more
because<00:01:23.790> there's<00:01:23.970> less<00:01:24.090> hair<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> absorbent

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
because there's less hair to absorbent

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.730 
because there's less hair to absorbent
in<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.080> area<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.710> um<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:27.810> probably<00:01:28.259> won't<00:01:28.500> cut

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
in one area so um I probably won't cut

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
in one area so um I probably won't cut
it<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.920> short<00:01:28.979> next<00:01:29.460> time<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.299> one

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

better<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:43.860> wiping<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.280> up<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> mean

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
better have it wiping it up so I mean

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.940 
better have it wiping it up so I mean
it's<00:03:46.410> definitely<00:03:46.740> a<00:03:47.070> little<00:03:47.250> more<00:03:48.530> soapy<00:03:49.530> than

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
it's definitely a little more soapy than

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.680 
it's definitely a little more soapy than
some<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.340> other<00:03:50.490> products<00:03:50.940> when<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.540> say

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
some of the other products when I say

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.350 
some of the other products when I say
Sophie<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.260> there's<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.680> lather<00:03:53.240> and<00:03:54.240> I'm

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
Sophie and there's like a lather and I'm

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.699 
Sophie and there's like a lather and I'm
definitely<00:03:54.690> know<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.020> not<00:03:55.200> used<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.470> seeing

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
definitely know I'm not used to seeing

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.770 
definitely know I'm not used to seeing
that<00:03:55.860> listen<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> other<00:03:56.459> product<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.450> don't

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
that listen the other product so I don't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.900 
that listen the other product so I don't
know<00:03:57.840> what<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.080> means<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.890> hope<00:03:59.490> it<00:03:59.670> means

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
know what that means but I hope it means

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.810 
know what that means but I hope it means
it's<00:04:00.150> gonna<00:04:00.270> help<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:01.430> okay<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.700> think

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
it's gonna help it okay so I think

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.260 
it's gonna help it okay so I think
that's<00:04:03.120> enough<00:04:03.390> wiping<00:04:04.190> let's<00:04:05.190> get<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.000> closer

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
that's enough wiping let's get a closer

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.090 
that's enough wiping let's get a closer
look<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.810> compare<00:04:09.530> okay<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.739> we<00:04:10.920> just

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
look and compare okay so we just

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.660 
look and compare okay so we just
finished<00:04:12.110> applying<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.380> solution<00:04:13.830> as<00:04:14.070> you

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
finished applying the solution as you

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.190 
finished applying the solution as you
can<00:04:14.820> see<00:04:14.970> on<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.270> side<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.840> side<00:04:16.049> we

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
can see on this side this is the side we

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.380 
can see on this side this is the side we
we<00:04:17.040> applied<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.640> solution<00:04:17.970> on<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.239> looks

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
we applied the solution on it looks

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.670 
we applied the solution on it looks
actually<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.840> little<00:04:19.049> bit<00:04:19.169> better<00:04:19.320> than<00:04:19.560> the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
actually a little bit better than the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.710 
actually a little bit better than the
other<00:04:19.859> side<00:04:20.130> as<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.460> can<00:04:20.609> see<00:04:20.850> there<00:04:21.540> side

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
other side as you can see there side

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.530 
other side as you can see there side
looks<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.989> little<00:04:22.080> bit

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
looks a little bit

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
looks a little bit
a<00:04:22.570> little<00:04:23.110> more<00:04:23.230> clumpy<00:04:23.680> er<00:04:23.740> then<00:04:24.670> this<00:04:24.910> side

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
a little more clumpy er then this side

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.220 
a little more clumpy er then this side
but<00:04:26.560> obviously<00:04:27.040> it's<00:04:27.670> still<00:04:28.210> there<00:04:28.450> it's<00:04:29.200> very

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
but obviously it's still there it's very

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.700 
but obviously it's still there it's very
dark<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.810> like<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.930> said<00:04:32.080> I'm<00:04:32.260> gonna<00:04:32.410> continue

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
dark so like I said I'm gonna continue

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.760 
dark so like I said I'm gonna continue
to<00:04:32.860> apply<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.130> for<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.520> few<00:04:33.700> days<00:04:33.880> overtime

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
to apply this for a few days overtime

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.990 
to apply this for a few days overtime
and<00:04:35.770> wipe<00:04:35.980> up<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.490> see<00:04:36.580> if<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.760> makes<00:04:36.880> a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
and wipe up and see if it makes a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.250 
and wipe up and see if it makes a
difference<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.660> will<00:04:37.840> keep<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.050> guys

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
difference and I will keep you guys
