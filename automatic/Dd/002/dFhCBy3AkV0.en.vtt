very much in the process of trying to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860 
very much in the process of trying to

was very intimidated by this section of
the<00:00:38.640> book<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.940> yet<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> knew<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.050> needed

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the book and yet I knew that it needed

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
the book and yet I knew that it needed
to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.530> addressed<00:00:40.770> somehow<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.879> making<00:00:42.270> sure

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to be addressed somehow in making sure

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
to be addressed somehow in making sure
that<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.660> shaping<00:00:42.930> our<00:00:43.230> children<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that we are shaping our children and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
that we are shaping our children and
really<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> overarching<00:00:45.059> principle<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
really the overarching principle of it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
really the overarching principle of it
is<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.920> love<00:00:47.160> our<00:00:47.340> children

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is that when we love our children

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.790 
is that when we love our children
sometimes<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.420> love<00:00:48.690> doesn't<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.590> like

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
sometimes that love doesn't look like

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.590 
sometimes that love doesn't look like
love<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> doesn't<00:00:50.850> feel<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.120> love

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
love to them it doesn't feel like love

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
love to them it doesn't feel like love
to<00:00:51.750> them<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> hard<00:00:52.649> tough<00:00:53.309> love<00:00:53.610> because

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to them it is a hard tough love because

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.490 
to them it is a hard tough love because
we're<00:00:54.030> trying<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> train<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.379> our
