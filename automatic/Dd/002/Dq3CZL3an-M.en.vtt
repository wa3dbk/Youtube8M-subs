 hi friends today we are going to make a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.390
 puff pastry with angel hair 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.970
 puff pastry we have it ready and what 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.379

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.019
 ready to work we will need it 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.199
 sugar to throw over 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.000
 angel hair pine nuts that also 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.890

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.649
 link so you can see it 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.649
 and a little bit of control 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.560
 first we will click on the clock before the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.520
 central part leaving one centimeter 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.520
 edge 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.430
 when we have already punctured all we have 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.230
 left a centimeter an inch and 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.550
 half or so because that's 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.560
 will raise now we are going to paint him with 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.229
 4 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.049
 another liquor if you want to put it as if not 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.409
 what to arrange is equal only the party 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.299
 that we have punctured is like this 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.310
 with a little bit of liquor because it gives you a 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.240
 good taste without overdoing 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.840
 from where we clicked 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 A) Yes 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.780
 now we will extend the hair of angel 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.450
 this is a natural angel hair that 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.359
 we did it in another of our videos 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.250
 that you can see in our channel is 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.250
 made with cider 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.570
 well let's extend the distribution well 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.390
 when we already have 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.200
 all the angel hair put 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.440
 we will paint with egg with a yolk 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 egg 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.280
 and a little bit reduced with water 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.020
 the edges 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.020
 that's how they will choose more colors 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.000
 and then we will put the pine nuts 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.500
 for the whole cake 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.500
 you'll see how good this is 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.120
 generous 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.380
 we crush them a little 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.970
 so they do not jump in my opinion is 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.330
 you can also put laminated almonds 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.280
 burst to the consumer's taste and 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.900
 next 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.900
 we will put sugar 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.489
 at 200 degrees above and below 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.180
 to know each other 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.269

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.360
