I<00:00:42.790> mean<00:00:43.059> to<00:00:43.809> Parrish<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:45.250> can<00:00:45.489> just<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.870> that

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
I mean to Parrish you can just see that

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.700 
I mean to Parrish you can just see that
it's<00:00:47.620> just<00:00:47.770> a<00:00:47.920> line<00:00:49.890> around<00:00:50.890> there<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:53.140> did

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
it's just a line around there and I did

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's just a line around there and I did
replace<00:00:54.070> them<00:00:54.280> with<00:00:54.399> these<00:00:54.840> which<00:00:55.840> was<00:00:56.020> off<00:00:56.140> my

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
replace them with these which was off my

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.340 
replace them with these which was off my
child's<00:00:56.620> bike<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.520> by<00:00:58.420> wanting<00:00:58.690> yellow<00:00:59.109> ones

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
child's bike and by wanting yellow ones

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
child's bike and by wanting yellow ones
a<00:01:00.090> second<00:01:01.090> these<00:01:01.210> off<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.750> I<00:01:02.170> can<00:01:02.320> reuse<00:01:02.500> those

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a second these off and I can reuse those

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.210 
a second these off and I can reuse those
another<00:01:04.239> thing<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.570> look<00:01:04.659> out<00:01:04.839> for<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.830> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
another thing to look out for is the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.539 
another thing to look out for is the
clips<00:01:06.729> clips<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:07.840> hold<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.200> few<00:01:08.380> lines<00:01:08.590> on<00:01:08.830> to

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
clips clips that hold a few lines on to

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.070 
clips clips that hold a few lines on to
the<00:01:09.640> pipes<00:01:09.880> etc<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:11.140> rusty<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.869> brittle<00:01:13.869> and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
the pipes etc get rusty and brittle and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.170 
the pipes etc get rusty and brittle and
brick<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.770> they're<00:01:15.340> not<00:01:15.430> very<00:01:15.580> good<00:01:15.670> either

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
brick and they're not very good either

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.440 
brick and they're not very good either
so<00:01:17.009> replacing<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.100> fewer<00:01:18.310> lines<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:19.210> want<00:01:19.270> to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
so replacing the fewer lines you want to

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.830 
so replacing the fewer lines you want to
buy<00:01:19.630> some<00:01:20.200> good<00:01:20.409> high<00:01:21.009> quality<00:01:21.490> silicone<00:01:22.000> fuel

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
buy some good high quality silicone fuel

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
buy some good high quality silicone fuel
line<00:01:23.049> now<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:23.950> can<00:01:24.100> see<00:01:24.280> if<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:24.460> look<00:01:24.640> at<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
line now you can see if you look at the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.760 
line now you can see if you look at the
thickness<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:26.909> compared<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.680> the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
thickness of that compared to the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.450 
thickness of that compared to the
thinness<00:01:30.040> of<00:01:30.130> that

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
thinness of that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.010 
thinness of that
you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> straight<00:01:33.420> difference<00:01:33.870> in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you can see a straight difference in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.750 
you can see a straight difference in
color<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.630> knots<00:01:37.229> flexible<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:38.040> lot

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
color and these knots flexible a lot

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.310 
color and these knots flexible a lot
more<00:01:38.909> durable<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:41.720> they<00:01:42.720> look<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.140> better

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
more durable and they look a lot better

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.670 
more durable and they look a lot better

watch out for these and fuel lines or if
you<00:02:15.510> buy<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.720> straight<00:02:15.930> where<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.950> want

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you buy it straight where you just want

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.040 
you buy it straight where you just want
to<00:02:17.280> replace<00:02:18.000> these<00:02:18.330> straightaway<00:02:18.660> before

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
to replace these straightaway before

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.370 
to replace these straightaway before
even<00:02:19.200> going<00:02:19.380> out<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.540> they're<00:02:22.290> not

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
even going out you know they're not

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.229 
even going out you know they're not
expensive<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.730> going<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.940> save<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.180> a

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
expensive and it's going to save you a

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.699 
expensive and it's going to save you a
lot<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> hustle<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.019> long<00:02:25.290> run<00:02:25.519> and

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
lot of hustle in the long run and

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.070 
lot of hustle in the long run and
another<00:02:28.709> thing<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.370> would<00:02:29.840> look<00:02:30.840> out<00:02:31.019> for

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
another thing that I would look out for

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.539 
another thing that I would look out for
also<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.300> condition<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.860> fuel<00:02:35.130> filter

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
also is the condition of the fuel filter

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.740 
also is the condition of the fuel filter
see<00:02:36.390> mine<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.810> starting<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> perish<00:02:37.890> and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
see mine is just starting to perish and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.360 
see mine is just starting to perish and
I've<00:02:39.750> taken<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.680> apart<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.130> I've<00:02:41.190> looked

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
I've taken this apart and I've looked

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.039 
I've taken this apart and I've looked
inside<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.060> single<00:02:42.600> condition

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
inside and it's single condition

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.690 
inside and it's single condition
somewhat<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:43.620> bothered<00:02:43.920> about<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:46.700> but

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
somewhat so bothered about that and but

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.310 
somewhat so bothered about that and but
