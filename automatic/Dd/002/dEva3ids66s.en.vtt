00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
alright so just one thing is that this

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.260

is a six milligram liquid so let's talk

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.610 
is a six milligram liquid so let's talk
about<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.570> vapor<00:03:04.720> vapors<00:03:05.170> actually<00:03:05.440> very

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
about the vapor vapors actually very

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.680 
about the vapor vapors actually very
good<00:03:05.830> they<00:03:06.250> don't<00:03:06.430> advertise<00:03:07.120> their<00:03:07.390> ratio

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
good they don't advertise their ratio

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.420 
good they don't advertise their ratio
but<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.930> would<00:03:08.110> assume<00:03:08.320> this<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:08.530> around<00:03:08.800> 50<00:03:09.130> 50

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
but I would assume this is around 50 50

but I would assume this is around 50 50

middle it's funny when you open up a

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.440 
middle it's funny when you open up a
pack<00:03:43.300> of<00:03:44.430> biscuits<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.550> Oreos<00:03:46.000> or<00:03:46.030> whatever

pack of biscuits like Oreos or whatever
it<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.050> if<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.350> smell<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:47.830> immediately

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
it is and if you smell it immediately

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.190

when<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.430> fresh<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:49.180> has<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.570> unique<00:03:49.750> smell

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
when it's fresh it has that unique smell

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.070 
when it's fresh it has that unique smell
