this<00:00:12.620> step<00:00:13.400> it<00:00:13.639> is<00:00:13.730> the<00:00:13.879> center<00:00:14.299> of<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.629> wheel

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
this step it is the center of the wheel

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.410 
this step it is the center of the wheel
these<00:00:15.289> were<00:00:15.619> romantic<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:16.700> a<00:00:17.029> lot<00:00:17.240> of

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
these were romantic and a lot of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.240 
these were romantic and a lot of
experience<00:00:17.960> and<00:00:18.860> husband<00:00:19.490> shape<00:00:19.700> is<00:00:19.970> involved

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
experience and husband shape is involved

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.310 
experience and husband shape is involved
the<00:00:22.250> first<00:00:22.520> step<00:00:22.789> is<00:00:23.829> set<00:00:24.829> the<00:00:24.980> proper<00:00:25.250> wheel

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
the first step is set the proper wheel

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:36.610 
the first step is set the proper wheel
to<00:00:27.320> make<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:28.840> straight<00:00:29.840> line<00:00:35.110> folks<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.410> tie

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
to make the straight line folks to tie

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.520 
to make the straight line folks to tie
the<00:00:36.680> wheel<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.820> left<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.420> go<00:00:38.600> in<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.379> right

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
the wheel to the left to go in the right

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.970 
the wheel to the left to go in the right
direction<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:44.480> operation<00:00:45.050> takes<00:00:45.289> us<00:00:45.649> to<00:00:45.800> an

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
direction this operation takes us to an

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:58.389 
direction this operation takes us to an
experienced<00:00:46.579> operator<00:00:47.059> about<00:00:48.249> 15<00:00:56.679> ok<00:00:57.679> once<00:00:57.980> we

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
experienced operator about 15 ok once we

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.479 
experienced operator about 15 ok once we
find<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.480> straight<00:00:59.809> forward<00:01:00.399> direction<00:01:01.399> of

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
find the straight forward direction of

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.139 
find the straight forward direction of
the<00:01:01.670> wheel

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
the wheel

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.610

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.999 

you<00:01:17.420> can<00:01:17.720> see<00:01:17.930> operating<00:01:18.470> on<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.710> spokes

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
you can see operating on the spokes

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.030 
you can see operating on the spokes
these<00:01:19.640> already<00:01:20.030> straining<00:01:20.600> up<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.530> direction

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
these already straining up the direction

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.240 
these already straining up the direction
of<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.280> wheel<00:01:23.710> when<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.830> wood<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.040> going<00:01:25.130> to

operate on the spurts everything is
going<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.009> change<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:34.700> it's<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:35.030> slow<00:01:35.360> process

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
going to change so it's a slow process
