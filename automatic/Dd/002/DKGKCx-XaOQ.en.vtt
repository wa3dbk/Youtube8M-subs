00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello welcome to do it 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 yourself inspiration here is kati and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.569
 this is the next challenge video of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.880
 Eva and me 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.280
 and today our theme is bookmark 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.670
 I have a parking strip for this 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.199
 it is 30 cm long and 5 cm wide 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.410
 by chance you already have such a nice one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.330
 Snakes pattern if only a few 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.740
 Fat daddy, of course, you can do that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.660
 also paint yourself beautiful 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.730
 then I have a loop tape here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.600
 It also has a length of about 30 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.600
 centimeters 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.390
 I have two eyes 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.920
 if you do not have such eyes you can 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.020
 of course, also made of cardboard in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.090
 small white circle and small ones 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.390
 Cut out a black circle and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.489
 then I stick to each other here 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 a pair of scissors and all-purpose glue first 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.379
 I'll click my strip off like that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.379
 one above the other 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.020
 Now I'm cutting it all over here 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.240
 are a bit awesome 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.870
 you should all look like one 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870
 snake head 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.240
 and in my head this could 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.240
 loop tape in 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.719
 I'm doing this for now here 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.079
 Papa opened again and here in the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.079
 Area 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.820
 home glue 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.080
 defender on both sides 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.940
 not too much used it depends 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.940
 the sides out again and distribute 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.610
 the front again something directly synonymous 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.860
 All-purpose glue here at the tips 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.620
 and now I put this grind here 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.620
 and at home nicely in the middle 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.490
 and then I believe the whole thing 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.350
 nice and straight now and that must be good now 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.540
 dry best I lay there for 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.420
 make a book with it, too 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.490
 really good together 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.980
 the tongue here in front of the cut I 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.849
 now as one 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.849
 to snake 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.640
 and these eyes are lucky here 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.810
 self-adhesive but otherwise you can 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.430
 Of course it's just a bit too 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:36.530
 Make glue behind and they will come 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.710
 still on the front of the face if that 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.710
 bad 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.910
 but it has to dry well now 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.930
 you can already see the result one 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.460
 snake as finished and yes that was 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.380
 really very simple and she 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.240
 still totally cute you can also nice 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.470
 give away 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.180
 I'll show you again what it looks like 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.420

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.010
 or here in my neighborhood book in my 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.310

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.850
 out with both eyes and the long 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.950
 split tongue so I hope you 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.139

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.790

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.550
