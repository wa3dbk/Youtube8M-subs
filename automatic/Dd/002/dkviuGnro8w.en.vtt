a review of my skates I do have the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.180 
a review of my skates I do have the
retail<00:04:58.730> version<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:59.150> these<00:04:59.410> which<00:05:00.410> are<00:05:00.650> actual

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
retail version of these which are actual

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.530 
retail version of these which are actual
you<00:05:01.340> know<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.580> stiffest<00:05:01.970> at<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.210> retail

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
you know the stiffest at the retail

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.160 
you know the stiffest at the retail
comes<00:05:02.780> which<00:05:02.930> is<00:05:03.050> would<00:05:03.170> be<00:05:03.200> about<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.940> 3.5

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
comes which is would be about a 3.5

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.110 
comes which is would be about a 3.5
maximum<00:05:06.170> out<00:05:06.440> of<00:05:06.680> five<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.280> these<00:05:07.790> are<00:05:08.000> the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
maximum out of five and these are the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.820 
maximum out of five and these are the
stiffest<00:05:08.510> because<00:05:08.810> these<00:05:08.930> are<00:05:09.080> actually<00:05:09.200> pro

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
stiffest because these are actually pro

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.490 
stiffest because these are actually pro
ones<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:11.210> these<00:05:11.390> will<00:05:11.600> not<00:05:11.750> fall<00:05:12.020> apart<00:05:12.320> of

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
ones so these will not fall apart of
