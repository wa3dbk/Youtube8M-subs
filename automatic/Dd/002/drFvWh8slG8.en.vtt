you you can work with creativity in in
order<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:31.720> different<00:01:32.140> fields<00:01:32.649> so<00:01:33.369> it's<00:01:33.610> not

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
order in different fields so it's not

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.990 
order in different fields so it's not
only<00:01:34.500> thinking<00:01:35.500> about<00:01:35.619> one<00:01:36.070> thing<00:01:36.310> but<00:01:36.369> try<00:01:36.939> to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
only thinking about one thing but try to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.230 
only thinking about one thing but try to
have<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.440> bigger<00:01:39.159> perspective<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:40.000> big

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
have like a bigger perspective that big

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.230 
have like a bigger perspective that big
a<00:01:40.270> strong<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.750> little<00:01:41.740> bit<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.549> it's<00:01:42.700> becoming<00:01:43.060> a

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
a strong a little bit so it's becoming a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.620 
a strong a little bit so it's becoming a
bigger<00:01:43.539> concept<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.369> project<00:01:46.090> with<00:01:46.479> you

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
bigger concept so it's project with you

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.490 
bigger concept so it's project with you
we<00:01:46.869> try<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.170> have<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:47.799> in<00:01:48.220> mind
