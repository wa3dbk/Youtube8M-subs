own personal revolution and most of my
weapons<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.119> art<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> write<00:00:22.410> songs<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
guitar which is like that I don't really

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
guitar which is like that I don't really
know<00:00:27.390> how<00:00:27.539> effective<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.140> revolution<00:00:28.740> really

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
know how effective my revolution really

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.150 
know how effective my revolution really
is<00:00:29.840> but<00:00:30.840> my<00:00:31.019> character<00:00:31.349> own<00:00:31.500> show<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
is but my character own show is in the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.630 
is but my character own show is in the
middle<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.820> violent<00:00:33.000> revolution<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
middle of a violent revolution but I I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
middle of a violent revolution but I I
think<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.420> that's<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.690> probably<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
think that that's really probably the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.000 
think that that's really probably the
only<00:00:37.800> major<00:00:38.040> difference<00:00:38.190> between<00:00:38.640> him<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> me

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
only major difference between him and me

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.610 
only major difference between him and me
because<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:42.140> Barnabas<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> looking

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
because I think that Barnabas is looking

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
because I think that Barnabas is looking
out<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> society<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.489> eating<00:00:44.940> itself<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
out on a society that's eating itself a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
out on a society that's eating itself a
lot<00:00:45.600> head<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.960> far<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.260> he's<00:00:46.379> concerned<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
lot head as far as he's concerned and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.000 
lot head as far as he's concerned and
he's<00:00:47.010> he's<00:00:47.910> looking<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.530> v-club<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
he's he's looking at the v-club kind of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.580 
he's he's looking at the v-club kind of
like<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> Coliseum<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> old<00:00:51.360> Rome<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> seeing

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
disgusted by that he wasn't changing so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.290 
disgusted by that he wasn't changing so
I<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.030> where<00:01:00.210> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I can I can kind of see where it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.700 
I can I can kind of see where it's
coming<00:01:00.329> from<00:01:00.600> actually<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.559> he's<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
coming from actually I just think he's a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.009 
coming from actually I just think he's a
little<00:01:01.859> dramatic<00:01:02.129> about<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.960> weapon<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
little dramatic about it weapon of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
little dramatic about it weapon of
choice<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:05.100> were<00:01:05.489> pretty<00:01:05.640> good<00:01:05.790> character

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
choice you were pretty good character
together<00:01:06.360> were<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.840> caucus<00:01:07.170> points<00:01:07.500> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
together were there in caucus points in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.500 
together were there in caucus points in
today's<00:01:08.790> world<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.540> geopolitical<00:01:09.990> see

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
today's world the geopolitical see

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.860 
today's world the geopolitical see
you<00:01:11.080> used<00:01:11.580> well<00:01:12.580> yeah<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.330> think<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.690> any

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
you used well yeah and I think that any

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.270 
you used well yeah and I think that any
time<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.140> have<00:01:14.410> a<00:01:14.440> character<00:01:14.860> who<00:01:14.980> thinks

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
time you have a character who thinks

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.600 
time you have a character who thinks
that<00:01:15.400> he<00:01:15.610> is<00:01:15.640> he<00:01:16.510> knows<00:01:16.750> what<00:01:17.140> God<00:01:17.650> lost<00:01:18.160> and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
that he is he knows what God lost and

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.040 
that he is he knows what God lost and
then<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:18.790> can<00:01:18.910> do<00:01:19.030> anything<00:01:19.360> so<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:19.750> think<00:01:19.840> that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
then it can do anything so I think that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.010 
then it can do anything so I think that
you<00:01:20.260> could<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.860> could<00:01:21.010> pick<00:01:21.250> I<00:01:21.600> chose<00:01:22.600> Timothy

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
you could you could pick I chose Timothy

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.910 
you could you could pick I chose Timothy
the<00:01:23.140> debate<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.840> don't<00:01:26.560> know<00:01:26.770> about

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
the debate because I don't know about

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.130 
the debate because I don't know about
Muslims<00:01:27.520> too<00:01:27.730> much<00:01:27.910> I<00:01:28.390> thought<00:01:28.630> this<00:01:28.900> guy<00:01:29.080> who

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
Muslims too much I thought this guy who

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.280 
Muslims too much I thought this guy who
spoke<00:01:29.500> English<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.450> think<00:01:34.960> anytime<00:01:35.140> you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
spoke English but I think anytime you

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.200 
spoke English but I think anytime you
have<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.620> surety<00:01:36.070> didn't<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.460> danger

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
have that surety didn't have a danger

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.410 
have that surety didn't have a danger
that<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.510> can<00:01:37.660> do<00:01:37.780> anything<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:40.030> think

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
that you can do anything and I think

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.900 
that you can do anything and I think
that<00:01:40.570> probably<00:01:40.780> in<00:01:41.080> any<00:01:41.260> culture<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:42.130> any

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
that probably in any culture and any

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.910 
that probably in any culture and any
religion<00:01:43.360> there<00:01:43.510> are<00:01:43.630> people<00:01:43.990> who<00:01:44.530> think<00:01:44.560> that

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
religion there are people who think that

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.290 
religion there are people who think that
they<00:01:45.160> know<00:01:45.340> everything<00:01:45.760> whether<00:01:46.060> they're

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
they know everything whether they're

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.450 
they know everything whether they're
Jewish<00:01:46.660> or<00:01:46.930> Muslim<00:01:46.960> or<00:01:47.470> Christian<00:01:47.950> or<00:01:48.100> maybe

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
Jewish or Muslim or Christian or maybe

analogous<00:05:10.789> or<00:05:11.029> great<00:05:11.299> people<00:05:11.659> away<00:05:11.839> from<00:05:11.869> the

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
analogous or great people away from the

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.169

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:14.179 
idea of what a science fiction show

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:15.309 
idea of what a science fiction show
would<00:05:14.329> be<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:14.659> it<00:05:14.779> doesn't<00:05:15.049> have<00:05:15.139> to<00:05:15.289> be

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
would be that it doesn't have to be

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.079 
would be that it doesn't have to be
completely<00:05:15.709> action<00:05:16.309> adventure<00:05:16.669> Bay's<00:05:16.849> that
