 how do we check 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.920
 if the sound is working well in our computer 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:12.499
 First 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.129

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.509
 then 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.890
 we make 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 a double click 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.250

 and we have to make sure that in this window this option appears on 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.660

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 that you can put and remove the Czech sea that for example 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 delay with that goes in the toolbar 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.640
