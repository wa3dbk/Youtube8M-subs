00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.748
 In this video, we will multiply 36 × 27 

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:08.127
 This will be a binary number with another binary number 

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:13.067
 The calculation method will be first by multiplying 36 x 7 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.042
 And then we have to hit 36 ​​× 20 

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.826
 We derive the number and then we combine the two numbers together 

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:25.156
 What I want to do first is to show you the calculation 

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:27.957
 To know how to hit these two numbers, and then I will calculate them again 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.192
 We will think a bit more about what different numbers represent 

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:36.241
 So let's start this process. I will multiply 36 × 7 

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:37.740
 36 x 7 

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:43.000
 So I can begin with the singular, 6 x 7 = 42 

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:48.902
 We'll write 2 down here and 4 representing 40 I can put in place of dozens 

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:55.635
 7 x 3 = 21 + 4 = 25 

00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:59.931
 So I can write 25 here, there is no place to carry this 2 

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:03.303
 So I'll just type 2 here in hundreds place, 

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:07.208
 Now, let's move forward, I'll clean this so that we do not get confused 

00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:10.426
 So we just have to know what the result is 7 × 36 

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:17.183
 And is 252. Let us now think about the outcome of 20 × 36 

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.067
 And now what we will do now is to set 0 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.978
 Because we will now multiply 36 by a certain number in the place of dozens 

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:27.123
 These are not only 2, they are 20 

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:31.000
 So 2, or should I say ... Well let's follow with the numbers now 

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:34.907
 And then I will explain .. We will think about it in terms of the value of the place 

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:41.251
 The second time, 6 hit 2 equals 12 write 2 here, 

00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:47.482
 We carry 1, 2 x 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:53.625
 And so we have known the result of 20 × 36 and 720 

00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:56.815
 And to think about what will happen if we do not put 0 here 

00:01:56.876 --> 00:02:01.074
 And then you will know that 2 × 36 = 72 but these 2 are not just 2 

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:07.154
 They are 20, so 36 × 20 = 720 

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:13.049
 Now we can combine these two numbers, because 36 × 27 equals the same result as 36 × 20 

00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:17.758
 + 7 × 36, so let's combine these numbers together 

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:29.459
 0 + 2 = 2, 5 + 2 = 7, 2 + 7 = 9, and we get 972 

00:02:29.506 --> 00:02:32.358
 Now I will solve it again, 

00:02:32.404 --> 00:02:38.343
 But this time, I'm going to talk about what these figures really represent 

00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:41.916
 Hopefully in the first track, you've seen the way to do it 

00:02:41.977 --> 00:02:45.119
 We will now think about what these numbers actually represent, 

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:53.427
 Therefore, we will multiply 7 x 36, so 7 multiply 6 equals 42, we will write 2 

00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:59.801
 In the place of the one, we can place 40 in place of tens, 4 representing 40 

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:09.513
 7 × 30 = 210 + 40 + 250, 252, We own 2 in place of the individual. 

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:16.125
 So we got 252, 36 x 7 = 252, let's now clean it up. 

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:28.303
 And now let's hit 6 × 20 and that will give us 120, so let's write 20 in 

00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:34.271
 Place the scores and then we hold 100, or we hold 1 which represents 100 

00:03:34.302 --> 00:03:42.898
 And now 2 hit ..... or should I say 20 × 30 will give us 600+ hundred more 

00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:54.410
 Will give us 700, so we knew that 20 × 36 = 720, 

00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:57.635
 7 in place of hundreds, 2 in place of dozens 

00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.751
 And then we can bring them together again, just like we did last time 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.830
 We got 972.
