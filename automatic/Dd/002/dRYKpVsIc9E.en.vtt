see that we've been torching all day
putting<00:00:10.920> our<00:00:11.070> base<00:00:11.250> sheets<00:00:11.550> on<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:13.400> we've<00:00:14.400> got

this<00:00:14.759> field<00:00:15.030> luck<00:00:15.269> today<00:00:15.590> so<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.100> see

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
this field luck today so here we can see

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.529 
this field luck today so here we can see
seems<00:00:18.560> demonstrating<00:00:19.560> how<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.130> done

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
seems demonstrating how this is done

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.560 
seems demonstrating how this is done
role<00:00:22.140> has<00:00:22.349> been<00:00:22.380> laid<00:00:22.800> out<00:00:22.829> and<00:00:23.300> then<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> gets

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
role has been laid out and then it gets

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.259 
role has been laid out and then it gets
back<00:00:24.900> rolled<00:00:25.289> from<00:00:25.739> one<00:00:25.980> end<00:00:26.160> roughly<00:00:27.089> two

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
back rolled from one end roughly two

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.490 
back rolled from one end roughly two
about<00:00:27.570> mid<00:00:27.989> point<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.880> then<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.869> hurt<00:00:31.079> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
about mid point and then the hurt the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.579 
about mid point and then the hurt the
surface<00:00:31.919> as<00:00:32.160> well<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.759> roll<00:00:32.969> itself<00:00:33.589> gets

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:34.589 
surface as well as some roll itself gets

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:36.889 
surface as well as some roll itself gets
heated<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.339> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.839> can

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
heated up and you can see it you can

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.569 
heated up and you can see it you can
sort<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.589> tar<00:00:37.800> starts<00:00:38.159> to<00:00:38.250> bubble<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
sort of see the tar starts to bubble a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.660 
sort of see the tar starts to bubble a
little<00:00:38.909> bit

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
little bit

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.849 
little bit
and<00:00:39.940> then<00:00:40.149> then<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:40.719> just<00:00:40.839> gets<00:00:41.019> rolled<00:00:41.350> nicely

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
and then then it just gets rolled nicely

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.590 
and then then it just gets rolled nicely
into<00:00:42.070> that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.689 

you<00:00:47.019> can<00:00:47.170> see<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.829> speed<00:00:48.190> goes<00:00:48.370> along

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
you can see that the speed goes along

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.549 
you can see that the speed goes along
the<00:00:48.730> scene<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.090> little<00:00:49.300> bit<00:00:49.570> with<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.320> heat

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
the scene a little bit with the heat

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.369 
the scene a little bit with the heat
ESCA<00:00:51.489> because<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:52.030> want<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.300> get<00:00:52.420> seemed<00:00:53.350> a

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
ESCA because we want to get seemed a

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.590 
ESCA because we want to get seemed a
little<00:00:53.620> more<00:00:53.890> heat<00:00:54.160> so<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.329> seals

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
little more heat so that it seals

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:21.550 
little more heat so that it seals
properly

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.740 

so<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:21.740> can<00:01:21.979> see<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.159> guitar<00:01:23.149> is<00:01:23.180> actually

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
so you can see that guitar is actually

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.920 
so you can see that guitar is actually
melting<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.470> squishing<00:01:25.369> out<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.509> bottom<00:01:26.840> of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
melting and squishing out the bottom of

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.380 
melting and squishing out the bottom of
the<00:01:27.020> sheet<00:01:27.229> which<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.310> good<00:01:28.520> that's<00:01:29.060> what<00:01:29.270> we

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
the sheet which is good that's what we

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.230 
the sheet which is good that's what we
want<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.659> see<00:01:30.610> we<00:01:31.610> don't<00:01:31.700> want<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:31.939> see<00:01:32.060> too

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
want to see we don't want to see too

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.060 
want to see we don't want to see too
much<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.659> but<00:01:32.899> yeah<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.890> see<00:01:34.039> a

much of it but yeah we like to see a

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.200 
much of it but yeah we like to see a
little<00:01:34.250> bit<00:01:34.399> pink<00:01:36.159> optimally<00:01:37.159> an<00:01:37.880> eighth<00:01:38.060> of

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
little bit pink optimally an eighth of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.679 
little bit pink optimally an eighth of
an<00:01:38.330> inch<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.869> good<00:01:39.140> fleet<00:01:39.549> 04<00:01:40.549> for<00:01:41.179> any<00:01:41.299> kind<00:01:41.539> of

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
an inch is good fleet 04 for any kind of

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.020 
an inch is good fleet 04 for any kind of
rolled<00:01:42.320> roofing<00:01:42.520> whether<00:01:43.520> you're<00:01:43.729> doing<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
rolled roofing whether you're doing the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.770 
rolled roofing whether you're doing the
base<00:01:44.179> sheet<00:01:44.420> or<00:01:44.600> where<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.140> cap<00:01:45.350> sheet<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.750> you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
base sheet or where the cap sheet so you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.200 
base sheet or where the cap sheet so you
can<00:01:48.079> see<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:48.310> we've<00:01:49.310> almost<00:01:49.520> got<00:01:49.820> this<00:01:49.939> lift

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
can see that we've almost got this lift

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.200 
can see that we've almost got this lift
we<00:01:50.329> were<00:01:50.450> lucky<00:01:50.630> with<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.990> parapet<00:01:51.530> wall

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
we were lucky with the parapet wall

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.910 
we were lucky with the parapet wall
because<00:01:53.210> we<00:01:53.479> were<00:01:53.630> able<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.959> put<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.170> piece<00:01:54.890> in

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
because we were able to put a piece in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.730 
because we were able to put a piece in
here<00:01:55.549> see<00:01:56.299> this<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.659> loose<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.140> he<00:01:57.170> can<00:01:57.470> torch

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
here see this is loose so he can torch

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.179 
here see this is loose so he can torch
on<00:01:57.979> underneath<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:59.049> with<00:02:00.049> his<00:02:00.319> field<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:00.979> I

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
was able to skip ahead so we've been

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.210
