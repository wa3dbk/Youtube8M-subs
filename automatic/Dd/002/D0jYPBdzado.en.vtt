00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.900
 hello everyone today 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.790
 nice that everything i show 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.679
 how do you work with colors in adobe photoshop 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.179
 using standard 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.589
 tools and third-party plugins 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.740
 today we will seek effect 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.090
 vintage words i.e. vintage color 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.039
 which is now very fashionable and all 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.449
 go crazy 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.249
 the good news is still new 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.319
 plug-in version of goods once 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.489
 goods about 4 pro 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.980
 which works oraz 3 faster in 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.659
 which added new filters and 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.390
 it is with her help that we will today 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.930
 do 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.000
 our vintage effect 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.890
 please check 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.060
 whether your monitors are calibrated 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.860
 because it matters when 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.890
 view your photos to all 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.660
 quotes 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.859
 were exactly what they were 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.070
 we would like 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 let's go page 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 Germans clarke bells about 4 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.370
 we have the legendary sector right away 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.750
 which allows us to accept whether to vomit 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.960
 that's about it 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.570
 vintage color 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 in principle, it is just but smooth too 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.659
 turned out pretty good but we will 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.000
 still moving in a different direction and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.540
 experiment 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.400
 since i didn't touch anything i mean i do 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.630
 this is the first time with you 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.630
 her mother porter filters and such 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.680
 film touches 1 5 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 so we have 29 under the melt filters then 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.200
 There are 29 types of film 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.250
 which we can cancel with 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.750
 using the cohort demand 4 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.450
 let's try to watch 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.410
 what do we like what do we like 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.860
 well, well, well 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 well let's try the seventh 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.630
 let's reduced 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.429
 so to speak 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.009
 film impact force yes 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.660
 our photo 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.760
 we will completely remove the vignette because 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.480
 I do not like 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.910
 so that all the same there was space 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.260
 so already interesting let's try 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.820
 m play with saturation 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.169
 insofar as 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.549
 on its own 1 story effect he's pretty 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.329
 unsaturated 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.589
 i.e. this is the main article 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.589
 without capable of paint and contrast one we 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.799
 try to add 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.099
 in some shade 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.689
 and in principle this year is greenish 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:26.329
 so here 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.819
 I also like the color very much 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.079
 so on 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.499
 dubai little noise so we 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:35.979
 there was an even greater effect 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.959
 film 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.969
 they can try sochi play 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.459
 situation settings 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.120
 power then there is danger of it 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.069
 filter 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.029
 Far should not go since 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.439
 too contrasting in my opinion 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.699
 best mfty yes seek middle ground 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.199
 and the result you would like 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.229
 get this case 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.229
 but basically that's because 8 is quite 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.639
 I like everything that is compared to 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.019
 initial images we 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.269
 got 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.659
 most interesting color 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.289
 in my opinion more saturated and 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.209
 reddish such cinema teachers 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.559
 just these are those who are vintage gasoline 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:20.429
 fire 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.589
 so let's try to do it even more 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.270
 dark trojan to 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.860
 models even more stood out on 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.019
 Photo 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.529
 and added that brightness 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.889
 In principle, all I think ours are those who 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.889
 ready 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.639
 we save our photo 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.689
 reconsider what we got in the end uah 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.689
 final comparison before and after 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.880
 so it was before it became after 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.819
 dollars after but after 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.419
 in principle, no everything like everything is good 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.869
 all perfectly 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:02.189
 This first attempt will be another opium regiment 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.469
 Question about 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.409
 so the squat we got 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.349
 now you can save 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.259
 or use as ready to not 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.659
 waste time 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.859
 thank you so much for your attention 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.360
 what are you looking at a date
