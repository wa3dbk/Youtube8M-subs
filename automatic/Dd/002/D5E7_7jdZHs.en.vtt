00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.050
 I want to complain because today in the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.680
 night I was dreaming something that I did not 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.060
 it seemed like nothing else I did not like it 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.630
 for nothing 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.539
 the dream was more or less like that the thing was 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.020
 that my boyfriend was accompanying me to the work of 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.610
 my mom stops to pick her up and back 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.190
 we were meeting my brother in the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.500
 way then we had to take the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.699
 good train the train from mexico which is the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.470
 subway to return to the house have 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.910
 ll 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.650
 and in the metro, I sat down and sat like that 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.750
 in places like my mom and my brother 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.760
 me and he did not want to sit down then he 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.020
 went to the bottom of the car you can 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.650
 tell 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.290
 the thing that suddenly I turn 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.710
 and she wants me to live and not a 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.070
 a little while and in this a girl goes up and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.820
 that gives a kiss or what happens and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.030
 It takes me to decide what wanna fuck and I 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.880
 I raise and I say hey good to see you who 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.710
 you are or what you want is what you are looking for or that 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.480
 so that what not because, as you know 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 you'm one of the people most 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.729
 jealous of this world 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.890
 and this and he says oh it's not that he's my 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.740
 friend for a long time already had 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.860
 a lot that I did not see it but it's normal 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 normal and I turned to see my boyfriend not 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.569
 because apart from everything the girl had 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.810
 grabbed the hand and did not let go and did not 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:48.770
 he let go and did not let go and if he sees anything 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.880
 what happens to him does not go and the same and he will not look 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.130
 how scared something like that and the thing that 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.039
 I get angry so good so much that I 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.420
 I went and spent the like to the 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.950
 following actions in the next 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.560
 station we had to go down 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.799
 so the thing was that my mom and my 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.590
 brother nothing else got off the train 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.410
 and I followed myself to the next station 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.049
 with them because apart from everything already 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.569
 they had planned to go somewhere else and 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.269
 that good is right is right we 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.060
 come on let's go let's go but the house that 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.190
 I forgot because I did not bring 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.860
 money my mom had stayed with my 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.410
 things and then I did not know what to do 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.730
 because I ended up accompanying them we went to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.190
 a stationery 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.090
 the style but she did not let go of the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.459
 I did not let go of my hand 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.310
 and then basic that a good dream 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.860
 horrible and so I woke up with my face 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.519
 of this woman this little doll 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.810
 oh I do not know but it 's the older sister of 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.980
 Phineas and Ferb 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:59.030
 and well, I just wanted to tell you that 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.180
 because I woke up like I did not 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.980
 I liked that dream for nothing and I want to 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.800
 that is all after having analyzed it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.590
 and after checking my sphere of 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.349
 crystal I think my boyfriend receive a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.269
 meeting of a person who does not see 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.069
 long you want a lot but that 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.610
 this person will see it with different eyes 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.450
 and xavi will not appear to me and well I think 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.280
 that's all I wanted to retaliate 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.530
 and I'm leaving goodbye 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.989

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.420

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.190
 it wakes up like that very early 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.080
 as right now I'm already 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.870

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.940
