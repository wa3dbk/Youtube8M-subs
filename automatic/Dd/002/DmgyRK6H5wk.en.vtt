 Translated by Ahmed Ibrahim 01272967425 Hello. This is Marty of Blue Lightning TV. 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm going to show you how to create a smooth, skin-free stain image. 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.720
 This is not updated from the tutorial I did in an earlier version of Photoshop. 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.180
 Open the image you wish to retouch. 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 I downloaded this one from Shutterstock.com. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.020
 The first step is to make a selection of your skin theme. 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.980
 There are many ways to do this, so choose the method that suits you best. 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 For example, you can use your Quick Select tool 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.330
 Pull the skin to select it. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.780
 To remove areas in the selection, press and hold the Alt or Option as you drag over it. 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.630
 Scroll to Select and select Edge. 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.650
 I did an in-depth tutorial on the edge setting, so I will not go all the details here. 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
 Check the smart radius and increase the radius slightly. 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.380
 Brush on areas where hair and skin overlap 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.460
 And output it as a "new layer with layer mask". 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.360
 Click the box next to the original image to make it visible 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.460
 Turning to filtering, blurry and blurry surface. 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.909
 For this picture, I will make a radius: 16 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 The threshold: 12 levels, however, 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.080
 You may want to adjust these amounts depending on size and accuracy 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.140
 from your picture. Choose a blend that is softened by the skin 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.200
 Just enough to hide most defects and imperfections. 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.300
 Is not worried about its fabric so far. We will take care of that in one minute. 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.940
 After that, we'll restore the back areas of the face that do not want outstretched, 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.760
 Such as eyes, eyebrows and lips. 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
 To do this, click a mask layer to make it active 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.879
 Open your brush tool 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.440
 Brush your pick. 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.450
 We will take care of size in an instant. Make Hardness: 0% 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.740
 Opacity and flow: 100%. From, press the Enter or Return key. 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.820
 To make the brush larger or smaller, press the right or left bracket key on the keyboard. 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.219
 Brush on any areas you want to reveal back the original unretouched image 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.680
 Adjust the brush size accordingly. 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.800
 I brush inside eyebrows, eyes and eyelids 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.740
 lips 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.460
 The smooth hair interlaced forehead. 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.820
 If you have areas of the face where the pores of the skin are not more homogeneous, 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.900
 Let's blur them a little, so it will melt in the face. 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.479
 Make the face layer active 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.720
 Open your blur tool. 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.550
 Make its power: 100% 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.820
 Adjust the size accordingly. Brush on those areas to blend them in. 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.820
 After that, we will remove any stains left on the face. 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.820
 Open the treated brush spot. 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.260
 Make sure that the Content button is aware of active. 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.620
 Adjust the size of the tool slightly larger than the defect and brush more. 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.470
 Continue until all defects, scars and other defects are removed. 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.670
 When done, go to Filter and Noise and "Add Noise". 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.440
 Mark "Camouflage" and check "Monochrome". 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.180
 Drag the Sidr to the amount that is produced with the grain that matches the rest if your image. 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.280
 I am using an amount of about one and a half percent, however, 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.500
 Your image may require a different amount depending on its size and resolution. 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.580

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.800
