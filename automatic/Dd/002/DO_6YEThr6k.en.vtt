00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:42.190
 It is excellent 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:46.010
 Because the snowy field is so bright, I used the view finder this time 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.339
 Share ratio is 100% 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.800
 When shooting diamond dust or a sliver 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:57.570
 There is the auto focus becomes unstable 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.030
 You can switch to manual focus by pressing the button next to the LCD monitor 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.260
 I can do it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:10.049

 After that was the start pattern of over 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.790
 I leave it to the camera

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.790
 8 recording time is about that total of 2 hours, but with one battery of this type 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.410

 Reserve was too late the last minute is one that person but is sputum take them 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:00.160
 I thought it was a touch panel of Sakata, but I could use it at 15 degrees below freezing . 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.890
 But 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.740
 that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:11.540
 Well I could use it without problems with the room at all 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.120
 And this camera's sensor and that xf 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.019

 Diamond dust 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.820
 It is a snow flake swaying in the wind 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:43.420

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:16.110
 If you do n't need a zoom lens, this camera is already 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.110
 I think it's good
