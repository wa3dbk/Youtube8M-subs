00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.790
 hello everybody to the water 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.460
 Today I'll show you how 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.370
 we see his fringe or his wick 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.190
 finally a bang who pushed what because 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.690
 that I had two month brothers but 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.059
 she pushed a little 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 so I have too much to do and the morning 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.470
 I do not necessarily have time to do 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 hire multiple so I'm going too 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.640
 stagnated then the morning here I am attached 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.390
 hair like that they're still a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 little wet but it does not really 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.380
 of importance you take your hair 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.600
 as they are so then you have to 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 decide how to get them off 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.230
 your bangs your wick 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.510
 so if you really want it at 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.510
 middle of a jumble this medium if you the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.020
 really want on the side repeated well 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.239
 on the side 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.230
 I'm going to take her side and from that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.329
 side there because my hair has 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.800
 tend to put themselves like that so you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.270
 see how you want to do and you 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.609
 do so I would put his wicks 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.190
 so I do it a little bit like that I had 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.390
 who by a bit like that hides the plug 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.990
 I like it for that love 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 hate and recesses I like so we 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.229
 know shas good party so travel that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.760
 really looks like his features so what 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.100
 what we are going to do is that I am going 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.630
 use in sharp decline 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 this is a simple basic hutu 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.869
 old i dress in hungary 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.220
 today I took a grid I 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.150
 have a black too but finally for you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.189
 take what you have on hand 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.090
 but take a dip because it's okay 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.430
 serve me for the hairstyle 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 so I'm going to select so mama 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.360
 match but I will resume I the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.619
 took a little higher for them 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.899
 have hair with so that they 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.270
 are they making an illusion for 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.670
 they seem a little more 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.829
 voluminous a little bigger 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.360
 so I have limits like that but I 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:59.310
 do not stop there I go a little further 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.810
 like that until touching Lorraine in 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.799
 did I really go since the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.600
 youth a re actually a pure face 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.179
 we see well I'm doing this I have my 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.569
 hair behind it is not very pretty and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.090
 here I keep my bit of wick 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.530
 on the other side I do the same but 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.719
 damn I take shorter 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.939
 really there for that goes that balance 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.709
 so I can there and I do like everything at 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.870
 the time I go to the ear I 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.120
 braid a little stripe and I do like 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.120
 this is the thousand things to do 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.120
 then I take with the thumb to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.719
 level below the times the nape 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.069
 on the other side 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.430
 and there I turn to be that you see 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.280
 well what I do in fact I'm doing a 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.930
 re such as this but I stayed 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:54.980
 hair that's how I leave 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.049
 why hair because nba sion 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.489
 we really have all the hair in the 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.349
 dance and really let the neck 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.699
 he will go back to the dishes of the day and 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.810
 Finally, I do not like it. 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:09.930
 it stays well right here so it's a 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.079
 story of good or that's after I 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.549
 take my nbs then there is a small 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:18.000
 attachment because it's not pretty leap but 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.989
 behind so I work in men's up mode 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.269
 the feminine while I traced I 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.030
 put on my hair 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.750
 I take off the hair jimmy above 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.900

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.259

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.819

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:39.209
 hair that pulls you well that there is no 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.430
 little buzz so it's not good alas 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.129
 what I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.650
 bring down sentences 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:50.720
 that's how it is and my little hair 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.720
 I am going to enlist them in the veins 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.680
 I 'm a little for you not see the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.200
 little line the time it really goes 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:10.240
 but now so it's good that I do 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.100

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.390
 you have morning and dry hair have 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.490
 completely dried because I put 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.709
 my hair at night where you wash 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.870

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.810
 to dry your hair before styling 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.800
 the hair and well you take it to you 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.950
 separate your wick 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.270
 you take a bath you pay normal and 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.010
 you get wet you go under water and 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.630
 you wet your wick what's up 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.360
 a lot do that will hold good at best 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.760
 to your agent his end just as a 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.160
 natural lacquer and so here is the hand 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.740
 frank disheveled good my hair is 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.800

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.680

 noon have slowly event and in fact we have 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.040
 a wick can curl on the end that 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.050
 will be appearing so what am I going to do 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.240
 it is that I will wait ben similar 3 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.250

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.070
 was fed up with your and ben that's that 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.930
 you want to remove it to see what 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:45.040
 that gives dove is simply 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:48.420
 he has my kind of fringe that looks 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.900
 nothing transformed into mesh 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.090
 so it curls but I 'm good 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.280
 you brush a little bit I know 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.640

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.920
 smooth 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.180

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.850
 appear a bit curly but at 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.830
 thread of the day are they going to you 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.080

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.670
