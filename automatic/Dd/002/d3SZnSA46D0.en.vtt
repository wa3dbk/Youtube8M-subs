 Hello everyone, Roma is small and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.670
 in today's lesson I will show how to replace it 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.560
 on your photo using such 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.320
 tool as quick selection 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.320
 select our model 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.080
 and as we see here we stand out 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 there was no necessary area 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:46.739
 I hold down the left key and the alt key and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:52.900
 the left mouse button is removed about the selection 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.440
 which is not necessary and so here 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.440
 inside 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.090
 sending 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.520
 radius 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.780
 Well, the girl we have identified take 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 clarify the edge and here we play with 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.590
 settings 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.460
 loops 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.790
 I'm 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.610
 leave such an option here 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:46.070
 select a new layer, click ok and press to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 left mouse button on our model 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.119
 drag on that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.119
 he which we want 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.680
 leave our model 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 he basically we changed let's 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.039
 make it more natural 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.039
 it looked we choose plastic 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.230
 a little more 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.230
 and so we will clean up from afar 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.900
 what we don't need 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.530
 and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.660
 this is how we draw 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.230
 for believable 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.769
 i there we can use internal 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.769
 day 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.390
 see what we do 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:17.140
 and here we are 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.450
 It turns out the replacement of the background with you was a rum 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.680
