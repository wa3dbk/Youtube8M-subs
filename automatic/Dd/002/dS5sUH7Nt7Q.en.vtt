00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.150
 hello everyone I'm metal platinum in a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.029
 new video this time I will tell you the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.850
 real story behind the k2 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.699
 let's start in the Soviet Russian Union 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 socialist in the 40 's were becoming 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.099
 biological experiments of metabolism 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.390
 with dog heads of cats horses 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.340
 etcetera were also implemented 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.719
 anesthetics to animals so that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.570
 I was sure that it was 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.000
 medically safe they also had 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.340
 planned to get a successful transplant 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.620
 between two different species but for 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 back then it was well known that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 It was unsustainable but since they had 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.879
 had a semi alive dog said by 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.610
 what not and it turned out that a Swedish scientist 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.230
 had the answer this man had 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 been exiled from his country by 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 experience cruelly with animals and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.080
 humans and was accepted by the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.330
 Soviets in your nation thanks to the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.970
 advances that this one had achieved 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.860
 using liquid solutions that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.690
 they contain the same density and pressure 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.910
 osmotic of the blood and isolating 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.860
 red blood cells of both specimens are 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.020
 could create a suspension that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.870
 could serve as substitute blood for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.910
 both bodies also by means of 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.070
 internal probes connected to the tube 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.780
 digestive bulk of both species is 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.720
 could extract the waste from the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.580
 samples but to check this it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.100
 I needed to experiment according to 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.020
 log of the Swedish scientist which does not 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.490
 I know the name but they did not want to take a chance 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 to be seen acquiring more 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 specimens since they had to spies 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.660
 internationals will discover them so 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.520
 they forged a plan so cruel one of the 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.440
 men who worked with him showed him 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.850
 one day her daughter 10 years 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.650
 facilities of the place 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.330
 going to the places that could be what 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.150
 than before for the girl or vital 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.160
 importance for the nation is also 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.710
 I found the son of the janitor which 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.540
 I was about 12 or 13 years old 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.600
 that he kept playing in the cellars 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.399
 secretly with a stray cat the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.069
 little girl had a dog that her mother 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.439
 had given away for his birthday and it was 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.319
 by that time still a puppy 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.389
 the assistant took the girl to the car and 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.189
 he insinuated that he could make them leave 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.439
 enter your pet she haunted 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.510
 accepted and when the arrival of travel 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.609
 mysteriously the rope of the necklace of 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.040
 dog let go and ran as if something what 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.889
 called the man locked his daughter in 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.870
 one of the offices and another one was removed 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.609
 man went into the cellar and took the cat 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.650
 in the presence of the child who remained 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.560
 stunned by the action of man who 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.630
 leave white the door 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.390
 the boy started calling his father the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.430
 which did not respond so the child looked 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.980
 one of the internal exits and started to 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.900
 look for his father to leave the place in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.780
 that he heard the girl and opened the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.849
 door to let her out they came up 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.069
 one of the largest laboratories in the 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.050
 building and they hid behind some 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.080
 large aluminum containers to the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.819
 that the macabre probe was connected 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.830
 procedure started and the boy 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.900
 covered the eyes of the girl with both 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.030
 hands and this one without thinking much you will 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.090
 the air escaped and released one or two 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.160
 fairs according to the blog described the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.049
 process as follows we have 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.000
 cut both specimens by the 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.920
 half taking care not to damage the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.080
 internal organs we also took care 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.959
 of not damaging the bone structure it 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.080
 they twist are still alive you can tell 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.730
 they suffer poor people I almost feel sorry now 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.769
 we proceed to join both parties 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.650
 of the specimen connecting the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.910
 spines were consistent go 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.980
 surprise 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.660
 this was due to uric acid that 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.610
 implant in their organisms once 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.040
 connected the spine I can already 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.500
 proceed to place the probes or my god 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.840
 breathing the boy who was witnessing 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.760
 happened his hands were shaking he could not 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.890
 avoid crying and started and threw himself 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.870
 soil could not stand what it was 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.790
 watching but when raising a little the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.260
 head could see which was the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.140
 content of aluminum cylinders 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.080
 he removed his hands from the eyes of the girl 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.060
 and this one witnessed maybe the most 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.730
 creepy of the process there was a man 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.770
 connected to the probes apparently it was the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.230
 father of the boy and only they could 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.420
 see it the other scientists ignored it 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.340
 since it was hidden in the cylinders of 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.190
 aluminum and there was a window where 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.410
 I could see the man's face the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.350
 started to move and the Swedish scientist 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.510
 he began to shout his cow koxka 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.790
 overcrowded the look of the soba cacos 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.100
 will fall as if it had use of the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.530
 reason like both heads ever 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.840
 they were part of a human being and both at 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.940
 Same time they said hurts hurt you 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.060
 it hurt 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.550
 nobody could believe it the soba cacos k 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.800
 they talked but one of the scientists 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.440
 screamed full of cursed anger this is not what 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.450
 what I wanted was a good man so the 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.670
 Swedish scientist pulled out a gun and 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.620
 shot in the forehead saying this is my 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.140
 greatest achievement I have done what darwin said 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.540
 impossible I have challenged the laws of the 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.150
 nature I can create that perfect being 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.070
 and nobody will ruin it all, they shut up and 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.200
 the boy took a metal bar 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.810
 heavy while the little girl started 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.910
 scream from the horror that I witnessed ran 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.010
 where his father was and broke the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.230
 crystal each one reacted in a way 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.540
 strange they started by joining the two 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.540
 heads and his look betrayed hatred and 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.700
 they shouted they did not go no and started running from 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.560
 awkward way towards the boy jumped to 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.810
 his face and he laid him down skinning him and 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.820
 eating from his gut the father of 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.010
 boy started screaming in pain and the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.110
 armpit koxka said there is no banquet 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.850
 fact he started to writhe and scream 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.500
 while the man was tearing 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.810
 brain waves letting out 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.240
 huge amounts of blood 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.370
 so cow koxka started to writhe and 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.350
 agonize and scream in a way that seemed 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.060
 that he spoke on his own and the 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.430
 you gaze became moribund and 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.680
 nerves collapsed so that she smiled 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.630
 and it twisted and ejected the suspension 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.210
 dark red color for both mouths 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.400
 while the Swede took out the gun and 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.260
 he started shooting everyone present 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.240
 for the anger it contained and by accident 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.160
 he fired towards tubes that contain 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.010
 alcohol and I am useful and ccoo and it started 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.960
 to expand throughout the laboratory the 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.820
 the girl 's father told him to take the 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.729
 green book on the table and run what 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.830
 as far as possible while stopping the 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.810
 Swedish the janitor was holding his son 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.790
 skinned from the face and with little 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.449
 how much blood he had left 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.090
 he said no matter we'll go together 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.009
 the girl ran and was saved not so 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.680
 others who died incinerated and only 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.779
 he survived the book and the girl which 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.719
 was found and cataloged as a 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:38.789
 survivor and when the girl told him 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.259
 the truth to the authorities this is 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.029
 they covered up the experiment and the 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.210
 forced to go to a health clinic 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:47.520
 mental the mother to avoid this is the 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.319
 led to the USA where years later 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.080
 Annan met while doing petter 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:54.089
 investigations for a caricature she 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.029
 he taught him the book and he laughed and took it 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:59.310
 as a joke in bad taste the woman at 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:01.529
 to get to the USA the name was changed to 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.330
 sofía blas and her daughter called her elizabeth 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:07.439
 blas elizabeth died on October 27, 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.569
 1998 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:12.060
 years later peter annan produces a 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.159
 cartoon called k2 or cow koxka where 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.710
 the main character are two brothers 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:19.589
 Siamese a dog and a cat that are 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.930
 joined by the calera was produced for 

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:23.940
 the company nick counting 65 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.430
 episodes 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.650
 well that was everything if you liked it 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.870
 comment give him little hand up and if 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.490
 they want to subscribe here their metal friend 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.490
 platinum says goodbye
