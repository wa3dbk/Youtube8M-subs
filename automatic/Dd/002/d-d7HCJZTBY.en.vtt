hi<00:00:01.650> I'm<00:00:01.949> Rob<00:00:02.129> King<00:00:02.340> from<00:00:02.520> perfect<00:00:02.730> boundaries

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi I'm Rob King from perfect boundaries

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.749 
hi I'm Rob King from perfect boundaries
and<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.770> difference<00:00:05.160> between<00:00:05.250> US

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
and this is the difference between US

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.259 
and this is the difference between US
and<00:00:06.029> other<00:00:06.270> fencing<00:00:06.899> contractors<00:00:08.210> okay<00:00:09.210> so

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
and other fencing contractors okay so

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.089 
and other fencing contractors okay so
this<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.139> left<00:00:10.320> hand<00:00:10.380> boundary<00:00:10.800> along<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
this is the left hand boundary along the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.259 
this is the left hand boundary along the
property<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.610> we're<00:00:11.700> working<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:12.090> at<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
property that we're working on at the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.089 
property that we're working on at the
moment<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.740> only<00:00:13.860> one<00:00:14.040> that

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
moment and this is the only one that

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.420 
moment and this is the only one that
we're<00:00:14.370> not<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.849> installing<00:00:15.240> and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
we're not going to be installing and

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.650 
we're not going to be installing and
basically<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.029> point<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> few

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
basically I just like to point out a few

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.900 
basically I just like to point out a few
different<00:00:18.930> things<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.500> what<00:00:19.619> our

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
different things as to what our

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.290 
different things as to what our
competitors<00:00:20.910> do<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.500> don't<00:00:22.830> do

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
competitors do and to what we don't do

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
competitors do and to what we don't do
this<00:00:24.300> fence<00:00:24.570> has<00:00:24.779> been<00:00:24.960> attached<00:00:25.740> using

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
this fence has been attached using

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.210 
this fence has been attached using
arrows<00:00:26.939> repaired<00:00:27.330> brackets<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
arrows repaired brackets which as you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.339 
arrows repaired brackets which as you
can<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.810> dirty<00:00:31.019> they

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
can see they just get a bit dirty they

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
can see they just get a bit dirty they
don't<00:00:31.560> look<00:00:31.710> very<00:00:31.949> nice<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.520> our<00:00:33.149> fins

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
don't look very nice and our fins

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.799 
don't look very nice and our fins
actually<00:00:34.550> interlinks<00:00:35.550> across<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.450> front<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
actually interlinks across the front of

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.680 
actually interlinks across the front of
the<00:00:36.899> posts<00:00:37.290> which<00:00:37.500> makes<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.950> unstable<00:00:38.690> also

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the posts which makes it unstable also

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
the posts which makes it unstable also
it<00:00:39.750> looks<00:00:39.899> much<00:00:40.079> nicer<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.559> well<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.610> anyway

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it looks much nicer as well but anyway

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760 
it looks much nicer as well but anyway
so<00:00:41.940> they've<00:00:42.510> added<00:00:42.780> trellis<00:00:43.079> work<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
so they've added trellis work on to the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.860 
so they've added trellis work on to the
top<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.300> apologies<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.480> transferred

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
top and apologies not transferred

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
top and apologies not transferred
they've<00:00:46.050> added<00:00:46.289> capping<00:00:46.710> unto<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> top<00:00:47.280> there

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
they've added capping unto the top there

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.529 
they've added capping unto the top there
but<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> camera<00:00:48.090> route<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> they've<00:00:48.510> used

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
but the camera route that they've used

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.590 
but the camera route that they've used
isn't<00:00:48.989> quite<00:00:49.200> long<00:00:49.379> enough<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.449> looks

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
isn't quite long enough so it just looks

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.500 
isn't quite long enough so it just looks
a<00:00:51.690> little<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.879> untidy<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:55.430> big<00:00:56.430> 99<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> part

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
a little bit untidy and big 99 and part

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
a little bit untidy and big 99 and part
of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> post<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:59.390> again<00:01:00.390> let<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.370> counter

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of the post and again let this counter

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.319 
of the post and again let this counter
rail<00:01:03.110> then<00:01:04.110> doesn't<00:01:04.530> meet<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
rail then doesn't meet up and

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.179 
rail then doesn't meet up and
we'll<00:01:06.840> say<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> unsightly<00:01:07.530> bracket<00:01:08.039> work

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
we'll say the unsightly bracket work

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.480 
we'll say the unsightly bracket work
that<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> used<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.969> install<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:11.340> then

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that have used to install it and then

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.410 
that have used to install it and then
come<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.969> the<00:01:12.060> trellis<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:16.789> as<00:01:17.789> you<00:01:17.969> can<00:01:18.090> see

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
come up to the trellis so as you can see

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.200 
come up to the trellis so as you can see
it's<00:01:19.969> bit<00:01:20.969> hit-and-miss

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
it's bit hit-and-miss

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.090 
it's bit hit-and-miss
created<00:01:24.210> gaps<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.630> over<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.929> place<00:01:28.100> wasn't

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
created gaps all over the place wasn't

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.580 
created gaps all over the place wasn't
just<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.789> doesn't<00:01:30.179> fit<00:01:30.719> equity<00:01:31.289> of<00:01:31.409> this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
just there doesn't fit equity of this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.389 
just there doesn't fit equity of this
size<00:01:33.289> anyway<00:01:34.289> I'll<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.590> show<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.920> ours

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
size anyway I'll just show you ours

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:50.990 
size anyway I'll just show you ours
quickly<00:01:48.799> as<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.069> see<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.789> we've<00:01:50.970> done

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
quickly as you can see what we've done

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
quickly as you can see what we've done
is<00:01:51.360> we've<00:01:51.539> installed<00:01:51.869> Eris<00:01:52.590> rather<00:01:52.829> straight

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is we've installed Eris rather straight

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.569 
is we've installed Eris rather straight
onto<00:01:53.280> v-notch<00:01:53.729> posts<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> aerials<00:01:56.459> go

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
onto v-notch posts so the aerials go

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.160 
onto v-notch posts so the aerials go
straight<00:01:56.909> across<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> front<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.929> fence

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
straight across the front of the fence

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.979 
straight across the front of the fence
and<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.890> actually<00:01:59.009> meet<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.119> midway<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
and they actually meet up midway in the

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.830 
and they actually meet up midway in the
post<00:02:01.289> then<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.950> nailed<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.849> structural

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
post then get nailed in so structural

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.809 
post then get nailed in so structural
stability<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.560> way<00:02:04.739> and<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.489> way<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
stability this way and that way is

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.819 
stability this way and that way is
increased<00:02:06.209> with<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> sort<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.840> joint<00:02:07.020> what

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
increased with that sort of joint what

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.169 
increased with that sort of joint what
we've<00:02:07.950> done<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.250> attached<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.879> foot<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
we've done is just attached a foot of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.599 
we've done is just attached a foot of
trellis<00:02:09.390> work<00:02:09.629> onto<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.079> top<00:02:10.289> we<00:02:11.039> found<00:02:11.400> up

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.609 
trellis work onto the top we found up

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.150 
trellis work onto the top we found up
the<00:02:11.819> backside<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.450> posts<00:02:12.889> making<00:02:13.889> a<00:02:13.980> nice

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the backside of the posts making a nice

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.020 
the backside of the posts making a nice
flush<00:02:15.590> such<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.069> all<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.700> way<00:02:17.790> along

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
flush such as that one all the way along

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.680 
flush such as that one all the way along
and<00:02:18.799> we've<00:02:19.799> used<00:02:20.370> 50<00:02:20.790> mil<00:02:20.940> spacers<00:02:21.389> for<00:02:21.540> this

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and we've used 50 mil spacers for this

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.780
