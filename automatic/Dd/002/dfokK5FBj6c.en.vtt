00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi I'm John MacLennan and I'm here today

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.420 
hi I'm John MacLennan and I'm here today
with<00:00:02.909> guitar<00:00:03.570> control<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.470> we're<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.400> to

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
talk about dialing in a good tone I

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.970 
talk about dialing in a good tone I
think<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.059> it's<00:00:09.210> often<00:00:09.480> an<00:00:09.750> overlooked<00:00:10.440> step

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
think that it's often an overlooked step

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.629 
think that it's often an overlooked step
especially<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:12.269> beginners<00:00:12.830> as<00:00:13.830> far<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.340> just

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
especially with beginners as far as just

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.880 
especially with beginners as far as just
when<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.880> plug<00:00:15.240> into<00:00:15.509> your<00:00:15.690> amp<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.289> start<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
when you plug into your amp and start to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.700 
when you plug into your amp and start to
play<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.760> we'll<00:00:17.910> talk<00:00:18.029> about<00:00:18.300> some<00:00:18.510> basic<00:00:19.109> knob

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
play so we'll talk about some basic knob

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.310 
play so we'll talk about some basic knob
controls<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:21.150> most<00:00:21.449> amps<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
controls here most amps are going to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.230 
controls here most amps are going to
come<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.369> treble<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.390> middle<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.650> bass

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
instance if I want a jazz tone I might

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.910 
instance if I want a jazz tone I might
give<00:00:46.710> myself<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:47.340> bit<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.910> bass<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
give myself a little bit more bass and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.750 
give myself a little bit more bass and
and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.370> maybe<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.690> my<00:00:52.340> guitar<00:00:53.340> roll

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and then maybe on my on my guitar roll

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.700 
and then maybe on my on my guitar roll
down<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> tone<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.620> I'm

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
down the tone a little bit and then I'm

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:07.120 
down the tone a little bit and then I'm
going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> sound<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.460> that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.969 

now<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.380> imagine<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.499> you<00:01:10.619> would<00:01:10.770> just

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
now if I imagine if you would just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
now if I imagine if you would just
plugged<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.579> your<00:01:12.030> guitar<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.229> like

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
plugged in your guitar and you have like

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.940 
plugged in your guitar and you have like
all<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.979> bass<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:15.899> treble<00:01:16.380> roll<00:01:16.710> back

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
all the bass up and the treble roll back

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
all the bass up and the treble roll back
and<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.219> just<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:17.579> just<00:01:17.729> wasn't<00:01:18.060> dialed<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.600> yet

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and it just it just wasn't dialed in yet

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.969 
and it just it just wasn't dialed in yet
you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.289> you<00:01:19.380> start<00:01:19.590> playing<00:01:19.799> your

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you know and you start playing your

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.450 
you know and you start playing your
chords<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.399> listen<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.700> this

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.100 

it<00:01:25.460> sounds<00:01:25.850> like<00:01:25.940> someone<00:01:26.390> put<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.630> pillow<00:01:26.930> over

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
it sounds like someone put a pillow over

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.050 
it sounds like someone put a pillow over
my<00:01:27.440> afro<00:01:27.890> I'm<00:01:27.980> like<00:01:28.100> do<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.280> have<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.520> cold<00:01:28.730> you

know
so<00:01:31.690> let's<00:01:32.690> balance<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.260> back<00:01:33.440> out<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.680> nice<00:01:34.250> good

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
so let's balance it back out a nice good

so let's balance it back out a nice good
place<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.970> start<00:01:35.180> might<00:01:35.420> be<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:36.020> level

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
place to start might be just to level

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.190 
place to start might be just to level
out<00:01:36.740> put<00:01:37.310> everything<00:01:37.760> even<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.780> know<00:01:38.930> and
