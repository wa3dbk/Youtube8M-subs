00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.769 

so<00:00:05.710> the<00:00:05.830> key<00:00:06.010> thing<00:00:06.310> with<00:00:06.580> overseeding<00:00:07.390> yards

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:07.779 
so the key thing with overseeding yards

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.949 
so the key thing with overseeding yards
is<00:00:07.930> to<00:00:08.530> have<00:00:08.770> seed<00:00:09.100> to<00:00:09.219> soil<00:00:09.370> contact<00:00:09.809> if<00:00:10.809> we

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:10.959 
is to have seed to soil contact if we

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.449 
is to have seed to soil contact if we
just<00:00:11.139> sprinkle<00:00:11.320> some<00:00:11.530> grass<00:00:11.889> seed<00:00:11.920> into<00:00:12.309> this

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
just sprinkle some grass seed into this

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.670 
just sprinkle some grass seed into this
yard<00:00:12.699> some<00:00:13.539> will<00:00:13.750> grow<00:00:13.900> but<00:00:14.230> it<00:00:14.350> won't<00:00:14.529> be

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
yard some will grow but it won't be

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.410 
yard some will grow but it won't be
quite<00:00:15.039> as<00:00:15.070> effective<00:00:15.639> if<00:00:15.760> we<00:00:15.940> can<00:00:16.150> get<00:00:16.270> that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
quite as effective if we can get that

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.630 
quite as effective if we can get that
seed<00:00:16.900> worked<00:00:17.260> into<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.680> soil<00:00:17.949> and<00:00:18.220> get<00:00:18.520> it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
seed worked into the soil and get it

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.790 
seed worked into the soil and get it
actually<00:00:18.820> touching<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:19.450> soil<00:00:19.750> surface<00:00:20.020> we

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
actually touching the soil surface we

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.620 
actually touching the soil surface we
can<00:00:20.950> get<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.280> seed<00:00:21.490> to<00:00:21.610> soil<00:00:21.760> contact<00:00:21.910> in<00:00:22.570> a

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
can get the seed to soil contact in a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.600 
can get the seed to soil contact in a
number<00:00:22.900> of<00:00:22.930> ways<00:00:23.130> sometimes<00:00:24.130> we<00:00:24.310> can<00:00:24.460> use<00:00:24.580> a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
number of ways sometimes we can use a

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.670 
number of ways sometimes we can use a
core<00:00:24.940> air<00:00:25.210> fire<00:00:25.510> which<00:00:25.930> will<00:00:26.050> poke<00:00:26.260> holes<00:00:26.500> in

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
core air fire which will poke holes in

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.350 
core air fire which will poke holes in
the<00:00:26.710> ground<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.310> we<00:00:27.670> can<00:00:27.820> poke<00:00:27.970> holes<00:00:28.180> in<00:00:28.330> the

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
the ground and we can poke holes in the

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.910 
the ground and we can poke holes in the
ground<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:28.810> then<00:00:28.960> sprinkle<00:00:29.380> our<00:00:29.440> seed<00:00:29.680> over

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
ground and then sprinkle our seed over

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.710 
ground and then sprinkle our seed over
the<00:00:30.010> top<00:00:30.160> of<00:00:30.190> that<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:30.670> those<00:00:31.030> the<00:00:31.360> seed<00:00:31.570> will

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
the top of that and those the seed will

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.090 
the top of that and those the seed will
fall<00:00:31.930> in<00:00:32.140> those<00:00:32.289> holes<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:32.829> will<00:00:32.920> give<00:00:33.070> us

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
fall in those holes and will give us

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.310 
fall in those holes and will give us
some<00:00:33.340> seed<00:00:33.550> to<00:00:33.670> soil<00:00:33.820> contact<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.629> way<00:00:34.840> that

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
some seed to soil contact that way that

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.780 
some seed to soil contact that way that
works<00:00:35.470> very<00:00:35.680> effective<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:36.250> we<00:00:36.370> should<00:00:36.579> core

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
works very effective and we should core

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.360 
works very effective and we should core
aerate<00:00:37.150> our<00:00:37.329> yards<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:38.170> alleviate<00:00:38.710> compaction

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
aerate our yards to alleviate compaction

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.370 
aerate our yards to alleviate compaction
and<00:00:39.550> get<00:00:40.090> air<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.540> water<00:00:40.780> movement<00:00:41.170> into<00:00:41.350> the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
and get air and water movement into the

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.590 
and get air and water movement into the
soil<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:42.010> downside<00:00:42.700> is<00:00:42.910> that<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.210> Correira

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
soil the downside is that the Correira

soil the downside is that the Correira
fication<00:00:43.930> holes<00:00:44.290> are<00:00:44.440> usually<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.829> couple

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
fication holes are usually a couple

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.220 
fication holes are usually a couple
inches<00:00:45.370> apart<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.060> you're<00:00:46.780> gonna<00:00:46.930> end<00:00:47.140> up

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
inches apart and you're gonna end up

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.990 
inches apart and you're gonna end up
with<00:00:47.380> just<00:00:47.500> grass<00:00:47.770> growing<00:00:48.070> in<00:00:48.309> those<00:00:48.489> Correra

seeding<00:00:51.880> yards<00:00:52.300> is<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.540> use<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.720> power<00:00:53.079> rake<00:00:53.410> or

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
seeding yards is to use a power rake or

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.770 
seeding yards is to use a power rake or
a<00:00:53.710> verdict<00:00:54.190> cutter<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.700> a<00:00:55.149> power<00:00:55.360> rake<00:00:55.630> our

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
a verdict cutter and a power rake our

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.049 
a verdict cutter and a power rake our
vertical<00:00:56.079> cuts<00:00:56.590> grooves<00:00:56.980> in<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.280> yard<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:57.790> so

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
vertical cuts grooves in the yard and so

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.610 
vertical cuts grooves in the yard and so
we<00:00:58.180> can<00:00:58.300> cut<00:00:58.450> a<00:00:58.480> series<00:00:58.719> of<00:00:58.870> grooves<00:00:59.170> going<00:00:59.530> in

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
we can cut a series of grooves going in

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.799 
we can cut a series of grooves going in
one<00:00:59.800> direction<00:01:00.120> sprinkle<00:01:01.120> our<00:01:01.210> seed<00:01:01.480> across

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
one direction sprinkle our seed across

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.510 
one direction sprinkle our seed across
the<00:01:01.989> yard<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.500> then<00:01:02.829> come<00:01:03.010> back<00:01:03.040> with<00:01:03.370> the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
the yard and then come back with the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.580 
the yard and then come back with the
verdict<00:01:03.760> cutter<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.210> cut<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.600> second<00:01:05.049> set<00:01:05.500> of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
verdict cutter and cut a second set of

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.020 
verdict cutter and cut a second set of
grooves<00:01:05.829> in<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.100> second<00:01:06.490> direction<00:01:06.789> and<00:01:06.909> that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
grooves in a second direction and that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.999 
grooves in a second direction and that
works<00:01:07.539> the<00:01:07.749> seed<00:01:07.990> into<00:01:08.200> all<00:01:08.409> those<00:01:08.649> grooves

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
works the seed into all those grooves

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.980 
works the seed into all those grooves
and<00:01:09.219> gives<00:01:09.369> us<00:01:09.520> very<00:01:09.759> good<00:01:10.450> seed<00:01:10.749> to<00:01:10.869> soil

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
and gives us very good seed to soil

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.469 
and gives us very good seed to soil
