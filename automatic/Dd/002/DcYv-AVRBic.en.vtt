kitchen video and he was talking about

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
kitchen video and he was talking about
you<00:00:38.820> know<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.149> scarce<00:00:39.480> fuel<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> be

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
you know how scarce fuel is going to be

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.799 
you know how scarce fuel is going to be
how<00:00:40.680> he<00:00:40.739> likes<00:00:40.980> propane<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.910> propane<00:00:42.390> really

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
how he likes propane but propane really

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.540 
how he likes propane but propane really
you<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.440> goes<00:00:43.680> quick<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you know goes quick and it's not a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.860 
you know goes quick and it's not a
renewable<00:00:44.940> resource<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.829> thinking

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
renewable resource so I got thinking

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.510 
renewable resource so I got thinking
about<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.140> great<00:00:49.590> way<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.309> save<00:00:52.039> fuel<00:00:53.039> when

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
about a great way to save fuel when

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.950 
about a great way to save fuel when
you're<00:00:53.670> cooking<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.210> cooking<00:00:54.750> those

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you're cooking because cooking those

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
you're cooking because cooking those
beans<00:00:55.230> takes<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.129> long<00:00:56.579> time<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:58.879> just<00:00:59.879> cook<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
beans takes a long time I just cook this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.490 
beans takes a long time I just cook this
pot<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.719> beans<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.199> been<00:01:01.379> simmering<00:01:01.710> for

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
pot of beans it's been simmering for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.320 
pot of beans it's been simmering for
numerous<00:01:04.500> hours<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> um<00:01:06.619> this<00:01:07.619> uh<00:01:08.240> pot<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
numerous hours so um this uh pot of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
numerous hours so um this uh pot of
beans<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.930> made<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.229> got<00:01:10.380> northern

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
beans that I just made it's got northern

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.660 
beans that I just made it's got northern
white<00:01:11.430> beans<00:01:12.619> had<00:01:13.619> some<00:01:13.799> dehydrated<00:01:14.280> carrots

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
white beans had some dehydrated carrots

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.420 
white beans had some dehydrated carrots
some<00:01:15.060> dehydrate<00:01:15.630> broccoli<00:01:16.430> dehydrated

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
some dehydrate broccoli dehydrated

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.870 
some dehydrate broccoli dehydrated
mushrooms<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.810> I'd<00:01:19.729> dehydrated<00:01:20.729> want

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
mushrooms all that I'd dehydrated want

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.320 
mushrooms all that I'd dehydrated want
myself<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.380> salt<00:01:22.770> pepper<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.790> some

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
myself now got salt pepper and some

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.060 
myself now got salt pepper and some
Cayenne<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.930> grew<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.439> I'd<00:01:25.619> ride<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> I

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
Cayenne that I grew that I'd ride so I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.469 
Cayenne that I grew that I'd ride so I
was<00:01:29.070> thinking<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.030> great<00:01:30.810> way<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> save

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
was thinking about a great way to save

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.530 
was thinking about a great way to save
energy<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:35.159> being<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.759> scientists<00:01:36.420> in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
energy so just being the scientists in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.130 
energy so just being the scientists in
me<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.200> started<00:01:37.530> thinking<00:01:37.590> about<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:39.140> PV

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
me I just started thinking about the PV

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.200 
me I just started thinking about the PV
equals<00:01:40.560> NRT<00:01:40.650> equation<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:42.689> ideal<00:01:43.470> gas<00:01:43.649> law<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
equals NRT equation and ideal gas law so

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.649 
equals NRT equation and ideal gas law so
pretty<00:01:45.210> much<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:46.140> says<00:01:46.409> when<00:01:46.710> pressure<00:01:47.659> goes

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
pretty much it says when pressure goes

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.800 
pretty much it says when pressure goes
up<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.799> volume<00:01:50.100> stays<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> same<00:01:50.880> then

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
up and the volume stays the same then

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.060 
up and the volume stays the same then
your<00:01:51.990> temperature<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.360> so

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
your temperature is going to go up so

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
your temperature is going to go up so
what<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.100> means<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.540> use<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.719> pressure

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
what that means is if you use a pressure

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.700 
what that means is if you use a pressure
cooker<00:01:59.270> you<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> increase<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
cooker you are going to increase the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
cooker you are going to increase the
temperature<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:03.240> what's<00:02:03.540> inside<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> set

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
temperature of what's inside with a set

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.119 
temperature of what's inside with a set
amount<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.159> fuel<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.110> speed<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
amount of fuel and you can speed up the

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.520 
amount of fuel and you can speed up the
cooking<00:02:08.160> process<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.869> may<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.140> an

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
cooking process so this may be an

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.030 
cooking process so this may be an
obvious<00:02:10.920> answer

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
obvious answer

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.470 
obvious answer
just<00:02:13.250> something<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:15.049> know<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:16.480> thought

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
just something that you know I thought

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.479 
just something that you know I thought
should<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.870> pointed<00:02:18.290> out<00:02:18.409> and<00:02:18.739> at<00:02:18.980> least<00:02:19.010> just

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
should be pointed out and at least just

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.740 
should be pointed out and at least just
thought<00:02:19.730> about<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:21.939> way<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:22.969> save<00:02:23.269> fuel<00:02:23.510> I

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
thought about as a way to save fuel I

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.339 
thought about as a way to save fuel I
don't<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.319> pressure<00:02:24.530> cooker<00:02:24.799> I<00:02:25.129> need<00:02:25.849> one

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
don't have a pressure cooker I need one

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.530 
don't have a pressure cooker I need one
but<00:02:27.730> it'll<00:02:28.730> speed<00:02:28.969> things<00:02:29.000> up<00:02:29.950> save<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.069> fuel

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
but it'll speed things up save you fuel

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.710 
but it'll speed things up save you fuel
and<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:34.069> know<00:02:34.239> save<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.269> money<00:02:35.510> because

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
and you know save you money because

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.229 
and you know save you money because
you're<00:02:35.930> using<00:02:36.049> less<00:02:36.290> fuel<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.819> just<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.209> show

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
you're using less fuel and just to show

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.640 
you're using less fuel and just to show
you<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.260> made<00:02:39.500> my<00:02:39.620> beans<00:02:39.829> out<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:41.590> out<00:02:42.590> of
