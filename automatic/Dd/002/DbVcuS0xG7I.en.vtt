00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.840
 That's like everyone 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.790

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.570

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.710

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.699
 the lower lashes 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.210
 so that our eyes look more 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.210
 open 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.689
 and good as blush I will use the 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.920
 pearls 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:23.430
 of ory flame of the line giordani vol 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.460
 what is the natural tone radios I'm going to 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.880
 use these two labials as first 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.780
 option for a more natural tone and it is one 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.570
 is hat pink and the other one is coral and I'm going 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.420
 to combine I'm going to first first I'm going to 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.110
 put the hat-trick and then I'll 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:47.570
 apply the coral tone and well that's going 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.820
 to give a more neutral natural tone and 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.090
 Well that is the first option of the 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.200
 lipstick tone if you want a very look 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.990
 natural 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.390
 Well, it would be that natural and if 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.430
 they want more intense because they use a 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.850
 darker color like this time not 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.370
 use do not want and it is without red color and 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.960
 that a long lasting lip and good 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.700
 well that's all the truth is something very 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.290
 simple but if you look how it changes 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.730
 from start to finish and maygar very much 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.590
 the good difference because until the 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.640
 next girls who are very well 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.640
