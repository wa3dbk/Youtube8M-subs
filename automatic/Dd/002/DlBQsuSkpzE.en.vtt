00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.160
 hi guys and girls you are watching 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:08.740
 video reviews from the blog father son and toys 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.349
 and today we will open the sixth window 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.179
 the shooting process decided to join my 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.789
 son and now he will open 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.970
 next window and we take a look at least 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.310
 one eye on the 6th gift and caught us 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.130
 separatist droid buzzard and 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.529
 it consists of 10 parts immediately 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.669
 proceed to build which I think not 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.669
 will take a lot of time 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.910
 after work in your gaze to be 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.150
 small replica of the vulture droid 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.900
 this model is like her older brother from 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.140
 recruiting kit in 75 041 easy 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.780
 goes into walking mode and can safely 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.330
 walk on the planet as a whole mini-model 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.700
 very similar to the original and its 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.190
 the building goes nine out of ten 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.979
 submitted to the guitar that can be said 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.790
 the conclusion is probably something that would be cool 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.430
 have 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.950
 and big models of all assembled in this 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.380

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.180

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.250
