video of my initial reaction to this but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.550 
video of my initial reaction to this but
just<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.190> make<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.370> long<00:02:14.610> story<00:02:14.760> short<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.959> got

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
just to make a long story short I I got

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.070 
just to make a long story short I I got
a<00:02:16.590> new<00:02:16.879> external<00:02:17.879> hard<00:02:18.120> drive<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:18.690> actually

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
a new external hard drive it's actually

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.390 
a new external hard drive it's actually
right<00:02:19.410> back<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
right back here and right here and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.100 
right back here and right here and
basically<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.940> had<00:02:27.120> happened<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.930> went

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
basically what had happened was I went

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.140 
basically what had happened was I went
to<00:02:28.200> transfer<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> lot<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.129> files<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.849> they

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
to transfer a lot of files and they

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.850 
to transfer a lot of files and they
didn't<00:02:30.360> transfer<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.140> had<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.560> initial

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
didn't transfer so I had my initial

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.199 
didn't transfer so I had my initial
reaction<00:02:32.010> videos<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.879> so<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.120> not

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
reaction videos on there so I'm not

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.119 
reaction videos on there so I'm not
gonna<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.480> able<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.660> give<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.900> those<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:35.099> uh

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
gonna be able to give you those but uh

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.400 
gonna be able to give you those but uh
basically<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.390> happened<00:02:36.750> was<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.050> car<00:02:37.260> got

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
basically what happened was the car got

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.640 
basically what happened was the car got
totaled<00:02:38.180> everything<00:02:39.180> related<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.379> car

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
totaled everything related to that car

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:59.220 
totaled everything related to that car
is<00:02:40.920> now<00:02:41.099> handled<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.760> done<00:02:41.879> with

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.020 

so<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> guess<00:03:00.530> now<00:03:00.740> I<00:03:00.770> could<00:03:01.370> say<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.819> I'm<00:03:01.910> in

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
so I guess now I could say that I'm in

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.320 
so I guess now I could say that I'm in
the<00:03:02.120> market<00:03:02.510> for<00:03:02.750> another<00:03:03.050> car<00:03:03.970> I'm<00:03:04.970> not<00:03:05.150> going
