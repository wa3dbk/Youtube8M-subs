00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
memory are very easy to access well we

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.430 
memory are very easy to access well we
also<00:01:09.409> include<00:01:09.890> our<00:01:10.130> HT<00:01:10.790> security<00:01:11.570> good<00:01:12.290> in

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
also include our HT security good in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.580 
also include our HT security good in
good<00:01:12.650> sensors<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.330> locks<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.050> secure<00:01:15.470> it

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
good sensors and and locks to secure it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.140 
good sensors and and locks to secure it
in<00:01:15.650> multiple<00:01:16.130> ways<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:18.369> all<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:19.759> at<00:01:20.060> a

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
in multiple ways and all of this at a

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.270 
in multiple ways and all of this at a
great<00:01:20.780> entry<00:01:21.170> starting<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.890> point<00:01:22.100> about

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
great entry starting the point about

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.840 
great entry starting the point about
$6.99<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:23.540> our<00:01:24.140> lowest<00:01:24.530> cost<00:01:24.800> desktop<00:01:25.369> and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
$6.99 so our lowest cost desktop and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.910 
$6.99 so our lowest cost desktop and
since<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.360> uses<00:01:26.479> less<00:01:26.990> than<00:01:27.229> 8<00:01:27.350> watts<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.740> power

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
since it uses less than 8 watts of power

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.370 
since it uses less than 8 watts of power
it's<00:01:28.880> going<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.180> cost<00:01:29.390> less<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.750> use<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's going to cost less to use the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.560 
it's going to cost less to use the
product<00:01:30.800> throughout<00:01:31.070> its<00:01:31.280> lifecycle<00:01:31.700> as<00:01:32.030> well

to to solid-state drives you can fit
into<00:01:44.140> this<00:01:44.380> device<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:47.020> aimed<00:01:47.409> primarily

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
into this device and so aimed primarily

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.219 
into this device and so aimed primarily
at<00:01:48.189> business<00:01:48.729> other<00:01:49.720> customers<00:01:49.990> probably

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
at business other customers probably

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.450 
at business other customers probably
pick<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.500> up<00:01:50.590> if<00:01:50.680> they<00:01:50.740> wanted<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.159> but<00:01:51.310> it's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
pick it up if they wanted to but it's

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.340 
pick it up if they wanted to but it's
really<00:01:51.700> designed<00:01:52.180> for<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.630> enterprise

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
really designed for the enterprise

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.219 
really designed for the enterprise
so<00:01:53.680> there's<00:01:53.830> also<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:55.540> affordable<00:01:55.780> modern

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
so there's also a more affordable modern

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.190 
so there's also a more affordable modern
model<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.799> doesn't<00:01:56.950> have<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.280> vPro

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
model that doesn't have the vPro
