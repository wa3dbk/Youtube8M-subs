00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
then oh man I mean it was movable and I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.959 
then oh man I mean it was movable and I
just<00:00:59.039> didn't<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.730> hand

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
just didn't know what from my hand

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.650 
just didn't know what from my hand
there's<00:01:00.719> no<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.199> space<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:03.570> know

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
there's no really space like you know

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.609 
there's no really space like you know
what<00:01:03.750> fine<00:01:04.019> oh<00:01:04.350> he's<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:07.200> still<00:01:07.500> get

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
what fine oh he's this you still get

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.710 
what fine oh he's this you still get
basic<00:01:08.040> movement<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.360> went<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
basic movement and then we went to a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.170 
basic movement and then we went to a
chance<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.170> easy<00:01:10.460> because<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.700> hand<00:01:11.939> still

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
chance it's easy because your hand still

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.890 
chance it's easy because your hand still
ends<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.110> away<00:01:14.070> from<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.430> pistol

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
ends up to be here away from the pistol

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.230 
ends up to be here away from the pistol
so<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.409> still<00:01:16.710> good<00:01:17.240> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so it's like it's still good and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.070 
so it's like it's still good and
something<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.530> wrong<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.920> mine<00:01:21.080> my

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
something that is wrong with mine my

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.999 
something that is wrong with mine my
Stampede<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.490> uh<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:25.799> doesn't<00:01:26.610> only<00:01:27.680> fire<00:01:28.680> when

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
Stampede is uh it doesn't only fire when

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.399 
Stampede is uh it doesn't only fire when
you<00:01:29.040> want<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> fire<00:01:29.700> anymore<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> that's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you want it to fire anymore so that's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.069 
you want it to fire anymore so that's
why<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.729> circle<00:01:33.360> thing<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.720> an<00:01:33.840> air

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
why I have the circle thing is an air

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.590 
why I have the circle thing is an air
stricter<00:01:35.390> no<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.810> restricting<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.439> hair

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.030
