00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.879
 who gives gas must be able to brake 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.039
 for that the stopper should be in top form 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.109
 his 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.410
 a brake system is never one hundred percent 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.810
 close 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 the sticking point is the brake fluid 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.439
 wears out and has to be all at the latest 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.609
 Two years out, not every biker 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.609
 know and heed 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.450
 they change two years 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 we do the practical test with alex and 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.989
 his 13 year old approx 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.140
 the last change is according to alex more 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.060
 than four years back 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.530
 Brake fluid is hygroscopic 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.330
 means she draws water 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.670
 this leads to air in the system over time 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.200
 the effect of braking is above all 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.160
 if the brake gets hot for example 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.630
 on the big tour 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.489
 the path lengthens with hotter 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.489
 Brake with each attempt by a few meters 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.440
 the effect of the old liquid leaves 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.940
 Extremely in practice that means im 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.940
 worst case crash 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.560
 by regularly changing the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.710
 liquid and completely vent the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.450
 plant remains the brake topfit the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.280
 conventional method with 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 wrench hand and much 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.009
 Patience brake to system open system 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.990
 close brake on cumbersome and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.630
 inefficient because the negative pressure is not 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.119
 is much easier too 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.979
 but they also serve the vacuum pump 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.170
 pumps the air must be completely out of the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.790
 systems produced under pressure 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.500
 not from around all air nests too 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.210
 remove 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 Recently, there is a little slip on 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.390
 the market it literally in itself 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.000
 has the air vent screw 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.979
 and he invented martin mast 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.710
 Explains what the breather screw the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.170
 We have preceded conventional methods 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.510
 have developed a solution that the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.600
 to solve the problem 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.380
 It arises on the screw 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.020
 the air must be tight 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.070
 must have check valve and so that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.750
 vent for everyone and for all 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.580
 accomplished 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.950
 the practice is as simple as it is ingenious 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.250
 which often already corrects the original 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.790
 screw flies out new air vent 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.860
 screw rows turn hose 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.860
 Put on and pump 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.540
 the check valve in the screw 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.190
 prevents liquid and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.850
 bubbles back into the system 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.800
 bring 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.959
 This ensures that the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.200
 complete air pumped out of the system 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.910
 becomes 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.060
 the full braking effect will be restored 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.060
 manufactured 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.019
 refill with new brake fluid and 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.840
 pump as long as no old one anymore 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.860
 the difference comes old and new 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.860
 is clearly visible 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.280
 not only the brake fluid, too 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.650
 original rubber pipes must 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.610
 about every turn 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.680
 five years 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.840
 It offers itself to the old ones 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.530
 wear-free steel flex cables too 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.599
 replace 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.950
 we recommend to look at the ventilation 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.230
 also exchange 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.489
 with just under 30 euros a small but good 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.489
 investment in safety 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.470
