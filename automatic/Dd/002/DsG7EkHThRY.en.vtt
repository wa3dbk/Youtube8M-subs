00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.530
 I would like to say 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.050
 I need to tell you a very important thing 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:35.480
 I know maybe together 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.860
 fuck the moon up 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 Hello everyone, Orly 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.739
 and today I would like to review this mod 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 very interesting which add such 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.500
 things are saved but you probably don’t 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.809
 know this portal gun and of course if 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.440
 who did not play the game portal 1 play 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.180
 although I don't think you will like it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.129
 don't play because the game is already pretty 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 did become though i don't know your cusack and 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.260
 in general, everything is very simple we take 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.020
 we shoot the portal with rubbing another and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.720
 for example, we go to 1 cop and we appear 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 in the other you saw that I found you copies 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.330
 will come out and also you can do it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.680
 I went much further 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.850
 jumped out of here no I drank 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.660
 from here there is no, I again Alan in general 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.210
 somewhat you see everything with everything than they 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.260
 only colors are different 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.960
 more to commit different here such beef 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.900
 a piece of beef for fun and potatoes 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.080
 if you played the original portal or on 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.909
 2 need clothes from a cat and 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.119
 it's already a kind of damage 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.640
 a quarter that can be used 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.250
 so also this mod adds 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.700
 and here such sneakers which were at 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.040
 the main character in the portal they are not outwardly 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.210
 they are not so much different 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.970
 longish 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.890
 in general, they are all that they can do it 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.039
 absorb damage completely from falling 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.590
 look i am out of fashion now and i can 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.450
 fall and rush and all 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.320
 and all damage absorbed ie mini 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 does no damage go further 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.350
 as this mod is here are you 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.989
 wonderful blocks that are for you too 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.940
 probably familiar from the portal and they 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.620
 traveling ones they are not like you 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.370
 earthen or stone was 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.290
 don't have another different physics and I don't know 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.569
 why not exactly needed but it seems like for 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.159
 scenery but they are still used for 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.010
 crafting which I will talk about later 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.830
 but so they just I think so for 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.049
 decorations are needed, and this is their lower by at 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.049
 type that's true I do not know what it is on 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.810
 in fact it is different and it’s the same 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.970
 block notes, they are also probably for 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.890
 elevator decorations so pipes and they don't 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.390
 I really understand from the video which 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.519
 it was before this we had to and 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.010
 look and there it used like 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.090
 candy lids which draws in smell with 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.190
 slabs 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.859
 if you understand what i'm talking about in general 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.829
 go ahead also from the video could see 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.260
 so here they were walking the device which is 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.420
 radio is actually regular radio and she 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.079
 play simple music here and rejoice 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.329
 nothing much and can not do 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.480
 useless thing one of the coolest 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.970
 pointing this mod I think so 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.000
 and here is such a thing she really 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.080
 flat and that's what she have 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.610
 do a long time ago 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.010
 shoulder you will not mind i think a 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.870
 and also it can be customized it was 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.739
 only 3 units and if you put it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.540
 on the top five 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.700
 and I do not want to test yourself to 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.760
 then lie down for a long time let's try on 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:52.040
 dumb hell and then bring him his note 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.940
 you fly after graduating brought flown what I 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.959
 forgot to press 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:03.440
 adam and everything and he flew and now he 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.260
 die yes it can protect the house such 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.150
 tweaks put on the maximum speed and 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.489
 all sorts of different zombie skeletons just 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.250
 will go and fly away from your home and 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.100
 you will be fully protected so 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.019
 way also this mod has a robot in 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.709
 which you could see in the game too 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.139
 portal 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.810
 i don't really know what not help 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.990
 perform kind of how they react to it 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.090
 movement but the driver they are on my neither 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.530
 whose others they don't respond or may 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.919
 be this breaking fashion or 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.690
 hd movie so i understand they wear 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.800
 talking up talkative three kinds 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:44.349
 different 1 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.970
 but he shot you see before 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.069
 death shoots and this one 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.539
 fires too rockets somehow well in 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:54.849
 Generally we go further as this mod has 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:59.409
 three wonderful drives that 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:01.979
 which play songs from the portal game here 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:05.319
 already quite so diverse 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:09.009
 shifts even the title is present on 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.319
 writer and so on they are such which 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.319
 we used to see 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.319
 mykraft 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:25.750
 and the third such incomprehensible epic music 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.930
 ok and we go well I think on this we 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.240
 finish because with crafting there is very 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.350
 many will have to shoot it all 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.110
 record and i think to do separate 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.880
 video about crafting to this fashion and I 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.740
 I think on this we finish in general all 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.180
 thanks for watching you orly was 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.180
 bye everyone
