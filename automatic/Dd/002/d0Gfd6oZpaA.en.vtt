00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.349
 hello welcome to the present 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.860
 motor.com this week we approved the 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.320
 citroën c4 aircross is the bet of 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.140
 citroën on the compact suv segment 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 segment on the rise a segment that now 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.150
 same as the success of the qashqai isan 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.329
 and good citroën he proposes us a car 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.920
 a little over high with the name c4 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.920
 even if it has nothing to do with him 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 as we said nothing has to do with 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.200
 the c4 and that's because in the guts 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.549
 this c4 aircross is a mitsubishi asx 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.590
 share platform share 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.840
 practically the entire body and are 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.570
 only a few details such as 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.299
 headlights the calender with the citroën logo 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 and the built-in indicators and a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.810
 new bumpers the ones that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.810
 they differ from the Japanese model 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.680
 not only the frontal denotes character 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.420
 citroën so he does behind a 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.150
 headlights with an appendage down that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.150
 remember not only the c4 but also 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.040
 me personally to that 5 apart from 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.220
 Other typical details of the brand 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.130
 the chevrons like this chrome strip 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.310
 in the tailgate or a pillar ce 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.810
 floating with the name air cross 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.810
 and the rose of the winds 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.250
 just as it happens on the outside 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.830
 interior of the citroën c4 aircross socket 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.560
 quite oriental features completely 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.050
 of the asx from which it derives since good 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.360
 simply its interior is exactly 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.820
 the same will only be some details 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.490
 like some logo and some small 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.130
 termination those that differentiate it from 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.890
 Japanese model 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.930
 in terms of equipment as our 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.870
 unit is pretty complete we have 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.700
 browser leather upholstery and even 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.500
 a panoramic roof that covers 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.500
 practically the entire roof 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.250
 if we access the trunk of the c4 ec2 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.569
 let's find a volume of 440 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.939
 liters 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.549
 some pretty profitable ways and if 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.800
 we have something to criticize is maybe a 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.130
 mouth of load somewhat high 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.100
 if we need more space for things 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.770
 and fold the rear seats and good 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.770
 we will have a practically flat space 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:18.110
 under the hood of our air cross it 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.900
 find a 1.6 hdi unit of 115 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.819
 horses 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:28.930
 it's a known motor in psa and it's from 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:32.010
 made the only thing that keeps this car from 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.010
 French group 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:40.620
 it's a pretty elastic silent motor 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:44.040
 pretty refined and good we have strength 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.299
 from the 1500 laps something that is not 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.329
 we may be a little short on 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.989
 off-road driving that is something of what 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.859
 that can boast this car especially 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:59.189
 for a first gear maybe too much 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.439
 long though we have a box of 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.569
 six relationships 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.579
 what 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.159
 how are you quite long so let's go 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.959
 to get low consumption right now 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:14.510
 we have a consumption of 55 liters but yes 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.310
 maybe it does a little bit not short but 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.930
 if you can have an answer something 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.930
 lazy to the accelerator 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.970
 d 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.400
 the citroën c4 aircross are offered with 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.060
 two types of traction traction 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.650
 only front and 4x4 traction 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.300
 our test unit present 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.700
 corresponds to this last type of 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.800
 4x4 drive is a system that 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.770
 it simply consists of three modes 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.500
 the first forces the front traction 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.300
 which is the best way to save 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.070
 fuel is the best way for a 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.620
 completely normal driving in 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.790
 normal conditions and then we have 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.940
 The automatic 4x4 system is a system 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.250
 that simply the management of 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.120
 traction is fully automatic it 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.180
 estimated automatically and will be in the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.630
 so that 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.759
 will give us that extra security in 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.660
 wet pavements and even snow or 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:24.150
 simply tracks paved tracks 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.180
 simple last we have the system 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.370
 4x4 with differential lock is a 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.520
 system usually reserved for 4x4 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.509
 pure although this one is not, but good 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.250
 better is to improve your attitudes 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:43.800
 distributing the pair equally 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:47.789
 in both axes and allowing a better 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.139
 traction which will allow us to leave 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.039
 graceful of difficult situations 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.039
 complicated 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.010
 good friends this has only been a 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.400
 preview of our citroën test 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.710
 c4 aircross hd and 115 horses if you want 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.840
 know all your secrets all your 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.530
 details I invite you to read our test 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.530
 written today motor.com 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.530
 we wait 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.270
 ah
