now<00:00:15.730> what's<00:00:16.730> going<00:00:17.029> on<00:00:17.210> how<00:00:17.990> did<00:00:18.050> we<00:00:18.290> get<00:00:18.410> here

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
now what's going on how did we get here

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.370 
now what's going on how did we get here
well<00:00:19.730> to<00:00:19.880> understand<00:00:20.270> population<00:00:20.869> growth<00:00:21.080> we

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
well to understand population growth we

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.620 
well to understand population growth we
should<00:00:21.560> really<00:00:21.830> start<00:00:22.040> at<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.250> beginning

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
turns out it took all of human history

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.790 
turns out it took all of human history
about<00:00:28.820> 50<00:00:29.300> thousand<00:00:29.750> years<00:00:29.989> up<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.680> year

1800 to reach the first billion
inhabitants<00:00:33.250> but<00:00:34.250> once<00:00:34.460> we<00:00:34.610> hit<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:34.910> mark

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
inhabitants but once we hit that mark

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.450 
inhabitants but once we hit that mark
things<00:00:35.810> started<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:36.290> move<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:37.160> number

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
things started to move the number

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.540 
things started to move the number
doubled<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.850> 2<00:00:38.030> billion<00:00:38.390> in<00:00:38.480> just<00:00:38.660> 130<00:00:39.380> years<00:00:39.710> 2

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
doubled to 2 billion in just 130 years 2

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.880 
doubled to 2 billion in just 130 years 2
billion<00:00:40.910> became<00:00:41.210> 3<00:00:41.510> billion<00:00:41.870> just<00:00:42.260> 30<00:00:42.590> years

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
billion became 3 billion just 30 years

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.940 
billion became 3 billion just 30 years
later<00:00:43.240> it<00:00:44.240> took<00:00:44.450> 14<00:00:44.930> years<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.290> go<00:00:45.530> from<00:00:45.710> 3

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
later it took 14 years to go from 3

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.280 
later it took 14 years to go from 3
billion<00:00:46.310> to<00:00:46.460> 4<00:00:46.670> billion<00:00:46.880> and<00:00:47.180> we<00:00:47.660> reached<00:00:47.870> five

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
billion to 4 billion and we reached five

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.040 
billion to 4 billion and we reached five
billion<00:00:48.740> thirteen<00:00:49.430> years<00:00:49.700> later<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.780> can<00:00:50.810> see

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
billion thirteen years later you can see

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.710 
billion thirteen years later you can see
what's<00:00:51.200> happened<00:00:51.610> 12<00:00:52.610> years<00:00:52.730> later<00:00:53.120> we're<00:00:53.660> at

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
what's happened 12 years later we're at

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.080 
what's happened 12 years later we're at
6<00:00:54.020> billion<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.590> another<00:00:55.310> 12<00:00:55.580> years<00:00:55.730> after

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
6 billion and another 12 years after

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.350 
6 billion and another 12 years after
that<00:00:56.120> we've<00:00:56.840> reached<00:00:57.140> 7<00:00:57.770> billion<00:00:58.270> what<00:00:59.270> is

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
that we've reached 7 billion what is

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.600 
that we've reached 7 billion what is
surprising<00:00:59.510> is<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.440> over<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:00.950> past<00:01:00.980> 50

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
surprising is that over the past 50

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.359 
surprising is that over the past 50
years<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.000> actual<00:01:02.810> growth<00:01:03.110> rate<00:01:03.440> has<00:01:03.650> slowed

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
years the actual growth rate has slowed

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.850 
years the actual growth rate has slowed
yet<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.239> size<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.020> world's<00:01:06.290> population

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
yet the size of the world's population

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.940 
yet the size of the world's population
continues<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.759> rise<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.960> how<00:01:09.200> can<00:01:09.259> both<00:01:09.680> things

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
continues to rise so how can both things

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.730 
continues to rise so how can both things
be<00:01:10.130> happening

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.830 

to<00:01:13.189> find<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.549> answer<00:01:13.850> we<00:01:14.180> have<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.420> go<00:01:14.600> back<00:01:14.810> a

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
to find the answer we have to go back a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.950 
to find the answer we have to go back a
few<00:01:15.020> hundred<00:01:15.290> years<00:01:16.420> profound<00:01:17.420> changes<00:01:17.869> were

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
few hundred years profound changes were

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.859 
few hundred years profound changes were
happening<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:19.250> Industrial<00:01:19.759> Revolution

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
happening the Industrial Revolution

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.380 
happening the Industrial Revolution
transformed<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.930> way<00:01:21.020> people<00:01:21.049> lived<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.649> work

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
transformed the way people lived in work

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.969 
transformed the way people lived in work
with<00:01:23.390> improved<00:01:23.720> economic<00:01:23.899> conditions<00:01:24.680> people

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
with improved economic conditions people

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.249 
with improved economic conditions people
live<00:01:25.280> longer<00:01:25.659> then<00:01:26.659> in<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.899> 20th<00:01:27.229> century

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
live longer then in the 20th century

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.499 
live longer then in the 20th century
better<00:01:27.979> sanitation<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.820> modern<00:01:29.149> medicine

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
better sanitation and modern medicine

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.380 
better sanitation and modern medicine
extended<00:01:29.990> life<00:01:30.140> even<00:01:30.590> further<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.390> family

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
extended life even further and family

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.840 
extended life even further and family
life<00:01:32.630> began<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.259> change<00:01:33.640> women's<00:01:34.640> roles

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
life began to change women's roles

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.090 
life began to change women's roles
expanded<00:01:35.450> there<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:36.350> greater<00:01:36.590> access<00:01:36.979> to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
expanded there was greater access to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.910 
expanded there was greater access to
modern<00:01:37.250> contraception<00:01:37.939> and<00:01:38.659> more<00:01:39.530> kids<00:01:39.740> were

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
modern contraception and more kids were

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.700 
modern contraception and more kids were
enrolled<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.369> school<00:01:41.080> all<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.409> led<00:01:42.679> to

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
enrolled in school all this led to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.910 
enrolled in school all this led to
smaller<00:01:43.100> families<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.789> longer<00:01:44.689> lives<00:01:44.920> this

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
smaller families and longer lives this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.910 
smaller families and longer lives this
is<00:01:46.100> what<00:01:46.280> experts<00:01:46.670> call<00:01:46.819> a<00:01:47.209> demographic

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
is what experts call a demographic

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.529 
is what experts call a demographic
transition<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.459> marks<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.880> shift<00:01:50.119> in<00:01:50.360> birth

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
transition that marks the shift in birth

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.460 
transition that marks the shift in birth
and<00:01:50.690> death<00:01:50.840> rates<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.810> what<00:01:53.990> does<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.259> mean<00:01:54.409> on

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
and death rates so what does it mean on

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.210 
and death rates so what does it mean on
a<00:01:54.590> global<00:01:55.009> scale<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:56.110> understand<00:01:57.110> global<00:01:57.619> we

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
a global scale to understand global we

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.490 
a global scale to understand global we
actually<00:01:58.670> have<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:58.880> think<00:01:59.119> local<00:01:59.659> that's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
actually have to think local that's

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.230 
actually have to think local that's
because<00:02:00.799> demographic<00:02:01.429> transitions<00:02:02.030> happen

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
because demographic transitions happen

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.990 
because demographic transitions happen
country<00:02:02.780> by<00:02:02.929> country<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.500> at<00:02:04.310> any<00:02:04.490> given<00:02:04.729> time

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
rates are high these countries generally

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.069

still<00:02:25.489> hot<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.000> population<00:02:26.600> growth<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.989> still

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
still hot so population growth is still

rising<00:02:27.910> now<00:02:28.910> look<00:02:29.120> at<00:02:29.239> countries<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:29.630> have

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
have fewer children but the population

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.259 
have fewer children but the population
is<00:02:36.530> still<00:02:36.859> growing<00:02:37.220> because<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.940> greater

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
is still growing because of the greater

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.500 
is still growing because of the greater
number<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.840> people<00:02:39.230> at<00:02:39.500> younger<00:02:39.709> ages<00:02:40.299> at<00:02:41.299> the

growth<00:02:43.609> is<00:02:43.790> stabilized<00:02:44.299> with<00:02:44.600> low<00:02:44.840> birth<00:02:45.019> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
growth is stabilized with low birth and

death rates and in some cases the
population<00:02:48.829> actually<00:02:48.980> declines<00:02:49.790> because

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
population actually declines because

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.599 
population actually declines because
there<00:02:50.510> are<00:02:50.630> more<00:02:50.750> deaths<00:02:51.049> than<00:02:51.440> births<00:02:51.609> which

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
there are more deaths than births which

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.360 
there are more deaths than births which
gets<00:02:52.850> us<00:02:52.970> back<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.480> original<00:02:53.900> question

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
gets us back to the original question

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.280 
gets us back to the original question
why<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.430> world<00:02:55.819> population<00:02:56.480> still<00:02:56.750> rising

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
why is world population still rising

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.990 
why is world population still rising
even<00:02:57.470> though<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.799> actual<00:02:58.280> growth<00:02:58.549> rate<00:02:58.730> is

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
even though the actual growth rate is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.990 
even though the actual growth rate is
slow<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.590> simple<00:03:00.920> answer<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.400> because<00:03:01.670> right

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
slow the simple answer is because right

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.940 
slow the simple answer is because right
now<00:03:02.209> we're<00:03:02.450> at<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.600> point<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:02.989> history<00:03:03.170> where

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
now we're at a point in history where

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.500 
now we're at a point in history where
there<00:03:04.130> are<00:03:04.250> still<00:03:04.430> more<00:03:04.760> people<00:03:05.150> living<00:03:05.359> in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
there are still more people living in

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.180 
there are still more people living in
countries<00:03:05.750> in<00:03:06.109> early<00:03:06.440> transition<00:03:07.010> with

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
countries in early transition with

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.360 
countries in early transition with
growing<00:03:07.579> population

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
growing population

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.309 
growing population
then<00:03:08.940> people<00:03:09.330> living<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.690> countries<00:03:09.870> with

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
then people living in countries with

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.339 
then people living in countries with
stable<00:03:10.769> or<00:03:10.920> declining<00:03:11.159> populations<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:13.170> there

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
stable or declining populations so there

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.170 
stable or declining populations so there
you<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.650> it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you have it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.360 
you have it
