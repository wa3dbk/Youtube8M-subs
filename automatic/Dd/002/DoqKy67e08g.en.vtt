00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.590
 for this the craft project 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.369
 you are going to use paper 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.490
 construction of various colors scissors and 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.920
 glue first take all the papers 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.650
 of colors and put them together and start 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.560
 to cut small strips of paper from each 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.330
 construction paper 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 in the way I'm doing it 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.009
 here 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.699
 now let's take a piece of paper 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.770
 pink and let's make a circle this 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.320
 procedure is going to be the same every time 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.809
 that one starts doing this kind of 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 craft since we have the circle 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.519
 let's take another piece of paper here 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.949
 they take a piece of green paper and 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.730
 Now I'm going to make another circle on top of 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:56.670
 of the pink circle that I started with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.350
 this way we're going to make a chain the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.149
 why I'm doing this 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 as a mini project is so that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.549
 you see in more detail how 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.799
 do if I had the biggest paper not 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.860
 I could do this kind of project like this 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 that's why I'm using small piece 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.970
 of paper but when you do it in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 house they have to take big pieces of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.689
 paper and they can make mini chains and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.119
 put them together as I did here I hope 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.680
 that you like this project and can 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.280
 use any form they wish 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.280
 Thank you 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.520
 and
