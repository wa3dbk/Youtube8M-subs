00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
this there are a couple situations we're

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380 
this there are a couple situations we're
all<00:00:34.260> more<00:00:34.500> heavily<00:00:34.890> consider<00:00:35.370> flatting<00:00:35.850> i'm<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
all more heavily consider flatting i'm a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
all more heavily consider flatting i'm a
flat<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.380> there's<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> fish<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
flat here if there's a fish in the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.709 
flat here if there's a fish in the
blinds<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> i<00:00:38.700> thought<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.940> by<00:00:39.180> flatting<00:00:39.629> i

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
blinds and i thought that by flatting i

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.990 
blinds and i thought that by flatting i
would<00:00:39.899> induce<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.469> continue<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.250> well<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
would induce them to continue as well so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.910 
would induce them to continue as well so
that<00:00:42.149> way<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.660> fish<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.290> or

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
that way I can get that fish in there or

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
that way I can get that fish in there or
I'm<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.700> flat<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.360> think<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.719> pose

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
I'm a flat here if I think my pose

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.690 
I'm a flat here if I think my pose
five-inch<00:00:46.530> against<00:00:46.860> love<00:00:47.010> Terri<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.489> like

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
five-inch against love Terri is like

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
five-inch against love Terri is like
super<00:00:48.539> super<00:00:48.719> sick<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.860> were<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> three

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
super super sick and if I were to three

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
super super sick and if I were to three
bet<00:00:50.430> they<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.789> fold<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> ton<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> time<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
bet they just fold a ton of the time so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
bet they just fold a ton of the time so
it'd<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.649> advantageous<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.640> them

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it'd be more advantageous to make them

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
it'd be more advantageous to make them
go<00:00:53.940> post<00:00:54.210> fuck<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.780> beat<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
go post fuck with me beat them there and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.260 
go post fuck with me beat them there and
win<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> lot<00:00:55.949> more<00:00:56.250> money<00:00:56.430> rather<00:00:56.910> than<00:00:57.120> just

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
win a lot more money rather than just

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.430 
win a lot more money rather than just
picking<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.660> their<00:00:57.780> three<00:00:58.050> big<00:00:58.230> blinds

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
picking up their three big blinds

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
picking up their three big blinds
preflop<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.460> those<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.600> situations

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
preflop so those are some situations

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.599 
preflop so those are some situations
where<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.320> would<00:01:01.469> consider<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.039> flatting<00:01:02.430> but

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
where I would consider just flatting but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.070 
where I would consider just flatting but
typically<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.539> playing<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.899> very

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
typically I'm gonna be playing this very

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
typically I'm gonna be playing this very
aggressively<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:05.040> okay<00:01:05.339> definitely

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
aggressively and I'm okay definitely

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
situation comes up one of the big

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
situation comes up one of the big
questions<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> ask<00:01:18.840> myself<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.680> how

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
questions I like to ask myself is how

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.640 
questions I like to ask myself is how
many<00:01:20.340> hands<00:01:20.610> currently<00:01:21.150> beat<00:01:21.479> me<00:01:21.659> now<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
many hands currently beat me now in a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.499 
many hands currently beat me now in a
situation<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.820> six<00:01:24.090> max<00:01:24.330> I'm

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
situation like this at six max I'm

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
situation like this at six max I'm
assuming<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.020> he<00:01:25.140> probably<00:01:25.320> doesn't<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
assuming that he probably doesn't have a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.440 
assuming that he probably doesn't have a
sting<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> ton<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> time<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.119> assuming

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
sting a ton of the time I'm assuming

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
sting a ton of the time I'm assuming
that<00:01:27.509> probably<00:01:28.170> four<00:01:28.409> bets<00:01:28.619> preflop<00:01:29.159> which

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that probably four bets preflop which

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
that probably four bets preflop which
means<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.420> probably<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> best<00:01:31.350> king

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
means that I probably have the best king

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.160 
means that I probably have the best king
or<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> chopping<00:01:32.549> king<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.509> he<00:01:34.020> could

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
or a chopping king right so he could

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.539 
or a chopping king right so he could
have<00:01:34.259> king<00:01:34.470> queen<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.100> most<00:01:35.250> likely

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
have king queen but you can most likely

beat me but there aren't a ton of combos
of<00:01:48.869> those<00:01:49.020> there's<00:01:49.590> three<00:01:49.979> kinds<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.340> threes

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
of those there's three kinds of threes

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
of those there's three kinds of threes
three<00:01:51.000> combos<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.450> six<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.259> super<00:01:52.619> worried

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
three combos of six is not super worried

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.569 
three combos of six is not super worried
about<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
about that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.280 
about that
I<00:01:53.610> don't<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.119> aces<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.689> gonna<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.079> here

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
I don't think aces are gonna be in here

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260 
I don't think aces are gonna be in here
all<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> often<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.549> aren't<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.939> ton<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
all that often so there aren't a ton of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.810 
all that often so there aren't a ton of
combos<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.140> beat<00:01:58.350> me<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.310> don't<00:01:59.369> think

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
combos that beat me and I don't think

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.609 
combos that beat me and I don't think
that<00:01:59.969> many<00:02:00.119> combos<00:02:00.570> will<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.899> me<00:02:01.079> by<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> turn

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that many combos will be me by the turn

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.740 
that many combos will be me by the turn
either<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> kind<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.570> situation

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
either so this is the kind of situation

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.859 
either so this is the kind of situation
where<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.350> may<00:02:04.829> consider<00:02:05.340> raising<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.600> I'm

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
where I may consider raising but I'm

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.410 
where I may consider raising but I'm

probably just gonna flat here if I flat
I<00:02:09.450> can

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
consider in these spots so we end up

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.050 
consider in these spots so we end up
going<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.530> four<00:02:42.769> in<00:02:42.859> the<00:02:42.920> turn<00:02:43.129> face<00:02:43.790> another

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
going to a four in the turn face another

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.119 
going to a four in the turn face another
bet<00:02:44.359> in<00:02:44.629> here<00:02:44.870> just<00:02:45.049> decides<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.620> call<00:02:45.769> again

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
bet in here just decides to call again

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.099 
bet in here just decides to call again
ok<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:46.790> when<00:02:47.000> he<00:02:47.150> bets<00:02:47.359> again<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.840> turn

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
ok so when he bets again in the turn

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.720 
ok so when he bets again in the turn
it's<00:02:48.349> another<00:02:48.650> situation<00:02:48.920> where<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.489> don't

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
it's another situation where I don't

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.000 
it's another situation where I don't
really<00:02:49.940> think<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.269> gonna<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.569> behind<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
really think I'm gonna be behind so the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.470 
really think I'm gonna be behind so the
four<00:02:52.220> doesn't<00:02:52.459> really<00:02:52.579> change<00:02:52.640> all<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.239> much

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
four doesn't really change all that much

three meant probably not so I'm not
really<00:03:01.010> worried<00:03:01.489> about<00:03:01.609> hands<00:03:02.180> like<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.510> and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
really worried about hands like that and

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.000 
really worried about hands like that and
the<00:03:02.750> four<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.109> my<00:03:03.230> opinion<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:03.620> doesn't

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
the four in my opinion just doesn't

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.890 
the four in my opinion just doesn't
change<00:03:04.250> much<00:03:04.519> what<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.030> does<00:03:05.239> change<00:03:05.629> and<00:03:05.780> then

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
change much what it does change and then

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.030 
change much what it does change and then
it<00:03:06.019> starts<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.409> put<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.560> fourth<00:03:06.890> straight

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
it starts to put a fourth straight

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.860 
it starts to put a fourth straight
forming<00:03:07.579> on<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.730> board<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.390> river<00:03:08.599> could

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
forming on the board so the river could

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.660 
forming on the board so the river could
be<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.079> deuce<00:03:09.379> of<00:03:09.590> five<00:03:09.799> of<00:03:10.010> seven<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.489> put<00:03:10.640> a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
be a deuce of five of seven and put a

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.009 
be a deuce of five of seven and put a
four<00:03:10.909> straight<00:03:11.209> up<00:03:11.359> which<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.659> definitely

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
four straight up which is definitely

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.020 
four straight up which is definitely
something<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.319> consider<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.129> in<00:03:13.879> this

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
something to consider and in this

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.990 
something to consider and in this
situation<00:03:14.239> again<00:03:14.959> I'm<00:03:15.470> still<00:03:15.799> not<00:03:15.950> folding<00:03:16.519> so

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
situation again I'm still not folding so

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.150 
situation again I'm still not folding so
it's<00:03:17.329> just<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.690> situation<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.680> am<00:03:18.859> I<00:03:18.950> going<00:03:19.069> to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
it's just a situation of am I going to

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.159 
it's just a situation of am I going to
raise<00:03:19.310> or<00:03:19.519> am<00:03:19.609> I<00:03:19.669> gonna<00:03:19.790> call<00:03:20.090> now<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.780> will

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
raise or am I gonna call now I will

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.870 
raise or am I gonna call now I will
heavily<00:03:21.530> consider<00:03:21.950> raising<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.819> think

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
heavily consider raising this if I think

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.809 
heavily consider raising this if I think
that<00:03:23.180> he's<00:03:23.630> going<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.930> overvalue<00:03:24.549> flush<00:03:25.549> draws

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
that he's going to overvalue flush draws

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.460 
that he's going to overvalue flush draws
that<00:03:26.000> he<00:03:26.090> had<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.359> flop<00:03:26.660> backdoor<00:03:27.230> flush

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
that he had on the flop backdoor flush

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.559 
that he had on the flop backdoor flush
draw<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.799> he<00:03:27.889> picked<00:03:28.069> up<00:03:28.160> on<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.459> turn<00:03:28.760> any

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
draw that he picked up on the turn any

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.690 
draw that he picked up on the turn any
sort<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.930> King<00:03:30.169> X<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:30.530> he<00:03:30.590> has<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.190> maybe<00:03:31.340> he

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
sort of King X that he has and maybe he

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.610 
sort of King X that he has and maybe he
levels<00:03:32.150> himself<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:32.810> gets<00:03:32.930> too<00:03:33.139> active<00:03:33.500> with

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
levels himself and gets too active with

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.710 
levels himself and gets too active with
something<00:03:33.859> like<00:03:33.950> tens<00:03:34.220> so<00:03:34.970> if<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.329> think<00:03:35.389> that

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
something like tens so if I think that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.360 
something like tens so if I think that
that's<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.139> case<00:03:36.379> then<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.859> definitely<00:03:37.220> just

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
that's the case then I definitely just

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.830 
that's the case then I definitely just
want<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.609> race<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.120> go<00:03:38.239> for<00:03:38.510> straight

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
want to race here and go for straight

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.809 
want to race here and go for straight
straight<00:03:39.049> value<00:03:39.530> if<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.280> think<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:40.639> is<00:03:40.790> a

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
straight value if I think this is a

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.189 
straight value if I think this is a
situation<00:03:41.090> where<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.540> really<00:03:41.780> just<00:03:41.900> think<00:03:42.019> he's

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
situation where I really just think he's

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.050 
situation where I really just think he's
messing<00:03:42.440> around<00:03:42.680> with<00:03:42.980> like<00:03:43.129> East<00:03:43.459> Queen<00:03:43.819> is

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
messing around with like East Queen is

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.080 
messing around with like East Queen is
Jack<00:03:44.449> Jack<00:03:44.900> 10<00:03:45.260> or<00:03:45.650> whatever<00:03:46.069> random<00:03:46.340> nonsense

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
Jack Jack 10 or whatever random nonsense

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.030 
Jack Jack 10 or whatever random nonsense
then<00:03:47.870> I'm<00:03:48.019> totally<00:03:48.260> on<00:03:48.470> board<00:03:48.500> calling

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
then I'm totally on board calling

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.069 
then I'm totally on board calling
letting<00:03:49.760> him<00:03:49.910> barrel<00:03:50.209> off<00:03:50.359> rivers<00:03:50.780> and

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
letting him barrel off rivers and

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.449 
letting him barrel off rivers and
obviously<00:03:51.379> giving<00:03:51.680> him<00:03:51.769> action<00:03:52.190> on<00:03:52.310> all

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
obviously giving him action on all

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.539 
obviously giving him action on all
rivers<00:03:52.819> so<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.989> would<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.280> major

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
rivers so that would be the the major

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.210 
rivers so that would be the the major
thought<00:03:56.150> process<00:03:56.629> I'd<00:03:56.750> be<00:03:56.870> having<00:03:57.230> here<00:03:57.530> again

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
thought process I'd be having here again

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.740 
thought process I'd be having here again
sometimes<00:03:58.699> I'm<00:03:58.790> gonna<00:03:58.849> raise<00:03:59.120> sometimes<00:03:59.660> I'm

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
sometimes I'm gonna raise sometimes I'm

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.319 
sometimes I'm gonna raise sometimes I'm
gonna<00:03:59.810> call<00:04:00.199> but<00:04:00.440> if<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.889> call<00:04:01.190> then<00:04:02.060> I'm

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
gonna call but if I call then I'm

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.699 
gonna call but if I call then I'm
definitely<00:04:02.569> gonna<00:04:02.810> be<00:04:02.930> getting<00:04:03.230> sticky<00:04:03.500> I'm

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
definitely gonna be getting sticky I'm

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.099 
definitely gonna be getting sticky I'm
pretty<00:04:04.190> much<00:04:04.370> every<00:04:04.819> single<00:04:05.030> river<00:04:05.419> that<00:04:05.900> of

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
pretty much every single river that of

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.629 
pretty much every single river that of
course<00:04:06.260> being<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.799> river<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.160> I'm<00:04:07.250> also<00:04:07.400> gonna

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
course being a river that I'm also gonna

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.839 
course being a river that I'm also gonna
get<00:04:07.849> sticky<00:04:08.209> on<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:08.660> when<00:04:08.810> he<00:04:08.930> bets<00:04:09.139> for<00:04:09.349> 350

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
get sticky on so when he bets for 350

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.220 
get sticky on so when he bets for 350
definitely<00:04:10.849> gonna<00:04:10.940> be<00:04:11.120> calling<00:04:11.359> him<00:04:11.569> off<00:04:11.750> but

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
definitely gonna be calling him off but

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.259 
definitely gonna be calling him off but
unfortunately<00:04:12.919> in<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:13.040> exact<00:04:13.400> situation<00:04:13.609> he

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
unfortunately in this exact situation he

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.360 
unfortunately in this exact situation he
ends<00:04:14.419> up<00:04:14.480> waking<00:04:14.690> up<00:04:14.959> with<00:04:15.109> top<00:04:15.440> two<00:04:15.739> which<00:04:16.130> is

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
ends up waking up with top two which is

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.520 
ends up waking up with top two which is
kind<00:04:16.789> of<00:04:16.849> weird<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.269> awkward<00:04:17.359> okay<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.229> the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
kind of weird and awkward okay so the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.529 
kind of weird and awkward okay so the
fact<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:18.859> hero<00:04:19.130> lost<00:04:19.400> his<00:04:19.640> hand<00:04:19.880> does<00:04:20.329> not

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
fact that hero lost his hand does not

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.150 
fact that hero lost his hand does not
mean<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.810> he<00:04:21.169> missed<00:04:21.620> played

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
mean that he missed played

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.770 
mean that he missed played
in<00:04:22.280> my<00:04:22.490> opinion<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:23.060> think<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.570> getting

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
in my opinion I think that getting

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.810 
in my opinion I think that getting
sticky<00:04:24.200> here<00:04:24.410> at<00:04:24.530> kink<00:04:24.740> weed<00:04:24.950> is<00:04:25.100> totally<00:04:25.580> fine

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
sticky here at kink weed is totally fine

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.540 
sticky here at kink weed is totally fine
and<00:04:26.000> valid<00:04:26.450> again<00:04:26.810> there's<00:04:27.080> certainly<00:04:27.620> some

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
and valid again there's certainly some

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.820 
and valid again there's certainly some
validity<00:04:29.030> for<00:04:29.510> considering<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.110> turn<00:04:30.380> raise<00:04:30.650> or

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
validity for considering a turn raise or
