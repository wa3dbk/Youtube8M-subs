side here so that immediately tells you

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.840 
side here so that immediately tells you
that<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.230> not<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.530> great<00:00:44.860> one<00:00:45.100> cricket<00:00:45.520> bat<00:00:45.670> so

immediately be downgraded to grade two
or<00:00:49.840> grade<00:00:50.050> three<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:50.710> then<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.100> have<00:00:51.190> a

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
or grade three and then you have a

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.560 
or grade three and then you have a
slight<00:00:51.610> little<00:00:51.910> blemish<00:00:52.270> just<00:00:52.480> over<00:00:52.690> here<00:00:53.070> but

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
slight little blemish just over here but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.869 
slight little blemish just over here but
firstly<00:00:55.570> hardwood<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.170> not<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.350> bad<00:00:56.620> thing<00:00:56.920> it's

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
firstly hardwood is not a bad thing it's

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.910 
firstly hardwood is not a bad thing it's
just<00:00:58.000> they<00:00:58.329> basically<00:00:58.780> discover<00:00:59.320> or<00:00:59.859> a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
just they basically discover or a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.279 
just they basically discover or a
discoloration<00:01:00.609> that's<00:01:01.359> the<00:01:01.539> harder<00:01:01.960> part<00:01:02.230> of

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
discoloration that's the harder part of

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.380 
discoloration that's the harder part of
the<00:01:02.350> wood<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:03.489> SEP<00:01:03.760> word<00:01:03.969> which<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.270> the

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
the wood the SEP word which is the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.359 
the wood the SEP word which is the
lighter<00:01:04.600> wood<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.320> would<00:01:05.500> be<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.860> little<00:01:06.280> bit

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
lighter wood that would be a little bit

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.800 
lighter wood that would be a little bit
softer<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:06.850> that's<00:01:07.240> actually<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.600> good<00:01:07.750> thing

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
softer so that's actually a good thing

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.540 
softer so that's actually a good thing
the<00:01:08.470> nice<00:01:08.680> thing<00:01:08.890> about<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.280> amount<00:01:09.460> of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
the nice thing about the amount of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.980 
the nice thing about the amount of
grains<00:01:09.789> here<00:01:10.000> is<00:01:10.149> that<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.420> pretty<00:01:10.630> evenly

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
grains here is that that pretty evenly

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.300 
grains here is that that pretty evenly
spaced<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:11.560> what<00:01:11.740> they're<00:01:11.920> being<00:01:12.039> about

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
spaced and what they're being about

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.330 
spaced and what they're being about
eleven<00:01:13.259> it's<00:01:14.259> probably<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.770> pretty<00:01:15.130> perfect

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
eleven it's probably a pretty perfect

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.100 
eleven it's probably a pretty perfect
number<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.000> grains<00:01:16.240> if<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.509> talk<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.959> most

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
number of grains if you talk to most

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.059 
number of grains if you talk to most
back<00:01:17.410> map<00:01:17.860> makers<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:20.080> like<00:01:20.349> nice<00:01:20.679> even

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
back map makers they like nice even

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.800 
back map makers they like nice even
grains<00:01:21.369> because<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.880> allows<00:01:22.149> them<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.539> press

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
grains because it allows them to press

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.020 
grains because it allows them to press
the<00:01:23.020> back<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.490> their<00:01:24.670> exact

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
the back to to their exact

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.089 
the back to to their exact
specifications<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:25.990> eleven<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.890> good

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099 
specifications and eleven is a good

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.730 
specifications and eleven is a good
number<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:28.020> you'll<00:01:29.020> see<00:01:29.259> you'll<00:01:29.440> see<00:01:29.470> if

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
number that you'll see you'll see if

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.410 
number that you'll see you'll see if
you've<00:01:29.950> read<00:01:30.130> any<00:01:30.369> my<00:01:30.520> blogs<00:01:30.849> or<00:01:31.119> watching

you've read any my blogs or watching

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.400 
you've read any my blogs or watching
them<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.630> refused<00:01:32.220> talked<00:01:33.220> about<00:01:34.289> vibration<00:01:35.289> in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
them I refused talked about vibration in

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.979 
them I refused talked about vibration in
wood<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.429> eleven<00:01:37.000> is<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.149> good<00:01:37.420> number<00:01:37.660> to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:37.989 
wood and and eleven is a good number to

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.589 
wood and and eleven is a good number to
keep<00:01:38.470> your<00:01:38.679> wood<00:01:38.860> nice<00:01:39.069> and<00:01:39.340> stuff<00:01:39.700> the

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599 
keep your wood nice and stuff the

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.320 
keep your wood nice and stuff the
benefit<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.050> wood<00:01:41.619> being<00:01:41.860> stuff<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.459> that<00:01:43.119> the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
benefit of wood being stuff is that the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.930 
benefit of wood being stuff is that the
back<00:01:43.539> doesn't<00:01:43.869> lose<00:01:44.649> any<00:01:44.979> power<00:01:45.429> of<00:01:45.729> food

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
back doesn't lose any power of food

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.300 
back doesn't lose any power of food
vibration<00:01:46.810> or<00:01:46.989> as<00:01:47.500> much<00:01:47.830> as<00:01:48.069> for<00:01:48.250> example

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
vibration or as much as for example

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.630 
vibration or as much as for example
about<00:01:48.849> with<00:01:49.000> four<00:01:49.209> or<00:01:49.390> five<00:01:49.660> grains<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.860> eleven

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
about with four or five grains so eleven

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.550 
about with four or five grains so eleven
is<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.759> good<00:01:51.910> amount<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.209> our<00:01:52.360> brains<00:01:53.080> which

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
is a good amount of our brains which

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.630 
is a good amount of our brains which
basically<00:01:54.009> means<00:01:54.280> you're<00:01:54.459> gonna<00:01:54.550> have

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
basically means you're gonna have

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.300 
basically means you're gonna have
maximum<00:01:55.420> transfer<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:56.080> power<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.709> the<00:01:57.099> ball

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
maximum transfer of power to the ball

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.940 
maximum transfer of power to the ball
meaning<00:01:57.849> you're<00:01:58.030> gonna<00:01:58.119> hit<00:01:58.450> bigger<00:01:58.660> sixes<00:01:59.110> it

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
meaning you're gonna hit bigger sixes it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.400 
meaning you're gonna hit bigger sixes it
could<00:02:00.640> scuse<00:02:00.910> me<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:01.869> that's<00:02:01.989> a<00:02:02.140> little<00:02:02.229> bit

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
could scuse me so that's a little bit

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.710 
could scuse me so that's a little bit
about<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:03.000> eleven<00:02:04.000> grains<00:02:04.209> is<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.450> great

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
about that eleven grains is a great

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.169 
about that eleven grains is a great
