00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.470 
and on simple of here you got you can
put<00:04:26.980> in<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:29.250> node<00:04:30.250> controller<00:04:30.760> for<00:04:31.270> this

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
put in a a node controller for this

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.990 
put in a a node controller for this
series<00:04:32.260> they<00:04:32.530> had<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> title<00:04:33.310> maker<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.700> think

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
series they had a title maker I think

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.660 
series they had a title maker I think
and<00:04:34.180> then<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.170> put<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> mic<00:04:35.650> or<00:04:35.920> you<00:04:36.310> can<00:04:36.460> plug

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
and then you put a mic or you can plug

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.760 
and then you put a mic or you can plug
in<00:04:36.790> headphones<00:04:36.940> as<00:04:37.690> well<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.080> you<00:04:38.170> get<00:04:38.290> patrol

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
in headphones as well and you get patrol

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.760 
in headphones as well and you get patrol
right<00:04:38.980> there<00:04:39.160> volume<00:04:39.520> control<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:39.940> that

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
right there volume control for that

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.110 
right there volume control for that
turning<00:04:41.770> around<00:04:41.860> here<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.830> have<00:04:45.130> your

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
turning around here you have your

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.090 
turning around here you have your
different<00:04:46.270> plugins<00:04:46.780> try<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.620> get<00:04:47.800> this<00:04:47.890> up<00:04:48.070> to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
different plugins try to get this up to

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.540 
different plugins try to get this up to
the<00:04:48.280> camera<00:04:48.310> here<00:04:49.650> give<00:04:50.650> them<00:04:50.800> plugins<00:04:51.310> here

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
the camera here give them plugins here

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.910 
the camera here give them plugins here
you<00:04:51.700> have<00:04:51.850> your<00:04:52.150> source<00:04:52.900> one<00:04:53.170> your<00:04:53.380> source<00:04:53.620> two

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
you have your source one your source two

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.700 
you have your source one your source two
and<00:04:54.250> then<00:04:54.940> extra<00:04:55.390> camera<00:04:55.750> which<00:04:56.080> I'm<00:04:56.290> not<00:04:56.530> sure

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
and then extra camera which I'm not sure

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.350 
and then extra camera which I'm not sure
where<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.100> controller<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.610> up<00:04:57.760> here<00:04:58.000> for<00:04:58.180> that

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
where the controller is up here for that

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.900 
where the controller is up here for that
then<00:04:59.260> you<00:04:59.470> get<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.740> out<00:04:59.890> for<00:05:00.160> that<00:05:00.670> one

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
then you get the out for that one

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.220 
then you get the out for that one
because<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.180> always<00:05:01.270> have<00:05:01.480> it<00:05:01.600> in<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.870> out<00:05:01.990> so
