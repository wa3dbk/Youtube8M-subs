00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.520
 hello all my name martÃ­n and today you 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.630
 I will teach how to download and install a 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.410
 program so you can tune 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 raised 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.940
 this is the link that I will leave below the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.350
 idea so that you can access and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.330
 download it 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.410
 Well, we're just going here 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.410
 safe download 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.850
 now it will open a box to download the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.380
 file is this 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.380
 add in saving files 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 we open 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.940
 and executors 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.940
 or we put that yes 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.680
 now it will begin to load the installation 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.800
 I notice that in windows seven it takes a 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:03.010
 little in loading it does not because maybe 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.550
 in windows xp be faster of all 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.090
 modes the installer execution that 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.649
 it was operating just as fast 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.570
 remember that it is a program that 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.909
 it works through a microphone 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.510
 it could be the notebook that I had 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.510
 Incorporated 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.780
 to the webcam 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.070
 the webcam usually bring a microphone 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.290
 incorporated also 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.870
 or else an external microphone that can 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.870
 you plug into your computers 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.960
 well this is the installation box 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.760
 we put the following we put that if 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.870
 following 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.760
 next and next 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.850
 as you will see is a program that exists 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.980
 pretty fast since it weighs nothing 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.270
 when we open it 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:03.140
 good to me takes my voice as well as 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.660
 can see the volume bar if a 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.570
 you are not going to take several 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.729
 options 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.370
 ademais 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.040
 and here 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.090
 choose the input of your microphone in this 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.090
 If webcam 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.460
 we accept good 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.210
 and I happened to comment that the es would be the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.660
 sixth string the fifth to the one of the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.200
 fourth lage the third the b the second and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.570
 the e 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.600
 the first rope this so sincere 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.970
 american why are these the lyrics 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.290
 is the standard tuning if they want 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.850
 they have a tuning is if they want 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.120
 try out 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.090
 well here we started to fine tune we started 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.629
 by the sixth 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.629
 do not 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.730
 [Music] 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.750
 then the 5th 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.750
 [Music] 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.939
 the fourth 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.750
 the third 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.260
 [Music] 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.260
 second 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.960
 and first 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.960
 [Music] 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.420
 it is also a program that one day that 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.580
 play chords for example played sun 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.580
 he recognizes them the chord with 2 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.480
 [Music] 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.150
 all an American cipher wisely 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.730
 Well that's all I hope you were done 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.590
 they ask me anything 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.590
