00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
most likely be afraid of you for a very

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
most likely be afraid of you for a very
long<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:33.299> has<00:01:33.509> happened<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> me

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
long time and this has happened to me

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.359 
long time and this has happened to me
before<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.930> okay<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.560> parakeets<00:01:38.189> are

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
before so okay if your parakeets are

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.630 
before so okay if your parakeets are
very<00:01:38.820> um<00:01:39.570> um<00:01:41.180> um<00:01:42.180> used<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.310> your

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
very um um um used to you if if your

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.300 
very um um um used to you if if your
parakeets<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:47.009> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
parakeets are you see you then then you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.920 
parakeets are you see you then then you
can<00:01:47.670> um<00:01:48.710> then<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.520> probably<00:01:50.880> let<00:01:51.750> them

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
can um then you can probably let them

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.319 
can um then you can probably let them
out<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.110> their<00:01:52.350> cage<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> let<00:01:53.549> my<00:01:53.729> birds<00:01:54.090> out
