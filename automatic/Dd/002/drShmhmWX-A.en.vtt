00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the same prices on short one and you get

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.020 
the same prices on short one and you get
more<00:02:51.810> hot<00:02:52.049> glue<00:02:52.379> with<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.069> prefer<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.909> get

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
more hot glue with it so I prefer to get

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.550 
more hot glue with it so I prefer to get
the<00:02:54.150> long<00:02:54.359> ones<00:02:54.629> but<00:02:54.750> if<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.139> the<00:02:55.290> short

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the long ones but if you like the short

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.110 
the long ones but if you like the short
ones<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.919> can<00:02:56.069> just<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.519> long<00:02:56.700> ones<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
ones you can just get the long ones and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.679 
ones you can just get the long ones and
then<00:02:57.209> cut<00:02:57.450> them<00:02:57.540> up<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.989> course<00:02:59.299> which<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.480> think

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
then cut them up of course which I think

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:13.620
