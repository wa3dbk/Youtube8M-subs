00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
like you usually would for leopard slots

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.010 
like you usually would for leopard slots
and<00:00:43.010> then<00:00:43.699> you're<00:00:43.850> going<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.059> do<00:00:44.180> that<00:00:44.420> for<00:00:44.750> all

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
and then you're going to do that for all

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:58.920 
and then you're going to do that for all
your<00:00:45.199> nails<00:00:45.379> except<00:00:45.920> your<00:00:46.070> ring<00:00:46.220> finger

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.060 

normally<00:00:59.930> this<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.320> why<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:00.500> would<00:01:00.710> throw<00:01:00.890> an

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
normally this is why you would throw an

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.210 
normally this is why you would throw an
outline<00:01:01.580> with<00:01:02.360> black<00:01:02.870> but<00:01:03.380> here<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.710> realized

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
outline with black but here I realized

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.970 
outline with black but here I realized
that<00:01:04.370> I<00:01:04.430> drew<00:01:04.790> my<00:01:05.120> hearts<00:01:05.510> too<00:01:05.780> small<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:06.950> I

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
that I drew my hearts too small so I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.100 
that I drew my hearts too small so I
take<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.610> paint<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.120> I<00:01:08.360> start<00:01:08.720> making<00:01:08.840> the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
take the paint and I start making the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.160 
take the paint and I start making the
hearts<00:01:09.380> bigger<00:01:09.730> so<00:01:10.730> you<00:01:11.180> sure<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:11.960> would<00:01:12.080> you

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
hearts bigger so you sure that would you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.170 
hearts bigger so you sure that would you
make<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.500> hard<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.920> make<00:01:13.070> him<00:01:13.220> big<00:01:13.640> enough<00:01:13.910> so

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
make the hard to make him big enough so

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.670 
make the hard to make him big enough so
that<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:14.450> outline<00:01:15.110> them<00:01:15.380> without

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
that you can outline them without

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.430 
that you can outline them without
covering<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.370> paint<00:01:16.640> too<00:01:16.880> much<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.020> here<00:01:18.260> I'm

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
covering the paint too much so here I'm

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.500
