00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.750
 wet lamb juice during 15 days in 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.130
 school and one day we found 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.869
 after when we go to school we have them 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.610
 general accounts have made tp of 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.040

 in a restaurant when we work

 really what we are in active life 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.270
 what matters to us is 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.190
 really that the students are at the heart 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.890
 of training and that he can of course 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.840
 practice and not just look at us 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.710
 are next to them but in the end what 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.690
 the wish is that students 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.580
 be autonomous and lead full at 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.410

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.170
 that gelatin can leave for 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.890
 start you need the student 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.050
 the apprentice understand that he is 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.270
 employed in a house in a 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.070
 restaurant that is not there simply 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.119
 in training just to make a visit 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.650
 touristic 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.480
 it's really a part of the brigade 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.310
 I have friends in another school 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.770

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.760
 alternation are technology us that 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.530
 means they do internships a 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.120
 once every three months when we talk 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.680
 and we see that normally they have my 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.380
 experience that show us how one 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.460
 will be able to dismount the saddles so 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.100

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.720
 parchment has been removed 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.790

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.310
 pride to be must already in one of 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.900
 greatest schools of paris we have

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.680
 French cuisine that unfold to 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.869
 the school we have in their entourage 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.119

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.250

 you see the coloring we will do in 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.470
 kind of rage all day a focus 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.810
 must be reactive 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.890
 the leaders are here too to try to 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.390
 do not get stressed because 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.920
 it's still not easy to manage your 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.180
 stress 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.160
 what we are looking for in a young person 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.200
 apprentice it is both the qualities 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.350
 but I would say more is the little 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.790
 spark that has in the eye landry we're going 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.040
 simply roll but we will not 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.549
 to make too much thickness we will do in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.010
 so that it does not cover just about 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.690
 5 6 cm this profile is very pedagogue 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.950
 sauna a lesser question to help us 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.269
 if we want to make revisions on 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.100
 something he's going to do them some classes 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.540
 we feel they have the experience and who 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.760
 are not there just to make short of 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.060
 kids and tell them bah voila you do that 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.980

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.450
 we love it when we wear it under and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.850
 we see our alumni arrive 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.079
 and who have experience abroad 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.450

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.530
