David<00:00:07.700> what<00:00:08.700> are<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.849> going<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.030> be<00:00:09.090> doing<00:00:09.120> next

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
David what are we going to be doing next

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.450 
David what are we going to be doing next
Jason<00:00:10.440> now<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.070> complete<00:00:11.429> a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
Jason now we're going to complete a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.640 
Jason now we're going to complete a
short<00:00:11.550> level<00:00:12.030> run<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.480> what's<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.559> all

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
short level run and what's that all

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.519 
short level run and what's that all
about<00:00:14.420> normally<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> short<00:00:16.020> level<00:00:16.379> run

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
about normally we do a short level run

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.310 
about normally we do a short level run
when<00:00:16.710> we<00:00:16.800> want<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> reduced<00:00:17.940> levels<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.660> some

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
when we want the reduced levels of some

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.090 
when we want the reduced levels of some
points<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.890> are<00:00:20.010> too<00:00:20.130> far<00:00:20.160> apart<00:00:20.990> to<00:00:22.070> get<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
points that are too far apart to get a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.590 
points that are too far apart to get a
reading<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.580> without<00:00:23.760> changing<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
reading on without changing the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
reading on without changing the
instrument<00:00:25.109> level<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.310> exercise

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
instrument level so in this exercise

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.519 
instrument level so in this exercise
we're<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.390> starting<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> white

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
we're going to be starting at the white

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
we're going to be starting at the white
peg<00:00:28.859> behind<00:00:29.429> us<00:00:29.640> which<00:00:30.240> we're<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> say

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
peg behind us which we're going to say

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.889 
peg behind us which we're going to say
is<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.349> arbitrary<00:00:31.740> benchmark<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.579> rl10<00:00:33.420> point

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
is an arbitrary benchmark of rl10 point

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.069 
is an arbitrary benchmark of rl10 point
ooo<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.829> we're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> get<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.210> RL<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.870> this

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
ooo and we're going to get an RL on this

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.040 
ooo and we're going to get an RL on this
corner<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> sleepers<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.719> and<00:00:39.719> then

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
corner of the sleepers here and then

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.619 
corner of the sleepers here and then
move<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.790> communication<00:00:41.790> pit<00:00:42.059> behind<00:00:42.450> me

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
move to the communication pit behind me

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.110 
move to the communication pit behind me
then<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> communication<00:00:44.610> pit<00:00:44.879> we'll

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
then from the communication pit we'll

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.569 
then from the communication pit we'll
move<00:00:45.270> back<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> white<00:00:46.050> peg<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:47.070> close<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
move back to the white peg to close the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
move back to the white peg to close the
level<00:00:47.850> run<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> need<00:00:49.500> some

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
level run and are you going to need some

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.220 
level run and are you going to need some
help<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.969> mean<00:00:51.780> Ann<00:00:51.930> let's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
help with this I will I mean Ann let's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.889 
help with this I will I mean Ann let's
do<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.969> okay<00:00:53.969> we're<00:00:54.180> starting<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.660> short

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
do it okay we're starting our short

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
do it okay we're starting our short
level<00:00:55.260> run<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.620> Jason<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.250> arbitrary

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
level run with Jason on the arbitrary

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119 
level run with Jason on the arbitrary
benchmark<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:57.899> taking<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> back<00:00:58.620> sight<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
benchmark and I'm taking a back sight to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:17.630 
benchmark and I'm taking a back sight to
that<00:00:59.280> point

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 

we're<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.150> taking<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.690> foresight<00:01:19.260> to<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
we're now taking a foresight to the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:02:02.039 
we're now taking a foresight to the
corner<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.160> sleepers

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.440 

so<00:02:02.950> Dave<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.640> you've<00:02:03.759> shown<00:02:04.000> us<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
so Dave now that you've shown us the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.209 
so Dave now that you've shown us the
short<00:02:04.840> level<00:02:05.200> run<00:02:05.409> what<00:02:05.979> have<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.130> got

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
short level run what have you got

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.059 
short level run what have you got
planned<00:02:06.490> next<00:02:06.750> Jason<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.990> thought<00:02:08.170> we'd<00:02:08.440> take

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
planned next Jason I thought we'd take

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.859 
planned next Jason I thought we'd take
some<00:02:09.280> spot<00:02:09.550> levels<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.119> allow<00:02:10.239> us<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.720> produce

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
some spot levels to allow us to produce

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.690 
some spot levels to allow us to produce
a<00:02:11.200> contour<00:02:11.560> plan<00:02:11.860> excellent<00:02:12.819> let's<00:02:13.390> see<00:02:13.510> that
