00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
and you can experiment by using

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.600 
and you can experiment by using
different<00:00:05.819> tools<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:07.200> ballpoint<00:00:07.950> pen<00:00:08.220> makes

different tools this ballpoint pen makes

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.839 
different tools this ballpoint pen makes
a<00:00:08.700> larger<00:00:09.059> deeper<00:00:09.389> dots<00:00:10.490> and<00:00:11.490> how<00:00:11.639> about

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
a larger deeper dots and how about

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.789 
a larger deeper dots and how about
pressing<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.480> lolly<00:00:12.750> stick<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.380> make<00:00:13.530> short

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
pressing in a lolly stick to make short

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.240 
pressing in a lolly stick to make short
lines<00:00:17.180> or<00:00:18.180> even<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.660> cocktail<00:00:19.289> stick<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.980> tiny

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
lines or even a cocktail stick for tiny

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.439 
lines or even a cocktail stick for tiny
dots

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.929 

you<00:00:27.449> could<00:00:27.570> even<00:00:27.840> open<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.560> paperclip<00:00:29.340> for

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you could even open out a paperclip for

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.569 
you could even open out a paperclip for
curvy<00:00:30.330> bits<00:00:33.260> just<00:00:34.260> press<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> same

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
curvy bits just press it in in the same

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.049 
curvy bits just press it in in the same
way<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.440> great<00:00:40.890> fun<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.910> can

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
way this is great fun to do and you can

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.509 
way this is great fun to do and you can
experiment<00:00:42.900> using<00:00:43.530> lots<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.010> different

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
experiment using lots of different

experiment using lots of different
things<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.000> press<00:00:45.269> into<00:00:45.629> your<00:00:45.660> clay<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.559> make

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
things to press into your clay and make

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:54.079 
things to press into your clay and make
different<00:00:46.949> patterns<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:52.550> when<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.670> finish

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
different patterns and when you finish

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.450 
different patterns and when you finish
your<00:00:54.269> design<00:00:54.390> leave<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> overnight<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.280> dry

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
your design leave it overnight to dry

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
your design leave it overnight to dry
then<00:00:57.449> it'll<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.780> rock<00:00:57.960> solid<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.559> ready<00:00:58.769> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
then it'll be rock solid and ready to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.670 
then it'll be rock solid and ready to
paint<00:00:59.309> now<00:00:59.610> to<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.839> design<00:01:01.110> stand<00:01:01.500> out

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
paint now to make the design stand out

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.890 
paint now to make the design stand out
take<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> small<00:01:02.699> brush<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.150> paint<00:01:03.479> a<00:01:03.570> dark

color<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> holes<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.250> lines<00:01:06.979> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
color in all the holes and lines and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
color in all the holes and lines and
when<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> dried<00:01:08.850> paint<00:01:09.420> over<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> whole

brush<00:01:15.150> quite<00:01:15.540> dry<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.799> fill<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
brush quite dry so you don't fill in the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.570 
brush quite dry so you don't fill in the
design<00:01:17.549> too<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:19.010> use<00:01:20.010> lots<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> different

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
design too much use lots of different

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.109 
design too much use lots of different
bright<00:01:21.030> colors<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.670> when<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.850> finish

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
bright colors and when you finish

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
bright colors and when you finish
painting<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.960> dry<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.830> have

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
painting it and it's dry you have

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
painting it and it's dry you have
something<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.670> looks<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.750> I've

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
something that looks like this and I've

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
something that looks like this and I've
even<00:01:28.890> given<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.340> coat<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.759> PVA<00:01:30.210> glue

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
even given this a coat of PVA glue

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.110 
even given this a coat of PVA glue
because<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.560> dries<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:32.190> goes<00:01:32.430> clear<00:01:32.910> and

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
because when it dries it goes clear and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.320 
because when it dries it goes clear and
shiny<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.050> toughen<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> clay<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.250> too<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.090> I

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
shiny and toughen the clay up too and I

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.760 
shiny and toughen the clay up too and I
think<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:36.660> look<00:01:36.840> great<00:01:36.870> as<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.470> piece<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
think they look great as a piece of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.380 
think they look great as a piece of
sculpture<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.670> place<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.850> somewhere<00:01:39.150> around

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
sculpture just place it somewhere around

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
sculpture just place it somewhere around
the<00:01:39.660> house<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.260> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.620> do<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.830> many<00:01:40.980> as<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the house and you can do as many as you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.250 
the house and you can do as many as you
like<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:42.060> experiment<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.930> different

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
like just experiment with different

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.330 
like just experiment with different
patterns<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.390> different<00:01:45.390> colors<00:01:46.230> and<00:01:46.470> they

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
patterns and different colors and they

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.720 
patterns and different colors and they
all<00:01:47.550> look<00:01:47.940> absolutely<00:01:48.780> brilliant<00:01:49.670> try<00:01:50.670> it
