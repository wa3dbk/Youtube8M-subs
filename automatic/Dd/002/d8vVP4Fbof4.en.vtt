00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and a bunch of the other guys in the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.810 
and a bunch of the other guys in the
office<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> workflow<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
office what is the workflow that you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.260 
office what is the workflow that you
work<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> hood<00:01:03.719> specifically

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.160 

so<00:01:08.140> when<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.770> start<00:01:09.579> a<00:01:09.850> project<00:01:10.299> like<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.750> I

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
so when I start a project like this I

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.399 
so when I start a project like this I
think<00:01:11.439> it's<00:01:11.560> really<00:01:11.950> important<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:13.090> become

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
think it's really important to to become

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.380 
think it's really important to to become
quite<00:01:14.409> familiar<00:01:14.590> with<00:01:14.950> whatever<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.149> that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
quite familiar with whatever it is that

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.300 
quite familiar with whatever it is that
you're<00:01:16.540> designing<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:17.350> interface<00:01:17.799> graphics

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
you're designing the interface graphics

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.279 
you're designing the interface graphics
for<00:01:18.580> for<00:01:19.090> example<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.780> Hornet

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
for for example the Hornet

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.060 
for for example the Hornet
you<00:01:20.649> know<00:01:20.799> I'm<00:01:21.009> creating<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.320> HUD<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.649> all

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
you know I'm creating the HUD and all

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.029 
you know I'm creating the HUD and all
the<00:01:24.430> interface<00:01:25.119> sort<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.689> design<00:01:26.170> elements

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
the interface sort of design elements

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.450 
the interface sort of design elements
for<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.299> I<00:01:28.539> believe<00:01:28.960> that<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:30.009> know<00:01:30.100> it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
for it and I believe that you know it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.969 
for it and I believe that you know it
should<00:01:30.850> be<00:01:30.960> cohesive<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.320> feel<00:01:32.619> like<00:01:32.799> it's

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
should be cohesive and feel like it's

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.190 
should be cohesive and feel like it's
part<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.580> same<00:01:33.789> system<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.899> know<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
part of the same system you know the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.980 
part of the same system you know the
design<00:01:35.619> aesthetic<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.880> ship<00:01:37.149> should<00:01:37.780> be

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
design aesthetic of the ship should be

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.880 
design aesthetic of the ship should be
reflected<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.520> UI<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:40.590> started<00:01:41.590> out<00:01:41.709> by

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
reflected in the UI I started out by

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.800 
reflected in the UI I started out by
just<00:01:42.159> sort<00:01:42.429> of<00:01:42.490> flying<00:01:43.060> around<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.569> ship

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
just sort of flying around the ship

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.649 
just sort of flying around the ship
getting<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.619> sense<00:01:44.860> for<00:01:45.159> some<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.940> design

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
getting a sense for some of the design

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.840 
getting a sense for some of the design
work<00:01:46.959> and<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.979> line<00:01:48.250> work<00:01:48.580> that's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
work and the the line work that's

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.210 
work and the the line work that's
already<00:01:49.149> been<00:01:49.600> built<00:01:49.869> into<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.319> ship<00:01:50.649> you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
already been built into the ship you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.889 
already been built into the ship you
know<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:51.580> taking<00:01:51.789> notes<00:01:52.060> from<00:01:52.420> some<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
know just taking notes from some of the

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.859 
know just taking notes from some of the
forms<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.979> shapes<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.970> have<00:01:55.179> already<00:01:55.479> been

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
forms and shapes that have already been

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.039 
forms and shapes that have already been
created<00:01:56.110> before<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.270> particular<00:01:58.270> asset

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
created before this particular asset

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.320 
created before this particular asset
from<00:01:59.920> there<00:02:00.159> I'll<00:02:00.429> just<00:02:00.459> do<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.090> lot<00:02:01.270> of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
from there I'll just do a lot of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.999 
from there I'll just do a lot of
sketches<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.049> I'll<00:02:02.860> be<00:02:03.100> very<00:02:03.850> loose<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.509> very

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
sketches and I'll be very loose and very

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.620 
sketches and I'll be very loose and very
fast-paced<00:02:06.009> with<00:02:06.670> sort<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.090> getting<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.450> lot<00:02:07.569> of

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
fast-paced with sort of getting a lot of

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.499 
fast-paced with sort of getting a lot of
ideas<00:02:08.170> out<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.709> paper<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:10.000> then<00:02:10.119> I'll<00:02:10.299> just

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
ideas out on paper and then I'll just

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.050 
ideas out on paper and then I'll just
like<00:02:10.840> loosely<00:02:11.440> either<00:02:11.859> scan<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.670> those

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
like loosely either scan in those

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.270 
like loosely either scan in those
sketches<00:02:13.660> from<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.109> book<00:02:14.320> or<00:02:14.560> I'll<00:02:14.799> just<00:02:15.040> come

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
sketches from the book or I'll just come

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.640 
sketches from the book or I'll just come
in<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.609> and<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.060> draw<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:17.019> know<00:02:17.140> freehand

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
in here and and draw you know freehand

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.550 
in here and and draw you know freehand
on<00:02:17.799> top<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.579> plate<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.109> vectorize<00:02:20.109> it<00:02:20.380> and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
on top of the plate and vectorize it and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.979 
on top of the plate and vectorize it and
make<00:02:20.709> everything<00:02:21.010> clean<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.489> nice<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.510> work

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
make everything clean and nice and work

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.440 
make everything clean and nice and work
with<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.530> grid<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.489> all<00:02:24.640> my<00:02:24.820> typeface

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
with a grid and do all my typeface

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.650 
with a grid and do all my typeface
exploration<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.530> Illustrator<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.660> solidify

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
exploration in Illustrator and solidify

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.289 
exploration in Illustrator and solidify
all<00:02:28.989> those<00:02:29.290> ideas<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.769> were<00:02:30.190> executed<00:02:30.820> in

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
all those ideas that were executed in

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.770 
all those ideas that were executed in
the<00:02:31.690> sketching<00:02:32.170> process<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:34.480> different

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the sketching process it's different

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.170 
the sketching process it's different
just<00:02:34.989> because<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.500> film<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.459> know<00:02:36.579> all<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.000> UI

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
just because in film you know all the UI

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.630 
just because in film you know all the UI
and<00:02:37.569> stuff<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.230> all<00:02:38.440> just<00:02:38.709> fake<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.489> get

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and stuff it's all just fake and we get

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.240 
and stuff it's all just fake and we get
to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.130 
to
you<00:02:40.580> know<00:02:40.700> make<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:40.970> up<00:02:41.180> as<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.450> go<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
you know make it up as you go but in the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.410 
you know make it up as you go but in the
game<00:02:42.350> environment<00:02:42.680> all<00:02:43.400> these<00:02:43.820> things<00:02:44.120> have

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
game environment all these things have

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.000 
game environment all these things have
to<00:02:44.570> have<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> purpose<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.410> they<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.860> have

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
to have a purpose and they have to have

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.970 
to have a purpose and they have to have
meaning<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.550> they<00:02:46.700> have<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.060> sort<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.980> you

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
meaning and they have to sort of you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.920 
meaning and they have to sort of you
know<00:02:49.070> function<00:02:49.700> as<00:02:49.910> an<00:02:50.270> aid<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.470> player<00:02:52.930> so

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
know function as an aid to the player so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.740 
know function as an aid to the player so
I<00:02:53.960> worked<00:02:54.410> on<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.490> design<00:02:55.910> for<00:02:56.270> about<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.540> week

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
I worked on the design for about a week

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.540 
I worked on the design for about a week
and<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.959> half<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.650> worked<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.490> the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
and a half and then worked on the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.740 
and a half and then worked on the
animation<00:02:59.510> for<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.350> few<00:03:00.860> days<00:03:01.480> that's<00:03:02.480> gonna

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
animation for a few days that's gonna

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.390 
animation for a few days that's gonna
brought<00:03:03.050> us<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> where<00:03:03.440> we're<00:03:03.620> at<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.220> there's

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
brought us to where we're at but there's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.760 
brought us to where we're at but there's
also<00:03:04.610> been<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.880> lot<00:03:05.120> that's<00:03:05.360> kind<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.660> gone<00:03:05.930> into

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
also been a lot that's kind of gone into

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.500 
also been a lot that's kind of gone into
it<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.030> point<00:03:08.240> for<00:03:08.450> example

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
it just to get to this point for example

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.560 
it just to get to this point for example
if<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.500> see<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:09.770> reticle<00:03:10.310> it's<00:03:10.910> an<00:03:11.090> actual

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
if you see this reticle it's an actual

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.250 
if you see this reticle it's an actual
3d<00:03:12.020> object<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:13.940> taking<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.840> vector

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
3d object and so taking that vector

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.490 
3d object and so taking that vector
design<00:03:15.800> that<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.160> saw<00:03:16.430> over<00:03:16.940> here<00:03:17.780> knowing

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
design that you saw over here knowing

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.010 
design that you saw over here knowing
that<00:03:18.730> we<00:03:19.730> want<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.209> fly<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.989> be

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
that we want it to fly in and be

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.810 
that we want it to fly in and be
three-dimensional<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.190> then<00:03:22.280> eventually

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
three-dimensional and then eventually

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.580 
three-dimensional and then eventually
end<00:03:23.030> up<00:03:23.270> looking<00:03:23.900> like<00:03:23.930> this

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
end up looking like this

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.550 
end up looking like this
taking<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.459> design<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.630> created<00:03:26.720> that

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
taking that design that I created that

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.040 
taking that design that I created that
2d<00:03:27.980> vector<00:03:28.760> art<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.300> Illustrator

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
2d vector art in Illustrator

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.270 
2d vector art in Illustrator
I<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:31.430> then<00:03:31.550> bring<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:32.000> into<00:03:32.739> cinema<00:03:33.739> 4d<00:03:34.130> and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
I can then bring it into cinema 4d and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.970 
I can then bring it into cinema 4d and
and<00:03:34.790> extrude<00:03:35.630> all<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.989> pieces<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.650> place

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
and extrude all the pieces and place

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.160 
and extrude all the pieces and place
them<00:03:37.010> in<00:03:37.340> their<00:03:37.459> own<00:03:37.580> depth<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.300> animate<00:03:38.989> them

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
them in their own depth and animate them

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.890 
them in their own depth and animate them
accordingly<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:41.270> then<00:03:41.450> I'll<00:03:41.540> be<00:03:41.660> able<00:03:41.690> to

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
accordingly and and then I'll be able to

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.500 
accordingly and and then I'll be able to
export<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.470> out<00:03:42.680> for<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.700> developers<00:03:44.269> to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
export that out for the developers to

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.199 
export that out for the developers to
work<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.200> into<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.500> game<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.430> what<00:03:46.910> Johnny's

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
work it into the game so what Johnny's

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.090 
work it into the game so what Johnny's
focus<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.720> in<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:48.049> whole<00:03:48.230> workflow<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.920> to

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
focus is in this whole workflow is to

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.430 
focus is in this whole workflow is to
come<00:03:49.280> up<00:03:49.370> with<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.640> high-level<00:03:50.209> visual<00:03:50.900> concept

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
come up with a high-level visual concept

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.490 
come up with a high-level visual concept
of<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:52.040> HUD<00:03:52.220> which<00:03:52.820> includes<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:54.049> animation

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
of the HUD which includes the animation

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.449 
of the HUD which includes the animation
of<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.650> boot<00:03:54.830> up<00:03:54.950> sequence<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.750> also<00:03:57.459> sorta

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
of the boot up sequence and also sorta

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.220 
of the boot up sequence and also sorta
like<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.580> damaged<00:03:59.000> states<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.660> how<00:03:59.989> that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
like the damaged states and how that

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.030 
like the damaged states and how that
sort<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.650> animates<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.810> what<00:04:02.810> my<00:04:02.959> focus<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.650> in

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
sort of animates and what my focus is in

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.400 
sort of animates and what my focus is in
this<00:04:04.400> workflow<00:04:04.580> is<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.209> take<00:04:05.570> that<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.350> then

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
this workflow is to take that and then

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.460 
this workflow is to take that and then
animate<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.540> gets<00:04:09.049> translated

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
animate it so that it gets translated

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.140 
animate it so that it gets translated
into<00:04:09.650> an<00:04:09.920> in-game<00:04:10.160> asset<00:04:10.579> which<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.880> can<00:04:11.030> then

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
into an in-game asset which I can then

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.060 
into an in-game asset which I can then
hand<00:04:11.420> over<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.870> Brandon<00:04:12.350> they<00:04:12.650> enhance<00:04:12.769> that

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
hand over to Brandon they enhance that

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.800 
hand over to Brandon they enhance that
flash<00:04:13.310> file<00:04:13.579> off<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.910> me<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.390> plug<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.690> into

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
flash file off to me and I plug it into

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.650 
flash file off to me and I plug it into
the<00:04:15.019> engine<00:04:15.380> and<00:04:15.530> make<00:04:15.680> sure<00:04:15.829> that<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.660> C++

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
the engine and make sure that the C++

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.750 
the engine and make sure that the C++
code<00:04:17.690> is<00:04:18.049> interfacing<00:04:18.530> with<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.950> properly<00:04:19.310> so

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
code is interfacing with it properly so

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.130 
code is interfacing with it properly so
the<00:04:19.880> cool<00:04:20.060> thing<00:04:20.299> about<00:04:20.329> how<00:04:20.840> we're

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
the cool thing about how we're

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.170 
the cool thing about how we're
developing<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.620> game<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:23.060> we're

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
developing this game is that we're

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.570 
developing this game is that we're
releasing<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.690> piece<00:04:23.900> by<00:04:23.930> piece<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.680> so<00:04:25.370> this

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
releasing it piece by piece and so this

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.210 
releasing it piece by piece and so this
for<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:25.850> first<00:04:26.090> dogfighting<00:04:26.510> module<00:04:27.220> the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
for this first dogfighting module the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.070 
for this first dogfighting module the
work<00:04:28.640> that<00:04:28.850> we're<00:04:28.970> doing<00:04:29.000> on<00:04:29.479> this<00:04:29.630> HUD<00:04:29.870> will

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
work that we're doing on this HUD will

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.870 
work that we're doing on this HUD will
be<00:04:30.169> able<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.380> put<00:04:30.590> put<00:04:30.890> it<00:04:31.010> out<00:04:31.130> there<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.850> the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
be able to put put it out there to the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.690 
be able to put put it out there to the
players<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.479> get<00:04:33.290> feedback<00:04:33.650> on<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:34.010> what

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
players and get feedback on that what

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.180 
players and get feedback on that what
things<00:04:34.970> could<00:04:35.390> be<00:04:35.540> improved<00:04:35.870> what<00:04:36.770> sections

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
things could be improved what sections

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.430 
things could be improved what sections
of<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.520> HUD<00:04:37.669> are<00:04:37.970> readable<00:04:38.720> or<00:04:38.840> not<00:04:39.020> readable

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
of the HUD are readable or not readable

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.840 
of the HUD are readable or not readable
and<00:04:39.590> then<00:04:40.040> we'll<00:04:40.220> be<00:04:40.310> able<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.460> fold<00:04:40.760> that

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
and then we'll be able to fold that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.240 
and then we'll be able to fold that
feedback<00:04:41.210> into<00:04:41.600> future<00:04:42.110> iterations<00:04:42.290> of<00:04:43.040> the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
feedback into future iterations of the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.040 
feedback into future iterations of the
HUD<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.580> different<00:04:44.030> ships<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:44.510> even<00:04:44.720> the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
HUD on different ships and even the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.219 
HUD on different ships and even the
anvil<00:04:45.620> HUD<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.340> star<00:04:46.610> citizen<00:04:47.090> there's<00:04:48.020> not<00:04:48.200> a

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
anvil HUD and star citizen there's not a

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.780 
anvil HUD and star citizen there's not a
lot<00:04:48.440> of<00:04:48.470> abstraction<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.400> how

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
lot of abstraction in how

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.030 
lot of abstraction in how
the<00:04:49.970> ship's<00:04:50.270> function<00:04:50.690> everything<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.650> real

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
the ship's function everything is a real

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.620 
the ship's function everything is a real
part<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:52.520> actually<00:04:52.670> exists<00:04:53.240> in<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.450> system

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
part that actually exists in the system

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.870 
part that actually exists in the system
and<00:04:54.020> all<00:04:54.710> of<00:04:54.740> those<00:04:54.950> parts<00:04:55.250> need<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.580> actually

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
and all of those parts need to actually

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.570 
and all of those parts need to actually
communicate<00:04:56.060> with<00:04:56.420> each<00:04:56.660> other<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.530> I've<00:04:58.250> been

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
communicate with each other so I've been

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.370 
communicate with each other so I've been
doing<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:59.000> lot<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.180> work<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.720> make<00:04:59.840> sure<00:05:00.110> that

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
doing a lot of work to make sure that

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.560 
doing a lot of work to make sure that
there's<00:05:00.620> interconnectivity<00:05:01.310> between<00:05:01.700> all<00:05:02.420> of

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
there's interconnectivity between all of

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.900 
there's interconnectivity between all of
the<00:05:02.660> various<00:05:02.990> ship<00:05:03.230> systems<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:03.920> making<00:05:04.730> sure

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
the various ship systems and making sure

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.100 
the various ship systems and making sure
that<00:05:05.090> those<00:05:05.270> have<00:05:05.480> a<00:05:05.540> way<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.780> communicate

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
that those have a way to communicate

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.650 
that those have a way to communicate
with<00:05:06.380> all<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.860> various<00:05:07.220> output<00:05:07.970> devices<00:05:08.300> like

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
with all the various output devices like

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.230 
with all the various output devices like
the<00:05:08.900> player's<00:05:09.500> HUD<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.400> our<00:05:10.700> goal<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.210> to

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
the player's HUD so our goal is to

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.540 
the player's HUD so our goal is to
create<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.870> really<00:05:12.410> cool<00:05:12.650> hut<00:05:12.950> a<00:05:12.980> really

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
create a really cool hut a really

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.760 
create a really cool hut a really
immersive<00:05:14.180> experience<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.230> one<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.500> ways

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
immersive experience and one of the ways

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.440 
immersive experience and one of the ways
that<00:05:15.980> we're<00:05:16.100> doing<00:05:16.370> this<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.730> actually

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
that we're doing this is to actually

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.070 
that we're doing this is to actually
diversify<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.380> visual<00:05:19.370> style<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:19.880> HUD<00:05:20.090> by

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
diversify the visual style of HUD by

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.230 
diversify the visual style of HUD by
shape<00:05:21.320> manufacturer<00:05:21.920> so<00:05:22.490> right<00:05:22.850> now<00:05:23.000> we're

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
shape manufacturer so right now we're

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.110 
shape manufacturer so right now we're
sort<00:05:23.390> of<00:05:23.510> initially<00:05:23.900> concept<00:05:24.410> in<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:25.120> visual

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
sort of initially concept in the visual

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.880 
sort of initially concept in the visual
look<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.390> feel<00:05:26.600> and<00:05:26.960> design<00:05:27.140> language<00:05:27.680> for

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
look and feel and design language for

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.730 
look and feel and design language for
the<00:05:28.010> Hornet<00:05:28.490> or<00:05:28.670> anvil<00:05:29.450> aerospace<00:05:29.900> rather<00:05:30.200> so

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
the Hornet or anvil aerospace rather so

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.330 
the Hornet or anvil aerospace rather so
you'll<00:05:30.950> see<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.370> same<00:05:31.610> style<00:05:32.150> in<00:05:32.450> the<00:05:33.340> Hornet

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
you'll see the same style in the Hornet

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.180 
you'll see the same style in the Hornet
and<00:05:34.520> gladiator<00:05:35.030> but<00:05:35.750> later<00:05:36.530> on<00:05:36.800> when<00:05:37.160> we

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
and gladiator but later on when we

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.760 
and gladiator but later on when we
actually<00:05:37.460> get<00:05:37.760> this<00:05:37.940> workflow<00:05:38.330> going<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:38.990> we

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
actually get this workflow going and we

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.010 
actually get this workflow going and we
start<00:05:40.070> fleshing<00:05:40.340> out<00:05:40.610> more<00:05:41.090> HUD<00:05:41.630> designs

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
start fleshing out more HUD designs

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.450 
start fleshing out more HUD designs
they're<00:05:42.770> actually<00:05:43.040> going<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.220> be<00:05:43.310> way

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
they're actually going to be way

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.420 
they're actually going to be way
different<00:05:43.700> so<00:05:44.120> for<00:05:44.660> in<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.960> trading<00:05:45.410> ship<00:05:45.440> like

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
different so for in a trading ship like

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.150 
different so for in a trading ship like
the<00:05:47.150> Musashi<00:05:47.510> ships<00:05:47.900> you'll<00:05:48.710> be<00:05:48.830> able<00:05:48.920> to

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
the Musashi ships you'll be able to

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.280 
the Musashi ships you'll be able to
you're<00:05:50.090> going<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.270> be<00:05:50.390> able<00:05:50.450> to<00:05:50.600> expect<00:05:51.080> a

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
you're going to be able to expect a

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.200 
you're going to be able to expect a
whole<00:05:51.830> different<00:05:52.190> experience<00:05:52.280> because<00:05:53.060> the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
whole different experience because the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.820 
whole different experience because the
visuals<00:05:53.600> language<00:05:54.110> will<00:05:54.260> be<00:05:54.290> different<00:05:54.710> well

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
visuals language will be different well

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.050 
visuals language will be different well
there's<00:05:54.980> a<00:05:55.040> lot<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:55.340> systems<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.820> are<00:05:55.940> going

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
there's a lot of systems that are going

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.540 
there's a lot of systems that are going
to<00:05:56.120> be<00:05:56.320> brought<00:05:57.320> in<00:05:57.470> to<00:05:57.650> star<00:05:57.860> citizen<00:05:57.890> and

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
to be brought in to star citizen and

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.950 
to be brought in to star citizen and
you're<00:05:58.880> going<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.060> need<00:05:59.240> an<00:05:59.330> interface<00:05:59.510> into

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
you're going to need an interface into

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.230 
you're going to need an interface into
all<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.230> those<00:06:00.380> so<00:06:00.850> we're<00:06:01.850> thinking<00:06:02.120> about

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
all of those so we're thinking about

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.840 
all of those so we're thinking about
things<00:06:02.600> like<00:06:02.750> navigation<00:06:03.350> star<00:06:04.250> maps<00:06:04.550> things

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
things like navigation star maps things

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.520 
things like navigation star maps things
like<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:06.460> possibly<00:06:07.460> trade<00:06:07.760> interfaces<00:06:08.530> all

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
like that possibly trade interfaces all

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.950 
like that possibly trade interfaces all
of<00:06:09.740> that<00:06:09.860> is<00:06:10.010> going<00:06:10.190> to<00:06:10.280> be<00:06:10.430> done<00:06:10.730> in<00:06:11.030> world

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
of that is going to be done in world

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.790 
of that is going to be done in world
there<00:06:12.410> won't<00:06:12.590> be<00:06:12.680> any<00:06:12.950> sort<00:06:13.550> of<00:06:13.700> game<00:06:14.800> abstract

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
there won't be any sort of game abstract

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.640 
there won't be any sort of game abstract
UI<00:06:16.040> so<00:06:16.880> there's<00:06:17.810> a<00:06:17.930> lot<00:06:18.050> of<00:06:18.080> stuff<00:06:18.410> to<00:06:18.530> look

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
UI so there's a lot of stuff to look

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.320 
UI so there's a lot of stuff to look
forward<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:18.980> doing<00:06:19.130> going<00:06:19.340> forward<00:06:19.430> one<00:06:20.180> thing

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
forward to doing going forward one thing

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.670 
forward to doing going forward one thing
we're<00:06:20.450> we're<00:06:20.630> doing<00:06:20.660> is<00:06:21.020> we're<00:06:21.380> defining

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
we're we're doing is we're defining

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.160 
we're we're doing is we're defining
different<00:06:22.100> color<00:06:22.280> spaces<00:06:22.760> that'll<00:06:23.750> be

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
different color spaces that'll be

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.740 
different color spaces that'll be
applied<00:06:24.440> to<00:06:24.590> different<00:06:24.710> things<00:06:24.920> for<00:06:25.250> example

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
applied to different things for example

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.970 
applied to different things for example
customizability<00:06:26.750> of<00:06:27.230> these<00:06:27.470> different<00:06:27.830> color

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
customizability of these different color

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.660 
customizability of these different color
spaces<00:06:28.430> so<00:06:28.940> a<00:06:29.300> user<00:06:29.780> can<00:06:30.050> take<00:06:30.290> the<00:06:30.560> red<00:06:31.010> color

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
spaces so a user can take the red color

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.370 
spaces so a user can take the red color
space<00:06:31.970> or<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.360> Critical<00:06:32.540> alert<00:06:32.900> color<00:06:33.110> space

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
space or the Critical alert color space

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.640 
space or the Critical alert color space
and<00:06:33.680> assign<00:06:34.070> a<00:06:34.100> different<00:06:35.050> RGB<00:06:36.050> value<00:06:36.410> or

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
and assign a different RGB value or

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.370 
and assign a different RGB value or
color<00:06:37.010> to<00:06:37.190> that<00:06:37.420> so<00:06:38.420> that<00:06:38.450> it's<00:06:38.720> more<00:06:38.870> readable

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
color to that so that it's more readable

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.250 
color to that so that it's more readable
to<00:06:39.650> them<00:06:39.860> coming<00:06:40.850> from<00:06:41.300> you<00:06:41.960> know<00:06:42.080> my

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
to them coming from you know my

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.530 
to them coming from you know my
background<00:06:42.830> not<00:06:43.160> really<00:06:43.910> being<00:06:44.120> much<00:06:44.330> of<00:06:44.360> a

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
background not really being much of a

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.450 
background not really being much of a
gamer<00:06:44.780> or<00:06:44.990> anything<00:06:45.230> I<00:06:45.500> sort<00:06:45.740> of<00:06:45.800> offer<00:06:46.160> a

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
gamer or anything I sort of offer a

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.520 
gamer or anything I sort of offer a
fresh<00:06:46.850> perspective<00:06:47.090> and<00:06:47.840> maybe<00:06:48.050> like<00:06:48.290> a<00:06:48.320> new

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
fresh perspective and maybe like a new

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.030 
fresh perspective and maybe like a new
set<00:06:48.770> of<00:06:48.890> eyes<00:06:49.070> and<00:06:49.490> I<00:06:49.580> would

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
set of eyes and I would

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.210 
set of eyes and I would
maybe<00:06:50.190> approach<00:06:50.690> problems<00:06:51.690> and<00:06:51.870> tasks<00:06:52.380> in<00:06:52.560> a

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
maybe approach problems and tasks in a

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.430 
maybe approach problems and tasks in a
different<00:06:53.550> way<00:06:53.670> than<00:06:54.000> regular<00:06:54.600> designers<00:06:55.290> in

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
different way than regular designers in

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.710 
different way than regular designers in
the<00:06:55.650> game<00:06:55.830> industry<00:06:56.070> would<00:06:57.030> because<00:06:57.510> they

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
the game industry would because they

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.570 
the game industry would because they
sort<00:06:57.930> of<00:06:58.050> know<00:06:58.230> the<00:06:58.410> limitations<00:06:59.100> and<00:06:59.340> and

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
sort of know the limitations and and

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.180 
sort of know the limitations and and
they<00:07:00.090> know<00:07:00.300> sort<00:07:01.050> of<00:07:01.110> the<00:07:01.170> boundaries<00:07:01.530> of<00:07:01.830> you

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
they know sort of the boundaries of you

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.860 
they know sort of the boundaries of you
know<00:07:02.310> where<00:07:02.820> they<00:07:02.970> need<00:07:03.000> to<00:07:03.150> be<00:07:03.240> working<00:07:03.570> in

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
know where they need to be working in

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.660 
know where they need to be working in
but<00:07:04.020> for<00:07:04.230> me<00:07:04.350> I<00:07:04.380> don't<00:07:04.470> really<00:07:05.250> know<00:07:05.400> anything

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
but for me I don't really know anything

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.060 
but for me I don't really know anything
about<00:07:05.880> that<00:07:06.180> so<00:07:06.390> I'm<00:07:06.510> just<00:07:06.720> kind<00:07:06.960> of<00:07:07.080> you<00:07:07.920> know

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
about that so I'm just kind of you know

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.170 
about that so I'm just kind of you know
doing<00:07:08.850> my<00:07:09.750> thing<00:07:10.080> and<00:07:10.260> then<00:07:10.410> we'll<00:07:10.650> work<00:07:11.100> to<00:07:11.370> to

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
doing my thing and then we'll work to to

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.020 
doing my thing and then we'll work to to
incorporate<00:07:12.810> it<00:07:12.930> into<00:07:13.110> a<00:07:13.290> you<00:07:14.130> know<00:07:14.250> a<00:07:14.280> usable

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
incorporate it into a you know a usable

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.470 
incorporate it into a you know a usable
state<00:07:15.360> for<00:07:15.780> gameplay
