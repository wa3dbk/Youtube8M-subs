never haps some of the most popular

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
never haps some of the most popular
works<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.900> actually<00:01:43.050> have<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.740> our

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
works that we actually have with our

works that we actually have with our
public<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.570> really<00:01:45.780> exciting<00:01:45.930> for

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
public and so it's really exciting for

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.890 
public and so it's really exciting for
us<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.650> be<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.190> be<00:01:47.250> able<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.730> install<00:01:48.420> all

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
us to be here to be able to install all

the<00:01:59.210> gallery<00:01:59.539> that<00:01:59.659> were<00:01:59.780> hanging<00:02:00.049> this

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
the gallery that were hanging this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.310 
the gallery that were hanging this
morning<00:02:00.710> which<00:02:00.890> has<00:02:01.100> monochrome<00:02:02.000> works<00:02:02.960> which

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
morning which has monochrome works which

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.050 
morning which has monochrome works which
is<00:02:03.469> immediately<00:02:03.890> outside<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:06.049> Rothko<00:02:06.439> space

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
is immediately outside the Rothko space

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.999 
is immediately outside the Rothko space
most<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.269> those<00:02:08.420> works<00:02:08.780> were<00:02:08.929> made<00:02:09.050> at<00:02:09.560> exactly

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
most of those works were made at exactly

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.860 
most of those works were made at exactly
the<00:02:10.190> same<00:02:10.340> moment<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.819> Rothko<00:02:11.269> was<00:02:11.420> working

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
the same moment the Rothko was working

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.900 
the same moment the Rothko was working
and<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.379> sets<00:02:12.709> up<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> dialogue<00:02:13.550> across

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and so it sets up a dialogue across

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.780 
and so it sets up a dialogue across
those<00:02:14.239> two<00:02:14.480> spaces<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:18.370> number<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.580> works
