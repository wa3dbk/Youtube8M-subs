00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
 p 

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.660
 it's not a guy too technical in the 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 list I more build the game all 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:15.000
 the bongo tastes 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.490
 Ayew people 'darkness I hope 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.230
 you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.640
 even though I've been trying for a long time 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 to make this video the people I have that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.059
 bored for two three days you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 really sorry for not taking it out 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.880
 before it's true it's been five days 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.260
 I think I have not felt and video 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.970
 I do not usually leave the chain 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.360
 without video too that long 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.040
 simply 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.989
 and on top of that the videos 400 comes 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.370
 so we'll say that I slow down a little 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.080
 little rhythm naturally but there 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.520
 it was really force I'm there for 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.980
 nothing I really had a lot of problems 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.680
 between my tv screen kicks but to bugger 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 I hope he will not die anymore 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 I'm on windows 10 and queen 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.360
 2.10 actually bugger all my software 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.619
 to make the shot videos during 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.990
 a whole day I tried to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.310
 to fix worries it did not change anything 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.640
 shot I'm ironed on windows 7 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.780
 yeah it works flawlessly visibly 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.190
 plus the fact that during an afternoon 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.020
 I'm trying to do some gameplay for 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.270
 to be able to offer you in this video 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.310
 the and and the next simply 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.020
 in the end I played a little bit for 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.340
 nothing even if there I propose blaco 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.229
 video with small sequences of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.460
 drinking gameplay it's not a sniper 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.410
 why it's not snipers all 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.789
 just because on pc bo I 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.050
 am a big brel sniper I 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.759
 not support I do not know why 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.319
 I love the styles on bo 2 but 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.700
 attention on pc it's really not my 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.170
 delirium so suddenly we find ourselves 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 in front of be2 ​​with small sequences 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.479
 in team death match to the army and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.009
 at the pumps 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 after you go see so it's rather 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.050
 nice but nothing folichon on 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.700
 mw2 rp z on mw3 technology had no 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.899
 drinking server of the coup I got 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.099
 folded on bo two it's been a long time 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.380
 that I did not do to you so I hope 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.179
 that it will make you happy 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.140
 so yeah full in shit full of 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.149
 things that made the video 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.280
 really late to arrive and you have it 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.800
 saw in the title I joined a team 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.080
 the laconic onic sniping clan that is 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.030
 a sniper team that he made exeter and c 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.819
 that start with everything either on 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.140
 youtube and among members who are 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.210
 goals all on youtube it's really 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.250
 something new 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.900
 so I have jones and tim why already 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.340
 firstly do not worry I know 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.170
 we will ask and lafarge is in 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.470
 did srgc my friends is my 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.330
 it's my group of mine by the last 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.800
 recruitment that really led to nothing and 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.570
 so I thought I had you 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.460
 spoken in the last video that I 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.540
 will look for john a project some 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.620
 something already solid 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.970
 that's what I 'm doing today I 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.190
 give a project that is really everything 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.310
 recent must know that I give this 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.380
 project as a right arm 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.030
 happiness finally happiness right arm 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.400
 the xbox one leader in the xbox section 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.989
 one because this sniper anthem is 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.940
 really in its infancy as I say and 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.739
 they do not necessarily have the visibility to 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.790
 recruit a lot of people and that's 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.830
 what I'm going to bring them in a 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.810
 first time of visibility for 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.040
 to be able to recruit is a 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.640
 of my next videos that happened to me 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.769
 on my channel 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.870
 it will be a recruitment lobby platform 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.050
 tahir ps4 xbox on the old 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.370
 platforms pc maybe if these two 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.140
 applications pc maybe we will make a 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.360
 pc section in any case me I'll be there 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.489
 as an advisor I 'll be there too 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.709
 to help them in the team in general 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.180
 but above all to be a straight arm to 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.220
 sides of steve roth to handle the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.510
 section xbox one which will be called owni.fr 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.890
 I have this a little bit that I bring 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.630
 the onic I really wanted to 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.780
 let go of montag frg which holds me a lot 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.069
 at heart for so many years now 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.599
 so suddenly so brox for those who 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.400
 do not know it's someone who has 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.959
 participated india but recruitment for the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.849
 srg it's a person I had 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.560
 take in the srg but who has 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.880
 decided to go to this project 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.560
 which is precisely where nick exists 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.840
 for a few months now I think 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.570
 and I repeat it again but 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.220
 it's all nine months in my head I 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.010
 not think you need to think in 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.570
 as if we would like the team to feast 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.970
 suddenly, that is to say that the team is 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.049
 known or what certainly while the opinion 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.670
 recruiting I would put you the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.079
 string in the description and the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.609
 social networks of the team etc etc 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.950
 but I do not want you to go 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.269
 subscribe to the channel because because 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.829
 you want to see a lot of content 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.250
 on it as I told them it takes 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.720
 really that relatively 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.060
 General recruit a lot of members 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.920
 that the the future roster of the future be 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.319
 solid to be able to offer 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.639
 montages and things quite frequently 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.930
 for now it's useless for this 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.880
 focus on the youtube channel finally brief 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.130
 that we come back will come back in the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.210
 recruitment video in question so if 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.320
 you have questions about 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.450
 all that said me in the comments 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.520
 in any case I give this project as 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.500
 I tell you to be right arm of 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.880
 steve rocks to help the hip section 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.650

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.310
 little bit and also at the same time 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.660
 for my part progressed in delirium 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.250

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.840

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.270
 want to progress 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.380
 it is not on pc that I will progress 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.420
 for the simple reason that I am 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.950
 not feel comfortable sniper on pc but 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.840
 with black ops 3 that will happen I 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.400

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.070
 springboard for my sniper progress and 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.660

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.360

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.540
 of world the bottom that I find that it's 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.280
 stupid to call it like that but 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.050

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.220
 precisely to have a case 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.639
 acquisition that allows you 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.900
 to record in 60 fps this is the base I 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.479
 if you want to make montages you 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.430
 must be able to record in 60fps 720p 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.169
 minimum so finally short there will be full 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.979
 of criteria also not masses to 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.750
 age level etc 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.520
 it will rather be released precisely the dry 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.050
 and a lot of people who fear this 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.400
 kind of criteria but finally here it is 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.560
 will have a video recruitment with both 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.610
 leaders civ rocks and frantic on the 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.080
 chain do not have long I hope that 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.979
 it will make you happy we find ourselves for 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.539
 an upcoming video 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.860
