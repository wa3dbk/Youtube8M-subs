 year and let my friends look for all that 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.269
 the creators were hiding from us in this 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.739
 wonderful in the film so let's start 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.200
 the beginning of the film when anakin and obi-van 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.120
 chasing mercenaries and driving him to 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.070
 the club then when they go there you can 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.690
 notice both on the very leftmost screen 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.390
 one of the aliens 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.460
 playing a video game star warriors pro 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.440
 the race for gunpowder from the first part in the same 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.899
 two soldiers can be seen in the club scene 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.780
 Coruscant having fun with girls so 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.210

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.880

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.740
 acting as si three pio like this 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.200
 Here the director decided to show us these 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.539
 actors in real looks small 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.709
 such stones because of this he deserves 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.569
 gratitude to the company can be 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.789
 notice two more good cameos 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.280
 namely, to see two children of the director 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.740
 george lucas and that daughter appears in 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.929
 a bar in the company of a black ahmed place 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.300
 where anakin pursues a murderer 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.920
 and the son appears in a small stone 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.929
 boy talking to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 the librarian after the last 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.300
 helped obi-wang 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.789
 when obi-van is in the Jedi archive 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.739
 looking for information about the fireplace you can see 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.050
 several busts along the shelves 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:01.539
 so here is the fourth in a row let right 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.140
 is the bust of the director George himself 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.360
 lukas 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.270
 the rest also feel people who 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.520
 had a hand in making this film in 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.470
 CJ animators knew that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.430
 these faces were used by myself 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.330
 george lukas 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.310
 they did not say this well and go to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.560
 what has already become a tradition in many 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.410
 movies including in the star saga 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.220
 warriors this is the legendary cry of wilhelm 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.190
 who love to use 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.800
 creators in their creations 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.930
 Easter eggs so here in this movie of his 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.210
 can hear in the moment when the soldier 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.110
 Naboo throws aside at the very 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.110
 first blast 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.790
 continuing after chasing the mercenary 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.070
 Coruscant killer has a scene when 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.830
 Obi-Wan comes out of the flying taxi 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.050
 holding anakin's caught sword so here 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.570
 here you can catch a glimpse on the wall 5 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.150
 letters of the alphabet in the style of Star Wars and 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.920
 Urbech if find his decoding in 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.440
 online and try to translate 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.510
 then we get the name Frank and this is 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.910
 such a small reference to frank 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.380
 oze who is voiced by the master himself 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.570
 iodine when obi-van and anakin reside in 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.420
 the club can be seen on one successful screen 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.370
 the skywalker sound logo is real 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.330
 existing company engaged 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.310
 musical arrangement in the scene when 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
 jedi obi van arrives at the mysterious 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.130
 camino planet 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.200
 he is shown a huge amount 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.050
 ready-to-use war clones 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.970
 crafted from one bounty hunter 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.380
 You can also see Easter eggs namely 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.630
 after he asks where 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.150
 is jango fett can be seen 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.270
 flipped voyager starship model 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.850
 from the series star trek or known to us 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.980
 like star trek so here's the old track 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.050
 There are easter eggs associated with star 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.020
 wars in the form of constantly appearing 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.739
 r2 di2 and here how can we see everything 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.160
 vice versa 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.170
 oh, these filmmakers in tribute 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.180
 respect 1 movie trilogy about star 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.070
 the wars which clone hits his head about 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.230
 low hanging door something and jango fett 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.690
 bangs his head while grabbing exactly 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.120
 same sound going down the door when 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.630
 enters his ship after a battle with 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.630
 obi-wang 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.660
 before you go look for your 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.000
 Anakin's abducted mother is found and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.860
 talking sp-1 and during this 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.410
 of conversation we see them drop 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.480
 your shadows on one of the walls so here 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.400
 You may notice that the shadow of Skywalker is already 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.760
 practically repeats its contours 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.890
 future alter-ego darth vader we are all 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.810
 his anger is already evident in that moment 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.470
 when he completely carves the whole tribe 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.600
 captors and the further in the scene where 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.090
 army of clones attacking duku count duku 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.280
 we see that one of the ships is controlled 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.890
 the pilot is yellow and in this you can 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.930
 have a good easter eggs as many 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.850
 claim to be very similar 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.200
 its appearance on the legendary 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.800
 Homer Simpson 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.230
 Here is such an interesting moment figures 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.660
 1138 which insert into all their 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.310
 films director george lucas after 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.820

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.310

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.800

 although this was not in the film itself 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.570

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.430
