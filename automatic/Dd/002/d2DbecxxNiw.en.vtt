hi<00:00:06.180> everyone<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:07.020> know<00:00:07.620> it's<00:00:07.890> been<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> while

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
hi everyone I know it's been a while

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.250 
hi everyone I know it's been a while
since<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.700> posted<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.150> video<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.840> moisture

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
since I posted a video to the moisture

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.009 
since I posted a video to the moisture
retention<00:00:10.559> series<00:00:11.300> today<00:00:12.300> I'm<00:00:12.389> going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.719> pick

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
retention series today I'm going to pick

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.049 
retention series today I'm going to pick
that<00:00:13.049> back<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.889> finish<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.519> series<00:00:14.910> out

starting<00:00:15.719> with<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.990> video<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.580> some<00:00:17.850> ladies

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
starting with this video so some ladies

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.200 
starting with this video so some ladies
naturally<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.840> low<00:00:19.140> porosity<00:00:19.380> hair<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
naturally have low porosity hair as I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.120 
naturally have low porosity hair as I
mentioned<00:00:21.570> before<00:00:21.660> when<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.560> relaxed<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
mentioned before when I was relaxed I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.220 
mentioned before when I was relaxed I
had<00:00:23.279> very<00:00:23.519> low<00:00:23.730> porosity<00:00:23.970> hair<00:00:24.199> which<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
had very low porosity hair which is

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.250 
had very low porosity hair which is
interesting<00:00:25.680> because<00:00:26.420> chemical<00:00:27.420> damage<00:00:27.630> can

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
interesting because chemical damage can

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.099 
interesting because chemical damage can
often<00:00:28.619> cause<00:00:28.769> high<00:00:29.160> porosity<00:00:29.429> hair<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.269> any

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
often cause high porosity hair at any

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.049 
often cause high porosity hair at any
rate<00:00:31.439> we're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> discuss<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.030> very

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
rate we're going to discuss a very

moisture retention in your hair if it's
low<00:00:37.980> porosity<00:00:38.870> one<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> most<00:00:40.290> important

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
low porosity one of the most important

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.290 
low porosity one of the most important
things<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.219> person<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.790> low<00:00:41.969> porosity<00:00:42.149> hair

things a person with low porosity hair

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380 
things a person with low porosity hair
can<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.920> loosen<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.309> those<00:00:44.489> cuticles<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
can do is to loosen up those cuticles so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
can do is to loosen up those cuticles so
that<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> moisture<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.379> only<00:00:46.590> absorbed

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that the moisture is not only absorbed

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
that the moisture is not only absorbed
into<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.850> hair<00:00:48.059> shaft<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.230> also

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
into the hair shaft but it's also

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
into the hair shaft but it's also
retained<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:52.370> one<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> accomplish<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
retained and one way to accomplish that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.590 
retained and one way to accomplish that
is<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.860> apple<00:00:56.309> cider<00:00:56.489> vinegar<00:00:56.640> rinses<00:00:57.329> a

is to do apple cider vinegar rinses a
tip<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.340> effective<00:00:59.850> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
tip to make this even more effective is
