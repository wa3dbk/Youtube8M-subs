today<00:00:15.900> we're<00:00:16.770> gonna<00:00:16.859> replant<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:18.650> first<00:00:20.210> you

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
today we're gonna replant it first you

today we're gonna replant it first you
got<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.570> pot<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.990> find<00:00:28.230> Scott<00:00:28.560> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
got this pot and if we find Scott it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.220 
got this pot and if we find Scott it
drains<00:00:29.250> into<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.730> little<00:00:29.939> tray<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.929> if<00:00:31.080> we

drains into this little tray and if we
find<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.769> need<00:00:31.880> more<00:00:32.880> holes<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.899> can

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
find that we need more holes we can

00:00:33.930 --> 00:01:16.010 
find that we need more holes we can
drill<00:00:34.890> holes<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.520> bottom<00:00:51.050> kind<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:56.539> die<00:01:15.020> we

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
drill holes in the bottom kind of die we

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:29.240 
drill holes in the bottom kind of die we
just<00:01:16.049> made<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.840> we're<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> add<00:01:28.770> in

just made and then we're going to add in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.140 
just made and then we're going to add in
some<00:01:30.170> regular<00:01:31.170> potting<00:01:31.799> soil<00:01:35.150> them

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
some regular potting soil them
honey<00:01:39.150> oil<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.960> got<00:01:44.509> pouring<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:46.049> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
honey oil that we got pouring some of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.350 
honey oil that we got pouring some of
that<00:01:50.780> we're<00:01:51.780> gonna<00:01:51.899> test<00:01:52.520> how<00:01:53.520> our<00:01:53.759> lemon<00:01:54.149> tree

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that we're gonna test how our lemon tree

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.800 
that we're gonna test how our lemon tree
is<00:01:54.509> gonna<00:01:54.659> fit<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.570> pretty

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
is gonna fit in here and that's pretty

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.800 
is gonna fit in here and that's pretty
good<00:01:57.960> height<00:01:58.619> wise<00:01:59.210> you<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
good height wise you want it to be a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.980 
good height wise you want it to be a
little<00:02:01.140> bit<00:02:01.290> below<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.070> top<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> pot<00:02:03.329> when

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
little bit below the top of the pot when

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.039 
little bit below the top of the pot when
you<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.350> your<00:02:04.469> potting<00:02:04.799> soil<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.280> there

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
you get all your potting soil in there

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.320 
you get all your potting soil in there
so<00:02:10.099> now<00:02:11.099> we're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> take<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> little<00:02:12.090> bit

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.260 
of this miracle around moisture control
potting<00:02:18.629> soil<00:02:19.550> which<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.580> supposed<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.209> be

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
potting soil which is supposed to be

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:45.850 
potting soil which is supposed to be
good

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860
