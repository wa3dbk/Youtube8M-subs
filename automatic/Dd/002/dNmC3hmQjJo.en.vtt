are<00:00:35.070> boiling<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.000> tend<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> go<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.530> when

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
are boiling so I tend to go from when

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.170 
are boiling so I tend to go from when
you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.309> there's<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> fair<00:00:38.760> few<00:00:38.940> bubbles

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
leaving leaving the bottom so we'll

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.240 
leaving leaving the bottom so we'll
start<00:00:42.149> our<00:00:42.300> time<00:00:42.510> I've<00:00:42.719> eight<00:00:42.960> minutes<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.569 
I'm just gonna leave leave the eggs eggs
there<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.190> exit<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.910> being<00:00:48.329> cooking<00:00:48.719> for

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
there so they exit but being cooking for

00:00:49.579 --> 00:01:21.679 
there so they exit but being cooking for
eight<00:00:50.579> minutes<00:01:19.189> feels<00:01:20.189> cool<00:01:20.970> cool<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
eight minutes feels cool cool to the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:37.680 
eight minutes feels cool cool to the
touch<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.140> great<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.500 

and<00:01:38.690> then<00:01:38.869> we're<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.049> going<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.560> roll<00:01:40.510> in

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
and then we're just going to roll in

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.749 
and then we're just going to roll in
that<00:01:41.659> helps<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.320> release<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.400> membrane

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
that helps to release the the membrane

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.320 
that helps to release the the membrane
from<00:01:43.940> from<00:01:44.750> your<00:01:44.900> shell<00:01:45.520> fall<00:01:46.520> from<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.970> from

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330

from from your shell fall from it from
their<00:01:47.509> splash<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.229> egg<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:50.180> stopped

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
their splash of the egg and it stopped

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.990 
their splash of the egg and it stopped
coming<00:01:50.990> up<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.470> then<00:01:52.070> I'm<00:01:52.220> just<00:01:52.310> going<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.759> use

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000

coming up and then I'm just going to use
my<00:01:53.030> thumbnail<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.960> kind<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.290> peel<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:56.240> want<00:01:56.420> to

try<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:56.840> get<00:01:57.020> underneath<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.830> membrane<00:01:58.630> it's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
try and get underneath the membrane it's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.719 
try and get underneath the membrane it's
just<00:01:59.780> coming<00:02:00.020> off<00:02:00.759> like<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:02.000> good<00:02:02.210> egg<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.729> then
