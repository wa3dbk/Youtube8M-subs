00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 very interesting form of question has already 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:17.880
 the office design you would like to be 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.330
 and it is not yet 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 it's still the time it was vanessa poletto 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.400
 Are you watching TV? 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 right place to inspire to create life 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.929
 that you want 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.480
 and this is our program of questions and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.100
 answers and today I have a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 question for you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.350
 if you find out you're going to die 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.989
 tomorrow if there would be any regret 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.820
 How many things do we just go through? 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.739
 putting off in our lives forgetting the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 our modality is not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.699
 and today I brought a subject well 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.829
 already much talked about interesting 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.280
 I think it's always worth it. 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 remember steve jobs founder of apple 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 speaks on a YouTube video about how the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.229
 his view of the world changed when he 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 discovered for the first time that he 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.510
 had cancer 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 his words were thus to remember that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 I'll be dead soon, it's the tool. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.549
 most important that I have ever met for me 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.640
 help make big decisions because 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.110
 almost everything external expectations pride 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.930
 afraid to go ashamed or fail to fall 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.189
 facing death leaving what is just 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.530
 important 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.400
 there is no reason not to follow your 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 heart 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.630
 remember that you're going to die is the best 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.850
 The way that I know 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.380
 to avoid the trap of thinking that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.049
 Do you have something to lose? 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
 You're already naked, there's no reason not to 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.180
 follow your heart 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.259
 even though we are apparently 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.020
 Healthy people have a little rest. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.619
 disconcerted or why? 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.729
 in fact this is inevitable for 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.579
 Everyone and my proposal today is that you 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.950
 wake up so it starts to dust 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.030
 of their projects that are repeating 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.299
 affected 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.220
 You can start building today. 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.769
 the life of your dreams giving the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.959
 first steps was published in the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.390
 united states a book that reports well 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.019
 This is what we're talking about top 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.180
 five hundred softdesign which is the five 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.829
 main pass repentance 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.290
 terminal patients 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.810
 it was written by o'neill is a 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.690
 nurse specialized in taking care of 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.079
 people close to death 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.840
 if you were to make a list today which 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.720
 would be your biggest regrets if 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.880
 you suddenly have some 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.569
 then see which were the most pointed 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.390
 by nurse and writer patients 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.329
 first I wish I had the courage 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.880
 living a life is true to myself and 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.870
 not the life that others expected 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.030
 me 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.720
 second I would not have 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.180
 worked so much third I would like to 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.750
 have had the courage to express my 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.380
 fourth feelings I would like to have 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.930
 kept in touch with my friends and who 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.109
 I wish I could have been happier 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.829
 I challenge you to think about these 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.230
 points each one because if you are 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.590
 seeing this media because you're still 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.459
 there alive and have a chance to start 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.680
 different people thinking different 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.829
 leave your comment here talking about 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.940

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.760
 with you 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.639

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.590
 will commit to making a difference 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.519
