00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.399
 very good people welcome to where 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.110
 m 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.650
 Madrid 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 that I do not have we're going to start a whore 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.180
 satoshi red or red like with you is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 you want to call it I do not care 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.020
 In the beginning, everyone considers 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.210
 these characters until contrary 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.399
 coming up from another so they put it like 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.430
 Cloud symbol and grab the comfortable 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.949
 pro but yes there are certain similarities 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.409
 between both that the truth is very 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:51.420
 interesting and if we analyze the video 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:54.690
 sorry but not dead sorry so for 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.739
 What I say why choose this fund because 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.739
 more to me two eggs 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.800
 where it takes 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.740
 well I have a theory that came to my mind 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.380
 it is not long ago I think but neither 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.899
 recently and I think he could prove it and 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.479
 is that network is already the same person 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.460
 he just wants to teach different 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.830
 evidence is obvious is a fucking theory or 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.890
 it is not come and save it but it is a lie 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.860
 because no no it is a theory of mine that 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.869
 applied today here and that transmito takes you 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.869
 so as not to separate entertain them a little 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.510
 First of all, there would be one thing left 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.120
 and is that when I say three days 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.290
 they are the same person as what I want 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.880
 to say is that person is alive 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.870
 completely but in dimensions 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.130
 different is to say 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.280
 you do not know, basically it's that 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.369
 several different dimensions 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.960
 better better as a simpler example 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.210
 dragonball you must have seen dragon 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.479
 ball for eggs then network and that's how 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.200
 trucks if we take here the future of the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.350
 sword or trump dgt or the trucks of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.530
 end of the dragon ball magic leave 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.709
 magic wood is basically the same 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.880
 character the same story just that he has 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.000
 changed a little is one dimension 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.560
 different a parallel world could be 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.230
 tell 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.880
 and is that the truth the similarities between 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.680
 both are too overwhelming 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.349
 bought simply that it be a 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.030
 coincidence both their physical resemblance 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.660
 as both have their principal a 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.840
 fucking pikachu like they both live in 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.099
 point planet both have the same 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.390
 dream is to reach already half a day or 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.670
 almost reach to say pokemon and 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.260
 become champion there and its 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.780
 once both also have a rival touches 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 balls and both know the teacher or 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.269
 help and life and life the similarities that 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.459
 has already presented in your head and if 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.819
 we do not escape tracers the environments or 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.880
 benhayer well now you can the difference 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.170
 between straight and ace 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.170
 I basically do not know 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.040
 have something would have had to happen for 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.050
 that a story several e so much one 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.470
 I could easily say that 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.560
 it could have been like that 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.710
 On his trip he accompanies Brock and dresses 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.410
 that for that reason everything changes and effect 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.720
 in a chain 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.040
 and basically everything changes and loses 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.680
 trying to keep trying 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.109
 but that's not clear about everything since the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.450
 Network history is so simple from 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.189
 leaving a village 40 exactly already 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.049
 that the trunk gives it a 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.030
 apocalypse to complete so something 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.700
 did not have to cause that change and 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.780
 it has not been simply 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.910
 or challenges is that being a maimed is not 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.970
 simply that network is in a 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.010
 dimension where canada say and asturias 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.989
 Where have we lost our of that 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.120
 change something else has had to happen and not 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.959
 I have no fucking idea what it is 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 all right now but it does not have any 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.440
 kind of sense is not based on anything like that 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.169
 that is based on something and I have arguments 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.270
 to prove it and it's very simple just 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.520
 it's a matter of watching the pokemon anime 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.100
 in which all the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.289
 protagonists or virtually all 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.729
 protagonists of the games less red 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.740
 gold appears 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.630
 diamond appears 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.229
 appears now that basically comes to 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.349
 be your rival in emerald pokemon and all 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.400
 it happens basically as the games are not 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.919
 I know that does not follow the timeline 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.199
 accurate of pokemon but it does have 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.699
 certain sense and that's what I do not 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.970
 block that's what made me wear 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:05.790
 this theory is extreme and it is that 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:08.860
 appears and you do not appear now appears 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.860
 but red not 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.199
 if they wanted to promote the games because 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.530
 I encouraged all the protagonists less 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.530
 to red 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.700
 that's what has really made me 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.530
 doubt 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.170
 On the other hand also add that little 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.980
 people is a completely full universe 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.170
 of gaps and sensory designs and that this 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.500
 be other very people of Marseille to the 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.800
 community but good this is each one 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.800
 is a 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.490
 in its logical senses and that really 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.490
 I saw certain they are not within what 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.830
 possible to see what red has reached us 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.100
 and that is the key to this rocky theory 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.990
 of spirit 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.920
 but you that your few who 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.920
 inclusions defined from cape
