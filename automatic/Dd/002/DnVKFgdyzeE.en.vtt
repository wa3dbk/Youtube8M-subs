00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.559
 offered by the manufacturer bmw se 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.719
 names eight beautiful a provocative strand 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.789
 does it have the flavor of a real 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 sporty simple wheels of the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.699
 moment 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.890
 jérôme bastia give us your opinion 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.630
 so it's true that generally I 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.570
 am super happy to try 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 cars for gran turismo I enjoy 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.689
 today it's not that I'm super 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.290
 happy is that it's ecstasy it's 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.210
 exceptional I will enjoy watching 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
 this look a real desire it looks like 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 a car of the future 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.740
 and yet it's good for sale in 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.640
 concession we will see them in detail this 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:50.690
 that it gives the designers are 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.550
 dropped with this super aggressive look 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 futuristic with many colors the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.330
 main color to social black but 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.980
 also those blue border that we 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.590
 will find a little bit everywhere it's 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.710
 to say that it is also a vehicle 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.430
 electric 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.890
 and then especially the materials used 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.140
 and yes then it sounds light the car 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.750
 weighs less than 1500 kg it's really a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.100
 exploit then as what also the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 hybrid vehicles may have 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.510
 really a sporty connotation with 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610
 this coupe which is really very profiled 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.600
 we can also notice for example in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.390
 the materials used 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.610
 the roof with the carbon fiber on 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.630
 also note that the crate with a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.670
 door opening 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.200
 it's the class maybe it's not very 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.760
 practical in town but also fish is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 awesome so I wanted to show you these 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.710
 details there look at the crate with the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.570
 carbon fiber is really high 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.360
 tech is top level 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
 a really special line to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.330
 level 2 so I do not know how we 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.729
 call it if it's the high also the one 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.650
 she actually we really have the flow 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.670
 of air that is really perfect I think 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.630
 and then dodo a mouth it's 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.040
 frankly the pictures speak of them 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.610
 even I'm watching 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 the details at the same time as you 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.660
 me regale it's really a super 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:17.800
 success he had to dare to do it and 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:19.240
 well bmw with 7.8 did it hat with 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.210
 the precious sesame 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.310
 the bmw key and although we can open the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.170
 safe to go on a weekend in 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.780
 holiday is beautiful this big 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.180
 piece of glass there with a window that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.750
 protects the cockpit and the trunk is here 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:41.470
 then surprise for our weekend we have 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.690
 took a jacket a bag on another 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 destiny and then what is found 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.550
 below well we find everything 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.300
 the paraphernalia to load the car have only 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.770
 not refuel 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.230
 well our app on the side for the without 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.209
 lead 98 but that's to load his 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.380
 p'tits quickly everything explained there is even 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.080
 An extension 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.270
 that's it to put you right there is a 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.600
 little room even time it's not my bone 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.600
 x 5 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.220
 so happiness makes it stick to it 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.780
 great thing it's so simple to 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.880
 make beautiful interiors like this 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.140
 here I tease a little bit the designers 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.470
 but it's a success 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.240
 actually in the sense that even though 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.610
 it's very busy there are lines of 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.100
 everywhere it stays very homogeneous 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.140
 it's still very fun with blue piping 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.720
 on the steering wheel there are blue leds 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.000
 it's really futuristic 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.300
 with the robotic box the pallets at the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.310
 flying 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.430
 options from everywhere obviously 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.610
 a big screen the digital meter too 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.910
 its magnificent bucket seats 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.860
 leather interior 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.390
 I am taken to have not rolled 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.440
 but to fly away and then besides 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.060
 when I look in my rearview mirror 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.970
 I seem to see is 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.290
 the back of 7.8 I look forward to putting 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.060
 contact by cons what is sure 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.060
 it's going to be quiet 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.139
 concerning driving pleasure the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.790
 comfort the pleasure I want to say 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.160
 what a treat this ride today 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.400
 thank you to all the team of laurent 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.800
 humped and bmw pelras is a real 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.600
 luxury to be able to use seven to eight 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.250
 for a full day 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.669
 so I will be able to detail you the 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.010
 complete list of optional equipment 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.639
 navigation the anti detector 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.440
 collision 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.660
 frankly good there are plenty of things 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.690
 but it goes a little above the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.919
 head there I savor more use 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.919
 overall car 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.590
 for the chassis part then it's a 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.620
 successful course despite 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.360
 small tires in 225 at the front and 245 at 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.610
 the back we talked about earlier 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.290
 well the chassis that is very much the 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.050
 road holding is really exceptional 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.180
 it's very well amortized the inconvenience 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.310
 major is the steering angle 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.020
 frankly for maneuvers in town 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.390
 the slots and where there are not many 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.650
 amplitude and hump a little just his 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.600
 ranks to be choosy 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:37.030
 in any case the chassis is great 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:38.620
 soundproofed it's a real treat for the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.630
 gearbox engine part then there 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.020
 there is a lot to say 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.510
 electric motors at the front 131 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.280
 horses then he is positioned at 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.100
 the front and it acts on the front wheels 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.440
 there are cardans on this bmw the 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.660
 thermal engine is located in position 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.150
 center back with the cards 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.150
 the rear to propel the vehicle the 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.280
 base of this engine is the famous 6 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.620
 cylinders 3 liters bmw 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.240
 except that well there they cut in 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.680
 two so we end up with 3 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.070
 cylinders of a liter 5 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.470
 coupled to a turbo and there we have 231 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.320
 horses so that when we use 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.400
 the two engines one at 3 162 horses and 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.400
 frankly it grows 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.190
 so we have three modes the comfort that 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.340
 combines the two engines we were going 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.740
 copro with the idrive that makes us a 100 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.810
 % electric and we can also have a 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.860
 sport mode 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.660
 so there all the counters were 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.000
 blue and all were sweet as soon as 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.450
 I go into sport mode it becomes red 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.110
 as fire hangs on you young philippe 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:58.130
 it's going to move 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:07:01.130
 oh there or so it's frankly that 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.940
 move and it's nothing fun to 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.940
 the ear too 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.680
 I continue to swallow the miles 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.410
 I wish you a good show all 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.500
 right away the aktu and the heading sport bye 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.500
 bye
