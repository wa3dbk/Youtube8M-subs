hello<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.159> thought<00:00:02.399> I<00:00:02.460> would<00:00:02.610> refill<00:00:03.060> this

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hello so I thought I would refill this

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.120 
hello so I thought I would refill this
video<00:00:03.629> since<00:00:03.959> I<00:00:04.080> still<00:00:04.290> had<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.620> make<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.920> gear

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
video since I still had to make the gear

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.460 
video since I still had to make the gear
for<00:00:05.339> caitlin's<00:00:05.700> arm<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:06.990> time<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.200> made

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
for caitlin's arm so this time I made

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.930 
for caitlin's arm so this time I made
sure<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.740> fully<00:00:07.890> charge<00:00:08.040> my<00:00:08.460> battery<00:00:08.790> before

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
sure to fully charge my battery before

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.870 
sure to fully charge my battery before
starting<00:00:09.620> so<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.889> started<00:00:11.219> off<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.580> paper

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
starting so I started off with a paper

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.299 
starting so I started off with a paper
template<00:00:12.509> then<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.929> traced<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.559> cut<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.099> on

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
template then I traced and cut it out on

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.849 
template then I traced and cut it out on
a<00:00:14.340> piece<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.610> craft<00:00:15.000> foam<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> piece<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.680> foam

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
a piece of craft foam the piece of foam

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.890 
a piece of craft foam the piece of foam
is<00:00:17.070> what<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.789> maintain<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.330> final

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
is what is going to maintain the final

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.779 
is what is going to maintain the final
shape<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.500> want<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.800> make<00:00:19.830> sure<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.460> spend

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
shape so you want to make sure to spend

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.250 
shape so you want to make sure to spend
your<00:00:21.029> time<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.240> making<00:00:21.689> your<00:00:21.720> template<00:00:22.140> as

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
your time on making your template as

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.670 
your time on making your template as
close<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> final<00:00:23.310> outcome<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.850> possible

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
close to the final outcome as possible

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
close to the final outcome as possible
then<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.800> cut<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.039> two<00:00:26.400> pieces<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> worbla<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
then I cut up two pieces of worbla so I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.310 
then I cut up two pieces of worbla so I
could<00:00:27.960> sandwich<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.619> piece<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> craft<00:00:29.400> foam

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
could sandwich that piece of craft foam

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
could sandwich that piece of craft foam
be<00:00:31.320> careful<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.219> part<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
be careful because this part can be a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880 
be careful because this part can be a
little<00:00:33.030> dangerous<00:00:33.210> first<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.410> heated<00:00:34.620> both

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
little dangerous first I heated both

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
little dangerous first I heated both
pieces<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> war<00:00:35.760> blood<00:00:36.000> before<00:00:36.149> sandwich

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
pieces of the war blood before sandwich

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.990 
pieces of the war blood before sandwich
in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> craft<00:00:37.350> foam<00:00:37.530> since<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> worbla

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
in the craft foam since the worbla

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
in the craft foam since the worbla
retains<00:00:39.360> heat<00:00:39.660> while<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.020> still<00:00:40.200> pliable

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
retains heat while it's still pliable

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
retains heat while it's still pliable
this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> when<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> need<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.640> quickly<00:00:41.850> press

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this is when you need to quickly press

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
this is when you need to quickly press
the<00:00:42.510> edges<00:00:42.660> together<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.890> fuse

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the edges together so that they can fuse

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.510 
the edges together so that they can fuse
around<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> edges<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.270> craft<00:00:45.570> foam<00:00:46.520> you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
around the edges of the craft foam you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.920 
around the edges of the craft foam you
can<00:00:47.670> always<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.300> time<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.660> doing

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
can always take your time when doing

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
can always take your time when doing
this<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.320> often<00:00:49.860> air<00:00:50.039> bubbles<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.550> form

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
this because often air bubbles will form

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.270 
this because often air bubbles will form
between<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.510> foam<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> worbla<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
between the foam and the worbla and you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.250 
between the foam and the worbla and you
will<00:00:53.430> want<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> reheat<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.300> shape<00:00:54.539> again<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
will want to reheat your shape again and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
will want to reheat your shape again and
again<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.680> make<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.309> flawless<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.879> possible

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
again to make it as flawless as possible

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.049 
again to make it as flawless as possible
I<00:00:58.190> learned<00:00:59.190> from<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.460> mistakes<00:00:59.850> from<00:00:59.969> last

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I learned from my mistakes from last

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
I learned from my mistakes from last
time<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> cut<00:01:01.079> off<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> excess<00:01:01.800> blah<00:01:02.070> blah

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
time so I cut off the excess blah blah

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
time so I cut off the excess blah blah
and<00:01:02.520> also<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> details<00:01:03.359> while<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.840> was<00:01:04.019> still

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and also the details while it was still

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.289 
and also the details while it was still
pliable<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.150> difficult

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
pliable because it is kind of difficult

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
pliable because it is kind of difficult
to<00:01:06.570> cut<00:01:06.780> through<00:01:06.900> multiple<00:01:07.290> layers<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to cut through multiple layers of the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.080 
to cut through multiple layers of the
worbla<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.939> has<00:01:09.090> cooled<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> solidified

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
worbla when it has cooled and solidified

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.700 
worbla when it has cooled and solidified
then<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> pressed<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.930> small<00:01:13.260> rounded

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
then I pressed it into a small rounded

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
then I pressed it into a small rounded
bowl<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.130> help<00:01:14.310> give<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:14.820> realistic

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bowl to help give it a more realistic

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.890 
bowl to help give it a more realistic
shape<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.820> didn't<00:01:17.820> run<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.119> last<00:01:18.390> time<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
shape I didn't run this last time but I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.960 
shape I didn't run this last time but I
needed<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.350> way<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> attach<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.280> buckle<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
needed a way to attach my buckle on to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.620 
needed a way to attach my buckle on to
my<00:01:21.090> belts<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> took<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.670> piece<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> wire<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
my belts so I took a piece of wire and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
my belts so I took a piece of wire and
covered<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.229> leftover<00:01:25.890> pieces<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
covered it with leftover pieces of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219 
covered it with leftover pieces of
worbla<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> could<00:01:27.360> attach<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> back

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
worbla so I could attach it to the back

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
worbla so I could attach it to the back
of<00:01:28.259> my<00:01:28.500> buckle<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:32.119> found<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> worbla<00:01:33.570> sticks

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
of my buckle I found the worbla sticks

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
of my buckle I found the worbla sticks
to<00:01:34.020> itself<00:01:34.290> best<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:34.799> both<00:01:35.009> parts<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.579> been

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
to itself best when both parts have been

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
to itself best when both parts have been
heated<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> carefully<00:01:37.079> reheated<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> wire

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
heated so I carefully reheated the wire

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
heated so I carefully reheated the wire
attachment<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.820> also<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> parts<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> my

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
attachment and also the parts of my

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.750 
attachment and also the parts of my
