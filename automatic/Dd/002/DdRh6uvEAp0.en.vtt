00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
ground in such a way so that it allows

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
ground in such a way so that it allows
the<00:00:39.450> protein<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.870> shine<00:00:40.170> through<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:40.590> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.200 
the protein to shine through when you
caramelize<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.520> it'll<00:00:41.670> still<00:00:41.850> give<00:00:42.030> us<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
caramelize it but it'll still give us a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
caramelize it but it'll still give us a
nice<00:00:42.360> crust<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.260> also<00:00:43.410> has<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:44.070> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

salt<00:00:44.340> white<00:00:44.550> pepper<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.420> great<00:00:45.960> for

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
salt white pepper to it so great for

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.010 
salt white pepper to it so great for
seasoning<00:00:47.239> all<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.510> let's<00:00:48.719> put<00:00:48.899> these

seasoning all right so let's put these

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.410 
seasoning all right so let's put these
shanks<00:00:49.410> together<00:00:49.739> first<00:00:50.430> thing<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.760> did<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
shanks together first thing I did is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
shanks together first thing I did is
yesterday<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> planned<00:00:52.469> ahead<00:00:52.649> by<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.129> my

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
yesterday I planned ahead by all my

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
yesterday I planned ahead by all my
stuff<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.850> went<00:00:54.090> home<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.930> took<00:00:54.989> my

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
stuff and I went home and I took my

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
stuff and I went home and I took my
shanks<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:55.860> put<00:00:56.100> them<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> plate<00:00:56.610> season

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
shanks out put them on a plate season

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.430 
shanks out put them on a plate season
them<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.239> salt<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> pepper<00:00:57.750> ahead<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> time

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
them with salt and pepper ahead of time

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
them with salt and pepper ahead of time
but<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.039> does<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> draws<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> little

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
but this does is it draws in a little

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
but this does is it draws in a little
bit<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:00.629> flavor<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
bit more flavor for it so it's a little

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
bit more flavor for it so it's a little
bit<00:01:02.100> deeper<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.489> flavor<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.210> end<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.600> I'm

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
bit deeper in flavor in the end so I'm

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
bit deeper in flavor in the end so I'm
at<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> point<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.150> got<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> do

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
at that point now so you got to do

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
at that point now so you got to do
before<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.810> cook<00:01:07.020> them<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.560> come<00:01:07.680> by<00:01:07.890> if

opposed to browning the flour the the
flour<00:01:47.850> helps<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.600> bit<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
flour helps to get a little bit of a

thicken this dish in particular so a
little<00:01:56.369> bit<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> outside<00:01:57.799> just<00:01:58.799> dust<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
little bit on the outside just dust it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.580 
little bit on the outside just dust it
lightly<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.990> gonna<00:02:01.140> allow<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
lightly and that's gonna allow that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440 
lightly and that's gonna allow that
flavor<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.070> meat<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> shine<00:02:02.820> through<00:02:03.030> once<00:02:03.299> we

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.060 
one of the artists and pastas would be
great<00:05:10.780> I'd<00:05:11.780> might<00:05:12.080> mix<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.470> in<00:05:12.590> here<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:12.919> toss
