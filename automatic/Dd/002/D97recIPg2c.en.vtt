00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
shoe thinking that it was going to be

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.690 
shoe thinking that it was going to be
purple<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.170> kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> mix<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.160> between

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
purple it's kind of a mix in between

when they came in the mail they wound up

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550 
when they came in the mail they wound up
being<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> same<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.570> color<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.140> these

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
