do we use collapse to pick up please
watch<00:00:24.600> throttle<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.830> use<00:00:26.930> but<00:00:27.930> throttled

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
watch throttle do you use but throttled

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.479 
watch throttle do you use but throttled
right<00:00:29.210> yes<00:00:30.210> sir<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.990> say<00:00:31.200> I<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:32.189> use<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.400> one

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
right yes sir you say I just use the one

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:41.750 
right yes sir you say I just use the one
thing<00:00:32.730> yoke<00:00:35.329> ok<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> throttle<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.079> yoke

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 

okay<00:00:42.629> well<00:00:42.989> I'm<00:00:43.199> going<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> run<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.679> power<00:00:43.890> up

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
okay well I'm going to run the power up

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.329 
okay well I'm going to run the power up
to<00:00:44.280> fifty<00:00:45.170> percent<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.410> my<00:00:46.589> phys<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.129> power

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
to fifty percent of my phys all my power

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.430 
to fifty percent of my phys all my power
calls<00:00:47.699> are<00:00:48.000> based<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.390> percentages<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.109> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
calls are based on percentages of the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
calls are based on percentages of the
physical<00:00:49.890> throttle<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> should<00:00:51.449> correlate

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
physical throttle so it should correlate

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.719 
physical throttle so it should correlate
to<00:00:52.019> rpms<00:00:53.780> across<00:00:54.780> any<00:00:55.050> throttle<00:00:55.589> but<00:00:55.829> we'll

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
to rpms across any throttle but we'll

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.160 
to rpms across any throttle but we'll
have<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> check<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.539> running<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.049> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
have to check that I'm running it up to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
have to check that I'm running it up to
50<00:00:58.619> right<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:59.039> there's<00:00:59.789> fifty<00:01:00.269> percent

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
50 right now there's fifty percent

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.249 
50 right now there's fifty percent
throttle<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.159> it<00:01:02.309> looks<00:01:02.519> like<00:01:02.729> it's<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.259> 76

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
throttle and it looks like it's about 76

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.740 
throttle and it looks like it's about 76
77<00:01:04.860> percent<00:01:05.399> rpm<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.539> confirm
