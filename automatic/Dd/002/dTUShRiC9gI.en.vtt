00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.390
 or grandma what a surprise that goes 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.120
 I care I'm here with my father 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.330
 but what a foolish woman if you do not 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.910
 she is always looking forward to see you grandma 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.910
 come then now we see you chao 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.840
 ah 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.610
 father 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.800
 father 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.570
 do not run away I said you were 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.740
 you have to fix that damn dais 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.600
 but gÃ¼iza 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.600
 hello, you know how to do it 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.670
 when a stage sounds there is a solution 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.290
 that does not require having to disassemble it and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.210
 reassemble 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.000
 The first thing to do is point out 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.830
 the point the points where they cross what 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.170
 let's do is inject foam 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.110
 polyurethane that you can buy in 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.680
 drugstores in containers like this one like 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.290
 You see comes with a narrow tube 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.000
 you have to protect the platform well because 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.600
 a spot of polyurethane foam is 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.600
 difficult to remove 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.610
 we will place a drill bit in the drill 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.500
 its thickness 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 a hole is made where it sounds 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.530
 in the center of the table better than in a 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.810
 extreme 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.810
 It is also advisable to use gloves and 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.070
 the place is as ventilated as possible 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.290
 the tube is connected and the 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.970
 foam the foam will expand to the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.640
 double its volume so there's no 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.600
 that fill the hole completely 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.550
 especially if we suspect that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.470
 tables are not too rigid because 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.690
 can to pumps and 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.670
 we have waited without stepping in the area to 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.710
 less an hour for the product to be 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.900
 has expanded and dried but still 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.900
 It will take 24 hours to dry completely 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.000
 Now you have to plug the hole 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.130
 we do it with wooden plaster 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.540
 there are different shades and you have to 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.540
 buy the one that matches our 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.410
 stage once the wood pulp dries 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.960
 is chosen to equalize and a layer is given 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.010
 varnish 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.989
 it is no longer crunch 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.720
 these tips will be useful for you 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.519
 perform some simple things but 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.680
 unless you are very handy and have 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.360
 experience let the professionals 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.260
 of reparalia we take care of the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.260
 more serious problems
