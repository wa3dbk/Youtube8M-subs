00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
was just mocked up basically just cotton

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.970 
was just mocked up basically just cotton
tacked<00:00:23.180> together<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.869> where<00:00:24.619> we're<00:00:24.830> at<00:00:24.950> now

project<00:00:40.480> really<00:00:41.480> why<00:00:41.960> we<00:00:42.199> settled<00:00:42.470> on<00:00:42.800> Kevin's

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
project really why we settled on Kevin's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.720 
project really why we settled on Kevin's
work<00:00:43.489> is<00:00:43.730> because<00:00:44.120> he's<00:00:44.590> captured<00:00:45.590> that<00:00:46.190> that

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
work is because he's captured that that

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.509 
work is because he's captured that that
little<00:00:47.180> point<00:00:47.510> between<00:00:48.199> you<00:00:49.040> know<00:00:49.190> the

little point between you know the

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.330 
little point between you know the
realism<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.870> artistic<00:00:51.380> nature<00:00:51.770> in<00:00:52.130> this

realism the artistic nature in this
amazing<00:00:53.329> material<00:00:53.899> sense<00:00:54.200> that<00:00:54.590> I<00:00:54.620> think

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
amazing material sense that I think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.830 
amazing material sense that I think
brings<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:55.550> all<00:00:55.640> together<00:00:55.880> and<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.719> know

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
brings it all together and you know

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.220 
brings it all together and you know
really<00:00:57.380> is<00:00:57.649> evocative<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.370> captures<00:00:59.090> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
really is evocative and captures the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.690 
really is evocative and captures the
power<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.469> white<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:00.739> were<00:01:01.070> going<00:01:01.370> for<00:01:01.520> with

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
power of white that were going for with

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.329 
power of white that were going for with
this<00:01:01.880> ride<00:01:02.149> having<00:01:03.110> Andy<00:01:03.410> come<00:01:03.559> out<00:01:03.710> he's<00:01:04.040> um

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
this ride having Andy come out he's um

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.760 
this ride having Andy come out he's um
he's<00:01:04.580> got<00:01:05.270> a<00:01:05.330> vision<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.930> an<00:01:05.990> idea<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.619> they

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
he's got a vision and an idea that they

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.650 
he's got a vision and an idea that they
want<00:01:07.040> down<00:01:07.280> there<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.820> it's<00:01:08.030> easier<00:01:08.330> for<00:01:08.540> him

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
want down there and it's easier for him

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.600 
want down there and it's easier for him
to<00:01:08.810> be<00:01:08.960> here<00:01:09.140> in<00:01:09.259> person<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.800> correlate<00:01:10.580> that

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
to be here in person and correlate that

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.969 
to be here in person and correlate that
experience<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.930> me<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.350> can<00:01:12.680> kind<00:01:12.920> of

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
experience to me so I can kind of

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.830 
experience to me so I can kind of
incorporate<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.700> into<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.119> piece<00:01:14.300> -<00:01:14.570> so

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
incorporate that into the piece - so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.680 
incorporate that into the piece - so
it's<00:01:15.649> important<00:01:16.640> for<00:01:16.850> him<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.060> come<00:01:17.330> out<00:01:17.450> and

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
it's important for him to come out and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.810 
it's important for him to come out and
see<00:01:17.840> my<00:01:17.960> work<00:01:18.110> in<00:01:18.289> person<00:01:18.649> because<00:01:18.979> nobody<00:01:19.610> can

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
see my work in person because nobody can

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.460 
see my work in person because nobody can
really<00:01:20.119> judge<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.600> work<00:01:20.750> that<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:21.020> do<00:01:21.140> by

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
really judge the work that I do by

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.710 
really judge the work that I do by
pictures

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
pictures

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.450 
pictures

the<00:01:56.409> week's<00:01:56.620> go<00:01:56.740> by<00:01:56.860> fast<00:01:57.250> now<00:01:57.490> we've<00:01:57.670> only<00:01:57.909> got

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
the week's go by fast now we've only got

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.359 
the week's go by fast now we've only got
about<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.690> think<00:01:59.200> nine<00:01:59.470> or<00:01:59.680> ten<00:01:59.950> weeks<00:02:00.130> of

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
about I think nine or ten weeks of

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.980 
about I think nine or ten weeks of
fabrication<00:02:01.000> before<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.600> has<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.869> be

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
fabrication before it has to be

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.740 
fabrication before it has to be
disassembled<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:02.799> ship<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.750> getting

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
disassembled in ship so it's getting

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.550 
disassembled in ship so it's getting
down<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.170> wire<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:07.020> can't<00:02:08.020> help<00:02:08.140> from<00:02:08.350> doing
