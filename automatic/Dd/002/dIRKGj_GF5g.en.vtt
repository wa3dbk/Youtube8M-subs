sites again the idea is to save you a
little<00:02:05.539> bit<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.810> money<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.739> I<00:02:06.770> get<00:02:07.160> what's<00:02:07.369> in

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
little bit of money so I get what's in

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.010 
little bit of money so I get what's in
the<00:02:08.050> insights<00:02:09.050> instead<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.739> looks<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:11.020> have

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
the insights instead of the looks I have

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.920 
the insights instead of the looks I have
cooked<00:02:12.349> all<00:02:12.650> kinds<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.069> stuff<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.610> already

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
cooked all kinds of stuff in it already

cooked all kinds of stuff in it already
I've<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.560> microwave<00:02:16.130> for<00:02:16.280> about<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.700> month

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030

now the microwave I or the stove I just
got<00:02:20.900> today<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:22.250> not<00:02:22.430> fired<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:23.030> up<00:02:23.150> yet

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
got today I have not fired it up yet

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.980 
got today I have not fired it up yet
this<00:02:24.409> is<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.709> first<00:02:24.980> time

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
this is the first time

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.230 
this is the first time
now<00:02:27.110> it's<00:02:27.410> showing<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.800> stall<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.990> 230<00:02:30.220> and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
now it's showing the stall that 230 and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.350 
now it's showing the stall that 230 and
rising<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.800> can<00:02:33.980> change<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.640> setting<00:02:35.060> at

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
rising you can change that setting at

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.460 
rising you can change that setting at
any<00:02:35.510> time<00:02:35.930> as<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.550> preheating

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
any time as you can see it's preheating

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.790 
any time as you can see it's preheating
or<00:02:39.850> just<00:02:40.850> jack<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.570> up<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:42.020> doing<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.380> pizza<00:02:43.270> 450

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
or just jack it up for doing a pizza 450

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.770 
or just jack it up for doing a pizza 450
and<00:02:46.840> giving<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.350> note<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.300> upper

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
and giving you a note you have the upper

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.490 
and giving you a note you have the upper
and<00:02:51.260> lower<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:52.330> memorizes<00:02:53.330> what<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.960> did<00:02:54.200> last

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and lower it memorizes what you did last

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.760 
and lower it memorizes what you did last
so<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.600> was<00:02:56.600> playing<00:02:56.900> around<00:02:57.050> with<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.440> using

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
so I was playing around with it using

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.210 
so I was playing around with it using
the<00:02:57.950> top<00:02:59.350> then<00:03:00.350> he<00:03:00.530> had<00:03:00.650> tops<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.640> top<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:02.180> it

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the top then he had tops the top of it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.640 
the top then he had tops the top of it
as<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.430> can<00:03:04.580> see<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.150> infrared<00:03:05.780> show<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.440> in

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
as you can see the infrared show you in

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.700 
as you can see the infrared show you in
the<00:03:06.770> reflection<00:03:07.690> that's<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.990> infrared

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
the reflection that's the infrared

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.330 
the reflection that's the infrared
