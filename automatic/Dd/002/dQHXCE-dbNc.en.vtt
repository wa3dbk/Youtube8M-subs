00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:01.699 
the pieces of it the deceiver extract

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:05.439 
the pieces of it the deceiver extract
the<00:03:02.569> but<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.379> can<00:03:03.560> burn<00:03:03.859> out<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:05.000> deceiver

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:05.449 
the but you can burn out so the deceiver

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.569 
the but you can burn out so the deceiver
extract<00:03:05.959> is<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.260> main<00:03:06.439> problem<00:03:06.739> when<00:03:07.459> you're

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
extract is the main problem when you're

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.599 
extract is the main problem when you're
playing<00:03:07.790> sprint<00:03:08.180> Splinter<00:03:08.750> twin<00:03:08.989> because<00:03:09.949> it

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
playing sprint Splinter twin because it

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.629 
playing sprint Splinter twin because it
actually<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.150> pretty<00:03:11.239> decent<00:03:11.930> body<00:03:12.109> and<00:03:12.639> at

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
actually is a pretty decent body and at

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.309 
actually is a pretty decent body and at
the<00:03:13.760> same<00:03:13.909> time<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.329> can't<00:03:14.569> burn<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.870> with<00:03:15.139> a

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
the same time you can't burn it with a

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.020 
the same time you can't burn it with a
lightning<00:03:15.680> bolt<00:03:15.980> or<00:03:16.219> anything<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.760> that

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
lightning bolt or anything like that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.759 
lightning bolt or anything like that
so<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.299> have<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.720> figure<00:03:17.900> out<00:03:18.019> another<00:03:18.349> way<00:03:18.739> to

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
so you have to figure out another way to

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.270 
so you have to figure out another way to
get<00:03:19.009> past<00:03:19.189> it<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.909> other<00:03:20.060> card<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.599> two<00:03:20.810> one

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
get past it the other card the two one

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.949 
get past it the other card the two one
is<00:03:22.280> paestum<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:22.909> it's<00:03:23.150> not<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.299> big<00:03:23.540> deal<00:03:23.780> because

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
is paestum I it's not a big deal because

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.080 
is paestum I it's not a big deal because
everything<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.919> can<00:03:25.310> do<00:03:25.579> is<00:03:25.819> you<00:03:25.970> can

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
everything that you can do is you can

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.509 
everything that you can do is you can
remove<00:03:26.509> it<00:03:26.659> easily<00:03:26.840> easily<00:03:27.590> remove<00:03:28.099> that<00:03:28.280> card

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
remove it easily easily remove that card

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.879 
remove it easily easily remove that card
but<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:31.310> one<00:03:31.729> four<00:03:32.239> is<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.689> lot<00:03:33.139> more<00:03:33.349> difficult

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
but the one four is a lot more difficult

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:34.390 
but the one four is a lot more difficult
to<00:03:33.979> remove

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
to remove

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.599 
to remove
so<00:03:35.120> roast<00:03:35.479> comes<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:36.139> play<00:03:36.439> roast<00:03:36.859> also<00:03:37.340> does

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
so roast comes in play roast also does

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.990 
so roast comes in play roast also does
very<00:03:37.879> good<00:03:38.120> against<00:03:38.449> John<00:03:38.750> rhinos<00:03:39.560> are<00:03:40.000> kind

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
very good against John rhinos are kind

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.640 
very good against John rhinos are kind
of<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.269> big<00:03:41.479> deal<00:03:41.780> right<00:03:42.169> now

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
of a big deal right now

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.949 
of a big deal right now
so<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.459> deck<00:03:43.669> is<00:03:43.849> relatively<00:03:44.329> cheap<00:03:44.629> to<00:03:44.659> make

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
so this deck is relatively cheap to make

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.469 
so this deck is relatively cheap to make
it's<00:03:45.169> not<00:03:45.229> like<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.799> expensive<00:03:46.459> deck<00:03:46.639> -<00:03:46.939> to<00:03:47.269> land

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
it's not like a expensive deck - to land

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.270 
it's not like a expensive deck - to land
