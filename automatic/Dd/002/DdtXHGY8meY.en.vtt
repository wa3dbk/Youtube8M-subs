00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.289
 biofuels resulting from the recycling of waste oils into fried foods 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.310
 can be considered to be an even more positive environmental 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.800
 said the uncle's direct investment causes a serious problem of pollution in rivers 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.310
 and water sources 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 Today, Brazil consumes approximately 3 billion liters of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030
 cooking vegetable oil 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.590
 The Center for Studies and Promotion of Group Agriculture the above is a 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.060
 non-governmental organization with headquarters in florianÃ³polis and to 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.660
 collection and filtering of cooking oil to act as biofuel in 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.940
 cars and diesel powered boats 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.790
 these games adds nothing has no transformation after all the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.430
 limited process 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.310
 we just make eye-catching filtration - it's as fuel 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.370
 we have difficulty as fuel pollutes up to 75% - that is to say 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.940
 What represents 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.299
 a significant resource saving 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.570
 for being a cheaper option 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 the idea is to establish partnerships with fishermen however on the 23rd that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.620
 recycled 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.980
 prices of the products they 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.390
 then I know if the factor is just incorrect and lords of crisis like 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.259
 raw material 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.190
 concerned to maintain these relations 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.679
 the team is getting what it is producing 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:35.770
 the farmer 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.219
 you have difficulties and 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.640
 she said the producer needs to be dependent on another piglet party if 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.270
 will have passed this blog 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.400
 is composed of multiple channels with one eye which would be thrown a summary of the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 rivers will have a facility but this ecological product the lowest value 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.620
 and goes to the coast as a consequence 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.850
 including will be the one who has a top trainer 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.170
 with the project begins to consume an ecological product 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 the low cost 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.889
 not 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.629
 she 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.399
 one hour 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.699
 This is an affront to honor. 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.589
 all the time 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.669
 not 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.080
 the German 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:48.969
 I voted not to fear
