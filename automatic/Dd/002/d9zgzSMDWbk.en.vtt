00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.510 
must be winding down Jeff you're exactly
right<00:02:07.899> Marc<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.500> storm<00:02:08.800> has<00:02:09.130> pretty<00:02:09.429> much

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
right Marc the storm has pretty much

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.450 
right Marc the storm has pretty much
wound<00:02:10.000> down<00:02:10.360> except<00:02:11.110> for<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.350> wind<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.920> the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
wound down except for the wind and the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.950 
wound down except for the wind and the
cold<00:02:12.640> air<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.180> being<00:02:13.420> brought<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:13.810> on

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
cold air that's being brought in on

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.570 
cold air that's being brought in on
those<00:02:14.110> strong<00:02:14.410> west<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.010> northwesterly

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
those strong west and northwesterly

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580 
those strong west and northwesterly
winds<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> wind<00:02:16.720> chill<00:02:16.900> factor<00:02:16.930> still<00:02:17.560> a

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
winds so the wind chill factor still a

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.990 
winds so the wind chill factor still a
bit<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.920> problem<00:02:18.130> here<00:02:18.370> today<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.850> we're

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
bit of a problem here today and we're

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.470 
bit of a problem here today and we're
going<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.150> have

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
going to have

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.330 
going to have
blowing<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.050> drifting<00:02:20.080> which<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.099> going<00:02:21.250> to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
blowing and drifting which is going to

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.280 
blowing and drifting which is going to
cause<00:02:21.519> some<00:02:21.550> problems<00:02:22.239> with<00:02:22.930> some<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
cause some problems with some of the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.440 
cause some problems with some of the
roadways<00:02:23.849> particularly<00:02:24.849> ones<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.299> not

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
roadways particularly ones that have not

been plowed or even the ones that have
been<00:02:26.830> plowed<00:02:27.069> are<00:02:27.370> probably<00:02:27.909> going<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.150> drift

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
been plowed are probably going to drift

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.300 
been plowed are probably going to drift
back<00:02:28.450> shut<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.200> they're<00:02:29.379> gonna<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:30.040> bit<00:02:30.280> of

back shut so they're gonna have a bit of

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.160 
back shut so they're gonna have a bit of
a<00:02:30.459> problem<00:02:30.670> keeping<00:02:31.150> those<00:02:31.299> roads<00:02:31.599> open

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170
