00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
rather everybody had telepathy or ever

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.599 
rather everybody had telepathy or ever
nobody<00:00:23.910> wore<00:00:24.180> clothes<00:00:24.539> anymore<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.580> don't

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
nobody wore clothes anymore and I don't

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.109 
nobody wore clothes anymore and I don't
know<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:28.130> it's<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.699> happening

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
know if this is like it's just happening

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.680 
know if this is like it's just happening
right<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.640> how<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.090> came

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
right now or if this is just how we came

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.569 
right now or if this is just how we came
to<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.950> always<00:00:35.130> been<00:00:35.280> this

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to be like it's just always been this

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.080 
to be like it's just always been this
way<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:36.000> humans<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:37.309> if<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.520> had<00:00:38.550> always

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
way for humans I think if we had always

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
way for humans I think if we had always
had<00:00:39.360> telepathy<00:00:39.860> things<00:00:40.860> would<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.070> very

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
had telepathy things would be very

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.970 
had telepathy things would be very
different<00:00:41.610> right<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:43.410> would<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.739> made

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
different right like we would have made

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.319 
different right like we would have made
machines<00:00:44.489> probably<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.640> simulate<00:00:47.640> telepathy

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
machines probably the simulate telepathy

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.779 
machines probably the simulate telepathy
instead<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.890> wouldn't<00:00:50.280> speak<00:00:50.550> out

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
instead of like we wouldn't speak out

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.150 
instead of like we wouldn't speak out
loud<00:00:50.820> probably<00:00:51.809> ever<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.710> would<00:00:52.860> laugh

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
loud probably ever like we would laugh

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
loud probably ever like we would laugh
assuming<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.180> still<00:00:54.300> had<00:00:54.539> vocal<00:00:54.870> cords<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
assuming we still had vocal cords and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.360 
assuming we still had vocal cords and
everything<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> could<00:00:55.710> speak<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.160> probably

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
everything it could speak we probably

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
everything it could speak we probably
won't<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.730> develop<00:00:57.120> spoken<00:00:57.510> language<00:00:57.930> right

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
won't know develop spoken language right

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.799 
won't know develop spoken language right
we'd<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.640> would<00:00:59.789> still<00:00:59.910> laugh<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.420> make

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
we'd like we would still laugh and make

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
we'd like we would still laugh and make
noises<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.440> things<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> use

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
noises and things but we want to use

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.620 
noises and things but we want to use
that<00:01:03.149> way<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> communicate<00:01:03.870> mostly<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:06.150> we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that way to communicate mostly so we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
that way to communicate mostly so we
would<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> sub<00:01:07.619> telephones<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.340> would

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
would like and sub telephones we would

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
would like and sub telephones we would
have<00:01:08.610> liked<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> let<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> phones<00:01:10.260> or

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
have liked to let the phones or

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
have liked to let the phones or
something<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
something and I don't know and then you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.719 
something and I don't know and then you
have<00:01:16.170> clothes<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.890> closer<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.460> kind<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
have clothes and closer just kind of

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.969 
have clothes and closer just kind of
weird<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.650> thinking<00:01:19.770> about

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
weird right like I was thinking about

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.679 
weird right like I was thinking about
this<00:01:20.250> today<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.030> why<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
this today I don't know why but on the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.410 
this today I don't know why but on the
way<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> work<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.409> thinking<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.790> aliens

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
way to work I was thinking if aliens

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.510 
way to work I was thinking if aliens
came<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> study<00:01:25.380> does<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.250> probably

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
came and study does they would probably

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.249 
came and study does they would probably
think<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> was<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.299> weird<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.049> wear

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
think it was really weird that we wear

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.980 
think it was really weird that we wear
clothes<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:30.210> none<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
clothes all the time like none of the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.010 
clothes all the time like none of the
other<00:01:31.170> species<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.979> earth<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:33.420> Jack

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
other species on earth do that like Jack

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
other species on earth do that like Jack
doesn't<00:01:34.409> feel<00:01:34.920> any<00:01:35.070> reason<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> wear<00:01:35.820> clothes

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
doesn't feel any reason to wear clothes

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
doesn't feel any reason to wear clothes
ever<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.750> used<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.530> totally<00:01:38.100> naked<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
ever I used to totally naked all the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
ever I used to totally naked all the
time<00:01:38.700> he's<00:01:39.150> fine<00:01:39.450> he<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.079> outside<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
time he's fine he was outside in the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560 
time he's fine he was outside in the
rain<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.310> didn't<00:01:41.939> bother<00:01:42.119> him<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.450> all

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
rain just now didn't bother him at all

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
rain just now didn't bother him at all
right<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.619> probably<00:01:43.950> thinks<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.280> weird<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
right it probably thinks it's weird that

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.560 
right it probably thinks it's weird that
we're<00:01:44.759> we're<00:01:44.880> close<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.759> oh<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.450> was

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
we're we're close to so oh but I was

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.010 
we're we're close to so oh but I was
thinking<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.170> weird<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.880> also<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.750> your

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
thinking it's weird that also like your

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.999 
thinking it's weird that also like your
head<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:54.210> holds<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> most<00:01:54.960> vital<00:01:55.350> organ

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
head is it holds the most vital organ

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.219 
head is it holds the most vital organ

now because I you can't really I can't
make<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.690> decision<00:03:57.900> like<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.440> for<00:03:58.830> all<00:03:58.950> of

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
make a decision like that for all of

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.390 
make a decision like that for all of
humanity<00:03:59.420> like<00:04:00.420> for<00:04:00.930> their<00:04:01.500> whole<00:04:01.680> course<00:04:02.190> of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
humanity like for their whole course of

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.550 
humanity like for their whole course of
how<00:04:02.640> they<00:04:02.880> developed<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.690> can't<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.320> I

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
how they developed I can't do that I

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.800 
how they developed I can't do that I
don't<00:04:04.740> want<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:04.920> kind<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.160> responsibility

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
don't want that kind of responsibility

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.110 
don't want that kind of responsibility
so<00:04:07.130> telepathic<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.580> would<00:04:08.730> be<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:08.850> good

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
so telepathic like this would be a good

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.970 
so telepathic like this would be a good
thing<00:04:09.390> once<00:04:09.750> we<00:04:09.930> all<00:04:10.050> stopped<00:04:10.320> freaking<00:04:10.830> out

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
thing once we all stopped freaking out

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.040 
thing once we all stopped freaking out
about<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.640> think<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.480> would<00:04:12.690> be<00:04:12.720> great

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
about it I think this would be great

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.949 
about it I think this would be great
because<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.550> won't<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.180> talk<00:04:15.390> anymore<00:04:15.630> I

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
because you won't have to talk anymore I

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.539 
because you won't have to talk anymore I
wonder<00:04:16.170> if<00:04:16.260> there's<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.470> range<00:04:16.830> if<00:04:17.190> there's<00:04:17.400> no

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
wonder if there's a range if there's no

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.849 
wonder if there's a range if there's no
range<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:18.270> don't<00:04:18.690> know<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:19.020> internet<00:04:19.500> service

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
range I don't know like internet service

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.349 
range I don't know like internet service
providers<00:04:20.370> would<00:04:20.609> all<00:04:20.760> go<00:04:20.970> out<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.209> business

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
providers would all go out of business

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.060 
providers would all go out of business
because<00:04:21.660> who<00:04:21.870> needs<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.290> internet<00:04:22.620> if<00:04:22.800> we<00:04:22.919> can

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
because who needs the internet if we can

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.350 
because who needs the internet if we can
just<00:04:23.100> communicate<00:04:23.370> telepathically<00:04:26.150> can<00:04:27.150> you

not<00:04:47.639> just<00:04:47.909> totally<00:04:48.300> uncontrolled<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.960> would

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
not just totally uncontrolled it would

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.390 
not just totally uncontrolled it would
have<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.259> be<00:04:49.289> regulated<00:04:50.069> by<00:04:50.219> the<00:04:50.250> government

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400

if<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.599> could<00:04:51.780> just<00:04:51.830> broadcast<00:04:52.830> thoughts<00:04:53.189> to

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
if you could just broadcast thoughts to

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.339 
if you could just broadcast thoughts to
anyone<00:04:53.759> you<00:04:53.909> wanted<00:04:54.240> there<00:04:54.810> would<00:04:54.990> be<00:04:55.020> like

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
anyone you wanted there would be like

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.260 
anyone you wanted there would be like
thought<00:04:55.830> pollution<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.819> would<00:04:56.939> be<00:04:57.090> just

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
thought pollution it would be just

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.749 
thought pollution it would be just
insane<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.860> maybe<00:04:59.039> that<00:04:59.280> wouldn't<00:04:59.550> be<00:04:59.610> the

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
insane so maybe that wouldn't be the

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.200 
insane so maybe that wouldn't be the
best<00:04:59.789> thing<00:05:00.150> ever<00:05:00.330> or<00:05:01.099> everyone's<00:05:02.099> naked<00:05:02.340> now

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
best thing ever or everyone's naked now

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.480 
best thing ever or everyone's naked now
does<00:05:03.930> this<00:05:04.110> mean<00:05:04.379> you're<00:05:04.529> just<00:05:04.770> always<00:05:04.979> naked

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
does this mean you're just always naked

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.969 
does this mean you're just always naked
because<00:05:05.879> then<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.509> can't<00:05:06.810> go<00:05:07.050> outside<00:05:07.229> when

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
because then you can't go outside when

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.189 
because then you can't go outside when
it's<00:05:08.159> like<00:05:08.370> really<00:05:08.789> cold<00:05:09.120> outside<00:05:09.360> or<00:05:09.900> you'll

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
it's like really cold outside or you'll

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.890 
it's like really cold outside or you'll
just<00:05:10.439> literally<00:05:10.979> die<00:05:11.189> right<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:12.090> can't<00:05:12.360> the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
just literally die right you can't the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.529 
just literally die right you can't the
humans<00:05:13.439> couldn't<00:05:13.770> live<00:05:14.099> in<00:05:14.460> certain<00:05:15.210> parts<00:05:15.479> of

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
humans couldn't live in certain parts of

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.360 
humans couldn't live in certain parts of
the<00:05:15.659> world<00:05:15.810> anymore<00:05:18.169> but<00:05:19.169> I<00:05:19.199> guess<00:05:19.620> overall<00:05:20.069> it

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
the world anymore but I guess overall it

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.800 
the world anymore but I guess overall it
would<00:05:20.490> be<00:05:20.610> better<00:05:20.819> for<00:05:20.939> everyone<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.479> be<00:05:21.569> naked

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
would be better for everyone to be naked

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.390 
would be better for everyone to be naked
