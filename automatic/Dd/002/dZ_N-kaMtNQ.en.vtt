00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
installed red works on this computer

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.020 
installed red works on this computer
before<00:01:09.350> they'll<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.560> install<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.549> takes<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
before they'll just install that takes a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
before they'll just install that takes a
few<00:01:12.090> seconds<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.990> jump<00:01:13.260> around<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.040> look

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
few seconds you can jump around and look

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
thank you for choosing red works press

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.530 
thank you for choosing red works press
backspace<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.250> return<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.210> then<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.390> just

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
backspace to return and then you just

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.290 
backspace to return and then you just
quit<00:01:30.060> basically<00:01:31.060> take<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.690> floppy<00:01:31.990> disk<00:01:32.320> out

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
quit basically take the floppy disk out

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.090 
quit basically take the floppy disk out
it<00:01:34.300> shuts<00:01:34.600> off<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:35.110> can<00:01:35.230> lock<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.650> terminal

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.190 
red box this is just amazing if you type
in<00:01:42.930> programs<00:01:44.520> look<00:01:45.520> at<00:01:45.610> all<00:01:45.730> that<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.990> if<00:01:47.110> you

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
in programs look at all that now if you

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.640 
in programs look at all that now if you
placed<00:01:47.440> on<00:01:47.590> another<00:01:47.920> computer<00:01:51.120> programs<00:01:52.650> look

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
placed on another computer programs look

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.340 
placed on another computer programs look
at<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.980> that's<00:01:54.250> just<00:01:54.460> tiny<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:56.229> look

there's like so much more stuff it's not
only<00:01:58.780> useful<00:01:58.990> for<00:01:59.170> coders<00:01:59.770> there's<00:02:00.490> games

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
only useful for coders there's games

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.050 
only useful for coders there's games
there's<00:02:02.950> worm<00:02:03.430> there's<00:02:04.260> so<00:02:05.260> much<00:02:05.530> stuff<00:02:05.770> and

yeah the by far the most useful if you
want<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.430> learn<00:02:12.750> coding<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.440> computer<00:02:15.280> craft

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
want to learn coding in computer craft

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.600 
want to learn coding in computer craft
is<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.840> tutorial<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.650> learnt<00:02:17.920> almost

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
is the tutorial I learnt almost

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.150 
is the tutorial I learnt almost
everything<00:02:19.270> kind<00:02:19.480> off<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.740> rest<00:02:20.980> I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
if you want to start coding because I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.979 
if you want to start coding because I
reckon<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.730> best<00:02:40.030> resource<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.930> you

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
reckon it's the best resource that you

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.830 
reckon it's the best resource that you
can<00:02:41.230> get<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.890> learning<00:02:42.340> coding<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.420> computer

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
can get for learning coding and computer

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.509 
can get for learning coding and computer
craft<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.550> few<00:02:45.550> other<00:02:45.730> things<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.450> we've<00:02:46.720> got

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
craft a few other things that we've got

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.120 
craft a few other things that we've got
is<00:02:48.519> like<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.450> bunch<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.840> health<00:02:50.080> help<00:02:50.590> topics

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
is like a bunch of health help topics
