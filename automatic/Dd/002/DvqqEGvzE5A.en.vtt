00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 may have had the idea of giving us gods 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.970
 lifts they don't have are not 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
 been held in contraction for that 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.179
 which concerns difficult positions which 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 for timing 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.519
 I also remember the positions as estates 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.610
 ferace three seconds as I know continues 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.040
 steps though 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.930
 seen so I want to try to find out later 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.760
 look at me pdf which ones were the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.840
 things that you didn't like because if you 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.630
 go to notice the program is liked 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.460
 also in the components for which surely 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 there had been some in the top 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 where you have already pointed it out 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.440
 during the trout, however, see pdf for 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.730
 going to understand exactly is the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.770
 detail what the problem was 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 main is now we follow ekaterina 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.800
 riazanova ilia tkachenko they present 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.680
 nino rota music of the godfather with 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.650
 their walter meister her remodeled 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.090
 at a time they held 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.090
 55 80 of the order 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.730
 Yup 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.930
 ekaterina riazanova conceived a hundred ha 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.660
 presented the program on music well 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.530
 sabrina is very classic very soft 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.220
 in bagher of marbles in this last one 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.750
 part was a waltz a theme that often 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.669
 we have seen it proposed we have seen 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.530
 last year also proposed by one 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.810
 our Italian photo of charlene 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.240
 guignard de marco fabbri is that if the 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.610
 league will not agorÃ  and are in the row good 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.889
 let's quickly remember that he works at 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.860
 March there will be world championships 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.699
 junior in March I recommend the real one 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.380
 Milan 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.240
 inquire come numerous see 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.460
 this event which is very important is 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.460
 very nice to have it in italy February 25th 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.949
 3 mar here is to be thanks for the date 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.419
 correct I recommend so in short 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.470
 remembered by everyone an appointment 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:51.039
 important then let's see here this is 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.090
 just a detail here it is I have 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.000
 seen that this is the element that 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.830
 the other in fact has now done a little 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.380
 I have special technical work 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.389
 marked some of the elements I have a doubt 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:08.150
 because the lifts must be up 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.759
 different designs we must xj definitely 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.310
 where the rotationals pay we have i 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.820
 uprisings in law and the stations 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.100
 agricultural products that are immediately 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.199
 then we have features 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.840
 of the difficulty elements both for 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:26.530
 that man who must be in position 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.930
 difficult to take the woman and I have 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.270
 doubts about the two lifts where he 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.240
 he was in the moon position because both 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.770
 they did not have clear the thread of 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.350
 entry for which it would be to go to 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.380
 see the replay a little better the 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.060
 drawing that is if to be considered straight 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.280
 line lift chrono left and then give a 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.039
 understand if these feature features of 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.500
 difficulties are considered or not 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:54.300
 this is the only thing that would come to me from 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.199
 go and see then we had one 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.930
 perspective a little too far away for 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.729
 what concerns the top for which 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.410
 there and maybe he'll check him out a little 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.030
 its low position to see if it was 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.280
 quite low these are the 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.949
 technical elements to go and see 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.150
 exactly to go now maybe a 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.220
 interpret to understand maybe a 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.930
 those are the technical score 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.449
 points those ideas that we can keep 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.130
 considering your lucidity 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.050
 because so much studied and there are anna 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.510
 cappellini and luca lanotte thank you for 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.580
 to have reminded me of the deadline 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:27.639
 there really is an expectation 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.320
 incredible for anna cappellini and luca 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.080
 lanotte was born of me premier and the 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.699
 score of the same aisle nada 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.789
 I refuse to do if I remember anna e 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:35.789
 luca 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:48.240
 as we read 87 59 the best dance with 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:52.260
 41 was implemented 45 technical and 95 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:55.120
 for what it concerns make up for a 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:58.770
 total of 143 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.139
 at 90 now I am in a very position 

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:04.930
 staff with the couple members 

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:07.090
 trained by massimo scali personally 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.510
 in bolzano I preferred his level of 

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.510
 interpretation
