hello there what I'm showing you today

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.809 
hello there what I'm showing you today
is<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.370> buck<00:00:02.669> model<00:00:03.179> 721<00:00:04.110> slimline<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.100> this

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
is the buck model 721 slimline and this

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.579 
is the buck model 721 slimline and this
knife<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.210> kind<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.569> unique<00:00:06.899> because<00:00:06.930> it<00:00:07.560> is

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
knife is kind of unique because it is

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.890 
knife is kind of unique because it is
actually<00:00:08.099> only<00:00:08.130> available<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:09.000> Walmart<00:00:09.269> and

actually only available at Walmart and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.950 
actually only available at Walmart and
so<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> suppose<00:00:11.219> Walmart<00:00:11.730> has<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.210> clout<00:00:12.570> that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
so I suppose Walmart has the clout that

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.320 
so I suppose Walmart has the clout that
they<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.620> get<00:00:13.740> manufacturers<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.790> buck<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
they can get manufacturers like buck to

produce an exclusive knife and that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.380 
produce an exclusive knife and that
increases<00:00:17.640> sales<00:00:18.170> for<00:00:19.170> them<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.619> kind<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.520> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
722 Spitfire and they look very similar

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
722 Spitfire and they look very similar
on<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.579> glance<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.540> few

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
on first glance but there are a few

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.869 
on first glance but there are a few
subtle<00:00:36.960> differences<00:00:37.559> between<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.550> two<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
subtle differences between the two and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.280 
subtle differences between the two and
this<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.020> right<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.350> being<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.739> 720<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:42.290> of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this one right here being the 720 one of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.830 
this one right here being the 720 one of
course<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.300> marked<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> blade

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
course you see that marked on the blade

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.880 
course you see that marked on the blade
right<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.350> 721<00:00:47.719> called<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> slimline<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
right there 721 called the slimline and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
right there 721 called the slimline and
it<00:00:49.950> definitely<00:00:50.520> earns<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.030> name<00:00:51.239> because

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it definitely earns that name because

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
it definitely earns that name because
you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:51.989> how<00:00:52.199> thin<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.670> knife<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you can see how thin the knife is and it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.950 
you can see how thin the knife is and it
comes<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.510> retail<00:00:57.899> $30.00<00:00:58.710> Walmart<00:00:59.960> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
know three different finishes this one's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520 
know three different finishes this one's
the<00:01:02.820> gray<00:01:03.120> finish<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.320> like

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the gray finish which I really like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.560 
the gray finish which I really like
because<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.400> close

because when you look at it up close

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.760 
because when you look at it up close

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so main difference between this knife

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390 
so main difference between this knife
here<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> its<00:01:27.930> sister<00:01:28.290> knife<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> 722

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
here and its sister knife the 722

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.300 
here and its sister knife the 722
Spitfire<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.409> number<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> blade<00:01:32.040> shape

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
Spitfire is number one the blade shape

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
Spitfire is number one the blade shape
right<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.150> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> more<00:01:33.780> rounded<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
right here it's kind of more rounded I

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.289 
right here it's kind of more rounded I
guess<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.159> could<00:01:35.280> say<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.759> spear<00:01:36.060> tip

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
guess you could say more of a spear tip

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.780 
guess you could say more of a spear tip
compared<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> drop<00:01:37.409> point<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
compared to the drop point of the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.230 
compared to the drop point of the
Spitfire<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.100> then<00:01:41.100> other<00:01:42.000> main<00:01:42.210> difference

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
Spitfire and then other main difference

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.060 
Spitfire and then other main difference
is<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.020> look<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.350> handle<00:01:43.710> here

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
is when you look at this handle here

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.300 
is when you look at this handle here
it's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.820> bit<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.119> contoured<00:01:45.950> right<00:01:46.950> here

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it's a bit more contoured right here

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
it's a bit more contoured right here
where<00:01:47.460> my<00:01:47.490> fingers<00:01:47.939> rubbing<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
where my fingers rubbing so it's a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.310 
where my fingers rubbing so it's a
thinner<00:01:49.619> dimension<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.090> than<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
thinner dimension right here than the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.639 
thinner dimension right here than the
Spitfire<00:01:53.570> but<00:01:54.570> everything<00:01:55.020> else<00:01:55.200> looks<00:01:55.320> very

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
Spitfire but everything else looks very

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.469 
Spitfire but everything else looks very
similar<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.399> first<00:01:56.640> glance<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.270> look

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
similar and on first glance they look

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.630 
similar and on first glance they look
almost<00:01:57.659> identical<00:01:58.009> they<00:01:59.009> come<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> same

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
almost identical they come in the same

look at that center pivot right there as

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.300 
look at that center pivot right there as
I<00:02:30.569> move<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> knife<00:02:31.290> up<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.680> down<00:02:31.799> it's<00:02:32.159> kind

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
I move the knife up and down it's kind

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.460 
I move the knife up and down it's kind
of<00:02:32.370> Wiggly<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.849> look<00:02:33.659> at<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> lock<00:02:34.079> right

here<00:02:34.560> where<00:02:34.799> my<00:02:34.890> thumb<00:02:34.920> was<00:02:35.370> I'll<00:02:36.209> try<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.569> get

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
here where my thumb was I'll try and get

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.660 
here where my thumb was I'll try and get
it<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.840> camera<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:38.939> I<00:02:39.120> move<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.510> laid<00:02:40.670> up

it on camera so as I move that laid up

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.300 
it on camera so as I move that laid up
and<00:02:41.879> down<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.450> does<00:02:42.720> wiggle<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.889> while<00:02:44.099> you're

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.960 
and down it does wiggle so while you're
cutting<00:02:44.549> something<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:46.230> might<00:02:46.409> notice<00:02:46.709> that

was a little bit of side-to-side play
when<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.560> first<00:02:49.889> got<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.400> tightened<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
when I first got it but I tightened the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.839 
when I first got it but I tightened the
pivot<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.989> there<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.409> that<00:02:53.280> tightened<00:02:53.730> out

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
pivot right there and that tightened out

action it flings right out retention is
good<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.400> saw<00:03:12.030> another<00:03:12.209> video<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.720> YouTube

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
good I saw another video on YouTube

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.259 
good I saw another video on YouTube
where<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.349> retention<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:14.010> very<00:03:14.220> poor<00:03:14.549> and

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
where the retention was very poor and

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.559 
where the retention was very poor and
holding<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.780> knife<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.199> the<00:03:16.319> handle<00:03:17.419> and<00:03:18.419> if

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
holding the knife in the handle and if

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.449 
holding the knife in the handle and if
that's<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.900> case<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.530> adjust<00:03:19.919> this<00:03:20.099> screw

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
that's the case I you adjust this screw

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.520 
that's the case I you adjust this screw
right<00:03:20.489> here<00:03:20.699> and<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.989> increases<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
right here and that increases the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.699 
right here and that increases the
tightness<00:03:23.129> on<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.639> lock<00:03:23.940> bar<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.049> that'll

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
tightness on the lock bar and that'll

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.439 
tightness on the lock bar and that'll
make<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:25.859> either<00:03:26.099> impossible<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.909> open<00:03:27.030> or

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
make it either impossible to open or

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.229 
make it either impossible to open or
nice<00:03:28.199> and<00:03:28.470> springy<00:03:28.829> myrtle<00:03:29.489> return<00:03:29.909> on<00:03:30.090> its

nice and springy myrtle return on its

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.839 
nice and springy myrtle return on its

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.770
