will but you want to tap not rub so it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.980 
will but you want to tap not rub so it
sounds<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:17.009> should<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.310> easy<00:01:17.460> enough

okay<00:02:19.999> and<00:02:20.999> I<00:02:21.180> guess<00:02:21.390> now<00:02:21.689> we<00:02:21.749> wait<00:02:24.590> so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
okay and I guess now we wait so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.140 
okay and I guess now we wait so
apparently<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.219> can<00:02:26.340> put<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.549> top<00:02:26.730> back<00:02:26.790> on

this and keep using it which is great so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.589 
this and keep using it which is great so
it's<00:02:30.209> not<00:02:30.359> a<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.719> used<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.969> the<00:02:32.969> instructions

say it's about two to three uses maybe

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.599 
say it's about two to three uses maybe
even<00:02:40.079> more<00:02:40.260> depending<00:02:40.799> on<00:02:40.920> what<00:02:41.099> area<00:02:41.280> you're
