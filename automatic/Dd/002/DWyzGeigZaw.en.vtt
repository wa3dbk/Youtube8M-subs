00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
black ops 2 and I found actually that

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.679 
black ops 2 and I found actually that
it's<00:00:25.830> not<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.400> don't<00:00:26.760> know<00:00:26.849> exactly<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.539> going

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689

it's not I don't know exactly is going
to<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.140> black<00:00:28.349> ops<00:00:28.560> 2<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.039> there<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.609> thing

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to be black ops 2 but there is one thing

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.389 
to be black ops 2 but there is one thing
that<00:00:29.910> I'm<00:00:30.240> almost<00:00:31.009> completely<00:00:32.009> sure<00:00:32.369> about

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
that I'm almost completely sure about

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.450 
that I'm almost completely sure about
like<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> money<00:00:33.180> nine<00:00:33.390> percent<00:00:33.930> sure<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:35.190> this

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
like a money nine percent sure that this

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.110 
like a money nine percent sure that this
is<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.239> black<00:00:36.390> ops<00:00:36.600> 2<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
is going to be in black ops 2 and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
is going to be in black ops 2 and
hopefully<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> screen<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.780> there

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
hopefully in the screen right now there

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.860 
hopefully in the screen right now there
should<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.770> um<00:00:41.510> this<00:00:42.510> picture<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
should be um this picture it's a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
should be um this picture it's a
quadrotor<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:46.980> it's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
quadrotor I think that's what it's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.479 
quadrotor I think that's what it's
called<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.899> what<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:52.129> it's<00:00:53.129> kind<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
called and what it is is a it's kind of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.319 
called and what it is is a it's kind of
like<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.750> like<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> black<00:00:55.500> NRC<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.910> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
like a like a black NRC like you can you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.260 
like a like a black NRC like you can you
can<00:00:57.510> control<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.379> um<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.579> remote

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
can control it with um with a remote

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.250 
can control it with um with a remote
control<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> gun<00:01:03.539> attached<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
control and it has a gun attached to it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.969 
control and it has a gun attached to it
and<00:01:04.409> there's<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> camera<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.470> control

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and there's a camera so the control

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.789 
and there's a camera so the control
actually<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.390> screen<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.619> can

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
actually has a screen so that you can

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.420 
actually has a screen so that you can
see<00:01:11.299> where<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.310> know

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430

and<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:15.720> cool<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.700> reason

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and it's it's pretty cool and the reason

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
and it's it's pretty cool and the reason
why<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.210> called<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.479> quadrotor<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.350> because

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
why it's called a quadrotor is because

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
why it's called a quadrotor is because
it<00:01:19.830> has<00:01:19.860> four<00:01:20.610> rotors<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.450> help<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.229> know

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it has four rotors to help it you know

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.330 
it has four rotors to help it you know
fly<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:24.119> found<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.689> video<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> video
