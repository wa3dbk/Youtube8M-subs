that<00:02:23.470> well<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:23.710> beginners<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:25.180> me<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
that well for beginners like me but I

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.060 
that well for beginners like me but I
figured<00:02:26.740> out<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> way<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.220> use<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.730> basically

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
figured out a way we use it I basically

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.630 
figured out a way we use it I basically
open<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.490> I<00:02:30.670> kind<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:32.940> rub<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.150> access<00:02:34.750> I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
open it and I kind of I rub the access I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.080 
open it and I kind of I rub the access I
hear<00:02:36.640> any<00:02:36.850> like<00:02:37.770> take<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.980> access<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.820> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
hear any like take the access and I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.080 
hear any like take the access and I
basically<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:41.070> run<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.220> along<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.640> edges

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
basically just run it along the edges

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.510 
basically just run it along the edges
I'll<00:02:43.630> just<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.590> get<00:02:44.770> because<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.310> don't<00:02:45.460> want

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
I'll just to get because I don't want

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.020 
I'll just to get because I don't want
that<00:02:45.880> thick<00:02:46.360> line<00:02:46.720> oh<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.890> when<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.220> apply<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.730> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
that thick line oh and when I apply it I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.280 
that thick line oh and when I apply it I
apply<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.910> not<00:02:52.150> along<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.020> edge<00:02:53.170> of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
apply it so it's not along the edge of

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.790 
apply it so it's not along the edge of
my<00:02:53.350> eye<00:02:53.440> but<00:02:53.620> like<00:02:55.440> perpendicular<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.650> my<00:02:56.770> eye

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
my eye but like perpendicular to my eye

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.970 
my eye but like perpendicular to my eye
so<00:02:57.190> it's<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.720> pointing<00:02:58.720> at<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:59.170> know<00:02:59.860> what<00:02:59.950> I
