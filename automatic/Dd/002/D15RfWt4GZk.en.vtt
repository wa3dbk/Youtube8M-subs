hey<00:00:15.450> guys<00:00:15.690> welcome<00:00:16.109> back<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.500> another

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
hey guys welcome back to another

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.029 
hey guys welcome back to another
tutorial<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.359> previously<00:00:18.750> done<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.800> on

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
tutorial I have previously done one on

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.150 
tutorial I have previously done one on
doing<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> insides<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> windows<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.260> I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
doing the insides of the windows and I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.790 
doing the insides of the windows and I
figured<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.760> was<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.269> proper<00:00:24.930> opportunity<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
figured this was a proper opportunity to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
figured this was a proper opportunity to
show<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> how<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.029> outsides<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
show you how I do the outsides of the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.189 
show you how I do the outsides of the
window<00:00:28.529> trim<00:00:28.910> in<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.179> case<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> window<00:00:30.929> trim

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
window trim in this case the window trim

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.000 
window trim in this case the window trim
is<00:00:31.880> molded<00:00:32.880> into<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> clear<00:00:33.600> parts<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.800> has

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
is molded into the clear parts so it has

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.150 
is molded into the clear parts so it has
a<00:00:35.040> sort<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.730> raised<00:00:36.000> edge<00:00:36.800> basically<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> just

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
a sort of a raised edge basically I just

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
a sort of a raised edge basically I just
apply<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> big<00:00:38.850> piece<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.270> tape<00:00:39.480> over<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.989> run<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
apply a big piece of tape over it run a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.190 
apply a big piece of tape over it run a
toothpick<00:00:41.280> along<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> line<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:42.989> where<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
toothpick along the line to know where I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.979 
toothpick along the line to know where I
need<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> cut<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.829> take<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> fresh<00:00:45.420> sharp

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
need to cut it take out a fresh sharp

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.310 
need to cut it take out a fresh sharp
blade<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.010> trim<00:00:47.640> around<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.239> edge<00:00:48.480> applying

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
blade and trim around the edge applying

00:00:49.320 --> 00:01:00.420 
blade and trim around the edge applying
medium<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.100> light<00:00:50.309> pressure

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:11.180 

you

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.650 

after<00:01:12.190> completing<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.760> gut<00:01:12.970> take<00:01:13.270> off<00:01:13.480> the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
after completing to gut take off the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.330 
after completing to gut take off the
masking<00:01:14.080> tape<00:01:14.140> for<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.860> parts<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.310> want

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
masking tape for the parts you want

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.210 
masking tape for the parts you want
painted

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.130 

the<00:01:19.220> cut<00:01:19.460> sometimes<00:01:19.760> pulls<00:01:20.420> up<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.720> masking

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
the cut sometimes pulls up the masking

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.140 
the cut sometimes pulls up the masking
tape<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.500> small<00:01:21.800> amount<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.460> take<00:01:22.820> out<00:01:22.940> a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
tape a small amount so I take out a

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.810 
tape a small amount so I take out a
toothpick<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.930> run<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.410> across<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:25.580> line<00:01:25.790> I

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
toothpick and run it across the line I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.150 
toothpick and run it across the line I
just<00:01:26.000> cut<00:01:26.480> and<00:01:26.810> go<00:01:27.320> over<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.830> with<00:01:27.980> my

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
just cut and go over it with my

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.130 
just cut and go over it with my
fingernail<00:01:28.760> just<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.210> feel<00:01:29.510> if<00:01:29.690> it's<00:01:29.840> all<00:01:30.020> the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
fingernail just to feel if it's all the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.380 
fingernail just to feel if it's all the
way<00:01:30.230> down<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.920> then<00:01:31.220> check<00:01:31.550> it<00:01:31.730> with<00:01:31.910> my<00:01:32.120> eyes

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
way down and then check it with my eyes

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.630 
way down and then check it with my eyes
from<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.870> front<00:01:33.230> and<00:01:33.410> back<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:34.100> see<00:01:34.310> if<00:01:34.430> it's

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
from the front and back to see if it's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.120 
from the front and back to see if it's
properly<00:01:35.390> on<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.840> clear<00:01:36.020> parts<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.590> that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
properly on the clear parts and that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.890 
properly on the clear parts and that
there<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.400> no<00:01:37.610> air<00:01:37.850> bubbles<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.660> the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
there is no air bubbles so that the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.960 
there is no air bubbles so that the
paint<00:01:39.140> won't<00:01:39.350> seep<00:01:39.740> underneath<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.580> masking

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
paint won't seep underneath the masking

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.870 
paint won't seep underneath the masking
tape<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:41.390> pretty<00:01:42.020> simply<00:01:42.560> ruin<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.700> clear

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
tape and pretty simply ruin the clear

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.870 
tape and pretty simply ruin the clear
part<00:01:44.180> for<00:01:44.990> painting<00:01:45.380> I'm<00:01:45.620> using<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.220> acrylic

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
part for painting I'm using a acrylic

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.600 
part for painting I'm using a acrylic
model<00:01:47.420> air<00:01:47.630> paint<00:01:48.140> from<00:01:48.500> Vallejo<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.460> is

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
model air paint from Vallejo this is

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.430 
model air paint from Vallejo this is
pretty<00:01:49.850> much<00:01:50.060> just<00:01:50.330> airbrush<00:01:50.600> ready<00:01:51.110> paint

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
pretty much just airbrush ready paint

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.220 
pretty much just airbrush ready paint
but<00:01:52.130> works<00:01:52.430> really<00:01:52.580> well<00:01:53.120> while<00:01:53.510> brushing<00:01:54.110> it

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
but works really well while brushing it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.100 
but works really well while brushing it
on<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.650> decided<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.820> go<00:01:56.000> with<00:01:56.210> two<00:01:56.360> light<00:01:56.780> coats

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
on I decided to go with two light coats

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.410 
on I decided to go with two light coats
the<00:01:57.530> first<00:01:57.770> one<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.430> second<00:01:58.790> one<00:01:58.820> being

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
the first one and the second one being

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.020 
the first one and the second one being
pretty<00:01:59.900> much<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.380> same<00:02:00.620> so<00:02:01.220> no<00:02:01.430> difference<00:02:01.850> in

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
pretty much the same so no difference in

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.930 
pretty much the same so no difference in
that<00:02:02.060> I'm<00:02:02.480> only<00:02:02.630> showing<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> first<00:02:03.320> and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
that I'm only showing you the first and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.880 
that I'm only showing you the first and
while<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.150> was<00:02:05.210> drying<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:06.050> decided<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.740> do

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
while that was drying I decided to do

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.270 
while that was drying I decided to do
all<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.370> other<00:02:07.610> parts<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:09.500> when<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.130> came

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
all the other parts and then when I came

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.520 
all the other parts and then when I came
back<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.030> one<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.510> was<00:02:11.720> ready<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.260> apply

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
back to this one it was ready to apply

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.600 
back to this one it was ready to apply
the<00:02:12.590> second<00:02:13.130> coat<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.680> reason<00:02:16.130> I'm<00:02:16.310> using

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
the second coat the reason I'm using

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.870 
the second coat the reason I'm using
acrylic<00:02:17.330> paints<00:02:17.630> instead<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:18.110> enamels<00:02:18.620> or

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
acrylic paints instead of enamels or

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.210 
acrylic paints instead of enamels or
using<00:02:19.880> zero<00:02:20.090> paints<00:02:20.510> by<00:02:20.780> airbrush<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.500> that

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
using zero paints by airbrush is that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.820 
using zero paints by airbrush is that
this<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.970> really<00:02:23.630> easy<00:02:23.660> paint<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.380> take<00:02:24.590> off

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
this is a really easy paint to take off

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.680 
this is a really easy paint to take off
and<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.280> doesn't<00:02:25.550> really<00:02:25.820> bite<00:02:26.180> into<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
and it doesn't really bite into the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.740 
and it doesn't really bite into the
material<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.830> we're<00:02:28.370> enamel<00:02:29.239> paints<00:02:29.600> are

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
material as we're enamel paints are

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.210 
material as we're enamel paints are
really<00:02:30.140> hard<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.410> get<00:02:30.650> off<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.130> need

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
really hard to get off and you need

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.190 
really hard to get off and you need
chemicals<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.910> get<00:02:32.060> them<00:02:32.209> off<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.600> those

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
chemicals to get them off and those

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.410 
chemicals to get them off and those
chemicals<00:02:33.500> ruin<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> clear<00:02:34.370> parts<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.239> you

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
chemicals ruin the clear parts and you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.750 
chemicals ruin the clear parts and you
pretty<00:02:35.630> much<00:02:35.720> don't<00:02:36.080> want<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.770> 4:0

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
pretty much don't want that and 4:0

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.910 
pretty much don't want that and 4:0
paints<00:02:38.239> that's<00:02:38.600> pretty<00:02:39.020> much<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.410> same<00:02:39.590> so

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
paints that's pretty much the same so

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.979 
paints that's pretty much the same so
this<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.640> safest<00:02:40.970> route<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.450> go<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.810> my

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
this is the safest route to go in my

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.320 
this is the safest route to go in my
opinion<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:43.190> works<00:02:43.430> pretty<00:02:43.670> good<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.209> if

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
opinion and it works pretty good and if

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.940 
opinion and it works pretty good and if
you<00:02:44.450> mess<00:02:44.660> up<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:45.080> take<00:02:45.290> out<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> toothpick

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you mess up just take out a toothpick

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.949 
you mess up just take out a toothpick
and<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.489> easily<00:02:46.670> scrape<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.360> off<00:02:47.480> or<00:02:47.750> even

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
and you can easily scrape it off or even

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.050 
and you can easily scrape it off or even
with<00:02:48.470> your<00:02:48.620> fingernails<00:02:49.160> if<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.670> paint<00:02:49.910> is

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
with your fingernails if the paint is

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:31.940 
with your fingernails if the paint is
still<00:02:50.120> pretty<00:02:50.510> fresh

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.970 

on<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:33.330> headlight<00:03:33.690> lenses<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.319> used<00:03:34.740> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
on the headlight lenses I used a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.850 
on the headlight lenses I used a
permanent<00:03:35.520> black<00:03:35.819> marker<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.530> mark<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> edge

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
permanent black marker to mark the edge

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.949 
permanent black marker to mark the edge
off<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.520> simulate<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.180> rubber<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.690> is

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
off to simulate the rubber that is

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.620 
off to simulate the rubber that is
usually<00:03:40.290> around<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.190> edges<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
usually around the edges on the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.690 
usually around the edges on the
headlight<00:03:42.989> lenses<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:44.010> works<00:03:44.370> pretty<00:03:44.550> much

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
headlight lenses this works pretty much

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.880 
headlight lenses this works pretty much
the<00:03:44.880> same<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.450> tail<00:03:45.660> lights<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.140> side<00:03:46.620> marker

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the same for tail lights and side marker

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.760 
the same for tail lights and side marker
indicators<00:03:47.670> or<00:03:47.970> all<00:03:48.750> those<00:03:49.050> other<00:03:49.290> small

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
indicators or all those other small

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.610 
indicators or all those other small
parts<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.489> just<00:03:51.150> gives<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.630> bit<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:52.050> more

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
parts it just gives it a bit of a more

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.890 
parts it just gives it a bit of a more
realistic<00:03:52.980> look<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.520> my<00:03:53.640> opinion<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.360> really

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
realistic look in my opinion is a really

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.470 
realistic look in my opinion is a really
small<00:03:55.170> effort<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.700> looks<00:03:56.970> good<00:03:57.239> in

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
small effort to do and it looks good in

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:09.580 
small effort to do and it looks good in
