channel just go look around and I'm sure
you'll<00:02:10.160> find<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.460> that<00:02:11.150> gives<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.480> more

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.330 
you'll find it that gives you more
in-depth<00:02:12.200> thing<00:02:13.130> on<00:02:13.490> how<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.920> be<00:02:15.920> able<00:02:16.010> to

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
in-depth thing on how to be able to

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.920 
in-depth thing on how to be able to
change<00:02:16.580> your<00:02:16.790> control<00:02:17.150> settings<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:17.690> anyway

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
change your control settings but anyway

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.500 
change your control settings but anyway
how<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:18.950> use<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> smallest<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.240> basically

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
how you use the smallest you basically

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.890 
how you use the smallest you basically
put<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.930> tennis<00:02:21.260> ball<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:23.000> tree<00:02:23.450> house<00:02:23.690> I

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
put a tennis ball on on a tree house I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.190 
put a tennis ball on on a tree house I
guess<00:02:24.110> if<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.440> want<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:26.150> press<00:02:26.450> your

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
guess if you want but and you press your

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.320 
guess if you want but and you press your
circle<00:02:27.740> key<00:02:27.950> or<00:02:28.160> whatever<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.940> hold<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
circle key or whatever it is to hold it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.050 
circle key or whatever it is to hold it
so<00:02:29.959> now<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.200> don't<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.800> keep<00:02:31.640> holding

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
so now you don't have to keep holding

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.140 
so now you don't have to keep holding
that<00:02:32.270> whatever<00:02:32.930> Kiah<00:02:33.200> found<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:34.640> hold<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
that whatever Kiah found to hold the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.000 
that whatever Kiah found to hold the
ball<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.630> tap<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.810> once<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.590> will<00:02:36.800> be

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
ball you just tap it once and it will be

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.860 
ball you just tap it once and it will be
in<00:02:37.250> your<00:02:37.280> hand<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.270> basically<00:02:38.480> what<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.720> do

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
in your hand so basically what you do

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.130 
in your hand so basically what you do
now<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.350> charged<00:02:40.160> racket<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.959> all

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
now is you charged racket and it's all

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.699 
now is you charged racket and it's all
it<00:02:42.440> works<00:02:42.620> sort<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.160> bow<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:45.380> longer

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
it works sort of like a bow the longer

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.010 
it works sort of like a bow the longer
you<00:02:45.739> hold<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.220> faster<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.060> further<00:02:47.570> will

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
you hold it the faster the further will

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.770 
you hold it the faster the further will
go<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.470> it's<00:02:48.590> kind<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.010> weird<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.940> jerky<00:02:50.600> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
go and it's kind of weird and jerky the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.180 
go and it's kind of weird and jerky the
movement<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.230> doesn't<00:02:51.500> really<00:02:51.590> go<00:02:51.980> in

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
movement it doesn't really go in

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.660 
movement it doesn't really go in
whatever<00:02:52.730> direction<00:02:53.770> it's<00:02:54.770> about<00:02:55.100> you're

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
whatever direction it's about you're

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.550 
whatever direction it's about you're
looking<00:02:56.060> at<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.450> think<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:56.870> supposed<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.380> do

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
looking at I think it's supposed to do

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.620 
looking at I think it's supposed to do
so<00:02:57.800> however<00:02:58.100> but<00:02:58.940> let<00:02:59.090> me<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.180> try<00:02:59.420> that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
so however but let me just try that

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.170 
so however but let me just try that
again<00:02:59.690> ensure<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.320> distance<00:03:00.860> yeah<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.910> one

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
again ensure the distance yeah that one

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.710 
again ensure the distance yeah that one
not<00:03:02.720> very<00:03:02.989> far<00:03:03.320> away<00:03:03.519> are<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:04.820> or<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.060> am<00:03:05.480> just

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720

a sucky tennis player which probably is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.100 
a sucky tennis player which probably is
the<00:03:08.330> case<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:08.870> anyway<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:10.750> yeah<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:11.989> can
