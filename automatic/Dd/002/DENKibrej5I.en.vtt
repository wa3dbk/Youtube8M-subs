00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
anything really I I actually like

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.790 
anything really I I actually like
running<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.420> play<00:00:18.630> without<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.199> nano<00:00:19.380> setup

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
running this play without the nano setup

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.010 
running this play without the nano setup
I<00:00:19.920> think<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> lot<00:00:20.460> better<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.900> you're

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I think it's a lot better and if you're

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750 
I think it's a lot better and if you're
a<00:00:22.050> player<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.289> me<00:00:22.680> who<00:00:22.859> doesn't<00:00:22.890> blitz<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> lot

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
a player like me who doesn't blitz a lot

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.060 
a player like me who doesn't blitz a lot
and<00:00:23.970> saves<00:00:24.720> his<00:00:24.960> blitzes<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.470> key<00:00:25.650> moments

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and saves his blitzes for key moments

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.470 
and saves his blitzes for key moments
this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> come<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.939> huge<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.420> if

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
this is going to come up huge for you if

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
on all blitzes and nanos are easy to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.069 
on all blitzes and nanos are easy to
block<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.180> sliding<00:00:33.420> lines<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.930> blocking

you might want to pick a team with
really<00:00:37.559> good<00:00:37.710> pass-rushers<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.730> case

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
really good pass-rushers just in case

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you do get blocked and pick up then

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
you do get blocked and pick up then
maybe<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.540> still<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.050> only<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.590> or

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

three seconds before that quarterback
gets<00:00:45.059> hit<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.899> let's<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.170> ahead<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.620> into

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
gets hit so let's go ahead and get into

I'm<00:00:54.090> stressing<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> guys<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.820> this<00:00:56.820> play<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I'm stressing to you guys to this play I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.319 
I'm stressing to you guys to this play I
think<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> better<00:00:59.789> places<00:01:00.059> in

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
think it's one of the better places in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
think it's one of the better places in
the<00:01:00.420> game<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.289> two<00:01:01.440> setups

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the game because there's two setups

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.080 
the game because there's two setups
there's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> nano<00:01:02.430> set<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
there's a nano set up and there's a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.119 
there's a nano set up and there's a
regular<00:01:03.449> set<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.979> when

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
regular set up so I'm going to that when

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
regular set up so I'm going to that when
you<00:01:05.220> come<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.610> play<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.060> only<00:01:06.570> thing<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you come on this play the only thing you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690 
you come on this play the only thing you
want<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.080> wary<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.979> side<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
want to be wary of is the side of the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.980 
want to be wary of is the side of the
field<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> most<00:01:09.299> receivers<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.840> right

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
field with the most receivers the right

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
field with the most receivers the right
side<00:01:10.200> has<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> most<00:01:10.590> receivers<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.180> might

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
side has the most receivers so I might

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.710 
side has the most receivers so I might
put<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:13.369> purple<00:01:14.369> rod<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.479> cover

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
put a purple rod over there to cover

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
put a purple rod over there to cover
those<00:01:15.900> receivers<00:01:16.290> more<00:01:16.590> now<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.460> here

those receivers more now you see here

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
those receivers more now you see here

calls<00:01:22.770> hike<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:25.049> line<00:01:25.229> does<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.470> pick<00:01:25.860> up

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

original position you see I put them

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.260 
original position you see I put them
right<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.740> top<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.160> tackle<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:35.030> just

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
right on top of that tackle and it just

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.970 
right on top of that tackle and it just
is<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> same<00:02:35.990> thing<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.320> just<00:02:36.440> happens<00:02:36.770> even

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
is the same thing it just happens even

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
is the same thing it just happens even
faster<00:02:38.590> center<00:02:39.590> gets<00:02:39.770> confused<00:02:40.130> again<00:02:40.220> that

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
faster center gets confused again that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.600 
faster center gets confused again that
stunt<00:02:41.390> messes<00:02:41.810> up<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.020> play<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.890> just

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
stunt messes up the play and it just

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.920 
stunt messes up the play and it just
happens<00:02:43.880> faster<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.330> reason<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.660> don't<00:02:44.840> like

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
happens faster the reason I don't like

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.240 
happens faster the reason I don't like
running<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.440> because<00:02:45.709> i<00:02:45.739> can't<00:02:46.100> play

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250
