for her really she's still got a medal
but<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:13.500> by<00:00:13.650> our<00:00:13.679> own<00:00:13.889> individual

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
but I think by our own individual

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.279 
but I think by our own individual
standard<00:00:15.210> she<00:00:15.389> wants<00:00:15.660> something<00:00:15.809> much<00:00:16.080> more

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
standard she wants something much more

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.710 
standard she wants something much more
yeah<00:00:16.920> she<00:00:17.160> didn't<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.490> above<00:00:17.550> 70<00:00:18.270> points<00:00:18.600> at

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
yeah she didn't get above 70 points at

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.200 
yeah she didn't get above 70 points at
all<00:00:18.930> through<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.230> whole<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.210> semi-finals

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
all through the whole of the semi-finals

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.400 
all through the whole of the semi-finals
and<00:00:21.390> I'm<00:00:21.449> sure<00:00:21.660> we're<00:00:21.779> gonna<00:00:21.840> seen<00:00:22.109> much

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
three competitions as we said so we know

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.900 
three competitions as we said so we know
she's<00:00:27.750> capable<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.470> moving<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
she's capable of moving up there that

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.860 
she's capable of moving up there that
all<00:00:30.210> starts<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.230> back<00:00:32.420> two<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
all starts now with this back two and a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.080 
all starts now with this back two and a
half<00:00:34.079> somersaults<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> pipe<00:00:35.640> position

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
half somersaults in the pipe position

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.630 
half somersaults in the pipe position
five<00:00:36.930> rounds<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> diving<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.860> come<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.489> your

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
five rounds of diving to come can your

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.610 
five rounds of diving to come can your
toe<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> open<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> competition<00:00:42.620> that's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
toe to open the competition that's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.100 
toe to open the competition that's
better<00:00:44.120> head<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.360> little<00:00:45.600> bit<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
better head back a little bit on the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.799 
better head back a little bit on the
start<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> divers<00:00:47.789> spin<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.450> slightly

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
start and so the divers spin is slightly

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
start and so the divers spin is slightly
faster<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.590> she<00:00:49.739> knew<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.219> kick-out<00:00:50.579> was

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
faster but she knew the kick-out was

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
faster but she knew the kick-out was
there<00:00:51.140> out<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> diving<00:00:52.680> board<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.280> was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
there out at the diving board that was

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.930 
there out at the diving board that was
good

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
good

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.130 
good
reaches<00:00:54.390> back<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:54.989> loose<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> back

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
reaches back to some loose in the back

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
reaches back to some loose in the back
so<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.469> head<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.219> makes<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> pipe

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so the head back just makes the pipe

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.959 
so the head back just makes the pipe
look<00:01:00.030> slightly<00:01:00.329> open<00:01:01.250> she<00:01:02.250> used<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.640> her

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
look slightly open she used all her

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.270 
look slightly open she used all her
experience<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:04.019> pull<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> dive<00:01:04.589> around<00:01:05.750> and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280

experience to pull the dive around and
six<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> half<00:01:08.549> seven<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> half<00:01:09.869> sand<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
six and a half seven and a half sand and
