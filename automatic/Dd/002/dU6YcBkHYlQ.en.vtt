00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.160
 How to determine your size? 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.390
 This is the question we ask when choosing clothes. 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.320
 catalog or online store. When shipped from 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.430
 another city, not to mention another country, with the size 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.210
 It is advisable to decide as accurately as possible. 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.610
 Determining your clothing size is easy. 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.720
 For this, it is necessary to measure only three parameters. 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.630
 Chest circumference. Waist circumference. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.719
 And the girth of the hips. 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.899
 It will take the most common measuring tape. 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.420
 Or, as it is called "centimeter." And as an assistant 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.059
 You can invite someone from relatives. 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.419
 Or friends. 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.979
 When taking measurements, it is necessary to stand straight, relaxed. 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.339
 Hands down along the body. Centimeter tape 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.950
 do not stretch too much or let go 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.549
 This is too loose. That she did not sag. 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.060
 It is better to wear underwear when taking measurements. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.850
 or light clothing. 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.570
 So chest. Chest circumference measured 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 on the most prominent points of the chest and shoulder blades. 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.509
 The tape should pass under the armpits. 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.020
 On the back of the tape, it is desirable to place a little higher, 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.729
 on the shoulder blades. Write the girth. 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.020
 Waist size - measured by the natural line. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.430
 At the waist also do not strongly tighten 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.479
 centimeter tape. To ordered clothes 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.259
 did not turn out to be small. Is that if you plan 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.899
 urgent to lose weight. 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.119
 The volume of the hips is measured by the most prominent points. 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.259
 buttocks and thighs. And also taking into account 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.520
 volume of the abdomen. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.090
 By writing these three parameters, you can consult the dimensional 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.909
 mesh and easy to define your size. 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.039
 Usually, the size of a shirt, blouson, polo is equal to half 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.649
 chest girth. What does this mean? 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.709
 For example, the size of the chest is 52 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.620
 104 centimeters. 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.230
 The size of the pants or skirt women need to check 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.530
 in the dimensional grid, based on the girth of the hips. 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.349
 And men determine the size of the pants, based on 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.120
 from waist circumference. For obvious reasons, dimensional 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.239
 mesh for male and female physique is different. 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.680
 Link to the dimensional grid that you see on the screen, 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.830
 in the description below this video. There you can find 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.909
 "correspondence table" of our sizes international. 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.700
 Which are presented in the format S, L, M, XL. 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.269
 Sometimes it happens that the parameters are between two 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.720
 neighboring sizes. In that case, of course 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.909
 it is better to choose a larger size. 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.970
 If you do not want clothes to hamper movement. 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.879
 It is also worth doing if the chest girth 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.409
 The cell size is 44, and waist circumference, 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.909
 for example, 48. Order clothes 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.109
 In this case, it is worth 48 size. 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.840
 That's all! Define your own 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.879
 clothing size is very simple. 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.290
 True, sometimes because of the designerâ€™s fancy clothes 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.709
 "small size" when very tightly seated. Or "full", 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.409
 that is, it hangs freely. But such subtleties are better. 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.069
 discuss with sales assistants about each specific 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.049
 clothes models. Small she is either full-length. 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.370
 And we wish you always look irresistible and wear 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.370
 the best clothes!
