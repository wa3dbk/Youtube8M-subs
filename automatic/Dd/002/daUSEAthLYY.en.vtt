00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.689
 hello today we want to show 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.570
 how to create such a drawing medallions 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:26.720
 this is one drawing 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.360
 it's almost such a wife a little different 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.260
 here he is completely clogged 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:39.019
 elongated loops 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:46.350
 here they are 8 and in this figure 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:52.320
 only six but this pattern fits easier 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.210
 a little report consists of 8 loops plus 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.879
 2 edge and fit it in 1 mail 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:08.690
 shoot from 1 to 14 row began to fit 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.690
 and then 7 rows are repeated 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.840
 we will start 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.930
 as I said arapov consists of 8 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.510
 loops plus 2 edge I dial 34 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.310
 loops 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:33.770
 type in any way convenient for you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.770
 and knit first row edge remove 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:48.660
 then knit one face wrap 2 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:52.200
 loops along with tilt left on the end 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:56.180
 gassing left so face one 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:02.690
 remove without sticking second facial 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:09.690
 knit front and not knit 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:14.700
 put on the face make sure 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.170
 the removed loop is not twisted then 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.170
 go three facial loops 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.400
 and 2 loops together with a slope to the right 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:40.200
 you will forget the needle from left to right in two 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:48.640
 loops and knit facial and cap and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:53.080
 count loops 1 2 3 4 4 set loops 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.690
 I cut the marker from the tubes for 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.700
 cocktails and it is desirable to take 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.340
 cocktail tubes because 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.630
 baby food is not small 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.810
 diameter and can slip 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.980
 nakida and in the loop and this report you 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.880
 repeat 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:23.110
 until the end of the recruited series I bound 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:28.620
 first row purl rows are knitted all 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.620
 purl nakida loops also purl 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:47.040
 proceed to the third row edge 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:47.040
 we remove 2 front nakid 2 obverse left 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.060
 2 face tilts to the left one loop 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:00.430
 remove without sticking 2 knit 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.880
 front and removed put on a knit 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.880
 facial 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.090
 1 front 2 loops with tilt 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.430
 to the right 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:23.970
 we start the needle from left to right in two loops 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:27.560
 and knit facial cap and facial and 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:34.970
 so until the end of the series 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.970
 knit fifth row edge remove 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:50.460
 3 front nakid then we will go 3 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:54.810
 facial together we will knit so 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.450
 so that the second loop was centered for 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.350
 this right needle will be in two loops 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:09.090
 left to right and shoot without tying 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:12.870
 third loop knit facial and these 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.770
 two loose loops we put on 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:22.710
 knit 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:31.140
 and here we got 2 loops clearly 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:37.130
 center then nakid and 2 facial and so on 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:42.360
 end of row go to seventh row 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:46.910
 we remove the edge now we have 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:50.250
 three holes that we knit 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:55.110
 nakida and we begin to knit 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:06:01.440
 a locket a needle we enter the lowest 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:05.660
 holes and take out the loop and put on 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.090
 her on the left knitting needle and this loop 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.190
 knit loop that was already on 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.990
 knitting needles that is two knit loops 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:20.040
 together and the next hole too 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:25.950
 take out the loop we put on the knitting needle but 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:28.160
 knit only one loop of 3 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.310
 hole take out the loop 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.880
 put on a knitting needle and knit only 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.880
 one loop 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:52.210
 and the last loop we take from the place 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:56.699
 between 2 and 3 loops here we take out 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:59.800
 we put a loop on a knitting needle and knit it 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:11.289
 Now all these 4 loops that we 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:16.479
 typed we have to knit the front floor 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:19.720
 medallion we now have these two 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:23.080
 loops that remain we knit with 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:27.270
 tilt to the right that is, we start the needle 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:40.030
 left to right and knit facial 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:43.870
 nakid 3 front 1 2 3 nakid 2 loops with 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:48.210
 tilt to the left one loop is not removed 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:53.010
 we knit the second one 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.010
 shot put on a knit
