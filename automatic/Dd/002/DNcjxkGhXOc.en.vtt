qualifying<00:01:03.480> standards<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.140> guess<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
qualifying standards I guess and do a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.859 
qualifying standards I guess and do a
very<00:01:05.820> few<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> us<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.210> actually<00:01:06.420> made<00:01:06.689> them

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
very few of us that actually made them

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.200 
very few of us that actually made them
so<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.920> guess<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.400> still<00:01:08.610> waiting<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:08.909> them<00:01:09.150> to

so I guess we still waiting for them to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.440 
so I guess we still waiting for them to
announce<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> team<00:01:09.890> if<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.909> didn't<00:01:12.270> swim

the bleachers being a part of that yeah

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.110 
the bleachers being a part of that yeah
I<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:49.019> great<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.410> know<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.590> first<00:03:50.120> because

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
I was great you know the first because

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.309 
I was great you know the first because
obviously<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.540> meat<00:03:51.660> was<00:03:51.810> delayed<00:03:52.079> by<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> day

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
obviously the meat was delayed by a day

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.900 
obviously the meat was delayed by a day
so<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:53.010> were<00:03:53.129> kind<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.579> know<00:03:53.609> we<00:03:53.819> were

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
so we were kind of you know we were

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.789 
so we were kind of you know we were
really<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.870> amped<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.319> really<00:03:55.500> psyched

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
really really amped and really psyched

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.220 
really really amped and really psyched
to<00:03:55.949> get<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.280> but<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.819> think<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:57.840> made<00:03:58.109> it

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
to get going but I think it just made it

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.409 
to get going but I think it just made it
that<00:03:58.260> much<00:03:58.379> more<00:03:58.590> special<00:03:59.069> once<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.060> did<00:04:00.209> like

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
that much more special once it did like

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.610 
that much more special once it did like
once<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.410> did<00:04:01.530> start<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.319> know<00:04:04.319> what<00:04:04.470> like

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
once it did start and you know what like

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.349

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.400 
you good or bad you know what I think I
mean<00:04:49.000> absol<00:04:49.330> at<00:04:49.450> point<00:04:49.660> we'd<00:04:49.840> won<00:04:50.050> three<00:04:50.380> out

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
mean absol at point we'd won three out

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.460 
mean absol at point we'd won three out
of<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.650> five<00:04:50.770> relays<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:52.110> points<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.290> don't

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
of the five relays so and points I don't

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.410 
of the five relays so and points I don't
think<00:04:53.530> was<00:04:53.800> really<00:04:54.010> that<00:04:54.400> important<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.300> that

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
think was really that important to that

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.730 
think was really that important to that
stage<00:04:55.660> because<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.170> know<00:04:56.260> it<00:04:56.350> was<00:04:56.530> pretty

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
stage because you know it was pretty

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.410 
stage because you know it was pretty
obviously<00:04:57.520> textures<00:04:57.940> going<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.150> win<00:04:58.270> unless

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
obviously textures going to win unless

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.770 
obviously textures going to win unless
something<00:04:58.960> something<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.560> happen<00:05:00.630> but<00:05:01.630> we

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
something something that happen but we

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.940 
something something that happen but we

wasn't that much of a big deal yeah the

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.430 
wasn't that much of a big deal yeah the
only<00:05:18.040> way<00:05:18.390> Texas<00:05:19.390> was<00:05:19.600> gonna<00:05:19.810> lose<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.080> meat

as<00:05:20.590> if<00:05:20.770> they<00:05:20.950> fall<00:05:21.190> started<00:05:21.700> so<00:05:22.270> did<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:22.660> allow

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
as if they fall started so did you allow

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.300 
as if they fall started so did you allow
yourself<00:05:23.080> in<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.500> back<00:05:23.650> of<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.860> mind<00:05:24.010> for<00:05:24.250> a

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
yourself in the back of the mind for a

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.310 
yourself in the back of the mind for a
second<00:05:24.700> say<00:05:24.910> all<00:05:25.150> Jews<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.930> hope<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.260> was

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
second say all Jews I hope that was

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.180 
second say all Jews I hope that was
Texas<00:05:27.120> um<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.600> mean<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:29.410> guess<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.680> did<00:05:29.830> kind<00:05:29.860> of

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
Texas um I mean I guess I did kind of

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.159 
Texas um I mean I guess I did kind of
but<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:30.940> know<00:05:31.030> what<00:05:31.120> i<00:05:31.150> mean<00:05:31.270> like<00:05:31.450> we<00:05:31.930> can't

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
but you know what i mean like we can't

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.780 
but you know what i mean like we can't
control<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:32.890> was<00:05:33.040> something<00:05:33.160> it's

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
control that so it was something it's

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.530 
control that so it was something it's
just<00:05:33.850> something<00:05:33.970> we<00:05:34.180> weren't<00:05:34.419> really

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
just something we weren't really

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.120 
just something we weren't really
thinking<00:05:34.840> about<00:05:35.020> we<00:05:35.710> are<00:05:35.800> more<00:05:35.950> concerned

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
thinking about we are more concerned

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.090 
thinking about we are more concerned
about<00:05:36.450> you<00:05:37.450> know<00:05:37.480> winning<00:05:37.810> that<00:05:37.900> relay<00:05:38.169> all
