actually before it was like a focus
mainly<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.440> game<00:00:34.620> there<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:34.920> thing

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
mainly on this game there was one thing

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.350 
mainly on this game there was one thing
I<00:00:35.100> wanted<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> mention<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> Lasky<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
I wanted to mention about the Lasky and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.479 
I wanted to mention about the Lasky and
I<00:00:36.420> noticed<00:00:36.750> later<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:38.040> regards<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I noticed later on with regards to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250 
I noticed later on with regards to
pieces<00:00:38.820> intention<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> her<00:00:39.420> ass<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:40.140> he

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
pieces intention to her ass when he

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.170 
pieces intention to her ass when he
first<00:00:40.590> got<00:00:40.800> his<00:00:40.980> Weber<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.460> shuttle<00:00:41.820> ready<00:00:41.969> he

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
first got his Weber and shuttle ready he

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
first got his Weber and shuttle ready he
actually<00:00:42.360> had<00:00:42.750> his<00:00:42.899> shuttle<00:00:43.140> moving<00:00:43.620> towards

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
actually had his shuttle moving towards

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
actually had his shuttle moving towards
opponent's<00:00:45.090> base<00:00:45.210> towards<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> losses<00:00:46.050> base

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
opponent's base towards the losses base

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.959 
opponent's base towards the losses base
but<00:00:46.920> act<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> point<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> time

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
but act it was at that point in time

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
but act it was at that point in time
this<00:00:48.239> observer<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.870> saw<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> starport<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
this observer just saw the starport and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.229 
this observer just saw the starport and
I<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.280> why<00:00:50.460> he<00:00:50.579> decided<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
I think that's why he decided not to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.610 
I think that's why he decided not to
harass<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.170> he<00:00:52.260> decided<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
harass and that was when he decided to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470 
harass and that was when he decided to
block<00:00:52.860> his<00:00:53.039> choked<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> second<00:00:54.300> gateway

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
block his choked with the second gateway

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
block his choked with the second gateway
and<00:00:54.750> switch<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> fast<00:00:55.379> carriers<00:00:55.770> when<00:00:55.949> he<00:00:56.039> saw

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and switch to fast carriers when he saw

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.290 
and switch to fast carriers when he saw
that<00:00:56.190> star<00:00:56.520> port<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> think<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.149> was<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that star port and I think that was the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
that star port and I think that was the
key<00:00:57.600> moment<00:00:58.260> he<00:00:58.320> saw<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> starport<00:00:58.890> felt<00:00:59.129> his

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
key moment he saw the starport felt his

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
key moment he saw the starport felt his
her<00:00:59.340> ass<00:00:59.460> wouldn't<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.820> effective<00:01:00.210> felt<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
her ass wouldn't be effective felt that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
her ass wouldn't be effective felt that
he<00:01:01.079> would<00:01:01.199> lose<00:01:01.350> his<00:01:01.410> shuttle<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.949> rebirth<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
he would lose his shuttle and rebirth to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
he would lose his shuttle and rebirth to
a<00:01:02.760> rate<00:01:03.149> calm<00:01:03.390> when<00:01:03.570> adapted<00:01:03.989> well<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
a rate calm when adapted well so if you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
a rate calm when adapted well so if you
think<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.090> respect<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.750> bodes

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
think about it in that respect it bodes

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
think about it in that respect it bodes
well<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.890> soo<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.700> say<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.970> he<00:01:09.090> adapted

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
well for be soo to say that he adapted

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.899 
well for be soo to say that he adapted
rather<00:01:10.200> than<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.470> got<00:01:10.619> lucky<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
rather than just got lucky this is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.520 
rather than just got lucky this is

versus iris though and i would say iris

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
versus iris though and i would say iris

iris know we're really on the pro see in

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
iris know we're really on the pro see in
this<00:01:27.689> season<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.650> iris<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.189> hasn't

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
this season and really iris just hasn't

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
this season and really iris just hasn't
recovered<00:01:29.880> from<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.689> big<00:01:31.079> massive<00:01:31.530> loss<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
recovered from that big massive loss to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.460 
recovered from that big massive loss to
a<00:01:32.159> GG<00:01:32.640> play<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.630> went<00:01:33.840> right<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> the

champion<00:01:36.750> unfortunately<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.290> could<00:01:37.439> only

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
champion unfortunately they could only

have been one it was GD played on that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940 
have been one it was GD played on that
occasion<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.900> other<00:01:40.020> factor<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.530> time<00:01:40.740> we

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
occasion the other factor this time we

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.469 
occasion the other factor this time we
are<00:01:41.070> again<00:01:41.400> still<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.700> Katrina<00:01:42.090> leaders<00:01:42.390> say

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
are again still on Katrina leaders say

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.819 
are again still on Katrina leaders say
what's<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.689> strategy<00:01:42.930> these<00:01:43.170> players<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.560> for

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
what's the strategy these players go for

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
what's the strategy these players go for
but<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.640> whether<00:01:45.090> or<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.420> take<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
but this whether or not they take the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.700 
but this whether or not they take the
fastest<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.110> our<00:01:46.259> certainly<00:01:46.500> doesn't<00:01:46.619> look

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
fastest when our certainly doesn't look

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.200 
fastest when our certainly doesn't look
like<00:01:46.799> iris<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> take<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> fastest

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
like iris is going to take the fastest

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.370 
like iris is going to take the fastest
when<00:01:48.329> he's<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.689> his<00:01:48.750> barracks<00:01:49.140> first

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
when he's going for his barracks first

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.020 
when he's going for his barracks first
and<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> looks<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.460> any<00:01:50.610> staking<00:01:50.939> his

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and it looks like any staking his

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.399 
and it looks like any staking his
refinery<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.570> well<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
refinery as well so I was going for a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.870 
refinery as well so I was going for a
tech<00:01:52.619> build<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.340> looks<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.549> he's<00:01:53.729> got<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
tech build be so looks like he's got a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.639 
tech build be so looks like he's got a
fast<00:01:54.090> expand<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.079> timepiece<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.530> not

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
fast expand so this timepiece are not

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.600 
fast expand so this timepiece are not
going<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> tech<00:01:56.100> though<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.310> times<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
going for the tech though this times in

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.190 
going for the tech though this times in
fast<00:01:56.820> expand<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.780> might<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.140> be

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
fast expand I think this might not be

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690 
fast expand I think this might not be
very<00:01:58.560> good<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.920> peace<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.189> considering<00:01:59.670> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
very good for peace you considering that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
very good for peace you considering that
there<00:01:59.969> are<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> base<00:02:00.869> positions<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.469> closer

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
there are the base positions are closer

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
there are the base positions are closer
that<00:02:01.979> being<00:02:02.159> said<00:02:02.280> Protoss<00:02:02.670> vs<00:02:02.969> terran<00:02:03.119> there

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that being said Protoss vs terran there

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030 
that being said Protoss vs terran there
is<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> massive<00:02:03.719> advantage<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
is a massive advantage on this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.430 
is a massive advantage on this
on<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.460> map<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:06.210> Protoss<00:02:06.570> players<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
on this map for Protoss players and

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.900 
on this map for Protoss players and
beast<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.830> already<00:02:08.040> shown<00:02:08.250> us<00:02:08.430> what<00:02:08.460> he<00:02:08.759> could

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
beast was already shown us what he could

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
beast was already shown us what he could
do<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.200> P<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.440> find<00:02:10.649> myself<00:02:10.710> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
do but I think P so I find myself a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.110 
do but I think P so I find myself a
little<00:02:11.040> bit<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.280> trouble<00:02:11.490> with<00:02:11.520> IRA<00:02:11.730> stacking

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
little bit of trouble with IRA stacking

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.370 
little bit of trouble with IRA stacking
and<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.240> are<00:02:12.300> setting<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.570> SUV<00:02:12.900> disc<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and I are setting that SUV disc out in

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.840 
and I are setting that SUV disc out in
the<00:02:13.440> correct<00:02:13.740> direction<00:02:13.770> he's<00:02:14.130> gonna<00:02:14.250> find<00:02:14.490> be

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
the correct direction he's gonna find be

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.670 
the correct direction he's gonna find be
so<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> other<00:02:15.180> factor<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.900> bezel<00:02:16.590> is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so the other factor is that a bezel is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.260 
so the other factor is that a bezel is
at<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.010> twelve<00:02:17.280> o'clock<00:02:17.490> position<00:02:17.880> artist<00:02:18.180> is

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
at the twelve o'clock position artist is

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.030 
at the twelve o'clock position artist is
the<00:02:18.540> nine<00:02:18.660> o'clock<00:02:18.930> position<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.650> with<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the nine o'clock position so with the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.590 
the nine o'clock position so with the
relatively<00:02:20.430> close<00:02:20.730> basis<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.300> both<00:02:21.420> players

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
relatively close basis for both players

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.930 
relatively close basis for both players
it's<00:02:22.140> gonna<00:02:22.320> make<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.680> much<00:02:22.860> easier<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.310> iris

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
it's gonna make it much easier for iris

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.790 
it's gonna make it much easier for iris
to<00:02:24.060> push<00:02:24.300> ahead<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:24.750> iris<00:02:24.900> play<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.650> I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
to push ahead and if iris play if I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.260 
to push ahead and if iris play if I
response<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.460> piece<00:02:26.610> was<00:02:26.790> doing<00:02:26.970> any<00:02:27.090> really

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
response what piece was doing any really

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.970 
response what piece was doing any really
should<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.570> able<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.560> unfortunately

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
should be able to be so unfortunately

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.050 
should be able to be so unfortunately
sliding<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> wrong<00:02:29.430> direction<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.910> by<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
sliding the wrong direction so by the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.610 
sliding the wrong direction so by the
time<00:02:30.180> beast<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.480> probe<00:02:30.690> gets<00:02:30.840> around<00:02:31.110> this

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
time beast was probe gets around this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.840 
time beast was probe gets around this
this<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.890> gonna<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.130> bad<00:02:32.160> for<00:02:32.490> me<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.640> because

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
this is gonna be bad for me so because

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.100 
this is gonna be bad for me so because
he<00:02:32.880> doesn't<00:02:33.090> know<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.330> iris<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.840> gonna<00:02:33.990> be

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
he doesn't know that iris is gonna be

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.320 
he doesn't know that iris is gonna be
checking<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.920> nevertheless<00:02:35.670> irises<00:02:36.150> walled

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
checking and nevertheless irises walled

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.180 
checking and nevertheless irises walled
off<00:02:36.390> Ashok<00:02:36.660> anyway<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.050> be<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.770> iris<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.100> now

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
off Ashok anyway so be so iris is now

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.470 
off Ashok anyway so be so iris is now
gone<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.550> he's<00:02:38.640> seen<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.940> gateway<00:02:39.150> come<00:02:39.390> up

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
gone and he's seen that gateway come up

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.270 
gone and he's seen that gateway come up
quite<00:02:39.690> late<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.080> he's<00:02:40.170> seen<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.530> simulator

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
quite late and he's seen the simulator

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.130 
quite late and he's seen the simulator
as<00:02:41.490> well<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.790> from<00:02:42.209> literally<00:02:42.750> from<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.959> time

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
as well so from literally from the time

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.540 
as well so from literally from the time
of<00:02:43.170> these<00:02:43.470> symbols<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.860> gateway<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.310> should

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
of these symbols in the gateway I should

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.800 
of these symbols in the gateway I should
have<00:02:44.610> an<00:02:44.730> idea<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.060> what<00:02:45.209> piece<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.600> dating

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
have an idea of what piece was dating

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.180 
have an idea of what piece was dating
nevertheless<00:02:45.990> he's<00:02:46.230> gonna<00:02:46.320> confirm<00:02:46.800> by<00:02:46.980> going

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
nevertheless he's gonna confirm by going

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.130 
nevertheless he's gonna confirm by going
through<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.880> beast<00:02:48.360> was<00:02:48.480> natural<00:02:48.780> expo<00:02:49.050> and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
through to beast was natural expo and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.210 
through to beast was natural expo and
see<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> piece<00:02:49.530> who<00:02:49.620> has<00:02:49.770> set<00:02:49.920> up<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.070> notch

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
see the piece who has set up a notch

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.560 
see the piece who has set up a notch
flexible<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.790> again<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.420> things

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
flexible and again one of the things

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.820 
flexible and again one of the things
that<00:02:51.660> really<00:02:51.720> helped<00:02:52.140> me<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> lot<00:02:52.620> when<00:02:52.800> the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
that really helped me so a lot when the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.110 
that really helped me so a lot when the
turn<00:02:53.100> push<00:02:53.340> came<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:53.820> already

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
turn push came and I are already

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.580 
turn push came and I are already
starting<00:02:54.330> up<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.450> Factory<00:02:54.720> when<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.410> turn

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
starting up that Factory when the turn

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.280 
starting up that Factory when the turn
push<00:02:55.800> came<00:02:56.010> was<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.550> fact<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.959> glides

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
push came was the fact that the glides

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.960 
push came was the fact that the glides
really<00:02:58.650> couldn't<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.040> mass<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.610> took<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.850> long

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
really couldn't be a mass it took a long

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.310 
really couldn't be a mass it took a long
time<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.510> last<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.780> travel<00:03:01.050> all<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> way

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
time for the last to travel all the way

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.260 
time for the last to travel all the way
across<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.739> map<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.040> support<00:03:02.430> his<00:03:02.520> units<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
across the map to support his units the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.580 
across the map to support his units the
spores<00:03:03.540> Ellis's<00:03:03.900> units<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.470> now

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
spores Ellis's units and be so now

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.630 
spores Ellis's units and be so now
putting<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:04.920> some<00:03:05.070> high<00:03:05.220> score<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.459> soon<00:03:05.550> as

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
putting on some high score as soon as

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.880 
putting on some high score as soon as
the<00:03:05.700> gateways<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.570> this<00:03:07.290> was<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.470> early

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
the gateways up so this was the early

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.290 
the gateways up so this was the early
game<00:03:08.040> defense<00:03:08.310> gonna<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.520> critical<00:03:08.700> year<00:03:09.000> he

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
game defense gonna be critical year he

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.800 
game defense gonna be critical year he
might<00:03:09.480> opt<00:03:09.750> for<00:03:10.050> blocking<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.530> choke

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
might opt for blocking that choke

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.120 
might opt for blocking that choke
anticipating<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.769> problem<00:03:14.040> is

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
anticipating that but the problem is

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.229 
anticipating that but the problem is
that<00:03:14.160> piece<00:03:14.400> who<00:03:14.489> doesn't<00:03:14.730> realize<00:03:14.820> what<00:03:14.970> ours

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
that piece who doesn't realize what ours

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.610 
that piece who doesn't realize what ours
is<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.510> he<00:03:15.570> seen<00:03:15.750> yes<00:03:15.959> he<00:03:16.050> in<00:03:16.230> his<00:03:16.350> base<00:03:16.500> he

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
is and he seen yes he in his base he

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.040 
is and he seen yes he in his base he
doesn't<00:03:16.800> realize<00:03:17.070> whether<00:03:17.220> or<00:03:17.400> not<00:03:17.459> iris<00:03:17.760> is

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
doesn't realize whether or not iris is

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.330 
doesn't realize whether or not iris is
fast<00:03:19.050> expanded<00:03:19.500> or<00:03:19.560> whether<00:03:19.709> iris<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.070> tacked

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
fast expanded or whether iris is tacked

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
fast expanded or whether iris is tacked
so<00:03:20.820> but<00:03:21.150> he<00:03:21.269> has<00:03:21.420> opted<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> put<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.019> second

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so but he has opted to put that second

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.420 
so but he has opted to put that second
gateway<00:03:22.410> down<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:22.799> all<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.040> needs<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.310> his

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
gateway down so all the needs to his

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.949 
gateway down so all the needs to his
plan<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.670> coupla<00:03:23.880> goons<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> middle<00:03:24.510> iris

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
plan to coupla goons in the middle iris

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.449 
plan to coupla goons in the middle iris
is<00:03:24.989> not<00:03:25.200> gonna<00:03:25.320> have<00:03:25.530> spider<00:03:25.830> mines<00:03:26.010> early<00:03:26.340> on

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
is not gonna have spider mines early on

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.590 
is not gonna have spider mines early on
so<00:03:26.640> he<00:03:26.730> won't<00:03:26.940> people<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.209> break<00:03:27.360> through<00:03:27.570> that

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
so he won't people to break through that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.630 
so he won't people to break through that
and<00:03:27.840> really<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.320> think<00:03:28.650> iris<00:03:29.160> needs<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.489> get

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and really I think iris needs to get

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.370 
and really I think iris needs to get
that<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.330> factory<00:03:30.720> machine<00:03:31.019> shop<00:03:31.200> down

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
that the factory machine shop down

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.050 
that the factory machine shop down
straight<00:03:31.650> away<00:03:31.680> because<00:03:32.459> he<00:03:32.640> knows<00:03:32.820> what<00:03:33.000> his

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
straight away because he knows what his

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.490 
straight away because he knows what his
opponent<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.600> doing<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.019> terms<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.290> tech

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
opponent is is doing in terms of tech

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.630 
opponent is is doing in terms of tech
and<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> think<00:03:34.860> iris<00:03:35.100> needs<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> get<00:03:35.459> an<00:03:35.519> early

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
and I think iris needs to get an early

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300 
and I think iris needs to get an early
push<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:36.959> receive<00:03:37.320> if<00:03:37.709> iris<00:03:37.950> tries

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
push in here but I receive if iris tries

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.920 
push in here but I receive if iris tries
to<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.519> what<00:03:38.700> they<00:03:39.209> lasted<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.570> think<00:03:39.600> they<00:03:39.840> lost

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
to do what they lasted I think they lost

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.000 
to do what they lasted I think they lost
made<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> mistake<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.380> iris<00:03:40.650> critic<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
made a mistake and iris critic the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.140 
made a mistake and iris critic the
heiress's<00:03:41.280> building<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.610> starport<00:03:41.910> as<00:03:42.030> well

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
heiress's building the starport as well

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.430 
heiress's building the starport as well
so<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.330> one<00:03:42.450> sell<00:03:42.660> us<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.140> well<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
so this one sell us do this as well and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.170 
so this one sell us do this as well and
iris<00:03:43.650> doing<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:43.950> as<00:03:44.010> well<00:03:44.160> now<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.000> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
iris doing it as well now and I and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.030 
iris doing it as well now and I and
again<00:03:45.570> perhaps<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.320> purpose<00:03:46.650> it's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
again perhaps the purpose it's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.960 
again perhaps the purpose it's
interesting<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.489> purse<00:03:47.640> they're<00:03:47.820> probably

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
interesting the purse they're probably

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.310 
interesting the purse they're probably
so<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.450> he<00:03:48.540> would<00:03:48.690> have<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.900> maneuver<00:03:49.170> books

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
so that he would have the maneuver books

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.600 
so that he would have the maneuver books
to<00:03:49.440> be<00:03:49.530> able<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.709> draw<00:03:49.860> realizing<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.430> piece

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
to be able to draw realizing that piece

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.759 
to be able to draw realizing that piece
was<00:03:50.700> able<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:50.970> drop<00:03:51.120> his<00:03:51.360> block<00:03:52.320> his<00:03:52.470> choke<00:03:52.650> and

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
was able to drop his block his choke and

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.140 
was able to drop his block his choke and
that's<00:03:52.920> why<00:03:53.040> Terran<00:03:53.670> player<00:03:53.760> seems<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> be

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
that's why Terran player seems to be

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.430 
that's why Terran player seems to be
going<00:03:54.239> going<00:03:54.750> going<00:03:54.840> for<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.080> starport<00:03:55.350> I

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
going going going for the starport I

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.500 
going going going for the starport I
think<00:03:55.590> iris<00:03:55.799> again<00:03:56.100> doing<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.000> right<00:03:57.209> thing

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
think iris again doing the right thing

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.539 
think iris again doing the right thing
in<00:03:57.690> terms<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.989> focusing<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.590> his<00:03:58.830> tech<00:03:59.070> because

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
in terms of focusing on his tech because

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.920 
in terms of focusing on his tech because
that<00:03:59.700> was<00:03:59.850> where<00:04:00.000> his<00:04:00.120> lead<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.480> he's<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.690> tech

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
that was where his lead is he's the tech

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.449 
that was where his lead is he's the tech
leader<00:04:01.140> thing<00:04:01.320> when<00:04:01.769> players<00:04:02.010> try<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.250> play

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
leader thing when players try to play

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.340 
leader thing when players try to play
catch-up<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:03.030> think<00:04:03.180> invariably<00:04:03.780> goes<00:04:03.989> against

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
catch-up I think invariably goes against

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.560 
catch-up I think invariably goes against
them<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.590> you're<00:04:04.709> if<00:04:04.860> you're<00:04:04.980> behind<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:06.090> if

them if you're if you're behind it if

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.060 
them if you're if you're behind it if
you<00:04:06.959> got<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> tech<00:04:07.470> lead<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.739> you're<00:04:07.830> behind

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
you got the tech lead and you're behind

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.070 
you got the tech lead and you're behind
in<00:04:08.220> economy<00:04:08.730> if<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.850> try<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.060> switch<00:04:09.930> the

in economy if you try to switch the
economy<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.950> try<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.220> play<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.580> where

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
economy and try and play that where

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.460 
economy and try and play that where
you're<00:04:12.060> basically<00:04:12.360> surrendering<00:04:13.200> the

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
you're basically surrendering the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.569 
you're basically surrendering the

initiative and the impetus to the
opponent<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.090> think<00:04:15.269> RS<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.570> doing<00:04:15.690> the

opponent and I think RS is doing the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.970 
opponent and I think RS is doing the
absolutely<00:04:16.079> right<00:04:16.230> thing<00:04:16.410> stop<00:04:16.590> going<00:04:16.799> for

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
absolutely right thing stop going for

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.180 
absolutely right thing stop going for
that<00:04:17.070> commands<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.519> Australia's<00:04:17.940> full

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
that commands and Australia's full

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.620 
that commands and Australia's full
on<00:04:18.400> his<00:04:18.519> tech<00:04:18.700> instead<00:04:18.970> he's<00:04:19.390> got<00:04:19.570> the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
on his tech instead he's got the

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.420 
on his tech instead he's got the
Stargate<00:04:19.959> down<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.530> thought<00:04:20.860> he<00:04:20.950> would<00:04:21.040> he's

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
Stargate down so I thought he would he's

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.530 
Stargate down so I thought he would he's
got<00:04:21.580> starboard<00:04:22.000> done<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.120> thought<00:04:22.300> he<00:04:22.360> would<00:04:22.450> go

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
got starboard done I thought he would go

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.880 
got starboard done I thought he would go
for<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.780> push<00:04:22.990> but<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.530> looks<00:04:23.680> like<00:04:23.710> he's

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
for the push but it looks like he's

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.590 
for the push but it looks like he's
gonna<00:04:23.980> go<00:04:24.160> for<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.370> job<00:04:24.580> instead<00:04:24.760> realizing

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
gonna go for a job instead realizing

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.270 
gonna go for a job instead realizing
that<00:04:25.690> be<00:04:25.840> soo<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.170> relying<00:04:26.530> mainly<00:04:26.740> on<00:04:27.100> his

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
that be soo is relying mainly on his

that be soo is relying mainly on his
block<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.580> his<00:04:27.790> target<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.780> defend<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.140> and

block and his target to defend it and
now<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.710> time<00:04:29.950> remember<00:04:30.370> last<00:04:30.550> time<00:04:30.730> versus

now this time remember last time versus

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.250 
now this time remember last time versus
the<00:04:31.270> last<00:04:31.420> piece<00:04:31.570> of<00:04:31.600> did<00:04:31.780> have<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:31.960> advantage

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
the last piece of did have the advantage

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.450 
the last piece of did have the advantage
of<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.410> river<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.710> help<00:04:32.830> him<00:04:32.920> defend<00:04:33.190> he<00:04:33.280> does

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
of the river to help him defend he does

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.920 
of the river to help him defend he does
not<00:04:33.550> have<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.060> time<00:04:34.240> around<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.720> I

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
not have that this time around and I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.270 
not have that this time around and I
don't<00:04:35.170> think<00:04:35.260> he's<00:04:35.440> gonna<00:04:35.500> actually<00:04:35.770> be<00:04:36.100> able

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
don't think he's gonna actually be able

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.940 
don't think he's gonna actually be able

down<00:05:01.570> this<00:05:01.960> was<00:05:02.140> I'm<00:05:02.410> not<00:05:02.560> sure<00:05:02.620> where<00:05:03.340> his

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
down this was I'm not sure where his

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.730 
down this was I'm not sure where his
tech<00:05:03.700> is<00:05:03.820> at<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.090> moment<00:05:04.420> I<00:05:04.590> might<00:05:05.590> be

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
tech is at the moment I might be

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.440 
tech is at the moment I might be
possibly<00:05:06.100> going<00:05:06.250> for<00:05:06.460> fast<00:05:06.640> carriers<00:05:07.240> again

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
possibly going for fast carriers again

possibly going for fast carriers again
but<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.630> think<00:05:07.840> Aras<00:05:08.020> would<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.260> ready<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.500> cope

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
but I think Aras would be ready to cope

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.110 
but I think Aras would be ready to cope
with<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:08.830> I'm<00:05:08.950> sure<00:05:09.100> he's<00:05:09.280> aware<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:09.670> that<00:05:09.970> is

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
with it I'm sure he's aware that that is

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.340 
with it I'm sure he's aware that that is
a<00:05:10.180> possibility<00:05:10.450> at<00:05:10.630> this<00:05:10.660> point<00:05:10.930> in<00:05:10.990> time<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
a possibility at this point in time and

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.600 
a possibility at this point in time and
iris<00:05:11.770> is<00:05:11.890> now<00:05:11.950> getting<00:05:12.130> his<00:05:12.250> drop<00:05:12.370> ship<00:05:12.520> out
