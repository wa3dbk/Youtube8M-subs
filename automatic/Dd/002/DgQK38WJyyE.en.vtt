00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.230
 and that the roofs we know shaker 77 and we 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.539
 found on a map quite special 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.600
 which is simply called for 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 kraft 2 and see what you get out of your 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.510
 hedgehog hello hello so here we go 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.890
 of course nothing will really reveal you from 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.300
 this map for me the hall to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.759
 the place where we are, I will be told 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.950
 because those voices there but we had a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.380
 little message to tell you about 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 about this map rather small 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.480
 things to ask you lÃ© have or where 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 in is her advancement she is not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.680
 still finished far away but but we 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.200
 work on it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 do you have anything else to say about this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.530
 instead of throwing fish in all 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.840
 the senses I think that's fine 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 summary okay when you wanted to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.829
 request is already a first thing 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.199
 it was that in the comments you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.609
 we gave your nickname minecraft 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.890
 so why do not you know for sure 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.119
 hack or something like that he 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.250
 we would need your password to the site 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.960
 but it's just sending skulls 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.909
 that we have here are not at all 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.090
 customize and in fact we would like 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.590
 to have as much skull as possible 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.259
 personalized ie a skull to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.479
 your at the head of your character 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.790
 minecraft so that's it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.259
 would allow you to be of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.880
 be part of the map 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.960
 and then we will allow us to have 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.610
 full of different heads what is 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.770
 much more fun than few echoes 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.289
 dect is from tv 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.700
 here and then something else we wanted 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.710
 ask yourself is pretty important it's 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.390
 simply that we are not in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.939
 breakdown of ideas I will not go that far 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.229
 but but let's say that in our match 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.899
 as it is a fairly open map 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.119
 we can easily add small ones 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.119
 mini games ideas like that two mini 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.770
 games in what we wanted to ask 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.560
 it's just if you have a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.780
 idea of mini games to pass it on to us 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.880
 to gold or how do we 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.380
 to transmit so already it can be you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.539
 can send us an idea 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.280
 simply share in writing explain to us 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.989
 the principle be you can us 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.030
 to pass down a map minecraft 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.510
 with the construction of the system already 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.220
 do it like that we'll go see and then and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.130
 then if we like it we will invite you 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.530
 outright maybe to come to build 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 this mini games that you will have done on the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.130
 map then already some mini-games for 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 those who do not understand it very well 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.340
 can be by that I give ideas the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.459
 more basic a fake of course your 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.500
 things more original but the one stand of 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.989
 archery in shooting win points 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.569
 fighting stuff etc all of that 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.000
 I call it children's mini games 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.709
 these are titles like that a game of 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.120
 fishing we must I can with canes to 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.250
 targeted fishing targets or stuff like 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.989
 this is mini games you do not have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.220
 no need to think of a scenario that 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.870
 going around you just need to 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 find a pretty original concept 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.090
 can have fun so that's for 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.880
 send me to send us his ideas on 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.609
 created a special mailbox that that 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.040
 will appear on the screen and that's called 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:12.150
 destiny kraft @ hotmail.fr 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.829
 that's what I have of everything 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.959
 of ivory wishes to evoke something 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.090
 I think you were very competent and 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.819
 that you have not forgotten anything at all 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.950
 fetid the waiters action but that's okay 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.389
 it fits well 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.560
 so here we go nothing show you 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:32.310
 totaka because apart from this building 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.490
 strange special when you do not know 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.210
 too much 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.770
 yes no it's true not too much and then 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.380
 here we will continue quietly to 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.870
 work on the map a whole and 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.490
 then with our little credit too 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.370
 that they help us a little bit not see 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:53.350
 wrong yes yes yes paris and then so 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.010
 do not hesitate if you have questions 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.420

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.280
