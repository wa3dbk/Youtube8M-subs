00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello everyone and welcome to mine 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.400
 sorry new video if you don't 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.110
 see, however, it is not important 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.969
 sorry especially for my choice 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:19.920
 from youtube but now I'm back and that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.869
 Christmas video for example you can 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 give this thing up for me 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.880
 preparing the candies 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.279
 le haribo type gummy to understand 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.899
 or those covered with sugar ad 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.399
 example excuse the emotion I owe myself 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.860
 resume again to do these 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.100
 candy I will taste peach 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 because my peach juice 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.039
 you will need 12 grams of gelatin in 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.230
 sheets can be found very well at 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.180
 supermarket which is about 6 sheets 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.860
 the water is not important 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 quality a little bit from this to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.100
 soak these because giving will not go 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.979
 in the recipe a 200 g pot of 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.830
 sugar 100 g of fruit juice 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.200
 pleasure juice of half a lemon of course 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.479
 you will need a juicer or otherwise 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.729
 with a fork and then you will need them 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.040
 a print I will try to make them 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.409
 rectangular with this socket in 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.900
 aluminum but you can use more 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.790
 also make molds easier for you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 silicone 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.909
 we go immediately with the preparation 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 so let's go and get our papers 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.670
 of gelatine and we're going to put them all 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.670
 in cold water 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.009
 ok and we forget them here for a while 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 at this point we are going to take the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.630
 Our saucepan put it there here 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.180
 little and we go to put the 200 g of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.479
 sugar sorry if I sign badly but I am 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.830
 alone and 100 grams which we then go to 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.140
 to put 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:17.970
 he admits the juice of my vehicle 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:20.570
 lemon that I squeezed ok and then I go to 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.980
 put my fruit juice 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.090
 so in my case as I told you 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.090
 first to fishing 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:35.520
 ok done now i will tell you how to proceed 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.100
 ok i was telling you at this point take a 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.570
 spoon always excuse for shooting 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:47.760
 the notes to mix will be a 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.190
 very full bodied than then anyway 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.490
 it will become more liquid because it 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:59.390
 sugar will melt and then we light 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.390
 the fire in my kitchen 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.130
 ok let's make it boil and it will have to clean 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.110
 our compound always dangerous for 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.850
 two minutes 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:22.260
 at this point you have to count two minutes 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.930
 and over time started to squeeze the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.890
 gelatin fish glue is from this 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.050
 point of knowing how to count e 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.750
 tidy up for a minute and put the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.970
 jelly that you have previously 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.890
 wrung out at this point you have 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.519
 mix your jelly in beige 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.410
 high put it in the mold pour it e 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.030
 now I can only hurt because I am 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.530
 with one hand 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:53.700
 ok now that yours is yours 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.410
 candies will be put into the mold 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.850
 waited will accept environment tour that 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.130
 cool and then put it in the fridge for 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.510
 8 hours anyway of time they become 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.100
 well well gelatinous we say and then 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.970
 tomorrow morning 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.480
 cut them and put the sugar or 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.870
 if you have instant I will show you 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:23.420
 just press and in this way 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.550
 sorry and the candy will come out 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.940

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.010
