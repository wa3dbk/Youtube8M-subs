awkward<00:02:15.670> angle<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.299> do<00:02:16.840> move<00:02:17.170> over<00:02:17.440> there<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.830> do

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
awkward angle I do move over there I do

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.789 
awkward angle I do move over there I do
give<00:02:19.030> him<00:02:19.150> about<00:02:19.330> half<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.810> tracks<00:02:20.230> width<00:02:20.500> to

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
give him about half the tracks width to

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.979 
give him about half the tracks width to
rejoin<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.430> he<00:02:21.549> just<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.970> think<00:02:22.599> he<00:02:22.840> knew<00:02:22.959> he

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989

rejoin but he just I think he knew he
was<00:02:23.260> doing<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:23.739> he<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.370> he<00:02:24.670> knew<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.819> was

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
and get good one run even coming on to

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.770 
and get good one run even coming on to
hang<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.120> straight<00:02:32.730> through<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.790> last<00:02:34.060> corner

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
hang a straight through this last corner

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.590 
hang a straight through this last corner
onto<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> straight<00:02:36.890> here<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.310> then<00:02:37.880> yeah<00:02:38.390> go

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
onto the straight here and then yeah go

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.400 
onto the straight here and then yeah go
good<00:02:38.780> run<00:02:38.930> on<00:02:38.959> him<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:41.120> decided<00:02:41.510> slipstream

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
and go to his left and about this point

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.930 
and go to his left and about this point
I'm<00:02:45.260> definitely<00:02:45.700> somewhat<00:02:46.700> alongside

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
I'm definitely somewhat alongside

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.900 
I'm definitely somewhat alongside
probably<00:02:47.630> half<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.050> car<00:02:48.260> but<00:02:49.130> he<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.400> forces

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
probably half the car but he just forces

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.870 
probably half the car but he just forces
me<00:02:49.940> onto<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> side<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.930> road<00:02:51.790> bit<00:02:52.790> of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
me onto the side of the road bit of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.500 
me onto the side of the road bit of
contact<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:54.340> everything's<00:02:55.340> okay<00:02:55.819> just<00:02:56.030> about

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
contact but everything's okay just about

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.009 
contact but everything's okay just about
then<00:02:57.689> coming<00:02:58.590> into<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.000> visible<00:03:00.000> where<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
new section is at the track he just goes

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
flying into me he saw none of what that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.220 
flying into me he saw none of what that
was<00:03:08.849> for<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.269> other<00:03:09.659> think<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:09.989> did<00:03:10.170> anything

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
was for the other think I did anything

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.319 
was for the other think I did anything
wrong<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:11.730> begin<00:03:11.849> with<00:03:12.150> early<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:12.959> clip

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
wrong to begin with early in this clip

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.610 
wrong to begin with early in this clip
but<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.360> call<00:03:15.540> out<00:03:15.659> in<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> lead<00:03:15.930> steel<00:03:16.260> stuff

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
but I call out in the lead steel stuff

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.940 
but I call out in the lead steel stuff
what<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.829> was<00:03:16.920> alright<00:03:18.200> but<00:03:19.200> behind<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:19.799> he

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
what I was alright but behind but he

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.949 
what I was alright but behind but he
still<00:03:20.250> he's<00:03:20.730> still<00:03:20.760> there<00:03:21.180> still<00:03:21.420> lingering

so<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.709> sure<00:03:22.769> if<00:03:22.950> he's<00:03:23.310> gonna<00:03:23.459> hit<00:03:23.640> me

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
so I'm not sure if he's gonna hit me

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.259 
so I'm not sure if he's gonna hit me

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
again

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.420 
again
I<00:03:24.299> actually<00:03:24.989> anticipated<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.159> I<00:03:26.190> didn't

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
I actually anticipated this but I didn't

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.979 
I actually anticipated this but I didn't
quite<00:03:26.609> get<00:03:26.790> out<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.000> way<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.239> time<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.450> saw<00:03:27.750> him

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
quite get out the way in time I saw him

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.880 
quite get out the way in time I saw him
coming<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:29.579> they<00:03:29.730> ever<00:03:29.909> go<00:03:30.090> he<00:03:30.329> hit<00:03:30.480> me<00:03:30.890> this

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890

coming and they ever go he hit me this
bit<00:03:32.040> really<00:03:32.430> surprised<00:03:32.760> me<00:03:32.970> because<00:03:33.120> then<00:03:33.569> I

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
bit really surprised me because then I

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.470 
bit really surprised me because then I
was<00:03:35.489> looking<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:35.849> him<00:03:35.909> there<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.239> they<00:03:36.329> need

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
was looking for him there but they need

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.380 
was looking for him there but they need
to<00:03:36.510> come<00:03:36.750> flying<00:03:36.930> out<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.260> front<00:03:37.409> of<00:03:37.500> me

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
to come flying out in front of me

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.690 
to come flying out in front of me
I<00:03:38.720> wasn't<00:03:39.350> going<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.620> accept<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.430> he's

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
I wasn't going to accept that so he's

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.220 
I wasn't going to accept that so he's
hit<00:03:40.910> me<00:03:40.970> off<00:03:41.180> three<00:03:41.420> times<00:03:41.450> there<00:03:41.870> pretty<00:03:42.050> much

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
hit me off three times there pretty much

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.640 
hit me off three times there pretty much
three<00:03:42.590> or<00:03:42.680> four<00:03:42.860> times<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.900> can't<00:03:45.230> let<00:03:45.380> win

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
three or four times so I can't let win

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.930 
three or four times so I can't let win
this<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:47.120> with<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> bit<00:03:48.170> more<00:03:48.200> precision<00:03:48.710> I<00:03:49.070> do

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
this so with a bit more precision I do

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.650 
this so with a bit more precision I do
what<00:03:50.210> I<00:03:50.240> have<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.450> do<00:03:50.600> here<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.820> just<00:03:53.090> plug<00:03:53.480> him
