today I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.019 
today I want to talk a little bit about
intensive<00:00:08.559> grazing<00:00:08.799> setting<00:00:09.639> up<00:00:09.849> paddocks

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:12.029 
intensive grazing setting up paddocks

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.480 
intensive grazing setting up paddocks
this<00:00:13.029> field<00:00:13.299> here<00:00:13.689> I<00:00:13.840> believe<00:00:14.770> is<00:00:14.920> roughly<00:00:15.219> ten

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
this field here I believe is roughly ten

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.009 
this field here I believe is roughly ten
acres<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:15.969> goes<00:00:16.150> down<00:00:16.359> to<00:00:16.510> the<00:00:16.600> tree<00:00:16.810> line

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:17.019 
acres it goes down to the tree line

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.760 
acres it goes down to the tree line
there<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:19.090> then<00:00:19.359> every<00:00:19.630> apple<00:00:20.170> tree<00:00:20.349> you<00:00:20.530> see

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
there and then every apple tree you see

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.470 
there and then every apple tree you see
there<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:24.310> I've<00:00:24.430> done<00:00:24.670> is<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:25.030> break<00:00:25.300> this

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
there what I've done is I break this

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.570 
there what I've done is I break this
this<00:00:25.960> field<00:00:26.230> down<00:00:26.410> in<00:00:26.590> paddocks<00:00:27.039> and<00:00:27.220> this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
this field down in paddocks and this

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.640 
this field down in paddocks and this
forces<00:00:27.940> the<00:00:28.210> cows<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.750> eat<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.020> grass<00:00:29.260> in<00:00:29.590> that

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
forces the cows to eat the grass in that

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.069 
forces the cows to eat the grass in that
paddocks<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.699> little<00:00:31.029> bit<00:00:31.119> more<00:00:31.330> consistently

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
paddocks a little bit more consistently

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.310 
paddocks a little bit more consistently
and<00:00:32.910> distribute<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.059> manure<00:00:34.359> which

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
and distribute the manure which

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.389 
and distribute the manure which
fertilizes<00:00:36.070> better<00:00:37.859> another<00:00:38.859> thing<00:00:39.219> it<00:00:39.370> does

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
fertilizes better another thing it does

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.719 
fertilizes better another thing it does
is<00:00:40.269> why<00:00:40.479> they're<00:00:40.690> in<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.899> paddocks<00:00:41.729> because

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
is why they're in the paddocks because

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.459 
is why they're in the paddocks because
they'll<00:00:42.999> beat<00:00:43.179> down<00:00:43.420> on<00:00:43.690> some<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.260> weeds

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
they'll beat down on some of the weeds

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.040 
they'll beat down on some of the weeds
that<00:00:44.620> they<00:00:44.800> don't<00:00:45.039> eat<00:00:45.339> like<00:00:46.179> the<00:00:46.300> joepie<00:00:46.749> that

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050

now that we're on the four-wheeler I've

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.080 
now that we're on the four-wheeler I've
got<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.980> set<00:01:39.190> up<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.430> make<00:01:39.550> it<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.730> little<00:01:39.850> easier

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
got it set up to make it a little easier

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.810 
got it set up to make it a little easier
to<00:01:40.480> set<00:01:40.660> up<00:01:40.690> these<00:01:40.900> paddocks<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.590> got<00:01:42.490> my<00:01:42.610> poly

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
to set up these paddocks I got my poly

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.220 
to set up these paddocks I got my poly
stake<00:01:43.180> holder<00:01:43.600> here<00:01:43.900> this<00:01:44.290> holds<00:01:44.620> them<00:01:44.740> down

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
stake holder here this holds them down

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
stake holder here this holds them down
these<00:01:47.230> here<00:01:47.590> actually<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:49.180> hold<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.540> reel<00:01:50.190> or<00:01:51.190> I

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
these here actually can hold a reel or I

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.180 
these here actually can hold a reel or I
can<00:01:52.120> lay<00:01:52.270> out<00:01:52.450> small<00:01:52.870> 50<00:01:53.320> gallon<00:01:53.620> water<00:01:53.800> trough

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
can lay out small 50 gallon water trough

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.560 
can lay out small 50 gallon water trough
across<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.760> because<00:01:54.909> we<00:01:55.030> have<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.210> move<00:01:55.450> the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
across it because we have to move the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.090 
across it because we have to move the
water<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.840> just<00:01:59.409> makes<00:01:59.620> it<00:01:59.710> so<00:01:59.890> much<00:01:59.950> easier

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
water to it just makes it so much easier

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.600 
water to it just makes it so much easier
so<00:02:00.909> we're<00:02:01.060> going<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.210> get<00:02:01.390> started<00:02:01.750> now

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.160 

and<00:02:05.610> we'll<00:02:05.790> start<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.120> our<00:02:06.270> first<00:02:06.660> one<00:02:06.750> here

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and we'll start with our first one here

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.240 
and we'll start with our first one here
I<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.990> all<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.350> before<00:02:10.710> roller<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.040> don't

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
I do this all from before roller I don't

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
I do this all from before roller I don't
even<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.850> off<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.210> makes<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.540> quick

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
even have to get off it makes a quick

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.050 
even have to get off it makes a quick
and<00:02:12.990> simple<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.560> then<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> move<00:02:14.820> them<00:02:15.000> a

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and simple and then you move them a

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.230 
and simple and then you move them a
bunch<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.720> want<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.990> keep<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.290> simple

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
bunch you want to keep it simple

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:28.550 
bunch you want to keep it simple
this<00:02:18.240> will<00:02:18.420> help<00:02:18.540> put<00:02:18.840> weight<00:02:19.050> on<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.380> cattle

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:39.220 

next<00:02:29.560> one

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.280 

okay<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.770> see<00:02:40.980> I've<00:02:41.510> got<00:02:42.510> my<00:02:42.540> poly<00:02:42.930> snakes

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
okay we can see I've got my poly snakes

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.100 
okay we can see I've got my poly snakes
running<00:02:43.650> across<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> field<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.810> now<00:02:45.810> we're

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
running across the field there now we're

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.960 
running across the field there now we're
going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.260> go<00:02:46.410> back<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.830> tie<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> poly

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
going to go back and tie on the poly

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210 
going to go back and tie on the poly
string<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:49.620> we'll<00:02:49.740> move<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> cattle

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
string and then we'll move the cattle

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.030 
string and then we'll move the cattle
into<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.670> paddocks<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:52.320> you'll<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:52.770> that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
into this paddocks and you'll see that

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.320 
into this paddocks and you'll see that
you<00:02:53.700> spend<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.150> much<00:02:54.390> time<00:02:54.420> moving<00:02:55.050> cattle

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
you spend this much time moving cattle

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330 
you spend this much time moving cattle
it's<00:02:57.330> very<00:02:57.630> simple<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> cattle<00:02:59.250> to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it's very simple to get the cattle to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.490 
it's very simple to get the cattle to
follow<00:02:59.580> either<00:02:59.870> they're<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.020> there<00:03:01.200> waiting

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
follow either they're up there waiting

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.390 
follow either they're up there waiting
on<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.770> hill<00:03:01.980> for<00:03:02.190> me<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:04.100> it'd<00:03:05.100> only<00:03:05.130> take

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
on the hill for me now so it'd only take

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.020 
on the hill for me now so it'd only take
a<00:03:05.550> few<00:03:05.820> minutes<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.240> get<00:03:06.330> them<00:03:06.570> moved<00:03:07.910> okay<00:03:08.910> I

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
a few minutes to get them moved okay I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.120 
a few minutes to get them moved okay I
like<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.540> rep<00:03:09.720> poly<00:03:10.080> wire<00:03:10.320> around<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.860> fence

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
like the rep poly wire around the fence

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.610 
like the rep poly wire around the fence
wire<00:03:11.400> three<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.390> four<00:03:12.630> times<00:03:12.840> as<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.320> can<00:03:13.470> see

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
wire three to four times as you can see

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.460 
wire three to four times as you can see
I<00:03:13.650> did<00:03:14.010> there<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.970> then<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.150> tied<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.540> off<00:03:15.840> so

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
I did there and then I tied it off so

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.730 
I did there and then I tied it off so
now<00:03:16.650> we'll<00:03:16.890> take<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:18.090> school<00:03:21.200> as<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.530> see

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
now we'll take the school as you can see

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.950 
now we'll take the school as you can see
I<00:03:22.770> have<00:03:23.040> another<00:03:23.160> area<00:03:23.820> rigged<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.300> here<00:03:24.570> for

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
I have another area rigged up here for

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:45.170 
I have another area rigged up here for
this<00:03:25.140> bowl

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.970 

I'd<00:03:46.180> stop<00:03:46.540> at<00:03:46.720> each<00:03:46.840> one<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.410> loop<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.920> through

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
I'd stop at each one and loop it through

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.150 
I'd stop at each one and loop it through
the<00:03:48.250> Cawley's<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.900> forth<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.590> on<00:03:50.830> till<00:03:51.069> we

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
the Cawley's so forth and so on till we

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.880 
the Cawley's so forth and so on till we
get<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.519> other<00:03:51.700> side<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:53.319> then<00:03:53.560> again

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
get to the other side and then again

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.089 
get to the other side and then again
tying<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.519> on<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:55.000> other<00:03:55.150> end<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.650> now<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.830> can

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
tying it on the other end so now you can

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.290 
tying it on the other end so now you can
see<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:58.720> made<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.050> across<00:03:59.290> they're<00:04:00.030> made<00:04:01.030> three

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
see it made it across they're made three

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.770 
see it made it across they're made three
passes<00:04:01.480> before<00:04:02.050> setting<00:04:02.830> up<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.069> poly<00:04:03.280> stakes

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
passes before setting up the poly stakes

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.240 
passes before setting up the poly stakes
the<00:04:04.780> fourth<00:04:05.080> pass<00:04:05.349> would<00:04:05.590> have<00:04:05.739> been<00:04:05.860> putting

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
the fourth pass would have been putting

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.479 
the fourth pass would have been putting
in<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.400> poly<00:04:06.700> Stig's<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:08.049> fifth<00:04:08.290> pass<00:04:08.560> put<00:04:09.370> in

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
in the poly Stig's the fifth pass put in

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.270 
in the poly Stig's the fifth pass put in
the<00:04:09.580> string<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.349> that<00:04:11.349> pretty<00:04:11.620> well<00:04:11.920> keeps

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
the string and that pretty well keeps

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.479 
the string and that pretty well keeps
the<00:04:12.730> weeds<00:04:12.940> off<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.480> fence<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:15.069> everything

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
the weeds off the fence so everything

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.940 
the weeds off the fence so everything
stays<00:04:15.730> nice<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.209> hot<00:04:16.500> now<00:04:17.500> we're<00:04:17.650> going<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.799> go

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
stays nice and hot now we're going to go

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.680 
stays nice and hot now we're going to go
up<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.190> get<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.400> boys<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.970> move<00:04:19.389> them<00:04:19.540> over

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
up and get the boys and move them over

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.909 
up and get the boys and move them over
Oh

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.440 

steers<00:04:24.639> every<00:04:25.419> one<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.600> them<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:28.060> we'll<00:04:28.300> get

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
steers every one of them so we'll get

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.030 
steers every one of them so we'll get
ready<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.720> move<00:04:28.960> them<00:04:29.139> they<00:04:29.710> look<00:04:29.889> like

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040

going to go over here and then tie this

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.700 
going to go over here and then tie this
into<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.750> poly<00:04:37.960> string<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:39.750> now<00:04:40.750> I'm<00:04:41.290> just

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.740 
into the poly string and now I'm just
going<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.070> open<00:04:43.060> up<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.300> section<00:04:43.720> here<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:46.510> then
