stuff like that just ramble on about

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
stuff like that just ramble on about
what<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.190> should<00:01:02.370> bring<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
what I think they should bring in and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.780 
what I think they should bring in and
what<00:01:03.120> they<00:01:03.239> should<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> game<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
what they should do with the game and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.210 
what they should do with the game and
one<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.119> wanted<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.390> talk<00:01:06.570> about<00:01:06.600> was

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
one of them I wanted to talk about was

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
one of them I wanted to talk about was
Moab's<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.490> nukes<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.540> they

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
Moab's or nukes like do you think they

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
Moab's or nukes like do you think they
should<00:01:09.960> bring<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.290> nukes<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> MOAB<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.460> black

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
should bring in nukes or a MOAB to black

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.120 
should bring in nukes or a MOAB to black
ops<00:01:12.030> 2<00:01:12.270> will<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> fit<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> type<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> game

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
ops 2 will it fit that type of game

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
ops 2 will it fit that type of game
because<00:01:14.810> infinity<00:01:15.810> war<00:01:15.930> games<00:01:16.200> tend<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
because infinity war games tend to be a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.730 
because infinity war games tend to be a
lot<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.070> faster<00:01:17.880> pace<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.930> would<00:01:19.080> say<00:01:19.259> like

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
lot more faster pace that would say like

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.300 
lot more faster pace that would say like
mw2<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.430> mw3<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.479> very<00:01:21.840> fast-paced<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.710> lot<00:01:23.189> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
mw2 and mw3 are very fast-paced a lot of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850 
mw2 and mw3 are very fast-paced a lot of
the<00:01:23.369> maps<00:01:23.580> are<00:01:23.729> real<00:01:23.880> close<00:01:24.060> quarter<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.860> i

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the maps are real close quarter and i

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.499 
the maps are real close quarter and i
don't<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.520> fit<00:01:26.970> black<00:01:27.240> ops

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
don't know what that fit black ops

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.210 
don't know what that fit black ops
because<00:01:27.810> black<00:01:28.049> ops<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.560> more<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> slower

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
because black ops was more of a slower

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
because black ops was more of a slower
paced<00:01:29.549> game<00:01:29.670> i<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.060> say<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.960> guns<00:01:31.200> were

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
paced game i would say the guns were

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.870 
paced game i would say the guns were
weaker<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.310> didn't<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.549> stopped

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
weaker because they didn't have stopped

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.810 
weaker because they didn't have stopped
in<00:01:33.060> power<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.159> they<00:01:35.159> had<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> lot<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.610> recoil

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
in power and they had a lot of recoil

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
in power and they had a lot of recoil
the<00:01:36.180> guns<00:01:36.360> too<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the guns too so I don't know what that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.999 
the guns too so I don't know what that
fit<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> black<00:01:39.840> ops<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.409> black<00:01:40.770> ops

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
fit in the black ops because black ops

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.310 
fit in the black ops because black ops
although<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.119> kid<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.360> gets<00:01:42.630> turned<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.140> he

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
although this kid just gets turned on he

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.100 
although this kid just gets turned on he
should<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:44.360> turned<00:01:45.360> off<00:01:45.540> his<00:01:45.720> xbox

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
should have just turned off his xbox

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
should have just turned off his xbox
right<00:01:46.380> after<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> probably<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:48.149> know

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
right after this and probably you know

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
right after this and probably you know
broke<00:01:49.170> his<00:01:49.350> xbox<00:01:49.710> he<00:01:50.040> should<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.340> done<00:01:50.460> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
broke his xbox he should have done that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
thinking about maybe buying a new

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.140 
thinking about maybe buying a new
controller<00:03:06.230> too<00:03:06.500> because<00:03:06.800> my<00:03:07.489> controller<00:03:07.880> has

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
controller too because my controller has

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.810 
controller too because my controller has
that<00:03:08.330> slow<00:03:08.720> turn<00:03:08.989> on<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.290> right<00:03:09.610> what<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
that slow turn on the right what is it

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.630 
that slow turn on the right what is it
joystick<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:12.739> got<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> perm<00:03:13.100> amazon<00:03:13.459> for

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
joystick and I got a perm amazon for

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.250 
joystick and I got a perm amazon for
like<00:03:13.670> twenty<00:03:14.090> bucks<00:03:14.209> sound<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.870> 22

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
like twenty bucks sound like that 22

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.080 
like twenty bucks sound like that 22
bucks<00:03:15.470> brand-new<00:03:15.799> I<00:03:16.070> was<00:03:16.670> probably<00:03:16.940> thinking

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
bucks brand-new I was probably thinking

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.610 
bucks brand-new I was probably thinking
about<00:03:17.420> getting<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.720> scuf<00:03:18.049> controller<00:03:18.410> because

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
about getting a scuf controller because

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.400 
about getting a scuf controller because
uh<00:03:18.799> they<00:03:19.610> have<00:03:19.820> like<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.090> scuff<00:03:20.750> grip<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:21.230> guess

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
uh they have like a scuff grip I guess

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.009 
uh they have like a scuff grip I guess
like<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.620> military-grade<00:03:22.190> grip<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.750> makes

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
like a military-grade grip that makes

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.449 
like a military-grade grip that makes
you<00:03:24.230> hold<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.709> controller<00:03:25.010> better<00:03:25.250> and

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
you hold the controller better and

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.960 
you hold the controller better and
