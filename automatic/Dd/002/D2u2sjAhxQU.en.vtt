00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
you all the different sensors so I'm

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.660 
you all the different sensors so I'm
going<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> start<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.830> manually<00:00:14.160> which<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.549> what

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
going to start it manually which is what

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.570 
going to start it manually which is what
you'll<00:00:14.820> hear<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:20.240> and<00:00:21.859> hopefully<00:00:22.859> there<00:00:23.490> we

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
you'll hear now and hopefully there we

Chris the button right level that have

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.560 
Chris the button right level that have
been<00:02:04.190> sensible<00:02:04.580> oh<00:02:04.730> what<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.880> lot<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.150> pen<00:02:05.330> cap

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
been sensible oh what a lot of pen cap

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.380 
been sensible oh what a lot of pen cap
or<00:02:05.750> something<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.680> light<00:02:07.370> level<00:02:07.700> says<00:02:08.060> lux

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
or something the light level says lux

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.640 
or something the light level says lux
it's<00:02:08.930> not<00:02:09.200> larks<00:02:09.650> it's<00:02:09.860> just<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.160> voltage<00:02:10.490> level

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
it's not larks it's just a voltage level

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.830 
it's not larks it's just a voltage level
so<00:02:12.650> that's<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.490> one<00:02:13.670> top<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.480> finger

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
so that's this one top of the finger

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.790 
so that's this one top of the finger
over<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:18.550> goes<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.820> lowes<00:02:20.570> or<00:02:20.930> some<00:02:21.620> light

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
over it goes to lowes or some light

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.880 
over it goes to lowes or some light
getting<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.250> from<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.520> sides<00:02:23.800> take<00:02:24.800> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
getting in from the sides take the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.640 
getting in from the sides take the
finger<00:02:25.070> off<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.700> there<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:26.540> go<00:02:26.650> brightens

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
finger off it and there we go brightens

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.360 
finger off it and there we go brightens
up<00:02:27.710> against<00:02:28.070> quite<00:02:28.280> bright<00:02:28.490> room<00:02:30.370> next

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.720 
up against quite bright room next
reading<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.420> magnetism<00:02:33.050> again<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.190> says<00:02:34.370> G

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
reading is magnetism again it says G

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.170 
reading is magnetism again it says G
which<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.390> think<00:02:35.780> stands<00:02:36.050> for<00:02:36.260> girls<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:38.030> it's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
which I think stands for girls but it's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.900 
which I think stands for girls but it's
not<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.600> true<00:02:39.110> level<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.280> just<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.580> voltage

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
not a true level it's just a voltage

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.020 
not a true level it's just a voltage
level<00:02:41.240> that's<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.960> one<00:02:42.170> up<00:02:42.290> here<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.910> is

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
level that's this one up here this is

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.570 
level that's this one up here this is
just<00:02:44.210> fun<00:02:44.600> it's<00:02:44.630> not<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.260> serious<00:02:46.190> experiment

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
just fun it's not a serious experiment

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.510 
just fun it's not a serious experiment
just<00:02:49.580> serious<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.090> meet<00:02:51.160> press<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.280> button

again<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> really<00:02:54.230> cool<00:02:54.440> one<00:02:54.650> this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
again this is the really cool one this

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.280 
again this is the really cool one this
is<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> one<00:02:55.100> that's<00:02:55.310> that's<00:02:55.940> had<00:02:56.150> some<00:02:56.780> people

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
is the one that's that's had some people

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.810 
is the one that's that's had some people
at<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.680> milton<00:02:57.950> keynes<00:02:58.130> rockridge<00:02:58.610> am

at the milton keynes rockridge am
interested<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.989> is<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.320> reading<00:03:00.530> off<00:03:00.800> of

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
interested this is the reading off of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.160 
interested this is the reading off of
this<00:03:01.130> sensor<00:03:01.670> here<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.630> l<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:02.959> like

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
this sensor here this is l just like

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.990 
this sensor here this is l just like
distant<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.739> sensor<00:03:04.190> which<00:03:04.610> sends<00:03:04.880> out

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
distant the sensor which sends out

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.530 
distant the sensor which sends out
multiple<00:03:05.180> pings<00:03:06.550> sound<00:03:07.550> waves<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.150> then

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
multiple pings sound waves and then

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.350 
multiple pings sound waves and then
waits<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.410> response<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.980> come<00:03:10.160> back<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:11.270> you

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
waits the response to come back if you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.290 
waits the response to come back if you
look<00:03:11.480> at<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.660> leds<00:03:12.459> see<00:03:13.459> green<00:03:13.970> one<00:03:14.150> is

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
look at the leds see green one is

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.590 
look at the leds see green one is
flashing<00:03:14.570> really<00:03:14.959> fast<00:03:15.820> that's<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.090> pulse<00:03:17.390> is

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
flashing really fast that's the pulse is

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:27.580 
flashing really fast that's the pulse is
going<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:21.700> distance<00:03:23.170> for<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> ceiling<00:03:26.590> on

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
going in now distance for the ceiling on

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.800 
going in now distance for the ceiling on
16<00:03:28.190> centimeters<00:03:28.820> which<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.239> about<00:03:29.810> right<00:03:31.810> put

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
16 centimeters which is about right put

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.870 
16 centimeters which is about right put
my<00:03:33.050> hand<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.410> front<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.770> it<00:03:35.440> 54<00:03:36.440> centimeters<00:03:36.880> 8

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
my hand in front of it 54 centimeters 8

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.630 
my hand in front of it 54 centimeters 8
centimeters<00:03:38.540> better<00:03:39.250> because<00:03:40.250> it's<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
centimeters better because it's in the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.270 
centimeters better because it's in the
out<00:03:40.820> multiple<00:03:41.239> pulses<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:42.410> get<00:03:42.770> an<00:03:42.920> average

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
out multiple pulses you get an average

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.070 
out multiple pulses you get an average
on<00:03:43.820> all<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.060> pulses<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.630> obviously<00:03:44.900> if<00:03:44.989> you

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
on all the pulses and obviously if you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.530 
on all the pulses and obviously if you
put<00:03:45.260> your<00:03:45.290> hand<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:46.160> front<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.670> during<00:03:47.450> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
put your hand in front of it during the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.330 
put your hand in front of it during the
pulses<00:03:48.020> then<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.590> will<00:03:48.680> average<00:03:48.860> out<00:03:51.340> it's

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
pulses then it will average out it's

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.000 
pulses then it will average out it's
good<00:03:52.489> because<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.000> sense<00:03:53.269> distances<00:03:54.010> from

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
good because it can sense distances from

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.000 
good because it can sense distances from
one<00:03:55.730> centimeter<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.720> think<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.620> about<00:03:57.769> two

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
one centimeter to think it's about two

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.870 
one centimeter to think it's about two
and<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.160> half<00:03:58.190> meters<00:03:59.019> if<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.700> go<00:04:01.700> over<00:04:01.760> there

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
and a half meters if I go over there

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.979 
and a half meters if I go over there
ends<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.880> distance<00:04:05.300> to<00:04:05.420> me<00:04:05.540> dog

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.569 

see<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.290> their<00:04:10.590> children<00:04:10.980> 40

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
see if that their children 40

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.380 
see if that their children 40
centimeters<00:04:13.010> which<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.400> would<00:04:14.760> say<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.209> bit

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
centimeters which I would say is a bit

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.009 
centimeters which I would say is a bit
too<00:04:15.659> far<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.370> it's<00:04:17.389> not<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.570> most<00:04:18.690> accurate

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
too far but it's not the most accurate

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.150 
too far but it's not the most accurate
in<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.410> world<00:04:19.590> because<00:04:19.799> obviously<00:04:19.889> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
in the world because obviously the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.890 
in the world because obviously the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
it quite a good experiment with all
