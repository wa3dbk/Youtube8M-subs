00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
don't need that either that's literally

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.870 
don't need that either that's literally
useless<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.739> gy<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.250> don't<00:03:29.580> need<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
useless but in the gy you don't need the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.970 
useless but in the gy you don't need the
background<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.350> don't<00:03:31.530> need<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.739> badge

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
background and you don't need the badge

make a difference you want to change any

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.820 
make a difference you want to change any
textures<00:04:00.600> or<00:04:00.720> anything<00:04:01.020> you<00:04:01.530> just<00:04:01.560> move<00:04:01.800> that

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
textures or anything you just move that

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.960 
textures or anything you just move that
to<00:04:02.010> images<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.370> don't<00:04:02.550> have<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.850> this

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
to images you don't have to do this

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.640 
to images you don't have to do this
again<00:04:03.150> i'm<00:04:03.450> just<00:04:03.660> doing<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.020> so<00:04:04.080> it's<00:04:04.350> much

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
again i'm just doing this so it's much

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.740 
again i'm just doing this so it's much
much<00:04:04.890> easier<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.730> right<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.390> next<00:04:06.630> one

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
much easier all right in the next one

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.080 
much easier all right in the next one
the<00:04:06.840> item<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.650> take<00:04:07.830> these<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.880> you

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
the item you just take these and you

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.460 
the item you just take these and you
don't<00:04:09.239> need<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.390> camera<00:04:09.600> be<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:09.989> any<00:04:10.140> can<00:04:10.320> take

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
don't need the camera be in any can take

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.330 
don't need the camera be in any can take
that<00:04:10.590> if<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.709> want<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:10.950> doesn't<00:04:11.100> make<00:04:11.280> a

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
that if you want it doesn't make a

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.550 
that if you want it doesn't make a
difference<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:12.570> put<00:04:12.750> them<00:04:12.989> in<00:04:13.290> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
difference and then just put them in the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.380 
difference and then just put them in the
images<00:04:13.950> again<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.459> then<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.670> chest<00:04:15.000> as<00:04:15.209> well

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
images again and then the chest as well

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.750 
images again and then the chest as well
take<00:04:16.080> these<00:04:16.290> out<00:04:16.530> put<00:04:16.950> them<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.280> images

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
take these out put them in the images

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.940 
take these out put them in the images
and<00:04:18.680> there<00:04:19.680> we<00:04:19.859> go<00:04:20.040> cool<00:04:21.030> just<00:04:21.930> do<00:04:22.080> that<00:04:22.320> and

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
and there we go cool just do that and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
and there we go cool just do that and
break<00:04:23.820> zzzz<00:04:24.210> coo<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.370> last<00:04:26.370> but<00:04:26.490> not

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
break zzzz coo and last but not

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.460 
break zzzz coo and last but not
is<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.360> mobs<00:04:27.600> which<00:04:27.810> actually<00:04:27.990> look<00:04:28.200> quite

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
is the mobs which actually look quite

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.350 
is the mobs which actually look quite
cool<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.310> basically<00:04:29.640> we<00:04:29.790> just<00:04:29.820> put<00:04:30.120> them<00:04:30.240> in

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
cool so basically we just put them in

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.050 
cool so basically we just put them in
the<00:04:30.450> images<00:04:30.930> boom<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.040> then<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.490> delete<00:04:32.940> the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
the images boom and then just delete the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.330 
the images boom and then just delete the
mobs<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:34.350> should<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.100> we<00:04:35.220> have

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
mobs and that should be it so we have

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.210 
mobs and that should be it so we have
all<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.850> our<00:04:35.940> files<00:04:36.210> here<00:04:36.630> as<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.470> see<00:04:37.680> if

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
the reason I told you to make a

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.150 
the reason I told you to make a
Minecraft<00:05:20.580> door<00:05:20.970> at<00:05:21.180> them<00:05:21.750> back<00:05:22.350> up<00:05:22.650> but<00:05:23.070> he's

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
Minecraft door at them back up but he's

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.980 
Minecraft door at them back up but he's
basically<00:05:23.550> when<00:05:23.730> you<00:05:23.760> back<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.120> up<00:05:24.150> before<00:05:24.660> you

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
basically when you back it up before you

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.780 
basically when you back it up before you
put<00:05:25.140> a<00:05:25.169> texture<00:05:25.590> in<00:05:25.650> or<00:05:25.800> modify<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.400> in<00:05:26.550> any<00:05:26.700> way

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
put a texture in or modify it in any way

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.700 
put a texture in or modify it in any way
then<00:05:27.450> it<00:05:27.570> will<00:05:27.690> actually<00:05:27.870> create<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.320> backup

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
then it will actually create a backup

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.040 
then it will actually create a backup
for<00:05:29.100> your<00:05:29.220> texture<00:05:29.700> pack<00:05:29.880> for<00:05:29.910> your<00:05:30.600> original
