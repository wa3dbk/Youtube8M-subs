00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.780

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:37.662
in the forest :)

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.440
everyone is getting interviewed, today is media day

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.320
we had our pictures taken

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.220
Vanya is very handsome, as always :)

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.140
he was the only one without make-up and still pretty

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.220
We woke up early

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.040
and at 9 AM we already had to be

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.400
ready for the photo shoot, interviews and other media stuff

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.480
This is Moritz (@MooseWD) and he speaks fluent russian

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.260
Sasha is a pig :)

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.840

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.980
After all of this

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.520
we were sent to the interview room and had some interviews

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.100
and only after that we were set free and went to practice

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.080
we scrimmed with NewBee

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.160
- the champions
 - The champions of last years TI

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.420
- Danya, looks who's there!

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.260
- who?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.960
- are they arguing about something?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.100
- why?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.520
- it's NewBee! how can they be possibly arguing

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.640
- Because [beep]

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.240
- Vanya, why would Newbee have a banter?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.069
- Dunno, did you outplay them today?

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.309
- honestly I couldn't remember, it was a close game

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:31.869
- well, if you could call your Magnus 'outplaying'
- and a 'close game', then yes

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.780
stop revealing our strats you fools!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We were fighting!

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.080
and in the end Akbar got them all!

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.820
and this is it!

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.860

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.260

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.680
[Dendi is on killing spree with a TRIPLE kill!]

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680
[Dendi is dominating with an ULTRA kill!]

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:21.718
Danya are you filming your vids again?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.960
Yes and I think those guys were baseball players

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.920
[nod of approval]

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.420
Tell me Vanya, is today a good day?

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.560
