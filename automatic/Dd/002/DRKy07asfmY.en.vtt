nobody<00:01:44.369> knew<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> play<00:01:44.759> against<00:01:45.090> him

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
nobody knew how to play against him

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.450 
nobody knew how to play against him
because<00:01:45.420> he<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.049> perceived<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.860> terrible

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
because he was perceived as a terrible

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.149 
because he was perceived as a terrible
champion<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.720> when<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.860> underestimate

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
remember it took me like probably 2 or 3

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.770 
remember it took me like probably 2 or 3
months<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.579> rank<00:01:57.000> played<00:01:57.270> before<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.570> hit<00:01:57.659> the

there is a time when masteries in like
the<00:03:00.100> first<00:03:00.370> tree<00:03:00.820> instead<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.600> TAC<00:03:01.840> speed

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
the first tree instead of a TAC speed

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.780 
the first tree instead of a TAC speed
where<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.500> is<00:03:02.590> right<00:03:02.740> now<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:03.190> used<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.400> be<00:03:03.490> 4%

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
where it is right now it used to be 4%

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.510 
where it is right now it used to be 4%
crit<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:05.590> was<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.920> dumbest<00:03:06.250> thing<00:03:06.310> I've

for<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.270> tip<00:04:20.540> probably<00:04:20.840> just<00:04:21.320> always<00:04:21.500> try<00:04:21.650> to

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
for a tip probably just always try to

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.130 
for a tip probably just always try to
keep<00:04:21.830> your<00:04:21.890> e<00:04:22.160> off<00:04:22.430> cooldown<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.300> what<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.020> mean

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
keep your e off cooldown and what I mean

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.900 
keep your e off cooldown and what I mean
by<00:04:24.230> this<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.680> when<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.250> get<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.610> certain<00:04:25.850> number

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
by this is when you get a certain number

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.400 
by this is when you get a certain number
of<00:04:26.060> stacks<00:04:26.270> on<00:04:26.450> somebody<00:04:26.720> for<00:04:26.900> example<00:04:26.960> you

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
of stacks on somebody for example you

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.960 
of stacks on somebody for example you
Autotech<00:04:27.800> them<00:04:27.920> once<00:04:28.100> or<00:04:28.340> five<00:04:28.580> times<00:04:28.760> does

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
Autotech them once or five times does

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.220 
Autotech them once or five times does
really<00:04:29.150> matter<00:04:29.330> don't<00:04:29.810> just<00:04:30.050> immediately

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
really matter don't just immediately

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.440 
really matter don't just immediately
rend<00:04:30.680> try<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.370> set<00:04:31.820> up<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:32.000> creep

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
rend try to set up a creep

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.090 
rend try to set up a creep
so<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:33.230> stacks<00:04:33.440> will<00:04:33.560> stay<00:04:33.710> there<00:04:33.830> for<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:33.980> few

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
so the stacks will stay there for a few

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.350 
so the stacks will stay there for a few
seconds<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.700> auto-attack<00:04:35.150> your<00:04:35.270> peep

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
seconds and you auto-attack your peep

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.150 
seconds and you auto-attack your peep
down<00:04:35.510> one<00:04:35.720> HP<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.050> then<00:04:36.110> your<00:04:36.230> rent<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.530> if

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
your rent kills the creep then your rent

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.190 
your rent kills the creep then your rent

will go back off of cooldown a lot of

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.780 
will go back off of cooldown a lot of
people<00:04:42.410> will<00:04:42.620> just<00:04:42.650> immediately<00:04:43.310> snap<00:04:43.580> their

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
like 10 or 15 seconds and then you're

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.210 
like 10 or 15 seconds and then you're
vulnerable<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.380> what<00:04:48.740> you'll<00:04:48.860> see<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:49.010> lot<00:04:49.160> of
