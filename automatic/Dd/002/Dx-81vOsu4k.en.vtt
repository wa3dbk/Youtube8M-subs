00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
average of five using my dayan zhanchi

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.400 
average of five using my dayan zhanchi
and<00:00:15.540> QQ<00:00:16.289> timer<00:00:17.359> this<00:00:18.359> must<00:00:18.660> first<00:00:18.930> average<00:00:19.289> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and QQ timer this must first average of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.769 
and QQ timer this must first average of
five<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.859> which<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.220> doing<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.580> voiceover<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.720> I

hope you like it
so<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.619> are<00:00:25.710> scrambles<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.400> cube<00:00:31.489> what<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so there are scrambles the cube what I

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.870 
so there are scrambles the cube what I
do<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.210> try<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> do<00:00:33.750> my<00:00:33.780> actual<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.700> less<00:00:35.700> than

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
do is I try to do my actual in less than

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.299 
do is I try to do my actual in less than
12<00:00:36.210> seconds<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.520> that<00:00:38.520> leaves<00:00:39.000> me<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:40.309> about

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
12 seconds so that leaves me with about

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.610 
12 seconds so that leaves me with about
three<00:00:41.879> seconds<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.390> violence<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.989> three

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
three seconds for violence and three

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
three seconds for violence and three
seconds<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.100> pls<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.850> an<00:00:47.850> idea<00:00:48.180> solved<00:00:48.539> would

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
seconds for pls so an idea solved would

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.220 
seconds for pls so an idea solved would
be<00:00:48.809> 18<00:00:49.289> seconds<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.039> since<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.180> overshoot<00:00:52.020> by

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
be 18 seconds but since I overshoot by

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.520 
be 18 seconds but since I overshoot by
1.8<00:00:53.010> seconds<00:00:53.340> also<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.910> becomes<00:00:54.690> 19<00:00:55.320> point

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
1.8 seconds also it becomes 19 point

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
1.8 seconds also it becomes 19 point
eight<00:00:55.649> seconds

that I will get up to I will be a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.580 
that I will get up to I will be a
15-second<00:02:29.340> average<00:02:29.640> solver<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.450> by<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.380> end

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
15-second average solver and by the end

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.260 
15-second average solver and by the end
of<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.830> year<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.340> my<00:02:35.580> wish

of this year so this is just my wish

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.730 
of this year so this is just my wish
let's<00:02:36.990> see<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.460> can<00:02:38.460> be<00:02:38.640> fulfilled<00:02:42.740> see

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
let's see if it can be fulfilled see

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.490 
let's see if it can be fulfilled see
there's<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.370> seventeen<00:02:44.820> point<00:02:45.090> five<00:02:45.240> one

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
there's a seventeen point five one

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.370 
there's a seventeen point five one
that's<00:02:46.500> what<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.100> was<00:02:47.460> saying<00:02:47.640> about<00:02:48.380> these

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
that's what I was saying about these

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.050 
that's what I was saying about these
swords<00:02:49.860> are<00:02:49.920> becoming<00:02:50.220> quite<00:02:50.490> common<00:02:50.880> now

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
swords are becoming quite common now

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.460 
swords are becoming quite common now
I<00:02:51.330> mean<00:02:51.690> 17<00:02:52.380> seconds<00:02:52.709> 16<00:02:53.430> seconds<00:02:53.790> old<00:02:54.440> so<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
I mean 17 seconds 16 seconds old so I

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.670 
I mean 17 seconds 16 seconds old so I
think<00:02:55.980> my<00:02:56.340> average<00:02:56.640> will<00:02:56.880> be<00:02:57.060> lowered<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:58.140> one

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
think my average will be lowered in one

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:12.200 
think my average will be lowered in one
month<00:02:58.920> or<00:02:59.100> so

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.210 

and<00:03:13.210> one<00:03:13.960> more<00:03:14.140> thing<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.440> keep<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.770> mind<00:03:14.980> while

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
and one more thing I keep in mind while

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.550 
and one more thing I keep in mind while
doing<00:03:15.460> actual<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:16.030> not<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.750> do<00:03:16.900> too<00:03:17.110> many<00:03:17.320> moves

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
doing actual is not to do too many moves

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.170 
doing actual is not to do too many moves
while<00:03:17.980> doing<00:03:18.220> after<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:20.550> do<00:03:21.550> not<00:03:21.820> practice

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
while doing after and I do not practice

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.360 
while doing after and I do not practice
look<00:03:22.420> ahead<00:03:22.570> okay<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.410> there's<00:03:23.740> a<00:03:23.830> twenty<00:03:24.220> one

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
look ahead okay so there's a twenty one

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.180
