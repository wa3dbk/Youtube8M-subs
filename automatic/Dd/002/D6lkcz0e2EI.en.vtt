00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.590
 hi everyone this is all a 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.360
 chain today we find ourselves for 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.060
 new video and I will introduce you 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.150
 the free kraft mode available under the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.390
 version 0.7 points 1/2 graff pocket 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.920
 edition is as its name indicates 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.750
 free kraft means kraft and 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.430
 for free and so you will be able to everything 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.830
 simply kraft and free everything 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.199
 that you want so then let's imagine that 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.860
 I go to the kraft table I did not 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.570
 no items at least I have no items 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.219
 I want to make a diamond armor 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.469
 so you just have to click 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.079
 as if you simply had the 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.940
 resources needed to make 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.350
 armor or any other object 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.430
 so it really works for everything 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.500
 anything anytime even in 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.850
 the kraft option so no need to be 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.060
 in the craps table you can go 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.820
 everywhere in the stone cutter like you 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.929
 can see here 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.179
 so then I'll make you a video 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.920
 presentation of a rather special mode 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.660
 so this wednesday so as you can 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.310
 see I have a little and at the top of my 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.170
 green screen the armor so I click 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.270
 on it and I have different modes 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.069
 available that is displayed and I can 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.009
 put directly into play if any 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.289
 modes that are not available by 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.989
 these patches since it's a fashion 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.020
 menu as you can see and so I 

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:38.750
 you will simply say more 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.289

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.000
 next 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.099

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.840

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.819
