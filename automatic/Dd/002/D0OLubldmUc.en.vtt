like<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> golf<00:01:36.600> ball<00:01:36.840> cutting<00:01:37.200> through<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> air

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
like a golf ball cutting through the air

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
like a golf ball cutting through the air
so<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.430> does<00:01:38.490> incorporation<00:01:39.360> with

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so what this does incorporation with

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
so what this does incorporation with
with<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.590> SLR<00:01:40.950> silver<00:01:41.369> ion<00:01:41.670> fabric

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
with the the SLR silver ion fabric

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
with the the SLR silver ion fabric
creates<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:43.049> nice<00:01:43.350> tight<00:01:43.740> form<00:01:44.130> fit<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
creates a really nice tight form fit and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
creates a really nice tight form fit and
it's<00:01:44.880> constant<00:01:45.390> scrubbing<00:01:45.750> dirty<00:01:46.020> air<00:01:46.290> we

it's constant scrubbing dirty air we

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.109 
it's constant scrubbing dirty air we
have<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.220> factor<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:47.970> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
have one more factor in here which is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.260

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
also an aerodynamic property aerodynamic

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.490 
also an aerodynamic property aerodynamic
doesn't<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.720> stop<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> front<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
jurors we bring it on to the back and we

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.270 
jurors we bring it on to the back and we
come<00:01:54.509> into<00:01:54.659> what's<00:01:54.899> called<00:01:54.960> vortex<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.130> what

come into what's called vortex and what
the<00:01:56.369> vortex<00:01:56.820> panel<00:01:57.119> does<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.390> multifaceted

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the vortex panel does is multifaceted

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
the vortex panel does is multifaceted
one<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.369> nice<00:01:59.520> lightweight

four-way<00:02:01.920> stretch<00:02:02.159> which<00:02:02.610> causes<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.030> jersey

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
four-way stretch which causes the jersey

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.850 
four-way stretch which causes the jersey
to<00:02:03.450> lay<00:02:03.570> nice<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.780> fight<00:02:04.140> across<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.680> back

to lay nice and fight across the back

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340 
to lay nice and fight across the back
but<00:02:05.280> take<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> close<00:02:05.759> look<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.930> big

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
but take a close look at this really big

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.229 
but take a close look at this really big
thick<00:02:07.799> stitch<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.340> runs<00:02:08.550> across<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.060> back

thick stitch that runs across the back

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
thick stitch that runs across the back
here<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.929> flat<00:02:10.200> lock<00:02:10.410> stitch<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.890> what

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here it's a flat lock stitch and what

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.880 
here it's a flat lock stitch and what
this<00:02:11.190> does<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.700> by<00:02:12.060> sitting<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
this does is by sitting on the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.559 
this does is by sitting on the
older<00:02:13.040> as<00:02:13.100> wind<00:02:13.340> comes<00:02:13.580> over<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> top<00:02:13.970> it

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
older as wind comes over the top it

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.420 
older as wind comes over the top it
creates<00:02:14.960> turbulent<00:02:15.500> air<00:02:15.650> once<00:02:15.920> again<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.340> it's

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
creates turbulent air once again so it's

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.740 
creates turbulent air once again so it's
supposed<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.730> air<00:02:16.850> sticking<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> fabric

back sides for the yoke the yoke area is
a<00:03:14.750> place<00:03:15.050> where<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.350> produce<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.769> lot<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.010> heat

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
a place where we produce a lot of heat

nice light fabric back there they can

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.150 
nice light fabric back there they can
dissipate<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.660> heat<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.230> also<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.769> moisture

what's it made out of our jammies are

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.970 
what's it made out of our jammies are
made<00:03:32.450> by<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:32.600> company<00:03:32.690> called<00:03:32.989> TMF<00:03:33.680> out<00:03:33.860> of

Verona Italy their bunks the the leaders
in<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.610> industry<00:03:37.670> for<00:03:38.030> chamois<00:03:38.570> a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
in the industry for chamois a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.590 
in the industry for chamois a
manufacturing<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.880> when<00:03:41.000> we<00:03:41.090> look<00:03:41.299> at<00:03:41.450> this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
manufacturing and when we look at this

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.150 
manufacturing and when we look at this
what<00:03:42.079> is<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:42.290> interesting<00:03:42.440> about<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:43.100> is

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
what is so interesting about this is

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.880 
what is so interesting about this is
that<00:03:43.340> it's<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:44.120> four<00:03:44.420> density<00:03:44.900> foam<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.590> starts

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
that it's a four density foam it starts

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.970 
that it's a four density foam it starts
out<00:03:45.950> with<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.160> outside<00:03:46.640> has<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.840> carbon<00:03:48.650> face

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
out with the outside has a carbon face

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.680 
out with the outside has a carbon face
to<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.610> can<00:03:49.730> see<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:49.970> black<00:03:50.209> lines<00:03:50.480> it's

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
to it you can see the black lines it's

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.060 
to it you can see the black lines it's
actually<00:03:50.930> carbon<00:03:51.320> woven<00:03:51.680> into<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.950> fabric

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
actually carbon woven into the fabric

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.190 
actually carbon woven into the fabric
itself<00:03:52.519> what<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.480> does<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.840> creates<00:03:53.989> an

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
itself what that does is it creates an

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.050 
itself what that does is it creates an
antimicrobial<00:03:54.650> environment<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:55.730> also

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
antimicrobial environment and also

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.940 
antimicrobial environment and also
carbon<00:03:56.660> as<00:03:56.780> an<00:03:56.870> element<00:03:57.320> keeps<00:03:57.829> the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
carbon as an element keeps the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.440 
carbon as an element keeps the
temperature<00:03:58.280> down<00:03:58.610> on<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> inside<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.299> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
temperature down on the inside of the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.509 
temperature down on the inside of the
chamois<00:03:59.720> as<00:03:59.959> well<00:04:00.230> then<00:04:00.920> we<00:04:01.010> go<00:04:01.160> into<00:04:01.340> the

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
chamois as well then we go into the

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.300 
chamois as well then we go into the
inside<00:04:02.030> of<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.900> chamois<00:04:03.170> itself<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.100> very

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
inside of the chamois itself the very

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.680 
inside of the chamois itself the very
inside<00:04:04.640> of<00:04:04.790> these<00:04:04.880> really<00:04:05.180> nice<00:04:05.299> fine

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
inside of these really nice fine

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.180 
inside of these really nice fine
filament<00:04:06.260> hairs<00:04:06.470> when<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.769> sit<00:04:07.040> they

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
filament hairs when you sit they

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.009 
filament hairs when you sit they
collapse<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.820> create<00:04:08.269> channels<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.810> run

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
collapse and create channels that run

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.630 
collapse and create channels that run
through<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.380> chamois<00:04:09.680> these<00:04:10.190> channels

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
through the chamois these channels

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.190 
through the chamois these channels
actually<00:04:10.940> with<00:04:11.150> moisture<00:04:11.660> back<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.079> the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
actually with moisture back to the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.080 
actually with moisture back to the
outside<00:04:12.650> so<00:04:13.190> not<00:04:13.340> only<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.579> your<00:04:13.670> sham<00:04:13.940> you're

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
outside so not only is your sham you're

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.880 
outside so not only is your sham you're
going<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.299> stay<00:04:14.450> drier<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:15.500> temperature

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
going to stay drier the temperature

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.409 
going to stay drier the temperature
inside<00:04:15.980> is<00:04:16.190> going<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.400> say<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.519> lot<00:04:16.820> cooler<00:04:17.120> as

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
inside is going to say a lot cooler as

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.360 
inside is going to say a lot cooler as
well<00:04:17.660> this<00:04:18.229> is<00:04:18.440> your<00:04:18.620> sham<00:04:18.890> you<00:04:19.039> want<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.280> have

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
well this is your sham you want to have

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.319 
well this is your sham you want to have
if<00:04:19.430> you're<00:04:19.519> going<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.669> be<00:04:19.760> in<00:04:19.789> the<00:04:19.910> saddle<00:04:20.209> for

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
if you're going to be in the saddle for

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.630 
if you're going to be in the saddle for
anywhere<00:04:20.600> more<00:04:21.109> than<00:04:21.289> four<00:04:21.560> hours<00:04:21.590> you've<00:04:22.310> got

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
anywhere more than four hours you've got

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.590 
anywhere more than four hours you've got
to<00:04:22.820> have<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.210> HX<00:04:23.630> eight

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
to have the HX eight

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.960 
to have the HX eight
so<00:04:25.230> primal<00:04:25.530> was<00:04:25.710> actually<00:04:25.980> founded<00:04:26.400> 20<00:04:26.580> years

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
so primal was actually founded 20 years

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.390 
so primal was actually founded 20 years
ago<00:04:27.150> on<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.960> premise<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.350> putting<00:04:28.650> art<00:04:28.950> onto

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
ago on the premise of putting art onto

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.250 
ago on the premise of putting art onto
apparel<00:04:29.850> we've<00:04:30.180> taken<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.780> whole<00:04:31.050> step

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
apparel we've taken that a whole step

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.220 
apparel we've taken that a whole step
further<00:04:31.560> by<00:04:31.830> by<00:04:32.370> allowing<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.870> custom<00:04:33.870> designs

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
further by by allowing a custom designs

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.350 
further by by allowing a custom designs
as<00:04:34.440> well<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.280> heart<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.640> soul<00:04:35.790> of<00:04:35.850> primal

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
as well but the heart and soul of primal

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.210 
as well but the heart and soul of primal
is<00:04:36.510> really<00:04:36.960> our<00:04:37.080> inline<00:04:37.500> designs<00:04:37.920> that<00:04:38.100> we

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
is really our inline designs that we

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.820 
is really our inline designs that we
offer<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.690> big-box<00:04:39.870> shops<00:04:40.350> in<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.710> the
