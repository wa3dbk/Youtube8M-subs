200<00:00:38.280> horsepower<00:00:38.550> weighs<00:00:39.300> 2,300<00:00:40.260> pounds<00:00:40.379> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
200 horsepower weighs 2,300 pounds so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.040 
200 horsepower weighs 2,300 pounds so
it's<00:00:40.950> low<00:00:41.100> power<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:41.640> low<00:00:41.820> weight<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> that

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it's low power but low weight and that

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
it's low power but low weight and that
seems<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.500> been<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> good<00:00:44.160> recipe<00:00:44.370> for

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
seems to have been a good recipe for

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
seems to have been a good recipe for
cars<00:00:44.820> around<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.750> doesn't<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> turbo

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
which is or no form of forced induction

which is or no form of forced induction
which<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.710> interesting<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.700> lot<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
which is interesting because a lot of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.520 
which is interesting because a lot of
the<00:00:51.030> cars<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.570> had<00:00:51.899> around<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.320> have

around<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.449> diabolical<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.280> someone

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
around that is diabolical now if someone

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
around that is diabolical now if someone
I<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.090> new<00:01:06.299> leaf<00:01:06.479> 666<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:07.560> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
I think with new leaf 666 a lot now that

came up with that name and that's some

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.899 
came up with that name and that's some
racy<00:01:10.049> nerdiness<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.580> yes<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I'm going to be talking about

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.250 
I'm going to be talking about
this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.390> nice<00:01:24.480> car<00:01:24.510> sure<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.870> tend

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
this is a really nice car sure I tend

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.410 
this is a really nice car sure I tend
not<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.700> particularly<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.030> front<00:01:27.300> wheel

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
not to particularly like front wheel

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.140 
not to particularly like front wheel
drive<00:01:27.450> cars<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> really

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
drive cars but this kind of really

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.940 
drive cars but this kind of really
doesn't<00:01:30.630> really<00:01:30.750> feel<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.320> much<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
doesn't really feel that much like a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.020 
doesn't really feel that much like a
front-wheel<00:01:32.190> drive<00:01:32.280> car<00:01:32.340> there's<00:01:32.580> no<00:01:32.700> sort<00:01:32.940> of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
front-wheel drive car there's no sort of

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390 
front-wheel drive car there's no sort of
fun<00:01:33.510> power<00:01:33.810> understeer<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:35.190> should<00:01:35.310> really

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
fun power understeer we should really

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.740 
fun power understeer we should really
nice<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.820> guess<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.570> not

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
nice I guess it's because it's not

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.750 
nice I guess it's because it's not
particularly<00:01:37.140> powerful<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.980> straight-line

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
particularly powerful and straight-line

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.450 
particularly powerful and straight-line
speed<00:01:38.910> does<00:01:39.300> struggle<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.080> little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.460> but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
speed does struggle a little bit but

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
speed does struggle a little bit but
yeah<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.120> really<00:01:42.270> nice<00:01:42.360> handling

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
yeah it's really really nice handling

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.710 
yeah it's really really nice handling
car<00:01:43.080> up<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.950> Bathurst<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.330> can<00:01:45.450> break

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
car up to Bathurst now and you can break

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.880 
car up to Bathurst now and you can break
the<00:01:45.870> scepter<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.320> late<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.620> isn't

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the scepter be late this isn't

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.690 
the scepter be late this isn't
particularly<00:01:47.100> cooking<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.430> straight<00:01:47.610> line

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
particularly cooking a straight line

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.790 
particularly cooking a straight line
it's<00:01:47.880> only<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.210> tiny<00:01:48.510> bit<00:01:48.720> faster<00:01:49.170> than<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> mr2

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
it's only a tiny bit faster than the mr2

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.850 
it's only a tiny bit faster than the mr2
we<00:01:50.370> had<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.550> few<00:01:50.850> weeks<00:01:50.970> ago<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.690> it<00:01:52.500> gets<00:01:52.620> walk

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
we had a few weeks ago and it gets walk

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.200 
we had a few weeks ago and it gets walk
around<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.160> first<00:01:53.340> moment<00:01:53.580> very<00:01:53.670> nicely<00:01:53.880> as

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
around the first moment very nicely as

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.760 
around the first moment very nicely as
we<00:01:54.660> come<00:01:54.810> down<00:01:54.840> towards<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.410> bottom<00:01:55.500> whole

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
we come down towards the bottom whole

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.320 
we come down towards the bottom whole
section<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.400> easily<00:01:56.850> flat<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.240> in

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
section now it is easily flat out in

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.999 
section now it is easily flat out in
this<00:01:57.450> car<00:01:57.660> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.320> feel<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
this car you can feel that it is a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
this car you can feel that it is a
little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.550> underpowered<00:01:59.880> through<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
little bit underpowered through here you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.210 
little bit underpowered through here you
do<00:02:00.720> sort<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.050> noticed<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.619> lack<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> power

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
do sort of noticed the lack of power

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.609 
do sort of noticed the lack of power
specially<00:02:02.580> coming<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.970> hill<00:02:03.050> but<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.320> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
specially coming up the hill but it is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.050 
specially coming up the hill but it is
manageable<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.369> gets<00:02:05.550> around<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.759> corners

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
manageable it gets around the corners

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
manageable it gets around the corners
well<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.930> towards<00:02:07.290> diabolica<00:02:07.770> now

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
well actually up towards diabolica now

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.229 
well actually up towards diabolica now
it<00:02:08.009> gets<00:02:08.100> turned<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> nicely<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> little

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
it gets turned in nicely and a little

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.580 
it gets turned in nicely and a little
bit<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> understeer<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> exit<00:02:10.200> again<00:02:10.410> it's

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
bit of understeer on the exit again it's

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.500 
bit of understeer on the exit again it's
on<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.830> creep<00:02:11.070> off<00:02:11.220> towards<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.580> grass<00:02:11.850> this

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
on to creep off towards the grass this

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.630 
on to creep off towards the grass this
car<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:13.260> quite<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.560> strange<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.459> drive

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
car is quite the strange going to drive

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.790 
car is quite the strange going to drive
if<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.239> get<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.570> right<00:02:15.810> then<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> under

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
if you get it right then the under

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.080 
if you get it right then the under
stairs<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.130> problem<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.670> sort<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.970> push

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
stairs on a problem if you sort of push

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.990 
stairs on a problem if you sort of push
it<00:02:18.209> too<00:02:18.540> hard<00:02:18.739> then<00:02:19.739> yes<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.520> have<00:02:20.730> some

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it too hard then yes you can have some

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.370 
it too hard then yes you can have some
issues<00:02:21.120> like<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.600> think<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:21.900> probably<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
issues like I think that's probably the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.260 
issues like I think that's probably the
case<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.739> all<00:02:22.830> front<00:02:23.100> wheel<00:02:23.250> drive<00:02:23.280> cars<00:02:23.670> up

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
case with all front wheel drive cars up

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.180 
case with all front wheel drive cars up
to<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.600> last<00:02:24.870> corner<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.560> gets<00:02:25.980> turned

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
to the last corner now and gets turned

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.310 
to the last corner now and gets turned
in<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.459> nicely<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.880> there<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.989> then<00:02:28.049> it<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
in very nicely to there and then it is

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.600 
in very nicely to there and then it is
just<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.560> run<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.860> line<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.280> said<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.580> not

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
just a run to the line as I said is not

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.460 
just a run to the line as I said is not
particularly<00:02:30.510> quick<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.080> straight<00:02:31.440> line

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
particularly quick in a straight line

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.530 
particularly quick in a straight line
however<00:02:32.400> around<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> corners<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.299> very

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
however around the corners it is very

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.270 
however around the corners it is very
very<00:02:33.570> good<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.530> should<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.739> an<00:02:35.100> interesting

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
very good so it should be an interesting

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.970 
very good so it should be an interesting
time<00:02:35.790> from<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> integra<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.900> there<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:37.950> go

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
time from the integra and there we go

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.740 
time from the integra and there we go
that<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.880> across<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.209> line<00:02:39.390> and

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
that is it it is across the line and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.850 
that is it it is across the line and
then<00:02:40.170> move<00:02:40.320> on<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> next<00:02:40.680> car<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:43.320> up<00:02:43.830> next

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
then move on to the next car and up next

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.630 
then move on to the next car and up next
we<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:45.060> yes<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.080> price<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.860> wasn't

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
we have a yes it's a price I wasn't

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.120 
we have a yes it's a price I wasn't
expecting<00:02:47.850> there<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.390> be<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.600> price<00:02:48.930> either<00:02:49.230> the

expecting there to be a price either the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.920 
expecting there to be a price either the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
this and we're going to use the price

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.880 
this and we're going to use the price

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
what you want around a track like this

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.080 
what you want around a track like this
because<00:03:56.980> there's<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.280> lot<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.430> sort<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.790> medium

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
because there's a lot of sort of medium

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.270

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
the through bajo section now it is the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.320 
the through bajo section now it is the
slowest<00:04:02.950> car<00:04:03.130> through<00:04:03.370> there<00:04:03.610> purely<00:04:04.060> because

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
slowest car through there purely because

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.520 
slowest car through there purely because
you<00:04:04.569> have<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.810> lift<00:04:04.959> off<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.170> accelerator

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
you have to lift off the accelerator

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.170 
you have to lift off the accelerator
because<00:04:06.130> otherwise<00:04:06.310> going<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.790> wander<00:04:06.970> off

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
because otherwise going to wander off

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.430 
because otherwise going to wander off

round diabolically get you can see it's
