00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
situation but without a lot better with

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.300 
situation but without a lot better with
him<00:04:46.630> would<00:04:47.169> have<00:04:47.289> been<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.410> bit<00:04:47.590> nicer<00:04:47.949> but<00:04:48.160> oh

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
well but now we go on entei triangle for

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.740 
well but now we go on entei triangle for
stone<00:04:50.770> edge<00:04:50.919> cuz<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.550> figured<00:04:52.150> he<00:04:52.360> might<00:04:52.539> want

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
stone edge cuz I figured he might want

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.870 
stone edge cuz I figured he might want
to<00:04:52.900> switch<00:04:52.960> out<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.320> lantern<00:04:53.740> plus<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.760> would

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
to switch out to lantern plus it would

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.490 
to switch out to lantern plus it would
still<00:04:55.090> do<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.240> lot<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.840> movies<00:04:56.169> anyways

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
still do a lot to the movies anyways

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.170 
still do a lot to the movies anyways
especially<00:04:56.949> after<00:04:57.100> life-form<00:04:57.610> it's<00:04:57.760> just<00:04:57.940> it

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
especially after life-form it's just it

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.779 
especially after life-form it's just it
would<00:04:58.270> have<00:04:58.360> been<00:04:58.389> really<00:04:58.660> low<00:04:59.070> but<00:05:00.070> I<00:05:00.100> miss<00:05:00.310> so

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
would have been really low but I miss so

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.120 
would have been really low but I miss so
I<00:05:01.120> almost<00:05:01.360> have<00:05:01.539> Nova<00:05:01.900> sept-iles<00:05:02.229> HP<00:05:02.560> fire<00:05:02.740> but

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
I almost have Nova sept-iles HP fire but

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.580 
I almost have Nova sept-iles HP fire but
fortunately<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.360> get<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> crate<00:05:05.139> so<00:05:05.470> that

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
fortunately I get the crate so that

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.550 
fortunately I get the crate so that
means<00:05:05.800> basically<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.840> get<00:05:07.840> revenge<00:05:08.169> for<00:05:08.350> the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
means basically I get revenge for the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.140 
means basically I get revenge for the
stone<00:05:08.740> edge<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.580> means<00:05:09.729> I<00:05:09.789> take<00:05:09.820> him<00:05:10.060> out

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
stone edge and that means I take him out

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.640 
stone edge and that means I take him out
and<00:05:10.270> now<00:05:10.389> i<00:05:10.570> can<00:05:10.780> sleep<00:05:10.900> storm<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.289> lantern

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
and now i can sleep storm the lantern

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.930 
and now i can sleep storm the lantern
because<00:05:11.889> I've<00:05:12.070> run<00:05:12.250> leaf<00:05:12.400> storm<00:05:12.610> for<00:05:12.820> some

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940
