00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
cat toy right there because if you pound

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.810

by<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> fingers<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.799> part<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.340> comes

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
by the fingers and that part like comes

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
by the fingers and that part like comes
up<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.920> sort<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.909> gets<00:01:45.000> annoying<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.640> did

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
up and it sort of gets annoying so I did

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090 
up and it sort of gets annoying so I did
that<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> i'll<00:01:48.450> probably<00:01:48.720> leave<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.560> wrapped

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that and i'll probably leave it wrapped

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
that and i'll probably leave it wrapped
up<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:50.970> another<00:01:51.060> day<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:53.600> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
up like this for another day or so and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.999 
up like this for another day or so and
hopefully<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:55.350> make<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> stiffer

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
hopefully this will make it stiffer

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.060 
hopefully this will make it stiffer
