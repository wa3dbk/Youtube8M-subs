00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
think the xbox side no one would give a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.030 
think the xbox side no one would give a
hell<00:04:13.050> about<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.350> because<00:04:13.560> it's<00:04:13.710> all<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:13.860> lot

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
hell about it because it's all a lot

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.560 
hell about it because it's all a lot
