guys are usually 200 205 pounds are able
to<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.950> think<00:00:44.309> he's<00:00:44.460> moving<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to do so I I think he's moving up in the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
to do so I I think he's moving up in the
more<00:00:45.420> tape<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.750> study<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.170> lady<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.559> Bell<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
more tape I study of lady I'm Bell the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
more tape I study of lady I'm Bell the
more<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.550> believe<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.940> he<00:00:48.329> belongs<00:00:48.719> in

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
more I really believe that he belongs in

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.920 
more I really believe that he belongs in
day<00:00:49.200> two<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.800> maybe<00:00:50.309> even<00:00:50.610> round<00:00:50.969> two<00:00:51.210> how

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
day two and maybe even round two how

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.090 
day two and maybe even round two how
much<00:00:52.079> does<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> help<00:00:52.410> him<00:00:52.620> coming<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
much does it help him coming from the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.319 
much does it help him coming from the
pro-style<00:00:53.340> offense<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.180> mentioned

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
pro-style offense because you mentioned

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.760 
pro-style offense because you mentioned
he<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.570> somebody<00:00:54.840> feels<00:00:55.170> comfortable<00:00:55.590> being

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
he is somebody feels comfortable being

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.770 
he is somebody feels comfortable being
flexed<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.610> think<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.149> helps<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.360> lot<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
flexed out I think it helps a lot and I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.270 
flexed out I think it helps a lot and I
just<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.230> versatility<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.980> can't

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
just think that versatility you can't

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.500 
just think that versatility you can't
have<00:00:59.430> enough<00:00:59.640> versatility<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> league

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
have enough versatility in the league

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
have enough versatility in the league
right<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> passing<00:01:01.770> game<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.070> so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
right now and in the passing game is so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
right now and in the passing game is so
important<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> big<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> can

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
important so as a big back that can

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
important so as a big back that can
protect<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.949> big<00:01:05.309> back<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.909> move

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
protect and a big back that you can move

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.160 
protect and a big back that you can move
around<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.630> different<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
around and do different things and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.289 
around and do different things and
create<00:01:07.439> mismatches<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.189> certainly<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.119> help

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
create mismatches it certainly will help

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
create mismatches it certainly will help
you<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> big<00:01:10.500> part<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you I think it's a big part actually of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.980 
you I think it's a big part actually of
what<00:01:11.700> his<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.270> brings<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.689> terms<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
value at the next level Dion Sims a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.280 
value at the next level Dion Sims a
tight<00:01:15.180> end<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.540> healthy<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.049> very

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going to be a you know an elite down the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
going to be a you know an elite down the
scenes<00:01:28.159> playmaker<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.400> big<00:01:29.579> play<00:01:29.820> specialist

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
scenes playmaker or big play specialist

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
scenes playmaker or big play specialist
at<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.900> tight<00:01:31.110> end<00:01:31.290> position<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
at the tight end position but it's a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
at the tight end position but it's a
very<00:01:33.060> deep<00:01:33.509> class<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> guys<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
very deep class of a lot of guys that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
very deep class of a lot of guys that
catch<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> ball<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.670> cannot<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
catch the ball well and cannot be in

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.030 
catch the ball well and cannot be in
line<00:01:36.659> blockers<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:38.009> are

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
line blockers and so I think there are

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
line blockers and so I think there are
teams<00:01:38.310> obviously<00:01:38.670> they're<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
teams obviously they're out there that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.270 
teams obviously they're out there that
need<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.900> inline<00:01:40.200> blocker<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.770> he's<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
need an inline blocker and he's on a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240 
need an inline blocker and he's on a
short<00:01:41.610> list<00:01:41.820> his<00:01:42.659> workout<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.229> solid<00:01:43.649> catches

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
short list his workout was solid catches

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.800 
short list his workout was solid catches
the<00:01:44.369> ball<00:01:44.520> well<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.180> think<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.780> look

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the ball well and I think when you look

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
the ball well and I think when you look
at<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.500> depth<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.040> tight<00:01:47.280> end<00:01:47.430> class

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
at it the depth of this tight end class

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.609 
at it the depth of this tight end class
might<00:01:47.759> hurt<00:01:47.970> him<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.930> still<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:49.530> has

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
might hurt him but I still think he has

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.260 
might hurt him but I still think he has
a<00:01:49.649> chance<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.189> somewhere<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.700> mid<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
a chance to go somewhere in that mid to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
a chance to go somewhere in that mid to
late<00:01:51.420> third<00:01:51.630> round<00:01:51.869> range<00:01:52.110> William<00:01:53.040> Gholston

reading quarterback sighs and I think

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.400 
reading quarterback sighs and I think
he's<00:02:43.300> someone<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.630> can<00:02:43.840> contribute<00:02:44.170> as

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
maybe number three number four

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.490 
maybe number three number four
cornerback<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.270> he's<00:02:46.540> going<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.050> have<00:02:47.290> to

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
cornerback and he's going to have to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.230
