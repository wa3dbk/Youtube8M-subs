00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:11.690
 starting to make an arch in the opening 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 in the lobby here is what we have here design 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:25.680
 drew on the wall and here it is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:30.109
 there will be a start making standard 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.109
 breakdown draw lines for perimeter 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.920
 perimeter is ready all marks are set 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.920
 lines drawn 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:08.060
 now therefore need to be twirled 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:11.990
 guide profiles for convenience 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.049
 production can be tightened immediately 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:21.649
 drywall draw over it 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:24.830
 the rest of the line and the excess cut somewhere 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.799
 a centimeter from the lines I'll show you where 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.970
 so here we are 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.940
 pencil radius excess cut off and 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.990
 Now you need to twist along these lines 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.350
 profile and we get one finished 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.350
 side 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.120
 Some of the pieces of iron have already been installed by snakes 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.770
 a pair of jumpers 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.500
 it 's not all there is still much to insert 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.380
 it is necessary but they are already tired of me and I'm for 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:10.240
 variety now for a bunch of one side 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 bottom end part twisted side 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.720
 Well, that's the end 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:22.390
 how do you do with me 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:32.019
 side of the arch is already ready this part 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:36.209
 it remains this way she sees even 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.829
 bands twisted on the profile in the ring 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:44.489
 itself becomes 90 degrees and 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:03:06.969
 align it is not necessary to check now 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:03:12.700
 let down here exactly exactly-exactly now 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:15.280
 need to draw a line from the inside 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.169
 also for the second snake it's just a couple 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.169
 years are profile marks 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.739
 something like this and under a certain 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.720
 the size is put a few marks and by 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.659
 it twists 2 signs the frame is almost 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.209
 ready sewing 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.199
 the round part is all ready a little bit on top 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.449
 the box remained 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:45.000
 the box is ready from the side 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:50.759
 fortified 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.759
 slightly and inserts like that 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.440
 to not swing 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.400
 if there are shelves in this opening 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.320
 drywall 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.290
 this is just a plus will be great but for now their 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.549
 no design 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:19.000
 so I had to bet inside 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.000
 everything can be sheathed 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.460
 the finished product arch is ready well that part 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.470
 inside will still peel off 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.890
 Drywall at Pier Fix 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.890
 but this will finish
