hey guys mattrick's here and recently
generic<00:00:04.170> be<00:00:04.380> released<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.040> video<00:00:05.160> showing<00:00:05.609> a

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
generic be released a video showing a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.210 
generic be released a video showing a
concept<00:00:06.089> for<00:00:06.299> an<00:00:06.390> item<00:00:06.569> elevator<00:00:07.080> where<00:00:07.919> if

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
concept for an item elevator where if

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.350 
concept for an item elevator where if
you're<00:00:08.400> facing<00:00:08.700> zero<00:00:09.540> or<00:00:09.840> two<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.400> f3<00:00:12.030> menu

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
you're facing zero or two in the f3 menu

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.980 
you're facing zero or two in the f3 menu
and<00:00:12.620> you<00:00:13.620> sort<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.160> squeeze<00:00:14.420> on<00:00:15.420> item<00:00:15.780> in

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
and you sort of squeeze on item in

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.590 
and you sort of squeeze on item in
between<00:00:16.289> four<00:00:16.470> blocks<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.300> any<00:00:18.300> items

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
between four blocks like this any items

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.620 
between four blocks like this any items
in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> middle<00:00:19.279> will<00:00:20.279> actually<00:00:20.730> pop<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
in the middle will actually pop to the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
in the middle will actually pop to the
surface<00:00:22.039> so<00:00:23.039> I've<00:00:23.310> been<00:00:23.430> trying<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> make<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
surface so I've been trying to make a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.340 
surface so I've been trying to make a
design<00:00:24.180> based<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.140> an<00:00:25.230> item

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
design based on this for an item

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
design based on this for an item
elevator<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.210> here's<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.359> I've<00:00:27.480> come<00:00:27.660> up

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
elevator and here's what I've come up

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.040 
elevator and here's what I've come up
with<00:00:29.150> basically<00:00:30.150> let<00:00:30.570> me<00:00:30.630> show<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.840> how<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
with basically let me show you how it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
with basically let me show you how it
works<00:00:31.109> real<00:00:31.470> quick<00:00:31.710> throw<00:00:32.250> some<00:00:32.430> items<00:00:32.640> down

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
works real quick throw some items down

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.500 
works real quick throw some items down
here<00:00:32.820> we'll<00:00:33.809> throw<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.559> ice<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:36.180> click<00:00:36.390> this

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
here we'll throw for ice you click this

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.459 
here we'll throw for ice you click this
button<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.489> items<00:00:38.960> will<00:00:39.960> make<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
button and the items will make it up to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.520 
button and the items will make it up to
you<00:00:41.600> right<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.960> something<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you right now just something like to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
you right now just something like to
fall<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:43.770> back<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.250> me<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.870> see

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
fall down back to me and as you can see

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
fall down back to me and as you can see
we<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.289> full<00:00:46.500> stack<00:00:46.710> again<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we have a full stack again so how this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.000 
we have a full stack again so how this
works<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:48.660> simple<00:00:48.899> we're<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.770> trying

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
works is pretty simple we're just trying

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.950 
works is pretty simple we're just trying
to<00:00:50.160> power<00:00:50.340> every<00:00:50.760> pitched<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.360> tix<00:00:51.600> apart

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
to power every pitched in for tix apart

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.590 
to power every pitched in for tix apart
and<00:00:52.340> it's<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.579> me<00:00:53.699> trying<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and it's just me trying to do that in a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170 
and it's just me trying to do that in a
countback<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.340> circuitry<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:56.879> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
countback way the circuitry for this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.670 
countback way the circuitry for this
itself<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.899> around<00:00:58.140> 4<00:00:58.949> by<00:00:59.280> 4<00:00:59.579> wide<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.329> deep

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
itself is around 4 by 4 wide and deep

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.569 
itself is around 4 by 4 wide and deep
but<00:01:01.680> there's<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.070> some<00:01:02.250> extra<00:01:02.520> stuff

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
but there's going to be some extra stuff

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.650 
but there's going to be some extra stuff
that's<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> make<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.510> bit

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that's going to make it a little bit

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.390 
that's going to make it a little bit
bigger<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:06.710> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.799> pretty<00:01:07.920> much<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.220> how

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
bigger so this is pretty much just how

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.289 
bigger so this is pretty much just how
it<00:01:08.520> works<00:01:09.860> one<00:01:10.860> negative<00:01:11.100> side<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.850> on

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it works one negative side of this is on

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.980 
it works one negative side of this is on
the<00:01:12.689> foliage<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:14.490> takes<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.330> power<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the foliage here it takes the power to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.640 
the foliage here it takes the power to
go<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.680> again<00:01:18.200> before<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
go all the way up again before all the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.429 
go all the way up again before all the
piston<00:01:19.950> stop-start<00:01:20.700> retracting<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
piston stop-start retracting and this is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
piston stop-start retracting and this is
what<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> magenta<00:01:23.070> circuit<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
what the magenta circuit here is for it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.590 
what the magenta circuit here is for it
on<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> block<00:01:25.590> update<00:01:25.920> issue<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
on this is a block update issue and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
on this is a block update issue and
these<00:01:27.600> repeaters<00:01:28.020> huge<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.560> sort<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> fixed<00:01:29.159> up

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
these repeaters huge is sort of fixed up

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.469 
these repeaters huge is sort of fixed up
manually<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:32.700> makes<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> whole<00:01:33.420> thing

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
manually and that makes the whole thing

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.960 
manually and that makes the whole thing
a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:33.869> bit<00:01:34.020> faster<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.670> version

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
a little bit faster and this version

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
a little bit faster and this version
just<00:01:36.090> has<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:37.170> input<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.560> output<00:01:37.740> methods

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
just has the input and output methods

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
just has the input and output methods
for<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> items<00:01:39.259> there's<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.470> water

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
for the items there's just a water

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.330 
for the items there's just a water
source<00:01:40.979> down<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.979> when<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> click<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
source down here and when you click the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.190 
source down here and when you click the
button<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.270> piston<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
button the piston down here is going to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.560 
button the piston down here is going to
block<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.560> water<00:01:46.860> source<00:01:47.100> off<00:01:47.369> otherwise<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
block this water source off otherwise it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
block this water source off otherwise it
won't<00:01:48.720> work<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.460> up<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> double

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
won't work and up here we have a double

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.389 
won't work and up here we have a double
piston<00:01:51.509> extender<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.290> throw<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> item<00:01:52.950> back

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
piston extender to throw the item back

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
piston extender to throw the item back
into<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> water<00:01:54.000> source<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:55.500> pretty

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
into a water source so that's pretty

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.210 
into a water source so that's pretty
much<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.920> let<00:01:56.640> me<00:01:56.700> show<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.880> again

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.070 

works<00:02:03.220> just<00:02:03.370> like<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.870> what<00:02:04.870> I<00:02:04.930> like<00:02:05.050> about

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
works just like that what I like about

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.780 
works just like that what I like about
this<00:02:05.440> design<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.830> it's<00:02:06.280> infinitely

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
this design is it's infinitely

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.400 
this design is it's infinitely
expandable<00:02:07.300> vertically<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.080> can<00:02:08.200> make<00:02:08.259> it

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
expandable vertically so you can make it

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.070 
expandable vertically so you can make it
like<00:02:08.560> 200<00:02:08.740> blocks<00:02:09.160> high<00:02:09.399> if<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.880> want

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
like 200 blocks high if you want

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.300 
like 200 blocks high if you want
obviously<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.140> will<00:02:11.200> take<00:02:11.410> longer<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.100> get<00:02:12.190> up

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
obviously it will take longer to get up

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.530 
obviously it will take longer to get up
there<00:02:12.459> then<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.820> construction<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.390> this

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
there then and the construction of this

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.270 
there then and the construction of this
itself<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.110> pretty<00:02:17.320> simple<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:18.070> looks

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
itself is pretty simple it looks

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.560 
itself is pretty simple it looks
confusing<00:02:18.640> right<00:02:18.790> now<00:02:18.850> but<00:02:18.970> that's<00:02:19.390> just

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
confusing right now but that's just

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.570 
confusing right now but that's just
because<00:02:20.340> everything<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.490> tightly<00:02:21.730> packed<00:02:23.580> so

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
because everything so tightly packed so

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.830 
because everything so tightly packed so
yeah<00:02:24.730> let<00:02:25.000> me<00:02:25.060> know<00:02:25.090> if<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.450> any<00:02:25.660> better

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
yeah let me know if you have any better

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360 
yeah let me know if you have any better
designs<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.530> I'm<00:02:26.800> interested<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.280> see

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
designs on this I'm interested to see

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.170 
designs on this I'm interested to see
them<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:29.010> definitely<00:02:30.010> ask<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.880> want<00:02:31.060> us

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
them and definitely ask if you want us

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.990 
them and definitely ask if you want us
to<00:02:32.020> torial<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.680> can<00:02:32.980> make<00:02:33.130> one<00:02:33.310> it's

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
to torial on it I can make one it's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720 
to torial on it I can make one it's
pretty<00:02:34.180> easy<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:35.350> until<00:02:35.650> then<00:02:35.770> thanks<00:02:36.670> for

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
pretty easy but until then thanks for

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.820 
pretty easy but until then thanks for
watching
