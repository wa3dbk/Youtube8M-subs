00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.600
 I wanted dari sonohra to welcome in 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.980
 this new update then in this 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.630
 video we will not talk about a mod 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.340
 but we will talk about the last one 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.889
 update and then the last snap 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.100
 shot in the last snap show there were 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.980
 lots of bugfixes also because type in 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 each version of minecraft take away 3000 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.050
 bug and another 4 thousand e 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.960
 so they tried to solve 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.060
 some vague notes but they have 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.700
 added the possibility of sea stream 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.060
 or to do live tweets itself 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.650
 what can we do on playstation 4 e 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.600
 so they added this possibility 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.510
 precisely on minecraft which makes everything 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.130
 simpler and lighter in that sense 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.380
 you will not have to download programs for 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.710
 screaming then the programs will occupy 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.900
 space and race less this because 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.060
 precisely on minecraft they have us 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.520
 added just a key already one 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.250
 button two test powers at sea 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.070
 only that we have to do 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.809
 things to estimate what we have to migrate 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.760
 our minecraft account in a 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.520
 majang account in what sense 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.500
 the majang is precisely the manufacturer 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.040
 let's say minecraft created us 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.020
 minecraft and for bad stream we have 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.870
 need mojang account now we can 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.060
 both to create it and to migrate ours 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.580
 minecraft account that is never year 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.900
 but it's just about minecraft in mojang account 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:32.080
 there is an account for both minecraft then 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.920
 let's say it always works on minecraft that 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.420
 for the sea we will say one 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.490
 only you have to create an account too 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.860
 on twitter now let's see where it is 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.060
 find the stink the button just but 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.150
 I do n't show you everything because 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.740
 however migrating the account etc is 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.860
 simple because you have to go only on 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.890
 site you have to put 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.450
 migrate accounts and then send me the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.220
 confirmation email with average of 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.980
 apples you have the mojang and minecraft account 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.200
 united very simple I show you the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.990
 button you have to click on is always going 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.509
 on options and there is this broadcast button 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.190
 settings here will be link account e 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.620
 let's say the page will open 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.570
 let's say mojang now you don't 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.540
 see why we say if they use dic 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.850
 history and therefore no longer web pages 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 browser does not show it to me 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.680
 however, let it be we eat it 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.850
 open the page where we need to insert 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.459
 the apples the password 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.890
 and then we say they will send you levels 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.500
 confirmation as I said before is also 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.300
 they also added a vi shader 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.959
 I repeat that shaders are the ones to be true 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.370
 super secret settings where clicking 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.959
 let's say you will find different effects like 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.000
 for example I'm using this effect 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.720
 it makes everything darker, so all darker and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.209
 low 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 we say that these are the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.470
 updates let's say the things they have 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.140
 added is as mentioned before however 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.959
 have made numerous bugfixes which makes 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.030
 all paid more because of a bug fix there 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.970
 then another 3,000 bagels will be made 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.670
 all the more ugly and however it comes 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.019
 defined excuse me if it is short but not 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.600
 I have more to say we will see you at 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.980
 next video and I recommend it 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.780

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.040
