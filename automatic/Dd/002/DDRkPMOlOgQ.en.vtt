00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
was trying to like hold the ball up but
this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> fail<00:01:32.850> watch<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.750> spin<00:01:34.140> down

this is a fail watch this and spin down

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
this is a fail watch this and spin down
at<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:35.009> even<00:01:35.909> though<00:01:36.000> i<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> end

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
at the one even though i was in the end

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.340 
at the one even though i was in the end
zones<00:01:37.130> Madden<00:01:38.130> doesn't<00:01:38.430> realize<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.350> but

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
zones Madden doesn't realize that but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.600 
zones Madden doesn't realize that but
I'll<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.770> keep<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.070> running<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.400> it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I'll just keep it running because it's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.499 
I'll just keep it running because it's
for<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> next<00:01:42.150> play<00:01:42.329> anyway<00:01:42.659> so

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.950 

usually<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:51.200> seems<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.450> Super<00:01:53.450> Bowls<00:01:53.659> are

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
usually it seems that Super Bowls are

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.850 
usually it seems that Super Bowls are
always<00:01:54.350> really<00:01:55.040> close<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.409> like<00:01:57.409> blowout

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
always really close and I like blowout

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.480 
always really close and I like blowout
games<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.630> I'm<00:01:59.630> kind<00:01:59.930> of<00:02:00.049> hoping<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.280> that's

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
games so I'm kind of hoping and that's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.249 
games so I'm kind of hoping and that's
why<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.640> like<00:02:01.700> watching<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.329> packers<00:02:02.539> play<00:02:02.899> is

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
why I like watching the packers play is

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.230 
why I like watching the packers play is
because<00:02:03.590> usually<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.520> playoffs<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.060> them

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
because usually in a playoffs with them

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.290 
because usually in a playoffs with them
or<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.509> postseason<00:02:06.110> it's<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.500> shootout<00:02:07.490> like

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
or the postseason it's a shootout like

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.990 
or the postseason it's a shootout like
think<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.410> get<00:02:09.590> two<00:02:09.860> games<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.700> postseason

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
think to get two games in the postseason

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.610 
think to get two games in the postseason
I<00:02:11.510> don't<00:02:11.690> know<00:02:11.780> if<00:02:11.870> I'm<00:02:11.959> right<00:02:12.080> or<00:02:12.140> not<00:02:12.349> but<00:02:12.410> I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
I don't know if I'm right or not but I

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.570 
I don't know if I'm right or not but I
think<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:13.040> two<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.430> them<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.790> over<00:02:14.120> 40<00:02:14.480> points

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
think of two of them one over 40 points

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.630 
think of two of them one over 40 points
so<00:02:16.580> then<00:02:17.330> last<00:02:17.540> year<00:02:17.660> they<00:02:17.810> had<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.640> 56

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
so then last year they had that like 56

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.860 
so then last year they had that like 56
to<00:02:19.910> like<00:02:20.060> 54<00:02:20.690> went<00:02:21.049> over<00:02:21.290> Arizona<00:02:21.769> last<00:02:22.040> year

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
to like 54 went over Arizona last year

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.160 
to like 54 went over Arizona last year
or<00:02:23.870> might<00:02:24.170> even<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.380> lost<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.769> don't<00:02:24.980> know<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:26.170> it

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
or might even a lost I don't know but it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.780 
or might even a lost I don't know but it
was<00:02:27.260> pretty<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:28.069> those<00:02:28.370> kind<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.640> games

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
was pretty I like those kind of games

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.360 
was pretty I like those kind of games
were<00:02:29.060> there<00:02:29.209> high<00:02:29.330> scoring<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.370> offensive

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
were there high scoring and offensive

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:41.170 
were there high scoring and offensive
heavy<00:02:31.580> uh<00:02:34.599> I<00:02:36.610> think<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:40.310> packers<00:02:40.610> are<00:02:41.060> a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
heavy uh I think that the packers are a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.900 
heavy uh I think that the packers are a
better<00:02:41.390> team<00:02:41.510> without<00:02:41.840> brett<00:02:42.230> favre<00:02:42.910> honestly

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
better team without brett favre honestly

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.170 
better team without brett favre honestly
and<00:02:44.150> i<00:02:44.950> think<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.340> they're<00:02:46.880> going<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.060> win

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and i think that they're going to win

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.670 
and i think that they're going to win
this<00:02:47.299> role<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.690> they'll<00:02:48.019> probably<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.410> more

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
this role and they'll probably have more

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.770 
this role and they'll probably have more
to<00:02:48.799> come<00:02:48.980> with<00:02:49.250> aaron<00:02:49.580> rodgers<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.120> there's

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
to come with aaron rodgers and there's

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.660 
to come with aaron rodgers and there's
going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.959> be<00:02:50.989> two<00:02:51.260> mobile<00:02:51.769> quarterbacks<00:02:52.400> in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
going to be two mobile quarterbacks in

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.170 
going to be two mobile quarterbacks in
this<00:02:53.380> super<00:02:54.380> bowl<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:54.890> that's<00:02:55.370> one<00:02:55.910> thing<00:02:56.060> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
this super bowl so that's one thing to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.110 
this super bowl so that's one thing to
watch<00:02:56.299> out<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:58.430> quarterback<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.000> run

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
watch out for is the quarterback to run

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.699 
watch out for is the quarterback to run
I'm<00:02:59.269> sure<00:02:59.450> both<00:02:59.630> teams<00:02:59.900> realize<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.530> and

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
I'm sure both teams realize this and

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.800 
I'm sure both teams realize this and
they're<00:03:00.829> both<00:03:00.950> plan<00:03:01.310> against<00:03:01.609> it<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:02.030> I'm

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
they're both plan against it but I'm

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.300 
they're both plan against it but I'm
sure<00:03:03.140> there<00:03:03.319> will<00:03:03.350> still<00:03:03.620> be<00:03:03.680> some<00:03:03.799> running

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
sure there will still be some running

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.210 
sure there will still be some running
fire<00:03:04.519> logs<00:03:04.880> for<00:03:05.269> this<00:03:05.420> moment<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:09.380> think<00:03:09.920> that's

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
fire logs for this moment I think that's

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.930 
fire logs for this moment I think that's
about<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:12.040> i'll<00:03:13.040> be<00:03:13.100> doing<00:03:13.489> more<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.819> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
about it and i'll be doing more of the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.360 
about it and i'll be doing more of the
series<00:03:14.390> probably<00:03:15.019> next<00:03:15.440> year<00:03:15.620> i'm<00:03:15.980> sure<00:03:16.190> make

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
series probably next year i'm sure make

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.400 
series probably next year i'm sure make
other<00:03:16.609> math<00:03:16.880> videos<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.540> just<00:03:17.780> won't<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
other math videos I just won't do the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.979 
other math videos I just won't do the
actual<00:03:18.709> games<00:03:19.359> probably<00:03:20.359> do<00:03:20.420> something<00:03:20.660> else

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
actual games probably do something else

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.809 
actual games probably do something else
