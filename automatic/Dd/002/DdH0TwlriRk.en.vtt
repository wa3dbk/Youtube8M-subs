00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.660
 with the kingdom of sweden 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.770
 started but has no higher ground 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.960
 behind it just stupid the game am 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.420
 a short information 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.439
 I will do all the things I explain 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.230
 will be mainly one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.140
 Above all, Christian nations judge 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.239
 even never catholic i'll just 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 explain the game itself as I do 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.820
 as catholic nations maybe 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.270
 Inside comments like that for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.030
 other religions is and in an extra 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.629
 video which the dlcs discuss in the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.520
 we live 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.129
 the Muslim faith of the and the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.199
 pagan beliefs and their specificity 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.640
 have them in the game because also for 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 another concepts have been introduced 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.439
 are that I give in a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.090
 wore up pledges for the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.850
 Muslim and pagan nations 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.830
 explain again and maybe 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.290
 also very briefly to the Orthodox both 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.860
 when not so much different 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 we start with the very simple 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.310
 interface of crusader kings 2 3 kings 2 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.140
 you are always on the map there 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.400
 no full screen windows that somehow 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.330
 you will always have the category cover 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.310
 card open 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.740
 because look from time to time various 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 window no but by and large 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.750
 you are always on the card the cable 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.200
 You can control by going to the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.500
 moving around edges you can use middle 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.270
 Press the mouse button and drag and pull 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 You can also talk about the mini card 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.860
 They serve some of our lives quite well 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.500
 where must the card is in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 different according to different topics 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.659
 colors that political card 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.430
 mode in the independent rich the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.810
 even no causal we subject 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.390
 but just by yourself 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.429
 are colored independently 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.429
 but you can also for example all 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.890
 the jure, for example, theoretical 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.819
 existing heart to show 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.480
 then the whole thing is a bit 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.739
 colorful or de jure kingdom has 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.269
 can exist and the same 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.360
 partly kingdoms that exist 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.280
 So by the way, could a general 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.280
 quite important, the jure and 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.430
 reel to reel exist through the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.650
 kingdom of poland, however, also gives like one 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.090
 here it looks that the jure is there too 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.860
 the kingdom of germany 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.970
 You can create that when you have the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.080
 has half of the necessary land 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.640
 and you can money enough to these 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.470
 title creates you can henceforth king 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.459
 from Germany , for example, call that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.799
 is the de jure info Date title or you 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.459
 can just color to terra as well 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.380
 I am in the terrain it gives you the can 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.760
 let dynasties show that is 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.470
 usually the political cards must 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.099
 just browsing men's cut in Asti 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.720
 is shown 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.150
 You can also do it religiously 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.250
 Colorize them with which ones 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.440
 religion is present which religion 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.150
 where is suppressed, for example, there is 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.720
 larvae dominated by Christians 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.209
 become 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.620
 and just different ways the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.310
 depending on what you're doing 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.609
 need 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.930
 Let's not go through one by one now 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.519
 has different windows in the kings 2 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.410
 the information is there 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.989
 province interface that you always get 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.730
 if you click a province it gives it 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.250
 character screens always gets 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.040
 if you click on a person or 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.079
 also up here on yourself 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.120
 There are more menus up here 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.769
 important to control the empire 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.430
 we will all discuss in further 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.389
 consequences 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.250
 There are different messages up here 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.470
 which can be permanently different 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.269
 if there are several you can even do it 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.200
 please still click through directly 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.090
 healthy or sometimes even marked 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.120
 can also follow them immediately 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.860
 you can ignore them you can 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.890
 also hide take right click power 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.180
 and the hook can do it for now 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.070
 then they will refuse 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.850
 faded in if something changes for 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.830
 this message 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.510
 or you can just call them the active ones 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.730
 then this will be for this message here 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.050
 above can not be displayed 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.700
 By the way, everything in the 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.950
 messages are very accurate 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.810
 change is a bit confusing 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.460
 because there are many different types 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.600
 but there are some messages 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.350
 By working you can play the game 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.530
 actually adapt very well 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.560
 here you have the different currencies 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.720
 so you want the normal gold prestige 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.120
 filial piety are just as important as you are 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.520
 receives and for different activities 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.860
 We must also spend the domain 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.320
 in addition one has generally the empires 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.770
 size how many possessions it owns 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.130
 rich gives and the current score 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.080
 That's why you have the date bar here 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.780
 you can turn the break on and off 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.419
 but with space bar or the break 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.010
 button with plus and minus or here you can 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.020
 you change the speed 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.190
 The game is running day by day 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.620
 but with different ones 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.180
 speeds 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.180
 There are some important news here 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.919
 as well as unimportant become the important ones 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.229
 always displayed here and you have to 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.390
 by clicking and because a new one is coming 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.950
 you can hear such a little babbling is the 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.600
 simply marks the important one 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.460
 Messages simply appear there 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.310
 no teeming and eventually they are 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.180
 also gone again 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.440
 this one down here 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.669
 I'm not sure what im doing 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:54.220
 German translated here is always 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:56.060
 editor manager also in the book 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.490
 land register as china different 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.350
 information in it you can find here 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.300
 can also adjust more precisely about this 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.850
 button what you have the show 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.410
 I want people multiplayer 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.450
 one could also play multiplayer 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.979
 but you should hide one 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.110
 have scheduled because the movie star 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.310
 Information is also on games 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.300
 a small screen 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.300
 the place gets tight 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.289
 and here and I like the said 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.639
 minimap the different card modes 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.439
 and here below the possibility 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.929
 to find characters and titles 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.429
 to go to the homeland province there is 

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.989
 different statistics you look at 

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:32.839
 can look for information about 

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:37.909
 or even the whole time 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:39.979
 main menu and it just general 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:44.239
 interface by just on the map 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:46.639
 bypasses provinces selects his troops 

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:47.509
 So we have to press briefly 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.429
 spend more 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:52.039
 you also here by the area 

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:53.659
 you can send the controls here 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.249
 one also fights on one's one 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.869
 also advise the area to send 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.299
 If you are there when you are on the map 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:02.559
 are and also, for example, in 

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:06.079
 direct diplomacy menu is coming 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:08.360
 and so, where everything happens in 

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:10.969
 Game where you start and where you always 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.799
 come back next videos 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:14.869
 we just single menus and individual 

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:17.679
 Be discussing activities like friends 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:17.679
 Hello
