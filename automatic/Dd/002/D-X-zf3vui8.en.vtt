was going to work with the leather but

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
was going to work with the leather but
it<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.470> turned<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.610> also

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it really turned out good and then also

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.990 
it really turned out good and then also
made<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:43.640> on<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> bigger<00:01:45.000> scale<00:01:45.799> with<00:01:47.000> the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.149 
I'll post this to show you if you're
kind<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.619> classical

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
kind of going for like a more classical

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
kind of going for like a more classical
look<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.909> noise<00:01:57.119> say<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
look with your noise say you have a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.120 
look with your noise say you have a
leather<00:01:58.049> sheath<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.590> something<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
leather sheath or something like that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.330 
leather sheath or something like that
and<00:01:59.520> didn't<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> put<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
and didn't really want to put the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.690 
and didn't really want to put the
tactical<00:02:02.340> style<00:02:02.719> parachute<00:02:03.719> Cordle<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.409> there

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
tactical style parachute Cordle in there

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.920 
tactical style parachute Cordle in there
that<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:06.090> way<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.329> could<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.659> with<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
that was one way you could go with it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.119 
that was one way you could go with it
it's<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.469> harder<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.829> work<00:02:08.069> with

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
it's a little bit harder to work with

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's a little bit harder to work with
because<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.550> obviously<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.090> lot<00:02:09.179> more

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
because it's obviously a lot more

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.050 
because it's obviously a lot more
stiffer<00:02:10.340> than<00:02:11.340> parachute<00:02:11.879> cord<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
stiffer than parachute cord and

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.809 
stiffer than parachute cord and
a<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:13.390> bit<00:02:13.480> harder<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.780> tighten<00:02:14.260> up<00:02:14.349> but

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
a little bit harder to tighten up but

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.030 
a little bit harder to tighten up but
with<00:02:15.819> some<00:02:15.970> practice<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.540> can<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:17.040> make

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
with some practice you can really make

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.589 
with some practice you can really make
it<00:02:18.069> look<00:02:18.310> really<00:02:18.430> good<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.670> give<00:02:18.910> give<00:02:19.300> your

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
it look really good and give give your

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.770 
it look really good and give give your
