00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
mind at the moment yeah the moment yeah

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
mind at the moment yeah the moment yeah
everything<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> start<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.590> after

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
everything is the start and then after

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
everything is the start and then after
the<00:00:31.980> positions<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> first<00:00:33.630> corner

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the positions we get in the first corner

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930 
the positions we get in the first corner
you<00:00:34.410> start<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> think<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> strategy<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you start to think in the strategy and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.590 
you start to think in the strategy and
the<00:00:36.630> possibilities<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.950> overtake

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
the possibilities to to overtake

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.540 
the possibilities to to overtake
possibly<00:00:39.600> until<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> rely<00:00:40.829> totally<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
possibly until you rely totally on the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.160 
possibly until you rely totally on the
team<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.940> work<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> play<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
team to work that out or will you play a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.340 
team to work that out or will you play a
part<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.649> well<00:00:44.640> yes<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.270> are<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.960> few

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
part in that well yes there are a few

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.520 
part in that well yes there are a few
discussions<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.840> we<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:48.989> agree<00:00:49.320> in

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
discussions and I think we all agree in

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.790 
discussions and I think we all agree in
in<00:00:49.860> our<00:00:50.120> strategy<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.289> confident

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
in our strategy and we are all confident

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.819 
in our strategy and we are all confident
about<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.649> wait<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
about it so we have to see and wait and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.260 
about it so we have to see and wait and
see<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.579> others<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.879> doing<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.239> well

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
see what the others are doing as well

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
see what the others are doing as well
last<00:00:57.960> 20<00:00:58.320> laps<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.680> think<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> red<00:00:59.100> tires<00:00:59.370> are

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
last 20 laps you think the red tires are

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:10.000 
last 20 laps you think the red tires are
going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.940> away<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.390> last<00:01:00.600> 20

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.500 

hopefully<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.610> less<00:01:12.000> process<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
hopefully we can have less process of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
hopefully we can have less process of
this<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.430> any

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
