route<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:23.290> let's<00:03:23.469> talk<00:03:23.620> about<00:03:23.680> route<00:03:24.129> for<00:03:24.400> a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
route so let's talk about route for a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.920 
route so let's talk about route for a
second<00:03:24.849> in<00:03:24.970> Tai<00:03:25.389> Chi

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
second in Tai Chi

there's<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.349> common<00:03:26.799> terminology<00:03:27.639> that<00:03:27.670> we<00:03:27.849> use

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
there's a common terminology that we use

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.210 
there's a common terminology that we use
called<00:03:28.239> routing<00:03:28.689> or<00:03:28.840> route<00:03:29.319> like<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> tree<00:03:30.010> has

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
called routing or route like a tree has

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.020 
called routing or route like a tree has
roots<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.870> as<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:33.010> continue<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.609> stand<00:03:33.819> here

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
roots so as you continue to stand here

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.940 
roots so as you continue to stand here
you<00:03:34.180> become<00:03:34.480> more<00:03:34.689> relaxed<00:03:35.379> you<00:03:35.560> want<00:03:35.889> to

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
become more rooted as if there are roots

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.099 
become more rooted as if there are roots
growing<00:03:38.409> out<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.739> bottom<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.189> your<00:03:39.220> feet

and to begin to imagine that there are

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.000 
and to begin to imagine that there are
roots<00:03:53.659> growing<00:03:54.139> out<00:03:54.349> from<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.620> bottom<00:03:54.769> of
