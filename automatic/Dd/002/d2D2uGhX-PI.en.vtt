tool to photography now most people
think<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.290> these<00:00:37.440> teleconverters<00:00:38.100> their

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
think that these teleconverters their

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.930 
think that these teleconverters their
main<00:00:38.579> thing<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.180> make<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> small<00:00:40.350> image<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
main thing is to make a small image you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.959 
main thing is to make a small image you
know<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:42.600> bigger<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> frame<00:00:43.760> that's<00:00:44.760> not

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
know much bigger in the frame that's not

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
really the point of that is one of the

they<00:01:57.330> weren't<00:01:57.570> sharp<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.560> didn't

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
they weren't sharp if they didn't

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.649 
they weren't sharp if they didn't
produce<00:01:58.890> an<00:01:59.130> image<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.580> could<00:01:59.760> use<00:02:00.000> they

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
produce an image that I could use they

whole thing how come when I put on this
teleconverter<00:02:22.349> my<00:02:23.159> debt<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> fields<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:23.969> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
teleconverter my debt the fields not the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.379 
teleconverter my debt the fields not the
same<00:02:24.450> let's<00:02:25.439> talk<00:02:25.620> about<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.919> briefly<00:02:26.389> depth

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
same let's talk about that briefly depth

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.490 
same let's talk about that briefly depth
of<00:02:27.510> field

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
of field

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.270 
of field
to<00:02:28.620> formula<00:02:29.070> focal<00:02:29.940> length<00:02:30.950> versus<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.070> hole

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
to formula focal length versus the hole

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.950 
to formula focal length versus the hole
in<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> back<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:33.170> lens<00:02:34.170> okay<00:02:35.130> basically

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
in the back of that lens okay basically

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.390 
in the back of that lens okay basically
in<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.050> nutshell<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.590> how<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.800> determine<00:02:37.950> depth

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
in a nutshell is how you determine depth

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.510 
in a nutshell is how you determine depth
of<00:02:38.520> field<00:02:39.350> when<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.470> put<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.860> teleconverter

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
of field when you put the teleconverter

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.030 
of field when you put the teleconverter
on<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:42.060> lens<00:02:42.330> we're<00:02:43.170> changing<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.710> focal

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
on this lens we're changing the focal

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.040 
on this lens we're changing the focal
lengths<00:02:44.190> aren't<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:45.570> what<00:02:45.750> we're<00:02:45.900> not

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
lengths aren't we but what we're not

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.310 
lengths aren't we but what we're not
doing<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.280> hole<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.850> diameter<00:02:48.690> hole

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
doing is that hole that diameter hole

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.740 
doing is that hole that diameter hole
it<00:02:49.530> ain't<00:02:49.830> changing<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.209> diameter<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
it ain't changing the diameter of the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.949 
it ain't changing the diameter of the
hole<00:02:51.780> stays<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.860> same<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:54.209> because<00:02:54.630> we<00:02:54.930> are

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
hole stays the same so because we are

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.830 
hole stays the same so because we are
changing<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.770> focal<00:02:56.190> length<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.540> we're<00:02:57.660> not

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
changing the focal length but we're not

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.530 
changing the focal length but we're not
changing<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.380> hole<00:02:58.770> in<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.100> back<00:02:59.340> the<00:03:00.240> depth

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
changing the hole in the back the depth

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.920 
changing the hole in the back the depth
of<00:03:00.690> field<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.530> same<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.900> a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
of field is not the same so you have a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.210 
of field is not the same so you have a
six<00:03:04.590> hard<00:03:04.800> EV<00:03:05.010> for<00:03:05.550> lens<00:03:05.910> right<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.200> f/4<00:03:07.220> when

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
six hard EV for lens right here f/4 when

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.960 
six hard EV for lens right here f/4 when
you<00:03:08.340> put<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.820> let's<00:03:09.270> go<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.930> tc20<00:03:10.770> III<00:03:11.670> on

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
you put the let's go to the tc20 III on

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.030 
you put the let's go to the tc20 III on
here<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.850> 1200<00:03:14.850> millimeter<00:03:16.040> f/8

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
here we now have a 1200 millimeter f/8

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.170 
here we now have a 1200 millimeter f/8
lens<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.820> FA<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.570> effective<00:03:19.470> f-stop

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
lens but the FA is the effective f-stop

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.660 
lens but the FA is the effective f-stop
what<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.450> effective<00:03:22.050> mean<00:03:22.320> it's<00:03:23.220> sucking

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
what is that effective mean it's sucking

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
what is that effective mean it's sucking
up<00:03:23.940> those<00:03:24.120> two<00:03:24.420> stops<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.870> light<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.620> taking

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
up those two stops of light it's taking

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.590 
up those two stops of light it's taking
the<00:03:26.010> light<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.850> suck<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.209> up<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.540> don't

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
the light and just suck it up you don't

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.160 
the light and just suck it up you don't
get<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:27.900> back<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.890> it's<00:03:29.070> an<00:03:29.160> effective

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
get them back so it's an effective

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.350 
get them back so it's an effective
f-stop<00:03:31.170> an<00:03:31.890> effective<00:03:32.310> F<00:03:32.430> stops<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:33.030> depth<00:03:33.239> of

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
f-stop an effective F stops the depth of

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.780 
f-stop an effective F stops the depth of
field<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.660> not<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.049> same<00:03:34.320> as<00:03:34.560> Nikon<00:03:35.430> says<00:03:35.610> it's

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
field is not the same as Nikon says it's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.360 
field is not the same as Nikon says it's
one<00:03:36.090> half<00:03:36.450> what<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> prime<00:03:37.830> lens<00:03:38.070> would<00:03:38.220> be

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
one half what the prime lens would be

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.620 
one half what the prime lens would be
okay<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.150> basically<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:40.530> put<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:41.010> there

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
okay so basically you put this on there

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.050 
okay so basically you put this on there
you're<00:03:42.630> at<00:03:42.750> f/8<00:03:43.350> effective<00:03:44.130> but<00:03:44.549> your<00:03:44.700> depth

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
you're at f/8 effective but your depth

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.370 
you're at f/8 effective but your depth
of<00:03:45.180> field<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.480> probably<00:03:45.750> closer<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.019> five

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
of field is probably closer to five

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.560 
of field is probably closer to five
point<00:03:46.860> six<00:03:47.459> it's<00:03:47.940> actually<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.330> little<00:03:48.450> bit

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
point six it's actually a little bit

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.479 
point six it's actually a little bit
less<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.110> weird<00:03:49.320> number<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.860> ain't<00:03:50.400> gonna

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
less the weird number I ain't gonna

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.920 
less the weird number I ain't gonna
remember<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> just<00:03:50.910> think<00:03:51.180> five<00:03:51.330> point<00:03:51.630> six

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
remember I just think five point six

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
remember I just think five point six
okay<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.519> focal<00:03:54.510> length<00:03:54.690> changes<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.620> hole<00:03:55.830> in

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
okay so focal length changes the hole in

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.770 
okay so focal length changes the hole in
the<00:03:56.010> back<00:03:56.220> doesn't<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:57.120> your<00:03:57.239> depth<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.510> field

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the back doesn't so your depth of field

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.960 
the back doesn't so your depth of field
is<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.410> be<00:03:58.500> less<00:03:58.769> than<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.280> effective

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
is going to be less than the effective

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.210 
is going to be less than the effective
f-stop<00:04:00.480> that's<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.079> cue<00:04:01.320> no<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.829> confusing

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
f-stop that's the cue no the confusing

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.580 
f-stop that's the cue no the confusing
part<00:04:02.420> effective<00:04:03.420> f-stop<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:04.110> not<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> same

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
part effective f-stop it's not the same

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.069 
part effective f-stop it's not the same
as<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.860> prime<00:04:05.190> f-stop<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.780> one<00:04:06.930> point

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
as the prime f-stop so the one point

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.680 
as the prime f-stop so the one point
four<00:04:07.410> one<00:04:07.680> point<00:04:07.980> seven<00:04:08.340> two<00:04:08.430> two<00:04:08.459> okay<00:04:09.450> out<00:04:09.660> of

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the three the one point seven is the one

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.600 
the three the one point seven is the one
that<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.420> have<00:04:12.630> on<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.989> 600<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.100> majority<00:04:14.519> of

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.159 
time the majority of the time the two
why<00:04:18.000> do<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.150> get<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.419> two<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> project

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
why do I get the two I have a project

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.420

physically<00:04:42.600> get<00:04:42.780> close<00:04:43.050> then<00:04:43.710> use<00:04:43.949> one<00:04:44.130> of

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
physically get close then use one of

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.100

these<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.610> narrow<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.120> angle<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.539> you<00:04:45.720> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
these to narrow the angle of you to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.350 
these to narrow the angle of you to
control<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.560> background<00:04:47.120> so<00:04:48.120> hope<00:04:48.330> that

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
control the background so hope that

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.790 
control the background so hope that
brings<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.750> little<00:04:48.810> bit<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.080> light<00:04:49.289> to<00:04:49.590> the

brings a little bit of light to the
teleconverter<00:04:50.639> situation<00:04:51.300> hope<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:51.990> helps

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
teleconverter situation hope that helps

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.550
