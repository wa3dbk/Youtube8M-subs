00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.280
 spectators from digital television to one 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.519
 new video special we want you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.809
 Today again compared to OLED TVs 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.770
 with the designation eb 96 09 on the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.400
 right side in comparison with the us 95 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.189
 09 the hd lcd on the left side 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.830
 show as you already see beautiful here 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.910
 there are differences in the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.399
 reflections 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.160
 that is the led lcd on the left 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.180
 side mirror clearly more conspicuous than 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.300
 the oled of the one purple 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 having discolored mirroring 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.640
 that means in the left tv could 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 see me quite well in the right less 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.890
 but it is important to note that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.820
 if practical a window in the back 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.680
 would that be a very violet one 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.020
 getting used to light then as 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.189
 give reflection 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.850
 a topic which many non- owners but 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.689
 those who may be 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 want to deal with is the problem with 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.490
 the so-called burn with a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.080
 burn the completely wrong concept is 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.600
 One speaks of a lament 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.310
 or memory effect we had 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.979
 already at plasma tvs 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.979
 Of course it is also here with us 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 topic because the pixels x themselves shine 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.170
 are and for one over a particular one 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 period the picture info keep 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.970
 and as soon as the image content changes 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.060
 it just be that the previous picture 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.600
 after lit I switch now 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.330
 again on the video from the last 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:51.210
 well-known picture from the disney pixar 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:54.360
 stripes inside out and this statue 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 is for oled to a very enjoyable 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.740
 because the roulette picture on the right 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.140
 a very high contrast of the page 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.399
 Contrast is partly for our chamber 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.640
 too much of a good one 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.610
 that means you may now see im 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.470
 Video image already in the bright areas 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.060
 an overexposure or a burnout 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.989
 of details yes, in reality, that looks 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.940
 picture flawless from the black 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.360
 Presentation is on the without much 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.560
 More convincingly, that means it's picture very much 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 much more plastic and the figures are 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 much much stronger and how much 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.430
 more in the foreground anchored off 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.390
 this black background as at 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.420
 led lcd where the whole scenery clear 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.370
 flatter works because just the impression of space 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.760
 by the lightened black lower 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.250
 is 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.590
 with respect to the luminescence is that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.709
 but standing still predestined for that 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.989
 it immediately when switching to light up 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.880
 will give because just the contrast 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.010
 difference to massive is that means we 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.430
 have cell without cell here now 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.609
 really shine with full intensity 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.260
 while others tell pure black 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.930
 represent practically complete 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.459
 are turned off 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.540
 and that leads to just that if 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.049
 here are a few more 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.550
 seconds and I leave 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.430
 switch 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.670
 then you will see like the figures 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:34.020
 apparently continue to shine before this 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.880
 but very dark background 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.870
 Now you have to do this a bit 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.640
 put that on the tv on the left 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.910
 you hardly recognize any more color 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.180
 that means the oled tv shows here 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.410
 really the very difficult to represent 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.720
 de bilt info error free but shows 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.930
 just this too afterglow from the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.240
 from the previous picture can now 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.710
 you switch here when black occurs 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.020
 logically not the lingering 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:09.810
 The oleds are just out of here 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.900
 I believe her a little more 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.840
 we have a shadowy stop at one 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.780
 full white surface the problem that the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400
 cells are practically artificially darkened 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.380
 the protective mechanism is engaged 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.890
 but still in the field of figures still 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:31.010
 can be seen afterglow and if we 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:34.200
 Now go back to the scene 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.240
 where it was seen very very strong before 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.080
 then you will notice slowly like this 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.210
 abate decreases I can do it now 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.000
 with the naked eye actually at all 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.070
 no longer recognize our camera pulls 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.010
 Here's a bit of the exposure 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.390
 that means for you it is faith 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.970
 I still see a little bit 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.270
 you have to say it's not with you 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.580
 comparable to plasma tvs 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.020
 There was a light on a plasma tv 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.440
 if you completely black areas 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.300
 asked what was extremely annoying because 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.270
 you then 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.340
 an afterglow in the cinemaxx coop 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:16.580
 could see beams 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:19.569
 our conclusion in this category lcd 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:25.539
 stay if you like it 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:28.340
 all-round talent when watching games movies tv 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.620
 transfer sport transfer where 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.389
 maybe the score on the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.479
 entire playing time is displayed 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.819
 sender logos are displayed 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.909
 if somehow one surfs on websites 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.819
 or many many still picture presentation 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:47.229
 makes slcd just the universal 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:50.150
 technology olet actually lives from 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:53.810
 Moving content as it is too 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.090
 pretty much whether 21 to 9 or 16 to 9 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.129
 what remains to be said finally 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.150
 you need to shed light on these 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:05.650
 effects do not panic in practice 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.380
 depending on the area of ​​application, it will hardly be 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.029
 disturbing appear in appearance 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.680
 nevertheless one must be in the 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.740
 why did this happen? 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.479
 afterglow the effort was on you should 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.610
 Just be aware of it in advance 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:24.940
 be like the oled technology 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:28.550
 works and what kind of effects 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:32.180
 are generated in practice, the plane 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:35.000
 not with a lcd I hope 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.449
 you have this little bio insight 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.990
 Of course we will continue to like it 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.690
 different technologies 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.259
 just compare these too 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.300
 peculiarities of these technologies to 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.770
 show and I would 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.099
 happy if next time 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.900
 is 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.259
 Thanks for watching and 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.259
 It's good
