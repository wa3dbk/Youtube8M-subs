00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 talk about safety in 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.410
 running training rather one thing 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.809
 security aspect namely lunch in 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.030
 Night time 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.680
 many runners and night trains 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.789
 winter evening it means very dark 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.320
 if several important aspects that 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.199
 maybe even save your life but in 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.119
 anyway provide immeasurably more 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.560
 high level of your security 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.130
 the first most important thing is running along the roads and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.420
 on the streets just to meet 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.940
 motor transport I am horrified watching how 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.489
 some runners move by 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.950
 roads and even the streets in one 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.649
 direction with motor vehicles it is very 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.660
 it is dangerous if you are on the back 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 hang around like he is big transport 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.500
 means questions can't from him 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.940
 dodge and if you run to meet 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.250
 motor transport you can somehow 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.970
 respond to road changes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.010
 situations just to meet motor transport 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 This is very important the second when you 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.210
 pick yourself running clothes pay 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 attention that it should 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.070
 be present clearly and in large 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.560
 the number of reflective elements 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:31.549
 case on a hat with gloves on a jacket 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:34.350
 on dancing and on sneakers these 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.890
 reflective elements are very important as 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.860
 a driver with great driving experience can 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.790
 say that people who go in normal 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.549
 clothes at night almost can't see it 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.700
 just black shadows on a black background 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.549
 take care of it but sometimes we 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.990
 have to move around such conditions 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.280
 when we can't move towards 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.520
 motor transport or just some 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.190
 dark dark space and there is 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.599
 the need to ensure our visibility 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.790
 and behind and for this there are many 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.989
 all sorts of fixtures like let's say 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.640
 so very simple dressing it up 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:28.230
 really just a red beacon which 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:34.319
 can work in two modes choose 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:38.310
 any hang it on the back of the collar and 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.629
 it is also very helpful to you in providing 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.629
 your safety
