00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.610
 hello girls then in this video 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.920
 I share you and sweet food for 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.630
 to be ashamed needed long in full 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.310
 shape they do not break anymore 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.779
 so for starters you're going to have 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.150
 need a pound so this is a 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.800
 lime first kiss that is really thick 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.290
 books that I prefer is to guard 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.640
 an eternity it's a must have and so 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.230
 I will use my skin of course to 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.710
 limay house give them their shape 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.690
 desired 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.149
 so personally I love the form 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.530
 square on the long nails and then the 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.579
 advice that you certainly need 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.200
 know but who really is to 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.820
 apply this is to limay want 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.830
 always from the outside to the inside 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.400
 it will not be too much to weaken them in 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.900
 going back and forth so then 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.460
 you are going to need a file and 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.100
 weigh everything goes but but this time 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.590
 advocated such a united version museum us 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.630
 to serve you to file so the end of 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.250
 the nail lightly on the top we 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.510
 as you see on the video it's this 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.829
 which will help avoid the 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.689
 splitting nails because when 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.759
 they are usually delivered it irritates a 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.200
 little long between nÃ®mes and and that's it 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.490
 can repair the damage that has 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.490
 been caused healthily 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.540
 I usually use this slim 12 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.950
 to file house angles so years 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.170
 necessary because that's the place where 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.330
 they tend to be the most fragile 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.660
 so here I am reading even slightly the angle 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.660
 hunting 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.460
 he 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 2 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.760
 so then you will need the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.950
 famous bowl of hot water 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.050
 you can add to it of course if you 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.979
 want mules essential oils 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.540
 vegetable etc 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.330
 for my part I use hot water 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.710
 purge race is enough and I'll get you 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.360
 horns and other but needs a few 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.340
 moments you will then need 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.869
 of a wooden stick so especially 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.130
 avoid all that is doing is 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.550
 far too aggressive for your little ones 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.950
 calculations 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.750
 you will use water rounded tip 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.520
 to fend off cuticles if you 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.100
 I did not have too much of that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.959
 side and I use this particular side 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.459
 and the slightly more pointed side for 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.800
 eliminate what is a little bit for 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.090
 dead actually and what is it stuck in 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 below the cuticles and therefore time 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.000
 in time not every time but example 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.550
 in me it is good to withdraw a small 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.560
 little is for dead and especially 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.180
 be careful not to press hard because 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 that if you press hard on the matrix 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.150
 is what will give you the famous 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.310
 white mark afterwards when long 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.290
 will not push back then 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.730
 I love using evening pulleys so 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.040
 there I had two different formats 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.269
 with both sides especially the one that goes 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.269
 polish and celtic industry 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.200
 as you surely guessed we're going 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.849
 use it to polish the surface of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.849
 each one so it's a process that allows 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.799
 to gradually eliminate the nails a 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.329
 little yellowed by removing the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.099
 first layers of the ngo so of course 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.450
 do not abuse it because otherwise it 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.549
 can make your blocking a lot 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.040
 finer and brittle is good time in 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.159
 time is pretty cool and so after we 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.359
 happens once I nail side of lalo 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.219
 do not know how it's called even small 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.480
 little chamois and it's great if 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.889
 you intend not to wear 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.489
 polish it will give a great side 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.489
 brilliant rozon 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.849
 we are often tempted to put polish 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.140
 permanently but according to my 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.790
 personal experience what can I 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.260
 do you have the orders so 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.239
 I recommend you bring some polish 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.950
 permanently but rather bet on the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.599
 this kind of fortifying base so there 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.790
 this is the base of the Roma who is really 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.650
 great for me what I prefer 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.730
 again is let breathe house on 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.430
 further away 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.110
 so here I'm going to apply a wax for 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.360
 the nails and who are doing so it's going to be 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.489
 really go to reinforce them and saÃ¯d 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.260
 misses the perimeter of long and so 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.060
 it's true that to come back to this 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.290
 subject I find that when I leave it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.640
 house that breathes and the highest 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.680
 possible ie at least half 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.269
 time I see a clear difference 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.980
 on the appearance of houses after at 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.269
 people who prefer to wear polish 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.980
 to protect them from shocks etc 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.540
 me perso it touches me the waves 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.250
 usually at prices become friable 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.410
 and so that's where I get you 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930
 let you make your personal opinion 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.220
 but still try the experience of 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.239
 let your nails breathe and 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.239
 risks you think 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.349
 and so of course the final beauty gesture 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.730
 it's the hand cream because 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.579
 well, you know when we get used to it 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.079
 cold and even here I would tell you that I 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.520
 never have the cream 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.080
 so here are the girls I hope this 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.740
 video will have pleased you as for me I do 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.240
 big kisses 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.870
 do not forget to join us are my 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.870
