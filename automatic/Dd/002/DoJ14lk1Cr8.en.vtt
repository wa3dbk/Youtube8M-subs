you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.699 

let's<00:02:25.330> take<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.630> look<00:02:25.840> at<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.050> chords<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.650> we

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
let's take a look at the chords that we

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.089 
let's take a look at the chords that we
use<00:02:27.130> with<00:02:27.640> that'll<00:02:27.970> never<00:02:28.090> happen<00:02:28.270> no<00:02:28.569> more<00:02:29.099> we

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
use with that'll never happen no more we

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:40.350 
use with that'll never happen no more we
have<00:02:30.250> G<00:02:31.319> g7<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.470> two<00:02:32.770> variations<00:02:33.569> d<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:37.769> 7e7<00:02:39.360> C

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
have G g7 in two variations d a a 7e7 C

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.660 
have G g7 in two variations d a a 7e7 C
and<00:02:40.630> E<00:02:41.380> flat<00:02:41.860> seven<00:02:42.120> all<00:02:43.120> basic<00:02:43.840> chords<00:02:44.670> now

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and E flat seven all basic chords now

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.280 
and E flat seven all basic chords now
we'll<00:02:45.849> break<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.090> introduction<00:02:46.780> down<00:02:46.989> into

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
we'll break the introduction down into

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.979 
we'll break the introduction down into
phrases<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.670> we'll<00:02:48.819> split<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.269> screen<00:02:49.600> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
phrases and we'll split the screen to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.809 
phrases and we'll split the screen to
show<00:02:50.170> my<00:02:50.410> hand<00:02:50.620> my<00:02:50.950> right<00:02:50.980> hand<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.730> the

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
show my hand my right hand and the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:05.540 
show my hand my right hand and the
tablature<00:02:52.299> at<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> same<00:02:52.840> time<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.830> way

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:14.960 

you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.520 

and<00:03:16.830> once<00:03:17.830> again<00:03:18.040> our<00:03:18.490> plate<00:03:18.730> very<00:03:19.150> slowly<00:03:19.530> try

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and once again our plate very slowly try

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:36.530 
and once again our plate very slowly try
and<00:03:20.710> follow<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.070> tablature

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.710 

you

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:50.610 

you

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.040 

one<00:03:51.620> thing<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:51.920> note<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.520> because<00:03:53.510> Blake

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
one thing to note is that because Blake

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.440 
one thing to note is that because Blake
played<00:03:54.410> this<00:03:54.620> bass<00:03:54.890> note<00:03:55.220> hard<00:03:55.580> it's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
played this bass note hard it's

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.059 
played this bass note hard it's
important<00:03:57.050> that<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.319> use<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.620> palm<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.890> your

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
important that you use the palm of your

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.360 
important that you use the palm of your
hand<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:59.180> damp<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.780> bass<00:03:59.989> strings<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:00.739> like

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
hand to damp the bass strings just like

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.940 
hand to damp the bass strings just like
bruns<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:02.030> is<00:04:03.580> on<00:04:04.580> his<00:04:04.819> monotonic<00:04:05.480> base<00:04:05.950> we're

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
bruns it is on his monotonic base we're

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.650 
bruns it is on his monotonic base we're
alternating<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.670> bases<00:04:10.120> don't<00:04:11.120> let<00:04:11.300> me<00:04:11.450> ring

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
alternating the bases don't let me ring

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.040 
alternating the bases don't let me ring
like<00:04:11.870> this

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
like this

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.140 
like this
in<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.830> ring<00:04:14.100> but<00:04:14.670> damp<00:04:14.970> them<00:04:15.240> with<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.690> palm

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
in the ring but damp them with the palm

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:30.159 
in the ring but damp them with the palm
bit<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.299> Doc<00:04:18.570> Watson<00:04:18.810> style

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.920 

I

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.600 

then<00:04:36.930> let's<00:04:37.440> take<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.650> closer<00:04:37.950> look<00:04:38.070> at<00:04:38.250> my<00:04:38.370> hand

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
then let's take a closer look at my hand

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.310 
then let's take a closer look at my hand
to<00:04:38.880> see<00:04:39.030> how<00:04:39.210> we<00:04:39.270> achieve<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:39.660> damping

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
to see how we achieve this damping

00:04:40.320 --> 00:05:10.000 
to see how we achieve this damping
effect

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.560 

these<00:05:11.010> are<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.340> last<00:05:11.490> three<00:05:11.850> notes<00:05:12.120> we<00:05:12.330> played

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
these are the last three notes we played

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:20.180 
these are the last three notes we played
in<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.990> last<00:05:13.140> section<00:05:18.740> this<00:05:19.740> is<00:05:19.890> where<00:05:20.040> we'll

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
in the last section this is where we'll

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:40.740 
in the last section this is where we'll
carry<00:05:20.460> on<00:05:20.580> for<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.090> second<00:05:21.480> section

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.450 

it<00:05:41.750> also<00:05:41.930> notice<00:05:42.650> that<00:05:42.680> when<00:05:43.070> I'm<00:05:43.190> picking

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
it also notice that when I'm picking

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.260 
it also notice that when I'm picking
with<00:05:43.930> two<00:05:44.930> fingers<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:46.460> my<00:05:46.640> little<00:05:47.060> finger

with two fingers that my little finger

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.530 
with two fingers that my little finger
lifts<00:05:47.840> away<00:05:47.960> from<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.470> soundboard<00:05:49.390> this<00:05:50.390> is

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
lifts away from the soundboard this is

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.190 
lifts away from the soundboard this is
unfortunate<00:05:51.320> is<00:05:51.440> part<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.890> my<00:05:52.070> style<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:53.840> makes
