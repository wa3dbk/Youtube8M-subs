 to make a headshot 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.409
 shot there are some who would not say 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.150

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.369

 frankly just try to make yourself 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.610
 a small representation of a hunt 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.810
