rainy day except emails I'd rather be
doing<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:07.049> let's<00:00:07.230> check<00:00:07.500> out<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:09.349> gold

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
doing this so let's check out this gold

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.459 
doing this so let's check out this gold
series<00:00:10.820> 4.5<00:00:11.820> horse<00:00:12.300> lawn-boy

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
series 4.5 horse lawn-boy

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.350 
series 4.5 horse lawn-boy
probably<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> last<00:00:14.490> ones<00:00:14.849> made<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
probably one of the last ones made it

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.830 
probably one of the last ones made it
has<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> magnesium<00:00:16.049> deck<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.250> two-stroke

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
has a magnesium deck and the two-stroke

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.540 
has a magnesium deck and the two-stroke
so<00:00:18.840> I'm<00:00:18.990> guessing<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.619> about<00:00:19.890> 10-12<00:00:20.460> years

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
so I'm guessing it's about 10-12 years

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.540 
so I'm guessing it's about 10-12 years
old<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> manual

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
old and it's the kind with the manual

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.350 
old and it's the kind with the manual

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
choke and no primer let's see

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.660

compression<00:00:36.360> oh<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.890> feels<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.280> brand-new

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
compression oh it feels like brand-new

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
just you move those two screws on the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.399 
just you move those two screws on the
curb<00:01:04.100> done<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> car<00:01:06.060> boat<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.570> also

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
crankshaft was dry and rusty which means

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
crankshaft was dry and rusty which means
the<00:01:11.159> crank<00:01:11.430> seal<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> good<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:13.020> a

black<00:02:16.650> disc<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.550> spring<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:19.200> clicks

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
black disc is a spring and this clicks

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.200 
black disc is a spring and this clicks
it's<00:02:22.050> your<00:02:22.350> ratcheting<00:02:23.130> speed<00:02:23.490> adjuster<00:02:23.970> it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
it's your ratcheting speed adjuster it

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.760 
it's your ratcheting speed adjuster it
just<00:02:24.420> puts<00:02:24.690> more<00:02:24.930> or<00:02:25.020> less<00:02:25.170> tension<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
just puts more or less tension on the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.670 
just puts more or less tension on the
spring<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.730> most<00:02:27.120> lawn<00:02:27.330> boys<00:02:27.590> don't<00:02:28.590> have

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
spring because most lawn boys don't have

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.270 
spring because most lawn boys don't have
much<00:02:29.220> adjustment<00:02:29.580> here<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.240> speed<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.800> that's

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
much adjustment here for speed so that's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.160 
much adjustment here for speed so that's
how<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.210> put<00:02:33.690> your<00:02:33.810> fingers

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
how you do it you just put your fingers

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.050 
how you do it you just put your fingers
underneath<00:02:34.440> while<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:34.860> running<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.730> while

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
underneath while it's running or while

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.760 
underneath while it's running or while
it's<00:02:36.210> not<00:02:36.360> running<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.110> adjust<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
it's not running and just adjust it and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.960 
it's not running and just adjust it and
trial<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.130> error<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.640> running<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
trial and error and get it running the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.350 
trial and error and get it running the
speed<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.390> want<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.790> tell<00:02:42.150> by<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
speed you want I can just tell by the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.150 
speed you want I can just tell by the
tension<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:43.470> one<00:02:43.680> should<00:02:44.040> run

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
tension of this that this one should run

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.960 
tension of this that this one should run
at<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> right<00:02:44.550> speed<00:02:45.860> well<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.130> went<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
at the right speed well I just went to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.730 
at the right speed well I just went to
move<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.330> lever<00:02:48.510> up<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.870> down<00:02:48.990> for<00:02:49.290> throttle

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
move the lever up and down for throttle

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.600 
move the lever up and down for throttle
and<00:02:49.860> choke<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:51.540> choke<00:02:52.200> did<00:02:52.560> not<00:02:52.740> move<00:02:53.070> but

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and choke and the choke did not move but

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.960 
and choke and the choke did not move but
it<00:02:53.760> does<00:02:53.940> work<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.540> push<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.140> manually<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.940> I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
it does work if I push it manually so I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.370 
it does work if I push it manually so I
checked<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.960> cable<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.840> got<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> broken

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
checked the cable and it's got a broken

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.430 
checked the cable and it's got a broken
spot<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:02.820> luckily<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.540> another<00:03:03.960> parts

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
spot but luckily I have another parts

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.620 
spot but luckily I have another parts
more<00:03:04.710> nearby<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.550> just<00:03:05.820> checked<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> cable

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
more nearby and I just checked the cable

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.330 
more nearby and I just checked the cable
and<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.900> good<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> needed<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.770> switch<00:03:08.040> that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
and it's good so I needed to switch that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.800 
and it's good so I needed to switch that
that's<00:03:08.790> probably<00:03:09.030> all<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.360> was<00:03:09.510> wrong<00:03:09.660> with

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
that's probably all that was wrong with

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.890 
that's probably all that was wrong with
it<00:03:09.960> why<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.110> guy<00:03:10.320> got<00:03:10.560> rid<00:03:10.710> of<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:11.360> no<00:03:12.360> choke<00:03:12.690> no

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
it why the guy got rid of it no choke no

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.250 
it why the guy got rid of it no choke no
start<00:03:13.230> no<00:03:13.410> prime<00:03:13.860> either<00:03:14.570> well<00:03:15.570> changing<00:03:16.080> that

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
start no prime either well changing that

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.080 
start no prime either well changing that
cable<00:03:16.680> was<00:03:16.830> quite<00:03:17.190> straightforward

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
cable was quite straightforward

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:27.290 
cable was quite straightforward
so<00:03:18.960> toque<00:03:19.560> works<00:03:19.860> now<00:03:23.150> no<00:03:24.150> problem<00:03:25.730> yeah<00:03:26.730> guess

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
so toque works now no problem yeah guess

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.350 
so toque works now no problem yeah guess
what<00:03:27.830> he<00:03:28.830> gave<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.250> test<00:03:29.490> for<00:03:29.730> spark<00:03:30.090> just

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
what he gave it a test for spark just

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.140 
what he gave it a test for spark just
before<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> was<00:03:30.840> ready<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.110> pull<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.520> and<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.940> had

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
before I was ready to pull it and it had

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.260 
before I was ready to pull it and it had
none<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.980> one<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.280> those<00:03:35.460> coils<00:03:35.730> came<00:03:36.060> from

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
none so one of those coils came from

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.940 
none so one of those coils came from
there<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.870> had<00:03:37.050> three<00:03:37.320> others<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.830> they

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
there and I had three others and they

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.940 
there and I had three others and they
all<00:03:38.160> had<00:03:38.400> no<00:03:38.610> spark<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.930> finally<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.530> found<00:03:40.770> a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
all had no spark so finally I found a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.530 
all had no spark so finally I found a
long<00:03:41.130> boy<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.460> took<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.820> coil<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.480> it

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
long boy I took the coil out of and it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.930 
long boy I took the coil out of and it
was<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> replacement<00:03:43.110> coil<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.800> now<00:03:44.640> we<00:03:44.700> have

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
was a replacement coil and now we have

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.610 
was a replacement coil and now we have
spark<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.570> just<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.990> reinstall<00:03:46.470> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
spark so I just have to reinstall the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.740 
spark so I just have to reinstall the
spark<00:03:46.890> plug<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.340> see<00:03:47.700> if<00:03:47.790> she<00:03:47.940> fires<00:03:48.180> up<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
spark plug and see if she fires up the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.460 
spark plug and see if she fires up the
gas<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.350> in<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.670> here<00:03:51.000> goes<00:03:51.060> no<00:03:51.810> prime<00:03:52.140> just

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
gas is in it so here goes no prime just

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:14.580 
gas is in it so here goes no prime just
the<00:03:52.830> choke<00:03:53.070> on

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.190 

Oh<00:04:15.090> gotta<00:04:16.090> love<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:18.510> two<00:04:19.510> shots<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.109> it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
Oh gotta love that two shots and it

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.040 
Oh gotta love that two shots and it
looks<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:20.530> it's<00:04:20.739> been<00:04:20.859> sitting<00:04:21.220> for<00:04:21.250> years

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
looks like it's been sitting for years

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.830 
looks like it's been sitting for years
sweet<00:04:23.220> did<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.400> say<00:04:24.639> before<00:04:24.790> Gary's<00:04:25.360> picking<00:04:25.750> is

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
sweet did I say before Gary's picking is

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.860 
sweet did I say before Gary's picking is
a<00:04:25.870> wonderful<00:04:26.440> business<00:04:27.000> fun<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.300> every<00:04:28.720> day

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
a wonderful business fun and every day

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.420 
a wonderful business fun and every day
feels<00:04:29.169> like<00:04:29.290> Christmas<00:04:29.860> if<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.100> never<00:04:30.280> know

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
feels like Christmas if you never know

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.740 
feels like Christmas if you never know
what<00:04:30.580> you're<00:04:30.730> gonna<00:04:30.820> get<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.480> you're<00:04:31.660> gonna

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
what you're gonna get but you're gonna

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.290 
what you're gonna get but you're gonna
get<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.990> lot
