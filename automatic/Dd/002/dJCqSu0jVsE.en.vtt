about and we've got new the big
operators<00:02:14.920> yes<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:15.900> two<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.200> go<00:02:17.319> on<00:02:17.500> that

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
operators yes so two can go on that

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.160 
operators yes so two can go on that
whereas<00:02:18.129> before<00:02:18.519> we<00:02:19.420> couldn't<00:02:19.780> because<00:02:20.080> there

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
whereas before we couldn't because there

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.600 
whereas before we couldn't because there
won't<00:02:20.349> be<00:02:20.410> enough<00:02:20.650> staff<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.190> cover

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
won't be enough staff to cover

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
won't be enough staff to cover
everything<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.480> you've<00:02:22.569> got<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.870> use<00:02:23.049> owns<00:02:23.260> now

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
everything so you've got to use owns now

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.850 
everything so you've got to use owns now
and<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.829> yeah<00:02:23.980> yeah<00:02:24.640> yeah<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:26.349> what<00:02:26.530> impact

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and you yeah yeah yeah and what impact

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.580 
and you yeah yeah yeah and what impact
do<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:26.980> think<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:28.180> chases<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.630> had<00:02:28.780> on<00:02:28.989> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
do you think the chases have had on the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.240 
do you think the chases have had on the
behavior<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:29.980> children

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
behavior of children

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.119 
behavior of children

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
now are right there with a year group

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.370 
now are right there with a year group
there's<00:03:06.910> roughly<00:03:07.329> about<00:03:07.389> two<00:03:07.750> year<00:03:08.019> groups<00:03:08.290> I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
there's roughly about two year groups I

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.800 
there's roughly about two year groups I
think<00:03:08.410> our<00:03:08.739> time<00:03:08.950> out<00:03:09.220> there<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.420> there<00:03:10.630> isn't

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
think our time out there so there isn't

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.059 
think our time out there so there isn't
all<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.139> conflict<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:12.160> there<00:03:12.400> was<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
all the conflict that there was like the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.370 
all the conflict that there was like the
older<00:03:15.910> year<00:03:16.389> groups<00:03:16.720> you've<00:03:17.560> got<00:03:17.889> that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
older year groups you've got that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.830 
older year groups you've got that

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
bickering back to forwards but now with

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.220 
bickering back to forwards but now with
them<00:03:23.019> split<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.150> lot<00:03:25.329> easier<00:03:25.540> there's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
them split it's a lot easier there's

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.840 
them split it's a lot easier there's
more<00:03:26.470> control<00:03:27.329> it's<00:03:28.329> just<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.840> lot
