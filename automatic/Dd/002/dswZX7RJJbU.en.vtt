00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.650 
Jets
and<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.580> meant<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:54.820> dryers<00:04:55.090> going<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.450> drop

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
and I meant the dryers going to drop

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:14.830 
and I meant the dryers going to drop
here

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:24.140 

and<00:05:15.290> speak<00:05:15.680> on

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.170 

gracefully<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.110> they<00:05:25.290> raise<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.949> love

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
gracefully that they raise I love

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:43.600 
gracefully that they raise I love
I<00:05:28.210> went<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.419> little<00:05:28.449> too<00:05:28.660> fast<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.259> beginning

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.450 

I<00:05:44.379> guess<00:05:45.379> I<00:05:45.500> ran<00:05:45.680> out<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.830> drive<00:05:46.159> time<00:05:46.490> but

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
I guess I ran out of drive time but

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.770 
I guess I ran out of drive time but
overall<00:05:49.460> it's<00:05:49.819> hard<00:05:50.000> to<00:05:50.090> say<00:05:50.240> that<00:05:50.509> was<00:05:50.599> a<00:05:50.629> good

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
overall it's hard to say that was a good

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.990 
overall it's hard to say that was a good
value<00:05:50.990> for<00:05:51.139> $7.00<00:05:51.919> but<00:05:52.159> in<00:05:52.250> any<00:05:52.340> case<00:05:52.430> it<00:05:52.849> looks

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
value for $7.00 but in any case it looks

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.369 
value for $7.00 but in any case it looks
like<00:05:53.150> it<00:05:53.360> did<00:05:53.449> a<00:05:53.509> pretty<00:05:53.689> good<00:05:53.840> job<00:05:53.900> on<00:05:54.259> my

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
like it did a pretty good job on my

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:58.629 
like it did a pretty good job on my
color<00:05:54.650> so<00:05:55.610> I<00:05:55.639> guess<00:05:55.879> that<00:05:56.210> is<00:05:56.240> it
