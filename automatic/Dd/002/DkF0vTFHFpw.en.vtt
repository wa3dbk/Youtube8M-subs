00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and make it more liquid are we going to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.490 
and make it more liquid are we going to
add<00:00:58.680> our<00:00:58.920> icing<00:00:59.460> sugar<00:01:02.329> speed<00:01:03.329> 3<00:01:03.719> until<00:01:04.409> it's

chef comes into its own because the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.550 
chef comes into its own because the

we're going to set that aside back into

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.460 
we're going to set that aside back into
the<00:01:22.530> thermo<00:01:22.890> chef<00:01:23.130> bowl<00:01:23.689> we<00:01:24.689> will<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:25.080> putting
