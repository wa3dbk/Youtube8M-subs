00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.580
 a comment from javi we found the truth 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.710
 I was talking about the iconia 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.180
 we would see more recommended mogollÃ³n de 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.520
 tweets the truth is that this guy dominates 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.470
 ciga loads of stuff tweets 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.390
 said and of all this most recommended 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.520
 about 10 clicks and well today I'm going to 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.620
 make three recommendations that has 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.329
 done javier boumos I put you here 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.530
 comment and also you can follow it in 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.780
 twitter because really this guy 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.880
 dominates lots of tweets of cydia well 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.720
 that you have any questions because 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.340
 I think he will be able to help them 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.750
 quietly I do not think it deserves 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.520
 pity I know that what is not here comes the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.260
 comment and your good twitter we're going to 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.390
 start with a tweet called icon 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.310
 ruin deimer and this tweet is pretty 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.840
 simple but it does a pretty useful thing 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.520
 how are you going to see what 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.500
 first we are going to go to the settings 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.630
 to configure this tweet we are going to 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.190
 look for it this here and with rum 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.200
 eimer and fix those that we have to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.879
 activate this here requires a double 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.590
 tap ok then what are we going to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.659
 have to do here is to hold down 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.579
 in any icon so that it vibrates and a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.350
 Once we vibrate let's make a double tap on 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.520
 an icon for example in tweet or we're not going 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.390
 to do a double is to see if what 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.340
 you see pam pam 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.070
 double tapen tweetbot and see what's going 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.659
 to let the application rename this 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.490
 It seems very interesting and javi told me 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.320
 that this is pretty cool for all 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.090
 those applications that have points 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 suspensions in the application because the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.450
 name is too long then the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.190
 it's a bit ugly and good 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.360
 with this application with this tweet we are going 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.610
 to be able to rename those applications 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.960
 they have a name too long and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.640
 put the one we want not 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.500
 obviously apart from this for good 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.119
 we can see any 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 application that has a name that 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.380
 we do not like it for the reason that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.670
 be and we will be able to change not 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.800
 I repeat that what we have to do is 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.960
 make them vibrate hold down a 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.640
 application we do a double tap on 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.039
 any application and we will be able to 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.050
 change the name of that application is 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.729
 a very simple click only does this 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.920
 It is completely free in the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.050
 repository of big boss' and I hope that you 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.440
 please see you later I hope you like the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.740
 video 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.740
 bye Bye
