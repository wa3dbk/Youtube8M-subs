look like this okay then you have to
take<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.780> whole<00:00:58.050> line<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.449> fold

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
take this whole line right here and fold

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.780 
take this whole line right here and fold
out<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.350> okay<00:01:02.600> take<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.989> square<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
out here okay take one square like this

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.200 
out here okay take one square like this
and<00:01:05.790> move<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.630> once<00:01:07.040> right<00:01:08.040> there

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210

okay<00:01:12.410> then<00:01:13.940> pull<00:01:14.940> it<00:01:14.970> sugar<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.940> it

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
okay then pull it sugar the like this it

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.380 
okay then pull it sugar the like this it
should<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.270> looking<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.690> this<00:01:18.900> um<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:20.390> pole

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
should be looking like this um to pole

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.200 
should be looking like this um to pole
rings<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.200> two<00:01:22.890> partial<00:01:23.550> rings<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:24.000> there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
rings and two partial rings right there

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.260 
rings and two partial rings right there
then<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.260> flip<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:25.650> over<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> should<00:01:27.240> be

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
then you flip it over and you should be

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.590 
then you flip it over and you should be
having<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.790> muscles<00:01:29.790> must<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.180> having

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
having this muscles must we be having

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.630 
having this muscles must we be having
this<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.960> right<00:01:32.810> okay<00:01:33.810> um<00:01:34.050> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.220> like

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
this all right okay um this is so like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.630 
this all right okay um this is so like
last<00:01:36.270> some<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.020> steps<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.190> solve<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
last some more steps then you solve it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.930 
last some more steps then you solve it
you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> always<00:01:39.930> pause<00:01:40.440> so<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.729> having

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
you can always pause so if you're having

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.630 
you can always pause so if you're having
trouble<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.410> just<00:01:43.590> pause<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.399> back

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
trouble you can just pause and go back

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.330 
trouble you can just pause and go back
okay<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.800> take<00:01:46.800> this<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.450> hold<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:49.340> take

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
okay so take this one hold it there take

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.109 
okay so take this one hold it there take
one<00:01:50.700> layer<00:01:50.970> up<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:52.380> layer<00:01:53.119> well

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
one layer up here right one layer well

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.139 
one layer up here right one layer well
up<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.770> take<00:01:55.770> two<00:01:56.160> layers<00:01:57.619> from<00:01:58.619> down<00:01:58.890> there

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
up here take two layers from down there

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.300 
up here take two layers from down there
and<00:02:00.149> take<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.479> there<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:03.020> flip<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.619> layer<00:02:04.830> up

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.020 

take<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:09.239> later<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:10.340> flip<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.820> over

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you get okay so you can reverse if you

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.949 
you get okay so you can reverse if you
want<00:02:23.370> doing<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:26.209> assuming<00:02:27.209> missing<00:02:27.660> stuff

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
want doing this assuming missing stuff
