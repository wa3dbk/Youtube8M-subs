 Today I would like to show you this 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.719
 assassin's creed unity small stack 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.800
 gaming one straight away a lot of words already 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.380
 on available 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 Wave cake crepe infusion version did not want 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.160
 would you show them imitation how we take 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.700
 who's wondering what the game is like 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.620
 which requires an eight core from someone 83 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.360
 on 10 or intel core i5 2500k on 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 minimum videos like beads for 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.070
 lecture and kuleshov 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 today I won 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 photographic you looked at given 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.420
 can see the ratio 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.420
 bathes 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:16.730
 but now vagan punishment of all 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:47.110
 beats 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:47.110
 I highlight the practice shows the story 4 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.910
 correct well 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:11.660
 squander fps right but not much 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:23.120
 brother wants infection let's go in 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:27.650
 settings for selecting the graph parameter here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.220
 as you can see are allowed but at 440 to 900 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.810
 full screen game quality graphics Well 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.709
 vertical sync off 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.200
 about the graphics here when you put 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.290
 maximum but very high quality 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:50.050
 why that in itself puts us a4 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:56.530
 they are better but let's say if you put it 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.530
 already play comfortably stop 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:20.210
 how would that 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.610
 control released 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.610
 knows love my coles and flank console 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:37.310
 but let me remind you wherever we are 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.430
 it would seem that we will not miss the factory 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.120
 residence frame 26 when killed thicker 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:52.639
 of events 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:52.639
 That ratio will be but but at the same time 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:07.090
 a market which is also very similar to 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.650
 here is to fasten everything is still set 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:16.060
 visual graphics settings to 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.060
 common and 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:04.680
 to on 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:37.030
 about 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:39.129
 time use play look in 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.809

 My Well Well here works on 

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:08.110
 I think of this video could but 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:10.029
 kill or transfer about which 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:16.289
 then the game is optimized or soft 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:16.289
 for example, for example, it will go for convenience 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.879
