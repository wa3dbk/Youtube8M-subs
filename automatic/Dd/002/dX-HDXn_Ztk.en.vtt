I could've been doing anything.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.169
Please.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.771
Your life would struggle to get a PG rating.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.329
I’ve seen you ’talking’ to your Benedict
poster.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.550
That was one time.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.520
What are you doing here anyway?

About to binge watch Walking Dead.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.530
I’m not interested.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440
I’ve just started this new series.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.930
It’s got sexy Scottish accents, kilts, feminist teachings. [Bagpipes start playing]

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
It all starts when Claire goes up into the
Highlands and she finds -

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.400
I don’t have five free hours [Bagpipes cut out]

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.740
So this actually isn't that bad -
Aah, shit.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.900
Not again.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.160
I wrote you 365 letters, damn it!

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.260
[Zombie groans]

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.940
How many times?!

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.220
Aim for the head!

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.360
[From the other room] No, no, no, no, no...

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.320
No, no, no, no, no, no

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.540
Em, what’s the matter?

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.420
No one knows when the next one’s coming
out.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.049
Randall was meant to die in 1747, but because
of Claire - 1743.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.459
And because they're related, it affects the
whole timeline!

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.420
Okay, okay, let's just take a little break,
alright?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.960
I’m just trying to help you.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.060
I’ve got it under control.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.270
This is Game of Thrones all over again.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.970
No.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.690
Stop - stop it.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.530
I nee- need it.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.920
There’s nothing left to read!

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.080
But please just one more page.

Listen to yourself!

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.720
Please, no!

[Rip of book pages]

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.180
Maybe if we use some tape...

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.940
I’m a monster.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.280
...like a lot of tape.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.680
I need to go back, don’t I?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.680
It’s for the best.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.540
Hi, I'm Em.

And I'm a book addict.
