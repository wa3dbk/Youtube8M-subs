00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.880 

having<00:00:02.700> been<00:00:02.939> asked<00:00:03.360> what<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.400> show<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.910> tabs

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
having been asked what I show the tabs

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.919 
having been asked what I show the tabs
for<00:00:07.890> red<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.030> roles<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:11.389> fear<00:00:12.389> I'm<00:00:12.690> unable

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
for red is the roles I fear I'm unable

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.020 
for red is the roles I fear I'm unable
to<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.799> because<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.190> don't<00:00:14.790> really

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
to do that because I don't really

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.849 
to do that because I don't really
understand<00:00:15.690> tabs<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.940> was<00:00:17.940> brought<00:00:18.810> up<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.350> an

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
understand tabs I was brought up in an

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.849 
understand tabs I was brought up in an
age<00:00:20.010> before<00:00:20.340> they<00:00:20.789> were<00:00:21.510> introduced<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.470> think

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.320 

or<00:00:25.859> maybe<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.580> simply<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.060> I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
or maybe it's just simply because I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.950 
or maybe it's just simply because I
taught<00:00:27.570> myself<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.080> play<00:00:28.760> that<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.060> don't

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
taught myself to play that I don't

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
taught myself to play that I don't
really<00:00:31.230> understand<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> read<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.579> or

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
really understand how to read them or

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.340 
really understand how to read them or
how<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> write<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:36.149> prepare<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
how to write them so I will prepare as I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.030 
how to write them so I will prepare as I
have<00:00:37.559> done<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.890> other<00:00:38.070> tutorials<00:00:39.170> my<00:00:40.170> own<00:00:40.350> way

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
have done in other tutorials my own way

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.119 
have done in other tutorials my own way
of<00:00:41.070> showing<00:00:41.570> how<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.600> play<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.950> one

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
of showing how to play it but this one

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.220 
of showing how to play it but this one
in<00:00:44.250> actual<00:00:44.610> fact<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.000> quite<00:00:45.210> simple<00:00:46.460> it's

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
in actual fact is quite simple it's

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.630 
in actual fact is quite simple it's
played<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.850> such<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> way<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.230> tune<00:00:53.010> comes

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
played in such a way that the tune comes

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.510 
played in such a way that the tune comes
out<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.930> change<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.500> caused<00:00:56.660> mostly<00:00:57.660> by

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
out as you change the caused mostly by

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.170 
out as you change the caused mostly by
playing<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.239> correct<00:01:00.660> bass<00:01:01.199> string<00:01:02.180> four

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
playing the correct bass string four

playing the correct bass string four
five<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.780> six<00:01:04.010> with<00:01:05.010> your<00:01:05.250> thumb<00:01:07.400> occasionally

five or six with your thumb occasionally

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.390 
five or six with your thumb occasionally
the<00:01:08.729> first<00:01:09.030> finger<00:01:09.600> picks<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.740> couple<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the first finger picks out a couple of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
the first finger picks out a couple of
the<00:01:11.520> notes<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> tune<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.689> rest<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the notes in the tune but the rest of it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
the notes in the tune but the rest of it
is<00:01:13.380> done<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> forum<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.970> other

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
is done at the forum and the other

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.690 
is done at the forum and the other
fingers<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> fill<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
fingers are just there to fill in the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.330 
fingers are just there to fill in the
gaps<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> by<00:01:19.950> following<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:22.009> chord<00:01:23.009> sequence

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
gaps so by following the chord sequence

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
gaps so by following the chord sequence
shown<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> video<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.700> get<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.689> I'll

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
shown with the video you get this I'll

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.300 
shown with the video you get this I'll
play<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.290> slowly<00:01:28.439> through<00:01:28.799> first<00:01:29.990> see

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
play it slowly through first see

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
play it slowly through first see

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
a little bit more difficult because

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.520 
a little bit more difficult because
you've<00:02:05.970> got<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.539> F<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.140> C<00:02:07.920> change

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
you've got to get the F and C change

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.370 
you've got to get the F and C change
quite<00:02:10.530> quickly<00:02:10.860> because<00:02:11.100> basically<00:02:11.850> it's<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
quite quickly because basically it's to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.710 
quite quickly because basically it's to
cause<00:02:13.709> within<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.549> bar<00:02:14.880> rather<00:02:15.239> than<00:02:15.540> just

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
cause within one bar rather than just

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.479 
cause within one bar rather than just
one<00:02:15.989> chord<00:02:18.200> when<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> put<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> annotations<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
one chord when I put the annotations to

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.750 
one chord when I put the annotations to
that<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.830> will<00:02:22.860> show<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.340> where<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
that and it will show you where the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.870 
that and it will show you where the
other<00:02:24.239> fingers<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.750> playing<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:26.280> hopefully

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
other fingers are playing and hopefully

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.110 
other fingers are playing and hopefully
then<00:02:27.090> you'll<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.480> able<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.750> follow<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
then you'll be able to follow it and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.449 
then you'll be able to follow it and
then<00:02:30.120> when<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.420> bring<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> up<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.110> speed

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
then when you bring it up to speed

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:59.260 
then when you bring it up to speed
should<00:02:32.459> sound<00:02:32.760> something<00:02:33.269> like<00:02:33.299> this

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:12.050 

Clearasil<00:03:00.770> balloons<00:03:01.770> from<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.550> boy

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.510 

I<00:03:13.790> hope<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.030> some<00:03:15.270> help
