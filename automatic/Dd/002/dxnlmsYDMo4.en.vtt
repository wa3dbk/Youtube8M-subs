however<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> can't<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.180> some<00:01:39.360> maniacal<00:01:40.079> head

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
however you can't get some maniacal head

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.010 
however you can't get some maniacal head
waggling<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.860> him<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
waggling and him just going like and the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.490 
waggling and him just going like and the
best<00:01:43.290> drugs<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.509> how<00:01:45.689> many<00:01:45.899> faces

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
best drugs I don't know how many faces

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.749 
best drugs I don't know how many faces
you<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.189> his<00:01:47.820> shoulders<00:01:48.450> are<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.759> problem

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you have but his shoulders are a problem

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 
you have but his shoulders are a problem
point<00:01:51.000> unfortunately<00:01:51.659> they<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.409> jointed

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
point unfortunately they are jointed

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.760 
point unfortunately they are jointed
exactly<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.399> Batman's<00:01:53.850> they've<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.420> this

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
exactly like Batman's they've got this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.130 
exactly like Batman's they've got this
joint<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:55.979> move<00:01:56.130> outwards<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
joint so they move outwards like this

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
joint so they move outwards like this
there's<00:01:58.140> no<00:01:58.280> cover<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.729> but<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.450> sculpt

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
there's no cover for them but the sculpt

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.170 
there's no cover for them but the sculpt
of<00:02:01.140> his<00:02:01.409> jacket<00:02:01.860> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.280> flows<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
of his jacket kind of flows with a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.069 
of his jacket kind of flows with a
little<00:02:03.540> bit<00:02:03.689> here

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
little bit here

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.280 
little bit here
however<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:05.310> looks<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.390> whole<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:07.049> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
however this looks a whole lot like a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.100 
however this looks a whole lot like a
shoulder<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.280> pieces<00:02:09.110> it's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
shoulder that's kind of in pieces it's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.370 
shoulder that's kind of in pieces it's
also<00:02:10.259> got<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> hinge<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.790> lot<00:02:12.170> easy

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
also got a hinge but it's a lot easy

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.660 
also got a hinge but it's a lot easy
to<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.680> start<00:02:13.830> moving<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.220> ball<00:02:14.400> joint

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
to just start moving the ball joint

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.010 
to just start moving the ball joint
around<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.450> want<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.690> try<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> bend

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
around and if you want to try to bend

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.180 
around and if you want to try to bend
the<00:02:16.170> hinge<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:16.800> put<00:02:16.980> some

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the hinge you have to really put some

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.670 
the hinge you have to really put some
focus<00:02:17.880> pressure<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.600> there<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.380> too<00:02:19.530> much

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
focus pressure in there but not too much

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.870 
focus pressure in there but not too much
pressure<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:20.220> then<00:02:20.370> you'll<00:02:20.520> pull<00:02:20.760> his

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
pressure because then you'll pull his

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030 
pressure because then you'll pull his
arm<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:22.050> Joker<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.860> one

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
arm off and this Joker is not the one

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.180 
arm off and this Joker is not the one
from<00:02:23.370> Mortal<00:02:23.700> Kombat<00:02:24.000> vs.<00:02:24.330> DC<00:02:25.010> which<00:02:26.010> will

his wrist joint is there but it's tricky
to<00:02:36.150> get<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> expressiveness<00:02:37.020> out<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.380> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
to get the expressiveness out of it you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.490 
to get the expressiveness out of it you

waist joint does have a decent range

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.750 
waist joint does have a decent range
though<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.020> you<00:03:01.080> can<00:03:01.290> accommodate<00:03:02.010> some

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
though so you can accommodate some

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.660 
though so you can accommodate some
posing<00:03:03.240> but<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.540> nearly<00:03:03.750> quite<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.320> deep

opposed as Batman can slip into his hips
are<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.840> believe<00:03:09.990> about<00:03:10.500> as<00:03:11.090> range<00:03:12.090> loaded<00:03:12.570> as

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
are I believe about as range loaded as

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.440 
are I believe about as range loaded as
Batman's<00:03:13.080> although<00:03:13.440> his<00:03:13.910> rubber<00:03:14.910> Underpants

are<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> lot<00:03:16.080> smaller<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.070> have<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> little

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
are a lot smaller so you have a little

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.110 
are a lot smaller so you have a little
bit<00:03:18.510> less<00:03:18.690> play<00:03:19.280> although<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.700> kind<00:03:21.030> of

bit less play although that kind of

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.760 
bit less play although that kind of

what<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.560> interesting<00:03:28.890> though<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.310> again

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
what is interesting though and again

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.820 
what is interesting though and again
what<00:03:29.790> makes<00:03:30.000> these<00:03:30.390> knees<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:31.140> me<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.530> just

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
what makes these knees to me so just

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.600 
what makes these knees to me so just
eccentric<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.850> odd<00:03:33.210> is<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:34.190> each<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.250> these

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
eccentric and odd is that each of these

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.640 
eccentric and odd is that each of these
knees<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> unique<00:03:36.540> piece<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.320> one's<00:03:37.500> been

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
knees is a unique piece this one's been

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.560 
knees is a unique piece this one's been
sculpted<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.310> pinstripe<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.240> one's<00:03:39.420> been

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
sculpted to be pinstripe this one's been

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.980 
sculpted to be pinstripe this one's been
sculpted<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.170> match<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.620> patch<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:41.400> knee

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
sculpted to match the patch on this knee

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.570 
sculpted to match the patch on this knee
they<00:03:42.990> even<00:03:43.260> managed<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.830> get<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.040> little<00:03:44.280> bit<00:03:44.490> of

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
they even managed to get a little bit of

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.090 
they even managed to get a little bit of
a<00:03:44.700> gradient<00:03:45.570> 'add<00:03:45.930> color<00:03:46.320> work<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.040> here

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
a gradient 'add color work going on here

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.410 
a gradient 'add color work going on here
whereas<00:03:47.430> over<00:03:47.550> here<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.880> feels<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.270> they

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
whereas over here it feels like they

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.390 
whereas over here it feels like they
couldn't<00:03:48.630> really<00:03:48.750> do<00:03:48.959> anything<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.470> suspect

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
couldn't really do anything I suspect

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.740 
couldn't really do anything I suspect
this<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.640> palm<00:03:51.000> plastic<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.570> might<00:03:51.720> be

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
this is palm plastic but I might be

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.170 
this is palm plastic but I might be
wrong<00:03:51.870> perhaps<00:03:52.170> its<00:03:52.410> abs<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:53.520> just<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:53.970> odd

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
wrong perhaps its abs it just it's odd

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.980 
wrong perhaps its abs it just it's odd
it's<00:03:54.510> like<00:03:54.920> these<00:03:55.920> knees<00:03:56.280> are<00:03:56.820> trying<00:03:57.510> very

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
it's like these knees are trying very

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.500 
it's like these knees are trying very
hard<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.470> take<00:03:58.920> part<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.490> what's<00:03:59.700> going<00:03:59.940> on<00:04:00.180> and

hard to take part in what's going on and

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.150 
hard to take part in what's going on and
you<00:04:01.230> know<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.590> look<00:04:01.740> at<00:04:01.830> them<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.040> go

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
you know you can look at them and go

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.070 
you know you can look at them and go
like<00:04:02.310> why<00:04:02.520> are<00:04:02.580> your<00:04:02.880> kneecaps<00:04:03.360> extending<00:04:03.959> to

the sculpting does kind of at least the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.550 
the sculpting does kind of at least the
color<00:04:42.660> work<00:04:42.900> kind<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.140> helps<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.350> little<00:04:43.410> bit

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560

color work kind of helps a little bit
the<00:04:43.650> sculpting<00:04:44.040> maybe<00:04:44.280> not<00:04:44.580> quite<00:04:44.910> as<00:04:45.180> much

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the sculpting maybe not quite as much

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.020 
the sculpting maybe not quite as much
and<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:46.260> does<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.650> know<00:04:46.740> look<00:04:46.920> like<00:04:47.040> his<00:04:47.280> pants

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
not much to do about that given the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.200 
not much to do about that given the
design<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.170> knees<00:04:52.730> his<00:04:53.730> ankles<00:04:54.150> are

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
design of the knees his ankles are

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.340 
design of the knees his ankles are
poseable<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.420> degree<00:04:57.780> but<00:04:57.990> really<00:04:58.200> they

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
poseable to a degree but really they

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.960 
poseable to a degree but really they
moreso<00:04:58.710> just<00:04:58.950> kind<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.160> slide<00:04:59.460> back<00:04:59.730> and<00:04:59.910> forth

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
moreso just kind of slide back and forth

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.300 
moreso just kind of slide back and forth
the<00:05:00.810> clicks<00:05:01.320> on<00:05:01.470> these<00:05:01.590> ankles<00:05:01.920> though<00:05:02.040> are<00:05:02.280> a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
the clicks on these ankles though are a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.520 
the clicks on these ankles though are a
bummer<00:05:02.670> because<00:05:02.910> it's<00:05:03.270> very<00:05:03.510> hard<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.140> get<00:05:04.320> him

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
bummer because it's very hard to get him

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.840 
bummer because it's very hard to get him
standing<00:05:04.950> they<00:05:05.070> often<00:05:05.370> want<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.640> click

a bit too much it's tricky of getting

a bit too much it's tricky of getting
him<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:13.980> stand<00:05:14.250> but<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.550> bigger<00:05:14.730> reason<00:05:15.150> why

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
him to stand but the bigger reason why

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.970 
him to stand but the bigger reason why
it's<00:05:15.510> tricky<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.810> get<00:05:15.930> him<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.110> stand<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.590> if

it's tricky to get him to stand is if

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.070 
it's tricky to get him to stand is if
you<00:05:17.070> look<00:05:17.220> at<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.370> shape<00:05:17.490> of<00:05:17.670> his<00:05:17.760> legs<00:05:18.080> his

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
you look at the shape of his legs his

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.700 
you look at the shape of his legs his
shins<00:05:19.590> are<00:05:19.800> actually<00:05:20.160> arched<00:05:20.880> like<00:05:21.150> this<00:05:21.710> both

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
shins are actually arched like this both

of<00:05:22.740> them<00:05:23.010> this<00:05:23.130> one<00:05:23.280> definitely<00:05:23.550> more<00:05:24.030> so<00:05:24.240> this

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
of them this one definitely more so this

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.740 
of them this one definitely more so this
makes<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:25.200> some<00:05:25.380> really<00:05:25.410> cool<00:05:25.860> postures<00:05:26.750> from

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
makes for some really cool postures from

makes for some really cool postures from
certain<00:05:28.080> angles<00:05:28.230> like<00:05:28.680> it<00:05:28.800> looks<00:05:29.280> really<00:05:29.370> neat

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
certain angles like it looks really neat

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.740

happened<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.230> him<00:05:34.460> again<00:05:35.460> this<00:05:35.610> is<00:05:35.940> something

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
happened to him again this is something

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.500 
happened to him again this is something
henna<00:05:36.410> it's<00:05:37.410> not<00:05:37.650> putting<00:05:38.430> me<00:05:38.550> off<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.940> toy<00:05:39.120> it

henna it's not putting me off the toy it
is<00:05:39.720> definitely<00:05:40.320> a<00:05:40.350> bit<00:05:40.560> of<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.710> con<00:05:40.950> in<00:05:41.910> terms<00:05:42.270> of

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
general stability it's it's just tricky

are large but the point of balance is
pretty<00:05:49.230> much<00:05:49.350> right<00:05:49.590> here<00:05:49.860> on<00:05:49.950> his<00:05:50.070> heels<00:05:50.370> so

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.670 
maintain balance too easily kind of have
to<00:05:59.550> get<00:05:59.730> used<00:06:00.540> to<00:06:00.660> how<00:06:00.840> this<00:06:01.020> guy<00:06:01.230> works<00:06:01.530> you

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
to get used to how this guy works you

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
bunch to get used to how his balance

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.700 
bunch to get used to how his balance
works<00:06:05.970> once<00:06:06.180> you<00:06:06.270> do<00:06:06.480> it's<00:06:07.050> not<00:06:07.230> too<00:06:07.440> bad<00:06:07.590> you

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
works once you do it's not too bad you

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.170 
works once you do it's not too bad you
can<00:06:07.740> also<00:06:07.920> bend<00:06:08.190> his<00:06:08.310> knees<00:06:08.490> slightly<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:09.150> make

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
his legs a little bit straighter

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.340 
his legs a little bit straighter
I<00:06:11.240> appreciate<00:06:12.240> what<00:06:12.270> they're<00:06:12.510> going<00:06:12.750> for<00:06:12.870> here

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
I appreciate what they're going for here

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.490 
I appreciate what they're going for here
in<00:06:14.310> practice<00:06:14.880> it's<00:06:15.390> definitely<00:06:15.900> going<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.200> put

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
in practice it's definitely going to put

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.560 
in practice it's definitely going to put
some<00:06:16.680> folks<00:06:16.920> off<00:06:17.070> of<00:06:17.250> the<00:06:17.340> figure<00:06:17.610> but<00:06:17.970> it's<00:06:18.480> an

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
some folks off of the figure but it's an

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.130 
some folks off of the figure but it's an
interesting<00:06:18.720> idea<00:06:19.700> I'm<00:06:20.700> glad<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:21.270> it's<00:06:21.540> only

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
interesting idea I'm glad that it's only

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.240 
interesting idea I'm glad that it's only
on<00:06:22.470> the<00:06:22.860> Joker<00:06:23.250> so<00:06:23.790> he's<00:06:24.570> poseable

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
on the Joker so he's poseable

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.770 
on the Joker so he's poseable
numerically<00:06:26.250> he's<00:06:26.520> more<00:06:27.120> or<00:06:27.150> less<00:06:27.330> on<00:06:27.510> par

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
numerically he's more or less on par

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.500 
numerically he's more or less on par
with<00:06:27.810> Batman<00:06:28.350> it's<00:06:29.190> just<00:06:29.460> that<00:06:29.670> the<00:06:29.820> range<00:06:30.090> of

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
with Batman it's just that the range of

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.460 
with Batman it's just that the range of
those<00:06:30.720> numbered<00:06:31.290> joints<00:06:31.830> are<00:06:32.010> not<00:06:32.430> quite<00:06:32.850> as

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
those numbered joints are not quite as

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.460 
those numbered joints are not quite as
deep<00:06:34.520> much<00:06:35.520> like<00:06:35.790> Batsy<00:06:36.360> the<00:06:36.660> Joker's<00:06:37.050> got<00:06:37.200> two

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
deep much like Batsy the Joker's got two

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.410 
deep much like Batsy the Joker's got two
alternate<00:06:37.920> hands<00:06:38.160> and<00:06:38.490> a<00:06:38.580> pair<00:06:38.820> of<00:06:38.850> things<00:06:39.240> to

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
he starts off with some very useful open

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.480 
he starts off with some very useful open
hands<00:06:42.780> but<00:06:43.230> the<00:06:43.350> right<00:06:43.530> hand<00:06:43.770> can<00:06:44.010> be<00:06:44.040> swapped

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
for one that very specifically can hold
