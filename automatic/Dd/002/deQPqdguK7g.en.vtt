00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.290
 in this laboratory are 20 years of research on araucaria angustifolia 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.240
 the tree symbol of the paraná the results of the companions works 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.240
 cloned are being celebrated by the Federal University of Parana with the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.390
 distribution of 4 thousand seedlings 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.739
 each one costs 1 real they are produced right here 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.869
 the coordination of studies and the professor flávio zanette 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 the idea is to form forests with pine trees of varied origins inform 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.419
 in this leaflet 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.820
 explains of the cycle of the pinion that during 36 months in the top of this tree the ribbons 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.269
 of different colors indicate a pollinating suns made in different years 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.850
 the actions 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.560
 will be harvested in 2008 and the yellow ones next year another achievement 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.190
 is in the success obtained with grafts 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.649
 The celebration also marks a new stage of research that is the 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.170
 diversification of seedlings 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.039
 is a campaign for the creation of a national management that brings together all 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.219
 surveys done in brazil on the real belt with that I'm sure 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.950
 that we will centralize with a database with all the information 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.970
 centralized so that the Brazilian authorities can do a good management 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.240
 of these 10 tata tree very important for Brazil especially for the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.540
 brazil is sara the stamp outside araucarias there are more than 300 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.170
 millions of years the species resisted the weather but not the devastation caused 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.250
 for the man 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.690
 of the eight million cars of araucaria forest areas in the parana today 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.540
 there are only 60,000 hectares less than 1% of the original state coverage as 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.270
 forests have given way to progress and extensive plantings of this map with the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.890
 blue dots indicate these remnants 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.840
 but unfortunately 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.740
 they are difficult to see for the director of the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.159
 wildlife is important for people and governments to be aware of 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.439
 of which it is not the pine that is in extinction 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.500
 but the preserved forests that have araucaria areas 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.220
 still in good condition has to be helped 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.790
 I am all society has to commit to doing
