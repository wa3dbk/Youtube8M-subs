00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.590
 Item No: SCP-147 Object class: Euclid 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.369
 Special Containment Procedures: The SCP-147 is not to be placed in the pseudo-1950's era 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.080
 Living room. The current container contains a throw carpet, two chairs, a phonograph, 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.579
 Rotor phone, and other suitable decorations. SCP-147 will reject any article dating from 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:34.170
 Later in late March 1965 (see Annex 0-40). Requires no external power source 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.520
 Or contact. 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.600
 Description: 1983 was discovered in a civilian house in Detroit, Michigan. It looks SCP-147 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:51.109
 To be 1957 GE brand black and white TV, model 17TO26. The SCP-147 has 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.750
 It is observed that it carries two different behaviors: 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.039
 Optimization: When SCP-147 is not acceptable in a room, it will display the broadcast from the 1950s era 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.390
 Comedy movies, such as Burns and Eline watching, Daddy knows best, and I love Lucy. in every 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.540
 The status of each broadcast was completely unique: archive software, none of them 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.940
 Still being produced, it has failed to find any record of episodes that plays SCP-147. 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.260
 No commercials are shown, and there is no indication of the station to be broadcast 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.180
 These programs. All radio stations are black and white. Topics exposed to SCP-147 in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.320
 An optimal condition reminded me of a pleasant feeling of relaxation. In this case, the size of the item 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.990
 Channels can be adjusted, although the exit switch seems to have had no effect. 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.830
 Reinforced: When there are modern-day elements present in the SCP-147 environment, this item will be only 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.580
 Extremely violent display and outrageous color footage; cutting heads, raping and execution, and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.260
 All have observed torture, but as of yet footage has been broadcast does not refer to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.320
 When or where I took scenes I photographed the place. Always high-optical footage and 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.170
 Sound quality. Subjects exposed to SCP-147 in his condition almost always vomit 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.810
 Due to the graphic nature of the broadcast after ten to fifteen seconds. One topic 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.260
 She suffered a nervous breakdown two minutes after exposure. Each theme has been shown to 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.740
 Extreme frequency to recall the contents of the broadcast, two fifteen 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.340
 Topics charged with hostile consideration SCP-147 for broadcasting since then committed suicide. nothing 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.110
 Controls the response element during hostile broadcasts. 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.940
 Attempts to examine the interior of the SCP-147 have not been successful, and shell the element 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.850
 Resists any attempt to eliminate it open. Put the item in the Faraday cage for order 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.420
 To deny any possible transmissions as it can be received has no effect. Effects 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.470
 The long-term exposure of SCP-147 was not documented. 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.430
 Addition: Any recreational activities involving SCP-147 will be held at least 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.069
 One week ago with the approval of the level of 4 individuals. 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:06.830
 Add [0-40]: Refer to the TC-147-B file for details. After [data write off] suggestion, 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.150
 Many of the things manufactured throughout the 1960s were brought in. Things made last 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.569
 March of 1965 led to aggressive behavior. Exactly difficult dating 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.569
 Because of the trouble of obtaining materials specifically made in testable dates and times. the reasons 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.170
 Why behave in a manner that depends on the date of a specific, unknown object, and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.430
 Being tested by [data write-off]. 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.099
 Addition [0-40a]: as has been repeatedly verified, the presence of persons born after March 1965 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:43.099
 Does not in itself lead to an event runner. For reasons still unknown, SCP-147 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.849
 Objects mainly to manufactured materials. Dr.. ███████ ███ مؤخرا recently 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.560
 An experiment was conducted in which he dressed himself with vintage (before 1965) materials 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.209
 Clothing, with the warning that he has three Peck Fleur pens (invented in the 1970s) at 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.290
 Pocket his shirt. What he saw while sitting in front of SCP-147, he later described 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.930
 As "a strange episode of Lucy loves featuring an amazing amount of about shooting." 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.599
 Addition [1-80]: Recent tests involving exposing convicted rapists and psychiatric patients 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.309
 To the object when indicated that it is hostile that the object is able to adapt images 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:27.259
 For the viewer. The rapist is bound to a metal chair manufactured in 1986, during 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.840
 That time was shown not rape one on the screen, while scenes of genital mutilation 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.419
 (Male in the first place) occurred frequently. Similarly, a mentally ill person had been tortured to death 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.130
 He saw less scenes of torture, and more scenes of failed execution.
