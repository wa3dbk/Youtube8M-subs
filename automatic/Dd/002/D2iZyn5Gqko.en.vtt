00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:31.960 

and<00:01:15.340> she's<00:01:15.940> ready<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.360> ride

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:02:08.680 

folding<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:33.050> big<00:01:33.230> fish<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.800> just<00:01:34.610> as<00:01:34.760> easy

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.509 

that's<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.929> you're<00:02:10.140> done<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:11.310> only<00:02:11.400> thing

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
that's it you're done and the only thing

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.660 
that's it you're done and the only thing
that<00:02:11.790> I'll<00:02:11.909> do<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:13.319> I'll<00:02:13.379> add<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.890> final<00:02:14.370> step

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
that I'll do is I'll add this final step

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.940 
that I'll do is I'll add this final step
of<00:02:14.849> mine<00:02:15.170> again<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.319> doesn't<00:02:16.560> come<00:02:16.799> with<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
of mine again this doesn't come with the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.680 
of mine again this doesn't come with the
bike<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.810> perhaps<00:02:19.549> big<00:02:20.549> fish<00:02:20.849> will<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
bike but perhaps big fish will in the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.319 
bike but perhaps big fish will in the
future<00:02:21.980> because<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:24.620> don't<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:26.970> have

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
future because I don't like to have

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.479 
future because I don't like to have
things<00:02:27.629> loose<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:30.650> can<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> potential

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
things loose it can be a potential

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.089 
things loose it can be a potential
problem<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.049> kind<00:02:34.379> of<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.530> jury-rigged

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
problem so this is kind of a jury-rigged

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.789 
problem so this is kind of a jury-rigged
but<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.690> use<00:02:36.690> these<00:02:36.989> velcro<00:02:38.540> ties<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.140> I

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
but I use these velcro ties and I

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.000 
but I use these velcro ties and I
finally<00:02:41.069> come<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:41.579> handy<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:43.620> flex<00:02:43.890> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
finally come in really handy they flex a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.369 
finally come in really handy they flex a
little<00:02:44.099> bit<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.819> they<00:02:45.660> still<00:02:45.870> keep<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.200> bike

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
little bit but they still keep the bike

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.199 
little bit but they still keep the bike
