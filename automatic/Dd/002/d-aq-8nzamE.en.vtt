00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
very dangerous and easy to die to when

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.609 
very dangerous and easy to die to when
you<00:01:59.520> fall<00:01:59.729> down<00:01:59.759> them<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.660> corruption<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.440> be

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you fall down them the corruption can be

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.670 
you fall down them the corruption can be
very<00:02:02.039> very<00:02:02.640> horrible<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:04.110> only<00:02:04.320> good<00:02:04.440> thing

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
very very horrible the only good thing

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.020 
very very horrible the only good thing
about<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.070> corruption<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.850> it's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
about the corruption is that it's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
about the corruption is that it's
somewhat<00:02:06.390> controllable<00:02:06.930> by<00:02:07.049> using

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
somewhat controllable by using

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.190 
somewhat controllable by using
sunflowers<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:08.820> guess<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.510> all<00:02:09.840> bad

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
sunflowers so I guess that's not all bad

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.479 
sunflowers so I guess that's not all bad
at<00:02:10.410> least<00:02:10.530> there's<00:02:10.739> some<00:02:10.950> good<00:02:11.190> thing<00:02:11.370> about

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
at least there's some good thing about

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.850 
at least there's some good thing about
it<00:02:12.920> number<00:02:13.920> two<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:16.140> Crimson<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.680> the

it number two the Crimson is the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.860 
it number two the Crimson is the
corruptions<00:02:17.340> brother<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.239> even<00:02:18.510> worse

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
corruptions brother and is even worse

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.960 
corruptions brother and is even worse
than<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.170> corruption<00:02:19.769> they've<00:02:20.459> got<00:02:20.730> very

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
than the corruption they've got very

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.640 
than the corruption they've got very
similar<00:02:21.239> monsters<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.019> corruption<00:02:22.320> but

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
similar monsters to the corruption but

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.590 
similar monsters to the corruption but
still<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.130> very<00:02:23.760> annoying<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> say<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.450> least

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600
