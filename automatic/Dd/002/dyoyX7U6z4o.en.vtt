if<00:00:00.240> I<00:00:00.359> want<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.630> make<00:00:00.780> my<00:00:00.930> loop<00:00:01.170> larger<00:00:03.290> you<00:00:04.290> see

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
if I want to make my loop larger you see

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.519 
if I want to make my loop larger you see
people<00:00:04.920> make<00:00:05.130> their<00:00:05.310> loop<00:00:05.520> larger<00:00:06.089> and

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
people make their loop larger and

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.620 
people make their loop larger and
they're<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:07.680> unquote<00:00:08.460> calling<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.269> Rope<00:00:09.450> out

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
they're not unquote calling the Rope out

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.209 
they're not unquote calling the Rope out
or<00:00:09.840> making<00:00:10.080> their<00:00:10.200> loop<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.559> March<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.950> start

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
or making their loop that March to start

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.930 
or making their loop that March to start
with<00:00:11.400> what<00:00:11.880> they're<00:00:12.059> doing<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.960> feeding

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
with what they're doing is just feeding

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.420 
with what they're doing is just feeding
feeding<00:00:14.940> their<00:00:15.330> rope<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.220> loop

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
feeding their rope so that the the loop

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.689 
feeding their rope so that the the loop
can<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.789> bigger<00:00:18.060> as<00:00:18.359> they're<00:00:18.810> roping<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
can get bigger as they're roping so that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.070 
can get bigger as they're roping so that
what<00:00:20.820> they're<00:00:20.970> doing<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.210> well<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.930> they're

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
what they're doing is well and they're

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
what they're doing is well and they're
on<00:00:22.199> their<00:00:22.350> forward<00:00:22.890> swing<00:00:23.250> their<00:00:24.119> forward

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
on their forward swing their forward

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.269 
on their forward swing their forward
swing<00:00:24.930> there's<00:00:25.439> their<00:00:25.680> feed<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:25.980> rope

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
swing there's their feed and rope

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.220 
swing there's their feed and rope
through<00:00:26.580> their<00:00:26.760> right<00:00:27.000> hand<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.630> letting<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
through their right hand and letting a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.839 
through their right hand and letting a
coil<00:00:28.500> maybe<00:00:28.740> come<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.220> their<00:00:29.310> left<00:00:29.490> hand

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
coil maybe come out of their left hand

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.080 
coil maybe come out of their left hand
so<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.380> rope<00:00:31.590> will<00:00:31.769> feed<00:00:32.040> through<00:00:32.430> their

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
so that the rope will feed through their

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170 
so that the rope will feed through their
hands<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.860> swing<00:00:35.280> forward<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:36.000> now

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
hands so on my swing forward here now

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.600 
hands so on my swing forward here now
I'm<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> feed<00:00:36.750> feed<00:00:37.739> rope<00:00:38.219> through<00:00:38.489> my

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
I'm going to feed feed rope through my

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.840 
I'm going to feed feed rope through my
hand<00:00:38.910> my<00:00:39.660> loops<00:00:39.930> getting<00:00:40.290> larger<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.370> using<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
hand my loops getting larger I'm using a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
hand my loops getting larger I'm using a
big<00:00:42.030> arm<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.540> big<00:00:42.719> swing<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.410> gonna<00:00:43.500> feed

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
big arm a big swing and I'm gonna feed

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.310 
big arm a big swing and I'm gonna feed
rope<00:00:44.070> through<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.399> hand<00:00:44.610> again<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.899> makes<00:00:46.079> my

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
rope through my hand again that makes my

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920 
rope through my hand again that makes my
loop<00:00:46.530> larger<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.270> feed<00:00:48.480> rope<00:00:48.719> through

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
loop larger and I can feed rope through

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
loop larger and I can feed rope through
my<00:00:49.050> hand<00:00:49.260> again<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.160> makes<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.579> loop

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
my hand again and that makes my loop

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.810 
my hand again and that makes my loop
even<00:00:50.969> larger<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.620> swing<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.579> loops

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
even larger so my swing is here my loops

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.180 
even larger so my swing is here my loops
getting<00:00:54.180> bigger<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:55.079> now<00:00:55.260> my<00:00:55.680> shot<00:00:55.949> didn't

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
getting bigger but now my shot didn't

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
getting bigger but now my shot didn't
present<00:00:56.340> itself<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> get

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
present itself there and I want to get

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.069 
present itself there and I want to get
it<00:00:58.620> smaller<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.550> pull<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.210> coil<00:01:00.899> back

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it smaller I can just pull a coil back

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.049 
it smaller I can just pull a coil back
up<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.309> maybe<00:01:02.550> even<00:01:02.699> another

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
up out of there and maybe even another

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.020 
up out of there and maybe even another
one<00:01:03.559> pulled<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:05.880> I'm

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
one pulled it right back up and now I'm

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
one pulled it right back up and now I'm
right<00:01:06.210> back<00:01:06.420> where<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.720> started<00:01:06.750> again<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.130> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
right back where I started again and I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.149 
right back where I started again and I
don't<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> figure<00:01:09.299> eight<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.570> loop<00:01:10.159> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
don't have a figure eight in my loop so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.789 
don't have a figure eight in my loop so
by<00:01:11.790> building<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.510> loops<00:01:12.750> start<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.320> that's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
by building your loops start with that's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
by building your loops start with that's
the<00:01:13.950> key<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.280> building<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.420> right<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the key to building it right here to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
the key to building it right here to
start<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.590> you're<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> beginner<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
start with if you're a beginner and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.670 
start with if you're a beginner and
haven't<00:01:18.150> built<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.479> loop<00:01:18.630> before<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> lot

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
haven't built a loop before it's a lot

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.300 
haven't built a loop before it's a lot
easier<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.850> build<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> method<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.280> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
easier to to build it the method we just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.920 
easier to to build it the method we just
showed<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:25.520> then<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.729> flop<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.630> here

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
showed you then then to flop it out here

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.569 
showed you then then to flop it out here
and<00:01:28.140> bring<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> under<00:01:28.890> your<00:01:29.070> wrists<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and bring it under your wrists and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.520 
and bring it under your wrists and
things<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.000> because<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> could

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
things like that because then it could

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.710 
things like that because then it could
throw<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> Hooley<00:01:32.759> or<00:01:33.060> throw<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> kink<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.689> your

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
throw a Hooley or throw a kink in your

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.770 
throw a Hooley or throw a kink in your
rope<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> figure<00:01:34.530> eight<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.390> once<00:01:36.390> again<00:01:36.540> I'm

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
rope or a figure eight so once again I'm

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
rope or a figure eight so once again I'm
going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> feed<00:01:37.409> rope<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.009> forward<00:01:38.280> swing

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
going to feed rope on my forward swing

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.140 
going to feed rope on my forward swing
forward<00:01:39.600> swing<00:01:39.990> forward<00:01:40.500> swing<00:01:40.979> feed<00:01:41.729> rope<00:01:42.000> on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
forward swing forward swing feed rope on

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.840 
forward swing forward swing feed rope on
my<00:01:42.299> forward<00:01:42.720> swing<00:01:43.020> make<00:01:43.770> my<00:01:43.950> loop<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.369> larger

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
my forward swing make my loop get larger

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.810 
my forward swing make my loop get larger
make<00:01:45.360> my<00:01:45.540> loop<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.869> larger<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.460> can

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
make my loop get larger and then I can

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.330 
make my loop get larger and then I can
go<00:01:48.240> ahead<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.570> grab<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> coil<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.979> left

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
go ahead and grab a coil here my left
