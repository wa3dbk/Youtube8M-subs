sandwiched<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.070> between<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.440> I<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.829> also

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
sandwiched in between it so I like also

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
sandwiched in between it so I like also
the<00:00:50.280> fact<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.760> included<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.449> chiller

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the fact that they included the chiller

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.819 
the fact that they included the chiller
amic<00:00:52.940> thermal<00:00:53.940> paste<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.050> chilling

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
amic thermal paste so it's a chilling

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.310 
amic thermal paste so it's a chilling
and<00:00:55.980> cool<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.670> made<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> nano

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and cool and made with the nano

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
and cool and made with the nano
particles<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.070> ceramic<00:00:59.489> nanoparticles<00:01:00.239> as

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so you have two choices on how you want

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.100 
so you have two choices on how you want
to<00:01:49.049> connect<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:50.000> here<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
to connect it now here it is with the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.260 
to connect it now here it is with the
fan<00:01:52.380> already<00:01:52.770> installed<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> that's<00:01:54.030> how<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
fan already installed and that's how it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.139 
fan already installed and that's how it
comes<00:01:54.500> sandwiched<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.740> between<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.969> can

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
comes sandwiched in between as you can

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.230 
comes sandwiched in between as you can
see<00:01:57.390> there's<00:01:58.320> these<00:01:58.799> brackets<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.030> can

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
see there's these brackets and you can

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.620 
see there's these brackets and you can
see<00:02:00.479> also<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.469> pipes<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:03.180> how<00:02:03.390> its

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
see also the pipes so that's how its

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.889 
see also the pipes so that's how its
held<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.990> place<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.560> underneath<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
held in place and underneath here you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.700 
held in place and underneath here you
can<00:02:06.899> take<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> look<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
can take a look at that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.390 
can take a look at that
solid<00:02:08.129> copper<00:02:08.580> base<00:02:08.819> very<00:02:09.830> smooth<00:02:10.830> machined

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
solid copper base very smooth machined

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
solid copper base very smooth machined
as<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.450> those<00:02:12.569> huge<00:02:12.959> pipes<00:02:13.319> those

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
as you can see in those huge pipes those

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.000 
as you can see in those huge pipes those
are

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
are

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160 
are
going<00:02:14.940> right<00:02:15.120> into<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.540> base<00:02:16.140> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
going right into that base that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.130 
going right into that base that
copper-based<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.700> um<00:02:18.090> pretty<00:02:18.750> impressive

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
copper-based so um pretty impressive

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.240 
copper-based so um pretty impressive
looking<00:02:19.640> CPU<00:02:20.640> cooler<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.690> here

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
looking CPU cooler as you can see here

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.309 
looking CPU cooler as you can see here
okay<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.610> got<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.849> pretty<00:02:24.090> wild<00:02:24.330> design

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
okay so it's got a pretty wild design

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.440 
okay so it's got a pretty wild design
underneath<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.700> would<00:02:26.879> think<00:02:26.909> just<00:02:27.330> by

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
underneath and you would think just by

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.270 
underneath and you would think just by
looking<00:02:27.780> at<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.349> there's<00:02:29.040> going<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.190> be

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
looking at that that there's going to be

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.119 
looking at that that there's going to be
some<00:02:29.489> serious<00:02:29.700> cooling<00:02:30.390> happening<00:02:30.810> here<00:02:31.129> and

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
some serious cooling happening here and

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.800 
some serious cooling happening here and
underneath<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.760> there's<00:02:33.030> some<00:02:33.269> screws<00:02:33.599> you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
underneath it there's some screws you

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.809 
underneath it there's some screws you
need<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.560> able<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.830> access<00:02:35.010> those<00:02:35.489> screws

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
need to be able to access those screws

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.110 
need to be able to access those screws
to<00:02:36.000> fasten<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:37.700> hardware<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.910> comes

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
to fasten the hardware that it comes

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.050 
to fasten the hardware that it comes
with<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.660> brackets<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.799> your<00:02:41.129> cooler<00:02:41.549> okay<00:02:42.000> so

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
with the brackets to your cooler okay so

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.119 
with the brackets to your cooler okay so
I'll<00:02:42.269> talk<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.079> second<00:02:43.470> here's

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
I'll talk about that in a second here's

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.910 
I'll talk about that in a second here's
the<00:02:44.370> four<00:02:44.940> pin<00:02:45.150> power<00:02:45.420> connector<00:02:45.569> for<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.200> for

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the four pin power connector for the for

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.400 
the four pin power connector for the for
the<00:02:47.010> fan<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.310> course<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.810> let's<00:02:48.989> go<00:02:49.110> ahead<00:02:49.200> and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the fan of course so let's go ahead and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.220 
the fan of course so let's go ahead and
review<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.220> installation<00:02:50.930> basically<00:02:51.930> you've

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
review the installation basically you've

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.339 
review the installation basically you've
got<00:02:52.260> your<00:02:52.620> fan<00:02:52.859> right<00:02:53.510> inside<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.019> got<00:02:55.230> to

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
got your fan right inside you got to

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.020 
got your fan right inside you got to
take<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.680> out<00:02:55.799> right<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.549> comes<00:02:56.790> with<00:02:56.940> these

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
take it out right so it comes with these

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.150 
take it out right so it comes with these
clips<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.170> got<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.379> take<00:02:58.530> out<00:02:58.650> those<00:02:58.829> clips

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
clips so you got to take out those clips

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.940 
clips so you got to take out those clips
and<00:02:59.340> take<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.030> fan<00:03:00.359> in<00:03:00.629> order<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.470> install

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
and take out the fan in order to install

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.089 
and take out the fan in order to install
the<00:03:02.459> cooler<00:03:02.849> so<00:03:03.359> that's<00:03:03.989> how<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.319> install<00:03:04.620> it

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
the cooler so that's how you install it

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.580 
the cooler so that's how you install it
first<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.940> take<00:03:06.150> out<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.420> fan<00:03:06.660> you've<00:03:07.410> got

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
first you take out the fan you've got

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.680 
first you take out the fan you've got
those<00:03:07.769> two<00:03:07.829> screws<00:03:08.400> there<00:03:08.700> then<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.420> look<00:03:09.599> at

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
those two screws there then you look at

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.210 
those two screws there then you look at
the<00:03:09.810> manual<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.410> then<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.620> figure<00:03:10.920> out<00:03:10.950> okay

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
the manual and then you figure out okay

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.830 
the manual and then you figure out okay
what<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.609> hardware<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.150> need<00:03:12.359> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
what is the hardware that you need to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.369 
what is the hardware that you need to
install<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.849> tell<00:03:14.849> CPU<00:03:15.390> or<00:03:15.660> an<00:03:16.170> N

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
install it on and in tell CPU or an N

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.890 
install it on and in tell CPU or an N
AMD<00:03:17.190> CPU<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:17.940> depends<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.480> CPU<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
AMD CPU so it depends on the CPU the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.479 
AMD CPU so it depends on the CPU the
type<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.319> hardware<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.069> need<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.310> use

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
type of hardware that you need to use

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.909 
type of hardware that you need to use
that<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.819> comes<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.319> so<00:03:22.319> once<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.650> figured

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
that it comes with so once you figured

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.589 
that it comes with so once you figured
out<00:03:23.010> what<00:03:23.340> CP<00:03:23.639> you've<00:03:23.819> got<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.389> follow

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
out what CP you've got and you follow

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.909 
out what CP you've got and you follow
the<00:03:24.720> instructions<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.349> install<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.799> and

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
the instructions to install it and

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.129 
the instructions to install it and
you've<00:03:26.430> accessed<00:03:26.910> those<00:03:27.090> two<00:03:27.329> screws<00:03:27.720> which

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
you've accessed those two screws which

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.379 
you've accessed those two screws which
you<00:03:28.349> need<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.769> with<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> long<00:03:29.579> screwdriver<00:03:29.940> so

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
you need to with a long screwdriver so

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.800 
you need to with a long screwdriver so
you<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.660> fasten<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.500> on<00:03:31.910> then<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.329> next<00:03:33.630> step

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
you can fasten it on then the next step

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.800 
you can fasten it on then the next step
is<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.200> put<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.410> fan<00:03:34.769> back<00:03:35.069> of<00:03:35.310> course<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.269> when

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
is to put the fan back of course so when

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.140 
is to put the fan back of course so when
you<00:03:36.900> put<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.169> fan<00:03:37.380> back<00:03:37.730> you've<00:03:38.730> got<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.060> get

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
you put the fan back you've got to get

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.629 
you put the fan back you've got to get
those<00:03:39.329> clips<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:41.010> comes<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.430> and

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
those clips that it comes with and

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.780 
those clips that it comes with and
attach<00:03:42.000> them<00:03:42.299> back<00:03:42.569> on<00:03:42.870> either<00:03:43.530> end<00:03:43.919> okay<00:03:44.730> so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
attach them back on either end okay so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.120 
attach them back on either end okay so
first<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.269> line<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.989> fan<00:03:46.470> back<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:46.950> there

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
first you line the fan back in there

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.680 
first you line the fan back in there
make<00:03:47.340> sure<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.669> airflow<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.180> pointing<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.630> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
make sure the airflow is pointing in the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.559 
make sure the airflow is pointing in the
right<00:03:48.810> direction<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.380> course<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:51.389> then

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
attach those two clips that I talked

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.629 
attach those two clips that I talked
about<00:03:53.430> here<00:03:53.720> alright<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.900> those<00:03:55.829> clips<00:03:56.250> then

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
about here alright and those clips then

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.309 
about here alright and those clips then
are<00:03:56.940> going<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.329> attach<00:03:57.660> themselves<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
are going to attach themselves to the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.970 
are going to attach themselves to the
fan

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
fan

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.460 
fan
alright<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.060> then<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.540> how<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.840> fan<00:04:01.139> gets

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
alright and then that's how the fan gets

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.069 
alright and then that's how the fan gets
held<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:02.010> place<00:04:02.299> okay<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:03.989> basically

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
held in place okay so that's basically

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.470 
held in place okay so that's basically
how<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.709> install<00:04:05.129> this<00:04:05.970> CPU<00:04:06.750> cooler<00:04:07.079> now<00:04:07.470> I've

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
how you install this CPU cooler now I've

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.879 
how you install this CPU cooler now I've
run<00:04:09.480> this<00:04:09.690> test<00:04:09.959> system<00:04:10.349> that<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.590> can<00:04:10.739> see

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
run this test system that you can see

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.000 
run this test system that you can see
here<00:04:11.220> with<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.489> previous<00:04:12.150> cooler<00:04:12.900> from<00:04:13.590> glacial

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
here with a previous cooler from glacial

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.550 
here with a previous cooler from glacial
tech<00:04:14.400> now<00:04:15.000> what<00:04:15.629> we're<00:04:15.750> trying<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.989> do<00:04:16.139> here<00:04:16.410> is

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
tech now what we're trying to do here is

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.259 
tech now what we're trying to do here is
unlock<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.340> four<00:04:17.609> cores<00:04:17.940> from<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.229> Phenom<00:04:19.680> to

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
unlock the four cores from the Phenom to

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.649 
unlock the four cores from the Phenom to
555<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.539> I've<00:04:21.660> got<00:04:21.870> here<00:04:22.229> in<00:04:22.380> Windows<00:04:22.800> 7<00:04:23.159> and

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
555 that I've got here in Windows 7 and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.540 
555 that I've got here in Windows 7 and
run<00:04:24.659> the<00:04:24.810> voltage<00:04:25.169> up<00:04:25.349> to<00:04:25.380> 1.4<00:04:26.039> volt<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.460> it's

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
run the voltage up to 1.4 volt so it's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.800 
run the voltage up to 1.4 volt so it's
very<00:04:26.789> high<00:04:27.000> voltage<00:04:27.479> here

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
very high voltage here

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.330 
very high voltage here
as<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.110> see<00:04:28.350> four<00:04:29.130> cores<00:04:29.520> unlocked<00:04:30.450> and

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
as you can see four cores unlocked and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.290 
as you can see four cores unlocked and
at<00:04:32.340> 3.6<00:04:32.940> gigahertz<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:34.290> basically<00:04:35.070> 36<00:04:35.940> degrees

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
at 3.6 gigahertz so basically 36 degrees

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.480 
at 3.6 gigahertz so basically 36 degrees

so definitely it makes a difference to

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.120 
so definitely it makes a difference to
get<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.510> CPU<00:05:16.050> cooler<00:05:16.320> like<00:05:16.620> this<00:05:16.830> when<00:05:17.040> you're

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
get a CPU cooler like this when you're

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.610 
get a CPU cooler like this when you're
