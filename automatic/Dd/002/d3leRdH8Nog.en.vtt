00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you're skiing this boot you might be

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.639 
you're skiing this boot you might be
more<00:00:54.059> prone<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> hiking<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> might<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
more prone to hiking so you might want a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.229 
more prone to hiking so you might want a
little<00:00:55.800> more<00:00:55.920> room<00:00:55.980> let's<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.550> back<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.090> this

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
little more room let's go back so this

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.599 
little more room let's go back so this
gives<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.890> 101<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.039> definitely<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.430> too

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
gives it to 101 it's definitely not too

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.189 
gives it to 101 it's definitely not too
wide<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.090> still<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.539> performance

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
wide it's still gonna be performance

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
wide it's still gonna be performance
orientated<00:01:01.800> give<00:01:01.949> me<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> nice<00:01:02.280> secure<00:01:02.699> stuff

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
orientated give me a nice secure stuff

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.980 
orientated give me a nice secure stuff
it<00:01:04.790> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.909> look<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> boots<00:01:06.360> unique<00:01:06.780> it's

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it if you look at the boots unique it's

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.630 
it if you look at the boots unique it's
got<00:01:07.110> three<00:01:07.439> micro<00:01:08.130> adjustable<00:01:08.400> aluminum

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
got three micro adjustable aluminum

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.810 
got three micro adjustable aluminum
buckles<00:01:09.500> three<00:01:10.500> buckles<00:01:10.920> oops<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> weight

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
buckles three buckles oops on the weight

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820 
buckles three buckles oops on the weight
buckles<00:01:12.360> weigh<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> boot<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.710> we

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
buckles weigh a lot on a boot so if we

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
buckles weigh a lot on a boot so if we
only<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.130> three<00:01:14.280> buckles<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> weighs<00:01:15.479> less

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
only have three buckles the weighs less

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.429 
only have three buckles the weighs less
therefore<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.470> easier<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.920> hike<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.900> as<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
therefore it's easier to hike in as you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
therefore it's easier to hike in as you
can<00:01:19.560> notice<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> top<00:01:20.250> buckle<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> mega

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
can notice the top buckle is a mega

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 
can notice the top buckle is a mega
oversized<00:01:21.600> buckle<00:01:21.960> too<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> does<00:01:22.799> have

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
oversized buckle too so it does have

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.670 
oversized buckle too so it does have
more<00:01:23.520> coverage<00:01:23.970> than<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.299> traditional<00:01:24.680> buckle

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
more coverage than a traditional buckle

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.620 
more coverage than a traditional buckle
and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> power<00:01:26.340> strap<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.090> 45

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and then the power strap is that 45

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
and then the power strap is that 45
millimeters<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.470> oversize<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
millimeters so it's oversize to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.609 
millimeters so it's oversize to
compensate<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.180> only<00:01:30.360> having<00:01:30.780> three<00:01:30.990> buckles

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
compensate for only having three buckles

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.050 
compensate for only having three buckles
the<00:01:34.619> micro<00:01:34.950> adjustability<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.670> buckles

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the micro adjustability of the buckles

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260 
the micro adjustability of the buckles
allows<00:01:36.420> us<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:36.930> fine-tune<00:01:37.579> our<00:01:38.579> fit<00:01:39.180> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
allows us to really fine-tune our fit of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060 
allows us to really fine-tune our fit of
our<00:01:39.390> boot<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:40.470> we're<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.920> tuned

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
our boot if we're going to be tuned

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
our boot if we're going to be tuned
catches<00:01:41.490> once<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> type<00:01:42.090> once<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> loose<00:01:42.689> we

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
catches once you type once to loose we

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
catches once you type once to loose we
can<00:01:42.990> spend<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:43.590> buffaloes<00:01:44.040> 360<00:01:44.759> degrees<00:01:45.090> in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
can spend these buffaloes 360 degrees in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.200 
can spend these buffaloes 360 degrees in
any<00:01:45.570> way<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.310> they<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.430> screw<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.060> out

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
any way and they will screw in and out

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
any way and they will screw in and out
there<00:01:48.540> before<00:01:48.840> giving<00:01:49.140> us<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> perfect<00:01:49.829> fit

there before giving us the perfect fit

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950

so we're not putting undue pressure down

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.110 
so we're not putting undue pressure down

knees our skis sit nice and flat we're
not<00:02:16.770> catching<00:02:16.950> our<00:02:17.160> edges<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.270> ski

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
not catching our edges and we can ski

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.750 
not catching our edges and we can ski
longer<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.260> more<00:02:19.410> comfortably<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.190> day<00:02:20.460> long

longer and more comfortably all day long

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.320 
longer and more comfortably all day long
we've<00:02:21.720> got<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.960> quick<00:02:22.620> adjust<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.090> top

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
we've got a quick adjust here on the top

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.740 
we've got a quick adjust here on the top
cuff<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.530> catch<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.610> allows<00:02:26.970> us<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.390> how

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
cuff that catch so that allows us to how

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.290 
cuff that catch so that allows us to how
many<00:02:27.810> different<00:02:28.020> volumes<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:29.300> it's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
many different volumes I have it's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.660 
many different volumes I have it's
toolless<00:02:30.990> so<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.440> quick<00:02:31.680> easy<00:02:31.890> leap

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
toolless so it's quick easy leap

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.150 
toolless so it's quick easy leap
adjustable<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> vine<00:02:34.440> ejected<00:02:34.890> style

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
adjustable this is a vine ejected style

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.890 
adjustable this is a vine ejected style
so<00:02:35.430> we've<00:02:35.610> got<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.910> clear<00:02:36.180> material<00:02:36.360> which<00:02:36.750> is

so we've got the clear material which is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.920 
so we've got the clear material which is
softer<00:02:37.320> light<00:02:37.530> mature<00:02:37.740> which<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> different

stare<00:02:39.930> absent<00:02:40.530> clear<00:02:40.890> material<00:02:41.040> stiffer

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
stare absent clear material stiffer

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.840

black material softer on this boot sorry

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.820 
black material softer on this boot sorry
that<00:02:44.850> allows<00:02:45.150> us<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:46.320> able<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.500> open<00:02:46.770> up

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
that allows us to be able to open up

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.890 
that allows us to be able to open up
throw<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.250> boot<00:02:47.460> get<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.790> much<00:02:48.000> easier<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
cops also a little softer so it's easier

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.050 
cops also a little softer so it's easier

to walk or hiking
speaking<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.180> which<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.080> look<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
speaking of which if you look at the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.710 
speaking of which if you look at the
back<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.800> food<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.550> has<00:02:56.970> what<00:02:57.270> solomon

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
back of this food it has what solomon

calls<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.230> ride<00:02:59.190> hike<00:02:59.550> feature<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:00.480> flip

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
calls a ride hike feature so we flip

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:12.260 
calls a ride hike feature so we flip
this<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.160> we<00:03:11.280> flip<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.640> lever<00:03:11.820> up<00:03:12.090> on

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
this up so if we flip the lever up on

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.760 
this up so if we flip the lever up on
the<00:03:12.390> back<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.750> boot<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.200> allows<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.560> cuff

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
the back of the boot it allows the cuff

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.830 
the back of the boot it allows the cuff
to<00:03:13.950> come<00:03:14.130> back<00:03:14.370> therefore<00:03:15.239> it's<00:03:15.360> easier<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
to come back therefore it's easier to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.610 
to come back therefore it's easier to
ride<00:03:16.110> or<00:03:16.500> hike<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:17.190> or<00:03:17.640> skin<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.360> if<00:03:19.080> we<00:03:19.260> flip<00:03:19.470> it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
ride or hike in or skin in if we flip it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.040 
ride or hike in or skin in if we flip it
down<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.940> flip<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.330> forward<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.690> hear<00:03:21.930> that

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
down you flip it forward you hear that

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.470 
down you flip it forward you hear that
lock<00:03:22.320> now<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> cup<00:03:23.190> cannot<00:03:23.730> come<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
look at the sole of the boot we've got

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.930 
look at the sole of the boot we've got
the<00:03:31.230> red<00:03:31.440> soles<00:03:32.070> are<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> little<00:03:32.430> bit<00:03:32.610> grip<00:03:32.790> here

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
the red soles are a little bit grip here

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.630 
the red soles are a little bit grip here
on<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.180> boot<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.630> also<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.950> between<00:03:35.100> you

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
on this boot and also in between you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.280 
on this boot and also in between you
notice<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.090> red<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.390> black<00:03:36.630> material<00:03:37.170> this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
notice this red and black material this

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.140 
notice this red and black material this
is<00:03:37.350> actually<00:03:37.769> rubber<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.400> between<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.940> sole

is actually rubber in between the sole

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.640 
is actually rubber in between the sole
so<00:03:39.390> sold<00:03:39.630> themselves<00:03:39.780> are<00:03:40.230> not<00:03:40.380> rubber

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
so sold themselves are not rubber

fence<00:04:13.459> up<00:04:13.610> hot<00:04:13.970> moisture<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:15.020> allows<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:15.530> to

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
fence up hot moisture so it allows it to

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.259 
fence up hot moisture so it allows it to
come<00:04:15.770> up<00:04:15.950> through<00:04:16.400> these<00:04:16.549> vents<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.030> top

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
come up through these vents in the top

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.800 
come up through these vents in the top

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
of the liner that featured on all sides

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.740 
of the liner that featured on all sides
so<00:04:21.140> that<00:04:21.290> allows<00:04:21.769> that<00:04:21.919> hot<00:04:22.160> moisture<00:04:22.760> hot<00:04:23.540> air

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
so that allows that hot moisture hot air

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.810 
so that allows that hot moisture hot air
to<00:04:23.870> come<00:04:23.990> up<00:04:24.169> evaporate<00:04:24.980> so<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.400> doesn't<00:04:25.669> sit

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
to come up evaporate so it doesn't sit
