00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
with that interception for the touchdown

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.990

to<00:01:48.460> seal<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.850> music<00:01:49.840> he's<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> great<00:01:50.170> player<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:51.549> I

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
to seal it music he's a great player I I

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.520 
to seal it music he's a great player I I
thought<00:01:52.420> also<00:01:52.659> when<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.170> guys<00:01:53.290> were<00:01:53.470> in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
thought also when you guys were in

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.139 
thought also when you guys were in
passing<00:01:53.920> situations<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.549> get<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> lot<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.880> time

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
passing situations you get a lot of time

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.520 
passing situations you get a lot of time
to<00:01:55.329> work<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.689> pocket<00:01:56.049> there<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:56.439> then

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
to work in the pocket there and then

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.840 
to work in the pocket there and then
when<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.770> did<00:01:56.890> collapse<00:01:57.070> you're<00:01:57.399> able<00:01:57.579> to<00:01:57.700> make

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
when it did collapse you're able to make

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.880 
when it did collapse you're able to make
plays<00:01:58.060> just<00:01:58.810> talking<00:01:59.049> about<00:01:59.079> that<00:01:59.530> offensive

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
plays just talking about that offensive

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.260 
plays just talking about that offensive
line<00:02:00.040> again<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.610> what<00:02:00.759> they<00:02:00.880> were<00:02:00.969> able<00:02:01.000> to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
line again and what they were able to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.910 
line again and what they were able to
accomplish<00:02:01.930> for<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.439> tonight<00:02:02.619> against

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
accomplish for you here tonight against

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.039 
accomplish for you here tonight against
a<00:02:03.070> pretty<00:02:03.399> good<00:02:03.549> way<00:02:03.640> with<00:02:03.820> defense<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.390> think

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
a pretty good way with defense I think

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.359 
a pretty good way with defense I think
they<00:02:05.170> really<00:02:05.409> held<00:02:05.590> them<00:02:05.740> off<00:02:05.890> when<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.340> was

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
they really held them off when I was

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.400 
they really held them off when I was
passing<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.939> had<00:02:07.090> all<00:02:07.270> time<00:02:07.509> all<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.960> time<00:02:07.990> in

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
passing I had all time all the time in

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.260
