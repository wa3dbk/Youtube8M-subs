win there at the end and just came up a
little<00:06:49.180> short<00:06:49.300> you<00:06:49.720> put<00:06:50.140> in<00:06:50.230> perspective<00:06:50.410> the

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
little short you put in perspective the

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.160 
little short you put in perspective the
strides<00:06:51.490> that<00:06:51.910> this<00:06:52.060> organization<00:06:52.450> has<00:06:52.780> made

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
strides that this organization has made

in<00:06:53.350> a<00:06:53.440> year's<00:06:53.650> time<00:06:54.060> it's<00:06:55.060> pretty<00:06:55.210> hard<00:06:55.450> to<00:06:55.510> put

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
in a year's time it's pretty hard to put

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.910 
in a year's time it's pretty hard to put
it<00:06:55.750> into<00:06:55.870> perspective<00:06:56.020> just<00:06:56.560> for<00:06:56.680> the<00:06:56.740> fact

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
it into perspective just for the fact

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.000 
it into perspective just for the fact
that<00:06:57.270> you<00:06:58.270> know<00:06:58.390> last<00:06:58.630> year<00:06:58.780> we<00:06:58.900> were<00:06:59.170> at<00:06:59.500> best

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
that you know last year we were at best

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.700

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
a mid-pack car on a good day and you

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.750 
a mid-pack car on a good day and you
know<00:07:02.800> this<00:07:02.950> was<00:07:03.100> kind<00:07:03.250> of<00:07:03.370> the<00:07:03.460> turnaround

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
know this was kind of the turnaround

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.159 
know this was kind of the turnaround
where<00:07:04.060> it<00:07:04.120> started<00:07:04.419> last<00:07:04.570> year<00:07:04.840> where<00:07:04.960> we<00:07:05.050> got

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
where it started last year where we got

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.200 
where it started last year where we got
our<00:07:05.260> new<00:07:05.410> cars<00:07:05.650> and<00:07:05.980> you<00:07:06.820> know<00:07:06.910> even<00:07:07.060> today

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
our new cars and you know even today

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.700 
our new cars and you know even today
we'd<00:07:07.660> like<00:07:07.780> I<00:07:07.870> say<00:07:08.020> we<00:07:08.140> have<00:07:08.230> a<00:07:08.260> top<00:07:08.470> five<00:07:08.680> car

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
we'd like I say we have a top five car

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.770 
we'd like I say we have a top five car
but<00:07:09.550> we<00:07:09.610> had<00:07:09.730> a<00:07:09.760> car<00:07:10.000> that<00:07:10.030> was<00:07:10.270> capable<00:07:10.720> of

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
but we had a car that was capable of

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.360 
but we had a car that was capable of
winning<00:07:10.900> at<00:07:11.140> the<00:07:11.230> end<00:07:11.380> because<00:07:11.710> we<00:07:12.160> took<00:07:12.310> a

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
winning at the end because we took a

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.159 
winning at the end because we took a
chance<00:07:12.640> and<00:07:12.880> were<00:07:13.030> able<00:07:13.180> to<00:07:13.300> run<00:07:13.720> fast<00:07:14.020> enough

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
chance and were able to run fast enough

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.250 
chance and were able to run fast enough
to<00:07:14.470> have<00:07:14.770> a<00:07:14.800> chance<00:07:15.100> so<00:07:15.720> with<00:07:16.720> our<00:07:16.840> cars<00:07:17.050> last

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260 
to have a chance so with our cars last

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.510 
to have a chance so with our cars last
year<00:07:17.440> we<00:07:17.530> couldn't<00:07:17.800> even<00:07:17.980> take<00:07:18.130> that<00:07:18.310> chance

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
year we couldn't even take that chance

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.860 
year we couldn't even take that chance
because<00:07:18.640> they<00:07:18.940> weren't<00:07:19.060> fast<00:07:19.270> enough<00:07:19.390> we<00:07:19.630> wind

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870
