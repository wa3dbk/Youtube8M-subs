00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.959
 Ah lead 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:18.619
 I'm 27 years old . I've been working hard all my life. 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:22.849
 I never thought I'd done my castle. 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:26.029
 I always just do as much as I do 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.380
 I live on my body properly. 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.460
 What can I do to improve the temperature of my life of beauty and mellow up to complete combustion 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.510
 Would it be 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.900
 Regardless of the result , I would like to feel this feeling by doing my best. 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.260
 How can I make myself a living person? 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.280
 Could I have the feeling that I am a person who works on the pancreas ? 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.650
 I have never been so hard to remember, so now I 'm ready to work 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.309
 I'm more anxious and scared 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.309
 I was hit hard 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.920
 Uh, we 're talking about a planet now. 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:05.770
 All the efforts are like that of other countries, 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.460
 I have a hard time trying to detect it, but I think it's a futile effort. 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.320
 Maybe there's a time to make that feeling. 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.760
 uh 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.380
 If you really do something in our society it is something spoilage or one end 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.890
 It became a society that felt very important, and then I saw a philosopher's words 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.120
 Bilmyeon not have time to self-development 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.480
 This expression of being in the self- era is something that some philosopher 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.220
 You were there, but you have a government . It's very much the same. 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.790
 The important thing is we've These well everything I really give us the second 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.690
 What second thing I asked for 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.750
 I'm in kindergarten. The sea ​​is seven years old. 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.750
 Ah 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:56.370
 The second was playing in that kindergarten . 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:01.590
 But there are only two of those 100 people out of the sea ​​that I certainly can not . 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:05.370
 One of the body's happening now do one child, two thought again of those four girls 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.270
 It's just a woman's door. 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.770
 Some of our second wife is precious. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.460
 I do not know what you said. 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.770
 I can not live it all. 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.770
 How old's why I'm going to fight abroad deserve 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:34.690
 It's also not good and so Can I haejwodo 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:40.510
 So it gave me something to write as his semi-hard Micky Announcements 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:43.650
 What are the plainclothes books are burnt throat tuna cake ah write one knowing 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.470
 He was in the early education room. 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.950
 So this is a politics thing. 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.950
 I heard 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.700
 Amun 3 3 Lege 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:04.940
 I do not know if it 's true, but I was happy to say that he was not an ex-girl. 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:08.390
 And, uh, you have 10% to do that too . 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:13.220
 There are a lot of them, but the subject is inferiority, 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:17.390
 I do not think there will be any people who are free from the problem after it is opened . 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.750
 I do not think this judgment has an inferiority and pathological inferiority sense. 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.390
 When the people of more than nine won first prize compelled to conclude such an inferiority complex about not 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.900
 It 's incredibly ridiculous. 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.740
 We feel like we are not doing the secret and how we are doing apostasy. 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.690
 When itjyo no choice but to live in a three room geokkuri But some feel a sense of inferiority 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.400
 Dare not be bad because 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:42.020
 Is because strengths than I have to concentrate because of an inferiority complex 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.560
 Some sense of the second is that I accept that those parts are inferior, 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.630
 I am not trying to do such a good job as a company, 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.450
 Trying to compensate for inferiority. 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.830
 Even though it is said that universal inferiority 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.460
 If you say that the keys are small, 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.060
 Accepting what I study hard so hard to exercise 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.640
 Well, first of all , I think a little bit , so I can raise my confidence. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.690
 I did not have an abs to try and keep it. 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:17.280
 Mask 0.1, etc. per country because I am such that heat is the existence useless 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.960
 I think it is incompetent and difficult to deny the entire purchase of my politics 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.090
 What a public dare. 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.190
 So why do people hate or reject me 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.420
 What I'm thinking is that some soldiers go 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.680
 So all the energy of man develops by finding his own strengths 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:38.670
 Not passing it self trying to get some thing obscure in any way or towards the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:44.070
 That this will continue to be a problem 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:48.540
 It's the moon I tried, no matter how hard I tried, 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.490
 The parts were able to work harder than halfway, but no matter how the thumb works 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.919
 Would you like to be a singer 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:59.099
 Yes , there are not many, so many of you. 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.990
 We recognize and accept that we can not live it all , 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.620
 You can not be lazy. 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.169
 I need some more painful parts and I need a transfer. 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.520
 The important thing is the big lazy, 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:15.750
 Inde very important to find out the health that you can do well by buying 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.389
 In other words , where there is a minimum resistance flowing into you where you can go 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.180
 I'm attracted to finding something . 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:26.210
 4 How do you know that? 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.990
 One of the reasons he does not know her feelings windows 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:35.240
 I 'm going to make an external comparison now . 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.940
 If you ever do that to find out it did not win and maintain the master to seek 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.650
 We can not define talents as late if we do, but 3000 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:47.090
 If there is a weakness among the four won their strengths guess four won so much more 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:50.750
 I sing only grow what one heard anything and I can enjoy itguyo 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.680
 So what if I worry a little more about what I do well ? 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.130
 I did. 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.810
 Keep your brain pressed for life 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:03.890
 I'll give you the answer. So I keep on my lap. 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:08.090
 If I Ramie do you want me to continue pressing for answers to life comes along asking geureongeo 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:12.620
 When I try to put it itjyo number of cases not giving an answer to continue the water 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.090
 Even if he fails in the pole did not experience such a division it's actually good 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.530
 You did not know. 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:22.190
 A little bit of what I am trying to do is decorate the jewelry and get me a bag with the same 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:26.000
 Also the efforts in some areas, but because not many tell me this again 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:30.170
 I'm looking for some other alternatives, but this is not right for me. 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.530
 If you find out more about what is good for me or what is good, 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.910
 So the story I'd like to share with you is 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:40.100
 You are more than any other resource I have . 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.940
 I am worried about what is good 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.810
 Uh, so there's a lot of people in their teens and twenties. 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:51.650
 20 What's not to get a larger product being a bit negative for the two 20 should be for sure 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:54.680
 Things that I think I have a sense of ownership of life as it did earlier talk 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.040
 Uh longer that 100 secondary cheat sheets anjimanyo bowled 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.720
 I caught the drivers. 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:05.920
 It is the second time that I am training in Saururus and what I am going to do 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.290
 What the late 20s through the various games that have some degree of trial and error 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:13.030
 Parts can be arranged 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:18.690
 So that I can not easily get rid of many worries and any such search and 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.690
 I wonder if I'm getting through trial and error.
