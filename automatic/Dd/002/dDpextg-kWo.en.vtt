g'vine iphone is internal memory the off
any<00:02:50.960> device<00:02:51.770> are<00:02:52.010> internal<00:02:52.430> memory<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.850> here

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
any device are internal memory and here

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.410 
any device are internal memory and here
they<00:02:53.690> are<00:02:53.720> external<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.610> have<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.970> buy<00:02:56.120> a

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
they are external so I you have to buy a

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.930 
they are external so I you have to buy a
really<00:02:56.720> good<00:02:57.220> as<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:59.090> card<00:02:59.360> microsd<00:03:00.110> card

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
really good as the card microsd card

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.510 
really good as the card microsd card
when<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:01.970> are<00:03:02.540> when<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.590> want<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.950> gigabytes

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
when you are when you want a gigabytes

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.600 
when you are when you want a gigabytes
or<00:03:04.700> 16<00:03:05.210> gigabytes<00:03:05.600> because<00:03:06.290> there<00:03:06.890> are<00:03:07.130> pretty

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
or 16 gigabytes because there are pretty

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.230 
or 16 gigabytes because there are pretty
cheap<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.020> cards<00:03:09.380> which<00:03:10.160> are<00:03:10.400> 8<00:03:10.730> gigabytes

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
cheap as the cards which are 8 gigabytes

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.910 
cheap as the cards which are 8 gigabytes
and<00:03:11.620> they<00:03:12.620> are<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.340> slow<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.000> when<00:03:14.920> they're

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and they are so slow and when they're

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.580 
and they are so slow and when they're
slow<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:17.180> get<00:03:17.450> problems<00:03:18.110> with<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.440> phone

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
slow you get problems with the phone

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.420 
slow you get problems with the phone
well<00:03:19.130> on<00:03:19.490> damn<00:03:20.210> outs<00:03:20.740> and<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.860> phone<00:03:22.070> will<00:03:22.280> get

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
well on damn outs and the phone will get

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.690 
well on damn outs and the phone will get
slower<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:22.940> etc<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.410> my<00:03:24.980> suggestion<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.640> that

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
slower and etc so my suggestion is that

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.890 
slower and etc so my suggestion is that
when<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.480> buy<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.960> SD<00:03:27.680> card<00:03:27.950> watch<00:03:28.790> watch<00:03:29.600> for

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
when you buy on SD card watch watch for

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.700 
when you buy on SD card watch watch for
the<00:03:30.020> class<00:03:30.460> they<00:03:31.460> all<00:03:31.580> have<00:03:31.790> classes<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.900> I

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
the class they all have classes and I

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.090 
the class they all have classes and I
recommend<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.640> least<00:03:34.700> class<00:03:35.510> 4<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.890> best

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
recommend at least class 4 and the best

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.090 
recommend at least class 4 and the best
and<00:03:37.340> higher<00:03:37.610> class<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.240> 6<00:03:38.960> well<00:03:39.560> there<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:39.950> no

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
and higher class is 6 well there is no

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.470 
and higher class is 6 well there is no
middle<00:03:40.460> class<00:03:40.970> 5<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:43.220> shoot<00:03:43.610> on<00:03:43.880> class

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
I'm not sure and that means that it will

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.710 
I'm not sure and that means that it will
make<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.740> less<00:04:49.040> about<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:50.060> will<00:04:50.210> be<00:04:50.330> exhausted

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
make you less about it will be exhausted

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.460 
make you less about it will be exhausted
about<00:04:51.580> one<00:04:52.580> day<00:04:52.820> or<00:04:53.000> two<00:04:53.270> when<00:04:53.600> when<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:54.170> use
