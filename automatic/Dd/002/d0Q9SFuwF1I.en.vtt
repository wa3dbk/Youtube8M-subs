opening up with quick helmets and Matt

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
opening up with quick helmets and Matt
affects<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.140> reason<00:00:43.500> why<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.010> strong<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
affects the reason why it's so strong is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
affects the reason why it's so strong is
because<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.300> hell<00:00:45.510> bats<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.170> tanky

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
because the hell bats are really tanky

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
because the hell bats are really tanky
they<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> lot<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> damage<00:00:47.550> pretty<00:00:47.879> fast

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
they can do a lot of damage pretty fast

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
they can do a lot of damage pretty fast
and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.289> matter<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> fact<00:00:49.829> basically<00:00:50.370> gives

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and the matter of fact basically gives

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.240 
and the matter of fact basically gives
them<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> mobility<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.960> need

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
them all the mobility that they need

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
them all the mobility that they need
especially<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
especially because of the what is it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
especially because of the what is it

previously before this patch you could

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.859 
previously before this patch you could
actually<00:01:07.799> put<00:01:08.189> four<00:01:08.520> hell<00:01:08.790> bats<00:01:09.060> into<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140 
into one matter of fact now now do I
agree<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.259> dispatch<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
agree with dispatch well it's kind of a
weird<00:01:21.180> patch<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.750> probably<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.680> have

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
weird patch it's probably not but I have

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100 
weird patch it's probably not but I have
would<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.009> gone<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.570> should

would have gone for right now I should

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
would have gone for right now I should
know<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.530> aliens<00:01:25.950> come<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> factory

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
know the aliens come from the factory

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
know the aliens come from the factory
and<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.570> helmets<00:01:27.960> come<00:01:28.200> from<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> Hellions

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
into a matter of fact but you could only

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.840

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
put two helmets into a matter of fact
now<00:01:35.850> what<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.150> could<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> simply<00:01:36.930> drop<00:01:37.229> em

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
now what you could do is simply drop em

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.590 
now what you could do is simply drop em
aliens<00:01:38.250> into<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> main<00:01:38.820> base<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.180> zurk<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
aliens into the main base of zurk and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.789 
aliens into the main base of zurk and
then<00:01:39.689> switch<00:01:39.960> them<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> help<00:01:40.439> us<00:01:40.590> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
then switch them to help us but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.289 
then switch them to help us but
obviously<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.880> able<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.150> pick

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
obviously it will not be able to pick

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
obviously it will not be able to pick
them<00:01:42.420> off<00:01:42.600> until<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.409> switch<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.100> back<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
them off until you switch them back to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.889 
them off until you switch them back to
Hellion<00:01:44.790> mode<00:01:44.939> again<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.780> kind

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
Hellion mode again and I think it's kind

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
Hellion mode again and I think it's kind
of<00:01:46.049> confusing<00:01:46.290> honestly<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.790> much

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
of confusing honestly I would have much

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.190 
of confusing honestly I would have much
rather<00:01:48.119> seen<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.170> just

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
rather seen that they would have just

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.859 
rather seen that they would have just
made<00:01:49.590> them<00:01:49.770> completely<00:01:50.100> mechanical<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
made them completely mechanical so you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.090 
made them completely mechanical so you
will<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.259> able<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.560> heal<00:01:52.770> done<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
will not be able to heal done with a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.920 
will not be able to heal done with a
matter<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> fact<00:01:53.549> anymore<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> maybe<00:01:54.540> make

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
matter of fact anymore and maybe make

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.200 
matter of fact anymore and maybe make

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the matter of fact ignite afterburners

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.179 
the matter of fact ignite afterburners
ability<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.899> research<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
ability and research that you have to

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
ability and research that you have to
complete<00:01:59.399> before<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.240> use<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.450> those

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
complete before you can use it those

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.149 
complete before you can use it those
that<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.380> change<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.860> would<00:02:02.040> have

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that are change that I would have

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.190 
that are change that I would have
involved<00:02:02.430> however<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.509> kind<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
involved however this is kind of the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.130 
involved however this is kind of the
same<00:02:04.560> result<00:02:05.030> right<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.180> he'll<00:02:06.479> bass<00:02:06.719> drops

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
same result right now he'll bass drops

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.020 
same result right now he'll bass drops
will<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.619> nearly<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.250> strong<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.729> he<00:02:08.879> used

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
will not nearly be as strong as he used

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.059 
will not nearly be as strong as he used
to<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:10.050> happy<00:02:10.590> about<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.830> because
