00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
where read their Redemption to will take

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
where read their Redemption to will take
place<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.490> expect<00:01:08.850> quite<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> lot<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
place but I do expect quite a lot of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
place but I do expect quite a lot of
wildlife<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.140> maybe<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.220> much<00:01:11.400> as

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
wildlife but maybe just not as much as

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.310 
wildlife but maybe just not as much as
the<00:01:11.790> first<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> reason<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:12.960> save

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the first one and the reason I do save

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
the first one and the reason I do save
this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.850> guys<00:01:15.000> remember

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
this is because if you guys remember

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
this is because if you guys remember
towards<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> end<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.590> first<00:01:16.860> read<00:01:17.100> their

Blackwater and there were quite a lot of

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880 
Blackwater and there were quite a lot of
vehicles<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.780> maybe<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> second<00:01:22.710> read

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890

their<00:01:23.070> Redemption<00:01:23.369> people<00:01:24.119> may<00:01:24.270> travel<00:01:24.720> more

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
their Redemption people may travel more

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.469 
their Redemption people may travel more
by<00:01:25.170> cars<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:25.950> horses<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
by cars than horses I don't know but I

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.270 
by cars than horses I don't know but I
do<00:01:27.540> still<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.590> quite<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
do still want to see quite a lot of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.429 
do still want to see quite a lot of
wildlife<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.119> generally<00:01:30.540> overall<00:01:31.079> because

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
wildlife just generally overall because

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.200 
wildlife just generally overall because
I<00:01:31.650> would<00:01:31.829> imagine<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.369> possibly<00:01:32.880> still

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
I would imagine it would possibly still

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
I would imagine it would possibly still
take<00:01:33.450> place<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> wild<00:01:34.259> wide<00:01:34.409> where

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
take place in the wild wide where

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.350 
take place in the wild wide where
storage<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.400> wouldn't<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.880> read<00:01:36.150> their

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
storage just wouldn't be read their

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.539 
storage just wouldn't be read their
Redemption<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.500> may<00:01:37.650> sound<00:01:37.950> crazy<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
Redemption so this may sound crazy and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.550 
Redemption so this may sound crazy and
all<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> would<00:01:39.150> love<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> full<00:01:40.200> grown

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
all but I would love to see a full grown

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
all but I would love to see a full grown

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.319 
down by one of those things that would
just<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.590> fun<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> insane<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.119> may

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
just be so fun and insane and this may

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.389 
just be so fun and insane and this may
sound<00:01:48.600> crazy<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.619> being<00:01:50.009> able<00:01:50.130> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399

mount a bear or possibly have a bear as
a<00:01:53.310> pet<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.390> imagine<00:01:54.780> walking<00:01:54.899> down<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> road

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a pet just imagine walking down the road

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 
a pet just imagine walking down the road
or<00:01:55.710> street<00:01:55.860> whichever<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.549> guys<00:01:56.700> wish<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.180> say

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
or street whichever you guys wish to say

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
or street whichever you guys wish to say
and<00:01:57.630> sit<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.229> barren<00:01:58.829> someone<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.310> when

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and sit in your barren someone like when

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
and sit in your barren someone like when
you<00:01:59.640> sit<00:01:59.880> down<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.270> think<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.840> stuff<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you sit down and think of this stuff it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
you sit down and think of this stuff it
really<00:02:01.560> isn't<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.979> impossible<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
really isn't that impossible and I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.249 
really isn't that impossible and I
personally<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> would<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.229> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
personally think this it would be a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.810 
personally think this it would be a
pretty<00:02:04.560> cool<00:02:04.799> feature<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> game

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
pretty cool feature to have in the game

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.029 
pretty cool feature to have in the game
being<00:02:06.329> able<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.630> mount<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.020> bear<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.710> can't

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
being able to mount a bear but I can't

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
being able to mount a bear but I can't
get<00:02:08.190> any<00:02:08.340> better<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.629> really<00:02:09.810> just

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
get any better than that so really just

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.510 
get any better than that so really just
overall<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.890> would<00:02:10.950> love<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.610> pets<00:02:11.970> in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
overall I would love to have pets in

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.160 
overall I would love to have pets in
their<00:02:12.670> Redemption<00:02:12.940> -<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.600> something<00:02:14.020> that

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
their Redemption - it's something that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.500 
their Redemption - it's something that
Rockstar<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.980> add<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.460> are<00:02:15.730> likely<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.360> add

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
Rockstar can add and are likely to add

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.180 
Rockstar can add and are likely to add
as<00:02:16.660> well<00:02:16.690> because<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.560> guess<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> first

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
as well because I guess in the first

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.160 
as well because I guess in the first
read<00:02:18.490> their<00:02:18.700> redemption<00:02:19.270> having<00:02:19.780> your<00:02:19.960> horse

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
read their redemption having your horse

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.080 
read their redemption having your horse
did<00:02:20.650> technically<00:02:21.220> go<00:02:21.370> down<00:02:21.580> as<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.880> pet

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
did technically go down as a pet

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.760 
did technically go down as a pet
considering<00:02:22.630> whenever<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.080> did<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.650> of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
considering whenever you did with so of

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.290 
considering whenever you did with so of
course<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.190> would<00:02:24.280> come<00:02:24.550> towards<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
course it would come towards you and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.270 
course it would come towards you and
then<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.750> mount<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.800> would<00:02:27.040> imagine

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
then you can mount it so I would imagine

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.890 
then you can mount it so I would imagine
it<00:02:27.580> would<00:02:27.700> be<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.970> same<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.390> second<00:02:28.720> read

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
it would be the same in the second read

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
it would be the same in the second read
their<00:02:29.080> redemption<00:02:29.650> but<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.100> would<00:02:30.340> be<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.550> lot

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
their redemption but it would be a lot

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.400 
their redemption but it would be a lot
more<00:02:30.940> cool<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.330> more<00:02:31.540> than<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:31.900> pet<00:02:32.170> for

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
more cool with more than one pet for

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.260 
more cool with more than one pet for
example<00:02:32.860> weight<00:02:33.010> dog<00:02:33.280> running<00:02:33.610> besides<00:02:34.000> you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
example weight dog running besides you

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.930 
example weight dog running besides you
or<00:02:34.600> even<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.200> crazy<00:02:35.380> crazy<00:02:35.830> ones<00:02:36.190> like<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> line

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
or even a crazy crazy ones like a line

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.150 
or even a crazy crazy ones like a line
or<00:02:37.300> even<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.750> bear<00:02:37.990> but<00:02:38.380> seriously<00:02:38.800> all<00:02:38.860> this

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
or even a bear but seriously all this

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.280 
or even a bear but seriously all this
stuff<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.610> definitely<00:02:40.240> possible<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.960> just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
stuff is definitely possible I just

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.570 
stuff is definitely possible I just
think<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.710> animals<00:02:42.070> should<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.250> put<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
think that the animals should be put to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.820 
think that the animals should be put to
a<00:02:42.730> lot<00:02:42.940> more<00:02:43.120> use<00:02:43.450> than<00:02:43.690> just<00:02:43.960> horses<00:02:44.440> for

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
a lot more use than just horses for

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.890 
a lot more use than just horses for
example<00:02:44.860> let's<00:02:45.550> just<00:02:45.610> say<00:02:45.820> there<00:02:46.120> are<00:02:46.240> dogs<00:02:46.690> in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
example let's just say there are dogs in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.450 
example let's just say there are dogs in
Red<00:02:47.170> Dead<00:02:47.350> Redemption<00:02:47.470> -<00:02:48.040> they<00:02:48.310> could

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
Red Dead Redemption - they could

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.250 
Red Dead Redemption - they could
definitely<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:49.210> dog<00:02:49.480> fights<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.990> could<00:02:50.140> get

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
definitely be dog fights that could get

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.050 
definitely be dog fights that could get

train<00:02:54.010> your<00:02:54.070> pet<00:02:54.520> in<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:55.030> case<00:02:55.270> for<00:02:55.540> dog

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.480 
meaning you would feed the dog and every
fight<00:02:58.480> wins<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.140> does<00:02:59.380> get<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> bit<00:02:59.890> stronger

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
I think this would be a really cool

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.360 
I think this would be a really cool
thing<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.350> in<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> game<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:06.040> they<00:03:06.220> could

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
thing to have in the game and they could

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.220 
thing to have in the game and they could
also<00:03:06.580> even<00:03:06.970> be<00:03:07.240> chicken<00:03:07.630> fights<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.050> then<00:03:08.140> you

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
also even be chicken fights and then you

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.750 
also even be chicken fights and then you
guys<00:03:08.380> may<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.680> thinking<00:03:09.070> I'm<00:03:09.190> crazy<00:03:09.370> but

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760
