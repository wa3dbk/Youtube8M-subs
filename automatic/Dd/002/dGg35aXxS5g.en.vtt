00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.969 
where the water gets first sucked into
it<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> inside<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> ring

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it on the inside you can see that ring

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
it on the inside you can see that ring
in<00:01:53.159> there<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.360> another<00:01:54.659> piece<00:01:54.899> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
in there that's just another piece of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.260 
in there that's just another piece of
ABS<00:01:55.470> pipe<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> cut<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> section<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
ABS pipe that I cut a section out of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
ABS pipe that I cut a section out of
squeezed<00:01:58.079> down<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:58.829> going

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
squeezed down in there and that's going

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.670 
squeezed down in there and that's going
to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.540> like<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> holding<00:02:01.020> spot<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.560> my

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
to be like a holding spot for my

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
to be like a holding spot for my
mechanical<00:02:02.219> media<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.759> we're<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> take

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
mechanical media so we're going to take

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.630 
mechanical media so we're going to take
our<00:02:03.390> egg<00:02:03.600> crate<00:02:04.219> drop<00:02:05.219> this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
our egg crate drop this

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.059 
our egg crate drop this
so<00:02:06.790> don't<00:02:07.240> drop<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.570> inside<00:02:07.860> we're<00:02:08.860> going<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
so don't drop it inside we're going to

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.980 
so don't drop it inside we're going to
drop<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.580> inside<00:02:10.119> here<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.780> going

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
drop this inside here and this is going

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.430 
drop this inside here and this is going
to<00:02:14.050> allow<00:02:14.350> for<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.900> mechanical<00:02:16.900> media<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
to allow for the mechanical media to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.430 
to allow for the mechanical media to
separate<00:02:17.950> itself<00:02:18.370> from<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.700> biological<00:02:19.440> take

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
separate itself from the biological take

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.470 
separate itself from the biological take
this<00:02:20.680> thing<00:02:20.920> right<00:02:21.130> here<00:02:21.190> cut<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> size<00:02:22.000> I'm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
this thing right here cut the size I'm

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.530 
this thing right here cut the size I'm
going<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.780> slide<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.560> down<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:23.980> there<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
going to slide it on down in there and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.030 
going to slide it on down in there and
if<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.660> can<00:02:25.810> see<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.850> right<00:02:28.209> below<00:02:29.040> when

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
if you can see it's right below when

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.350 
if you can see it's right below when
it's<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> tank<00:02:30.610> it's<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.940> be<00:02:31.030> above

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it's in the tank it's going to be above

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.660 
it's in the tank it's going to be above
but<00:02:31.690> right<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.620> pad<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.220> right<00:02:33.400> below

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
but right now the pad is right below

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.580 
but right now the pad is right below
those<00:02:33.820> holes<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.390> as<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.780> water<00:02:34.989> enters<00:02:35.110> in

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
those holes so as the water enters in

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.870 
those holes so as the water enters in
the<00:02:35.709> first<00:02:35.950> thing<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.160> hits<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.520> going<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> be

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the first thing that hits is going to be

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.550 
the first thing that hits is going to be
that<00:02:37.380> mechanical<00:02:38.380> media<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.120> dense<00:02:40.120> foam

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
that mechanical media in that dense foam

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.840 
that mechanical media in that dense foam
so<00:02:41.560> we're<00:02:41.650> going<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.830> flip<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.100> actually<00:02:42.730> we're

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
so we're going to flip it actually we're

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.120 
so we're going to flip it actually we're
going<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.030> cap<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.140> off<00:02:44.290> right<00:02:44.530> here<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:44.950> is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
going to cap it off right here this is

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.400 
going to cap it off right here this is
all<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.489> loosely<00:02:45.970> fit<00:02:46.300> not<00:02:46.840> glued<00:02:47.260> or

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
all just loosely fit not glued or

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.780 
all just loosely fit not glued or
whatever<00:02:47.709> because<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.010> still<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.400> be<00:02:48.580> able

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
whatever because I still have to be able

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.060 
whatever because I still have to be able
to<00:02:48.880> pull<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.209> all<00:02:49.330> apart<00:02:49.650> when<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> perform

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
to pull it all apart when I perform

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.190 
to pull it all apart when I perform
maintenance<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.610> whatnot<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:52.840> loosely

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
maintenance and whatnot so just loosely

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.229 
maintenance and whatnot so just loosely
slip<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.610> there<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.880> that's<00:02:55.060> what

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
slip that on to there and that's what

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.759 
slip that on to there and that's what
the<00:02:55.330> bottom<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.840> filter<00:02:56.019> looks<00:02:56.380> like<00:02:56.590> this

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
the bottom of the filter looks like this

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.080 
the bottom of the filter looks like this
is<00:02:56.860> going<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.070> rest<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.550> bottom<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.030> the

all right
there<00:03:22.500> we<00:03:22.769> go<00:03:23.180> sorry<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.569> wavered<00:03:25.560> off<00:03:25.829> with

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
there we go sorry if I wavered off with

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.119 
there we go sorry if I wavered off with
the<00:03:26.099> camera<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.750> got<00:03:28.079> all<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.650> there<00:03:28.890> so

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
the camera but got all that in there so

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.100 
the camera but got all that in there so
we<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.280> cap<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.879> off<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.360> cap<00:03:30.659> right<00:03:30.870> here

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
we can cap this off this cap right here

has a 3/4 inch bulkhead in it that'll

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.380 
has a 3/4 inch bulkhead in it that'll
allow<00:03:34.769> me<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.040> attach<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.760> pump<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
allow me to attach it to the pump and

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.990 
allow me to attach it to the pump and
again<00:03:37.319> just<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.829> loosely<00:03:38.189> slip<00:03:38.579> this<00:03:38.760> on

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
again just going to loosely slip this on

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.339 
again just going to loosely slip this on
to<00:03:39.150> there<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:41.540> that's<00:03:42.540> basically<00:03:42.989> what<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
to there and that's basically what the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.780 
to there and that's basically what the
chamber<00:03:43.560> looks<00:03:43.890> like<00:03:44.099> without<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.459> pump

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
chamber looks like without the pump

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.509 
chamber looks like without the pump

was<00:03:47.640> about<00:03:47.760> 15<00:03:48.329> bucks<00:03:48.629> you<00:03:48.930> know<00:03:49.019> I've<00:03:49.170> got

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
was about 15 bucks you know I've got

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.039 
was about 15 bucks you know I've got
about<00:03:50.340> seven<00:03:50.790> or<00:03:50.879> eight<00:03:51.000> dollars<00:03:51.180> invested<00:03:51.930> in

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
about seven or eight dollars invested in

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.509 
about seven or eight dollars invested in
the<00:03:52.140> ABS<00:03:52.530> pipe<00:03:52.799> another<00:03:53.370> five<00:03:53.670> or<00:03:53.849> six<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.359> the

and it was about three bucks for the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.750 
and it was about three bucks for the
pump<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.530> that's<00:04:01.859> everything<00:04:02.159> installed

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
pump so that's everything installed

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.589 
pump so that's everything installed
inside<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.780> it's<00:04:04.769> time<00:04:04.920> for<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.159> workhorse

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
inside and it's time for the workhorse

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.899 
inside and it's time for the workhorse
horse<00:04:06.829> right<00:04:07.829> there's<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.220> intake<00:04:08.609> so<00:04:08.819> I'm

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
horse right there's the intake so I'm

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.750 
horse right there's the intake so I'm
just<00:04:09.060> going<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.299> slip<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.629> onto<00:04:10.019> there<00:04:10.760> nice

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
just going to slip that onto there nice

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.270 
just going to slip that onto there nice
and<00:04:11.790> smooth<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:15.440> all<00:04:16.440> right<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.859> that's<00:04:17.099> our

very<00:04:19.680> simple<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.310> it's<00:04:20.400> going<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.549> be<00:04:20.699> very

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
very simple and it's going to be very

very simple and it's going to be very
effective<00:04:21.800> this<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.919> our<00:04:23.099> output<00:04:23.280> water<00:04:24.120> gets

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
effective this is our output water gets

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.659 
effective this is our output water gets
sucked<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.870> through<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.169> input<00:04:25.590> there<00:04:25.889> goes

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
do is I'm going to throw it on the tank

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.750 
do is I'm going to throw it on the tank
or<00:04:36.750> in<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.229> tank<00:04:37.440> because<00:04:38.190> it's<00:04:38.340> an<00:04:38.430> internal

quick<00:04:44.449> alright<00:04:45.449> so<00:04:45.630> we're<00:04:45.780> back<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:46.409> it

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
quick alright so we're back I have it

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.129 
quick alright so we're back I have it
installed<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:47.330> just<00:04:48.330> kind<00:04:48.539> of<00:04:48.570> got<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:48.900> clamped

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
installed I just kind of got it clamped

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.180 
installed I just kind of got it clamped
in<00:04:49.470> there<00:04:51.080> lowered<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.229> water<00:04:52.409> level<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:53.099> a

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
in there lowered the water level just a

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.770 
in there lowered the water level just a
little<00:04:53.430> bit<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.729> give<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:53.970> guys<00:04:54.120> an<00:04:54.300> idea<00:04:54.449> of

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
little bit to give you guys an idea of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.969 
little bit to give you guys an idea of
the<00:04:54.930> kind<00:04:55.139> of<00:04:55.229> flow<00:04:55.440> that<00:04:55.650> we're<00:04:55.770> pushing

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
the kind of flow that we're pushing

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.589 
the kind of flow that we're pushing
through<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.430> thing<00:04:56.699> which<00:04:56.849> is<00:04:57.000> quite<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.270> bit

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
through this thing which is quite a bit

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.990 
through this thing which is quite a bit
it's<00:04:58.500> going<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.710> handle<00:04:58.949> this<00:04:59.070> 55<00:04:59.610> quite

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
it's going to handle this 55 quite

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.670 
it's going to handle this 55 quite
nicely

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
nicely

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.010 
nicely
there<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:02.520> is<00:05:02.580> inside<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.120> tank<00:05:03.479> kind<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.840> just

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
there it is inside the tank kind of just

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.980 
there it is inside the tank kind of just
has<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.410> similar<00:05:04.860> look<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.130> ah<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:06.630> know<00:05:06.750> your

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
has a similar look to ah you know your

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.560 
has a similar look to ah you know your
overflows<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.800> stuff<00:05:08.039> doesn't<00:05:08.310> really<00:05:08.570> look

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
overflows and stuff doesn't really look

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.210 
overflows and stuff doesn't really look
too<00:05:09.630> ugly<00:05:10.020> take<00:05:10.350> up<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.560> whole<00:05:10.710> lot<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.919> space

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
too ugly take up a whole lot of space

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.070 
too ugly take up a whole lot of space
and<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:11.610> going<00:05:11.699> to<00:05:11.759> be<00:05:11.880> very<00:05:12.120> very<00:05:12.330> effective

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
and it's going to be very very effective

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.909 
and it's going to be very very effective
I<00:05:14.720> could<00:05:15.720> have<00:05:15.840> drilled<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.229> hole<00:05:16.380> smaller

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
I could have drilled the hole smaller

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.150 
I could have drilled the hole smaller
for<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.669> intake<00:05:18.410> but<00:05:19.410> considering<00:05:20.039> this

worry about little fry getting sucked up

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.779 
worry about little fry getting sucked up
and<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:28.080> course<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.470> can<00:05:28.620> adjust<00:05:28.889> that<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.669> know

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
and of course I can adjust that you know

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.700

to<00:05:35.759> do<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.030> going<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.330> create<00:05:36.919> somewhat<00:05:37.919> of<00:05:37.949> a

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
to do is going to create somewhat of a

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.950 
to do is going to create somewhat of a
vortex<00:05:38.610> as<00:05:38.789> it<00:05:38.910> pushes<00:05:39.090> water<00:05:39.419> around<00:05:39.780> it's

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
vortex as it pushes water around it's

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.390 
vortex as it pushes water around it's
going<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.139> push<00:05:40.320> waste<00:05:40.620> all<00:05:40.889> the<00:05:41.039> way<00:05:41.099> around

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
going to push waste all the way around

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.350 
going to push waste all the way around
and<00:05:41.639> hopefully<00:05:42.360> back<00:05:42.870> into<00:05:43.229> it<00:05:43.410> and<00:05:44.210> may<00:05:45.210> end

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
and hopefully back into it and may end

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.820 
and hopefully back into it and may end
up<00:05:45.479> taking<00:05:45.720> care<00:05:46.110> of<00:05:46.259> itself<00:05:46.560> as<00:05:46.800> far<00:05:47.009> as

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
up taking care of itself as far as

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.740 
up taking care of itself as far as
gravel<00:05:49.830> backs<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:50.220> whatnot<00:05:50.580> and<00:05:50.820> I'll<00:05:51.599> just

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.960 
gravel backs and whatnot and I'll just
have<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.050> clean<00:05:52.259> the<00:05:52.349> filter<00:05:52.530> every<00:05:52.770> week<00:05:53.039> but
