00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.200
 beauty galley 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.199
 good today I'll show you how to 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.119
 people do a homemade pitching test 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.410
 here are the materials that people 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.710
 will use 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.039
 will be a mission is great is you can 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.420
 to be any color does not matter just not to 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:35.760
 make the ball run from the fans being 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 one of the normal fan says supporter 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 the inep with the tab there too 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.430
 using a relatively large buoy 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.620
 great that supports a background of 30 grams 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.449
 in Bolivar case and steel tie zinho 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.809
 or the steel stop 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.660
 so people are very simple to make people 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.660
 You'll have to make a change here. 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.580
 it will be at our steel door who will 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.200
 take the hypothesis of steel 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.659
 in this part here ball 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.159
 you will learn the normal sun or 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.259
 that in the case 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.820
 if you will use it the right way 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.470
 but how are we going to use it as a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.939
 support work throwing 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.439
 We're going to have to do with the poll. 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.380
 cut our share here ok I will not 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.810
 show you how we can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.790
 cut how do you do 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.990
 because I already did have a float here 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.299
 ready here can be cut to herein as 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.140
 work that needs some 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:49.200
 tools I do not have here in common 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.420
 show you guys but then you left 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.250
 explain to you how the system is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.119
 of assembly 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:09.720
 so after you've cut the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:13.690
 of catwalk end of the tie 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:22.330
 sugar comes later when passing the support 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:24.400
 ok then the olive pellet and then 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.530
 here on top of that part but a bucket 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.270
 fan with inep with the clip here 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.610
 right 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.480
 done that 's just the bottom will be 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.510
 open is that you will have cut the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 pliers and working with it and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.940
 to put the other one says normal smooth fan and 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 working and learning clearly here 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.680
 form and conditions of the prisoner chip 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.530
 so I was already touching you are 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.940
 see how she gets so upstairs 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.940
 come our supporter 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.080
 then to Missang to buoy the Bolivar lead 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.560
 and our supporter you're going to call 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.840
 here the line with the reasons of the system 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.170
 coc and kiev the reel line or 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.170
 reel 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.540
 when you look at how it looks like 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.850
 right when what matters when you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.220
 one is to use this system before 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.440
 do it also test to see if the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.440
 lead and the weight of rain will resist 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.050
 Resist his weight will not sink okay 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.489
 This is very important here too. 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.260
 important detail also that you do not 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:47.230
 You have to make a modification to the float. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:49.630
 with sandpaper taking off a bit from the float 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.650
 right by digging it into the float 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:58.080
 so that after the lead olive 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.080
 get inside the buoy this way here 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.230
 it is also important to make 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.790
 give more stability in the good then when 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.570
 you throw the ball more 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.190
 stable within the water than the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.890
 is this guys mount our campaign 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.730
 home pitch 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.600
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.800
 Italy a well just in time tip well 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.630
 you can be doing and with few 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.340
 materials and this 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.860
 system that this ball will be 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.750
 oscillating significantly in their fishing and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.810
 breaking a branch even on an occasion of 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.610
 emergency your fishing right then 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.480
 Let's see what this little animal looks like. 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.190

 neighbor ac from the back of house 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:54.340
 He touches it there to see if it's 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.340
 then our pitch guard system 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.800

 You can see that it looks pretty cool. 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.110
