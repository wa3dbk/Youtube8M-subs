website at WWE TV and consist calm we're
gonna<00:00:30.109> use<00:00:30.320> three<00:00:30.619> long<00:00:31.310> lengths<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.820> cord

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
gonna use three long lengths of cord

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.720 
gonna use three long lengths of cord
which<00:00:33.019> we<00:00:33.199> need<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.680> fold<00:00:34.070> in<00:00:34.250> half<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:37.579> make

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
which we need to fold in half to make

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.690 
which we need to fold in half to make
three<00:00:38.030> loops<00:00:38.920> we'll<00:00:39.920> secure<00:00:40.280> them<00:00:40.520> with<00:00:40.550> a

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
three loops we'll secure them with a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:55.299 
three loops we'll secure them with a
knot<00:00:40.940> at<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.420> end

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.660 

which<00:00:55.850> can<00:00:56.270> then<00:00:56.360> be<00:00:56.539> used<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:58.250> hold<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.579> in

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
which can then be used to hold it in

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.130 
which can then be used to hold it in
place<00:00:58.789> I<00:00:59.239> like<00:00:59.539> to<00:00:59.629> use<00:00:59.719> a<00:00:59.750> binder<00:01:00.110> clip

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
place I like to use a binder clip

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.959 
place I like to use a binder clip
because<00:01:00.680> then<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:00.949> can<00:01:01.129> use<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.489> loop<00:01:01.640> here

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
because then you can use the loop here

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.119 
because then you can use the loop here
to<00:01:02.539> put<00:01:02.690> over<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.989> nail<00:01:03.230> or<00:01:03.530> have<00:01:03.649> someone<00:01:03.920> hold

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
to put over a nail or have someone hold

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.520 
to put over a nail or have someone hold
and<00:01:04.460> that's<00:01:05.299> what<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:05.780> need<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.200> start<00:01:06.409> your

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
and that's what you need to start your

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.990 
and that's what you need to start your
braiding<00:01:09.280> for<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:10.400> braid<00:01:10.640> we're<00:01:10.820> going<00:01:10.940> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
braiding for this braid we're going to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.660 
braiding for this braid we're going to
use<00:01:11.150> three<00:01:11.509> loops<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:12.140> your<00:01:12.830> index<00:01:13.100> finger<00:01:13.490> and

use three loops on your index finger and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.210 
use three loops on your index finger and
your<00:01:13.759> middle<00:01:13.790> fingers<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:15.110> have<00:01:15.140> two<00:01:15.740> loops<00:01:16.009> on

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
your middle fingers we have two loops on

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.350 
your middle fingers we have two loops on
one<00:01:16.430> hand<00:01:16.670> one<00:01:16.940> on<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.149> other

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
your empty middle finger you're going to

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.670 
your empty middle finger you're going to
bring<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:19.549> through<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.330> bottom<00:01:20.659> loop<00:01:20.690> grab

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680

through grab the top tighten I'll do a
couple<00:01:49.399> of<00:01:49.460> more

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.020 

you<00:01:58.470> can<00:01:58.620> do<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.860> as<00:01:59.040> loose<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.550> as<00:01:59.580> tight<00:01:59.670> as

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you can do this as loose or as tight as

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.000 
you can do this as loose or as tight as
you<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.690> you're<00:02:00.840> using<00:02:01.110> leather<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.800> I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
you want if you're using leather like I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.040 
you want if you're using leather like I
am<00:02:02.220> you'll<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> use<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> little<00:02:03.540> bit<00:02:03.780> of

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
am you'll have to use a little bit of

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.910 
am you'll have to use a little bit of
force<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.880> get<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.150> be<00:02:06.270> tight<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.740> also

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
force to get it to be tight you can also

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.609 
force to get it to be tight you can also
do<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> same<00:02:08.550> thing<00:02:08.760> with<00:02:09.450> any<00:02:09.690> odd<00:02:10.020> number<00:02:10.440> of

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
do the same thing with any odd number of

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.610 
do the same thing with any odd number of
loops<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.300> through<00:02:12.720> all<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.440> loops

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
loops you just go through all the loops

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960 
loops you just go through all the loops
on<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> bottom<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.430> use<00:02:14.640> your<00:02:14.820> lower

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
on the bottom and you use your lower

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270 
on the bottom and you use your lower
fingers<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.380> case<00:02:16.650> we'll<00:02:16.860> end<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.100> with<00:02:17.160> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
fingers in this case we'll end up with a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.900 
fingers in this case we'll end up with a
triangle<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.420> three<00:02:18.780> sides<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.550> used

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
triangle on all three sides if you used

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.580 
triangle on all three sides if you used
five<00:02:21.450> loops<00:02:21.810> you'd<00:02:22.080> actually<00:02:22.380> end<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.530> with

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
five loops you'd actually end up with

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.180 
five loops you'd actually end up with
more<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.040> square<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.650> take<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> look<00:02:29.070> at

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
more of the square if we take a look at

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.770 
more of the square if we take a look at
mine<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.300> see<00:02:33.480> we've<00:02:33.690> ended<00:02:33.960> up<00:02:34.080> with<00:02:34.700> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
mine you can see we've ended up with a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.640 
mine you can see we've ended up with a
