00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and so we're in a tough market and so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.859 
and so we're in a tough market and so
you've<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> work<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.720> things

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you've got to work out of these things

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
you've got to work out of these things
is<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.560> why<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:31.920> also<00:01:32.070> important<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> end

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
is that why it was also important to end

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.100 
is that why it was also important to end
the<00:01:32.790> season<00:01:32.939> well<00:01:33.240> doesn't<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> based<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.020> a
