00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.310
 when will s finally run around again at the s-Bahn without delay without 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.789
 Failures with full-length trains and their wheels 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.990
 with certainty can only say that nobody knows neither the 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.539
 new management still the Senate 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.119
 the employees 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 Wars only daily to feel the annoyance of the passengers because the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 rarely started new week the same way as the last 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.209
 Welcome to the sardine cane that was again for many in the 

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:33.530
 Even in the chaos, the subway still lags behind on most lines 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.699
 20-minutes-stroke 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.440
 two lines failed 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.910
 and an end is not in sight the subway can not say when the trains 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.310
 again scheduled roles customers are increasingly annoyed 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.890
 was a disaster 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.040
 of course we work change 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.860
 There's no room on Monday 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 with five boys and girls and boys 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.569
 Percent and employees 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.109
 the states are possible and reasonable to theirs and to be more important with which ones 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.480
 Song cattle car and that can not really be 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.440
 Help hopes in the suburban train in a discussion from the BVG but only can 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.200
 offer little if additional buses and trains are not on the farms 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.230
 it's possible that it's about personnel 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.560
 contrary to what we all use the suburban train storage room in the workshops too 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.030
 The picture less then percent of transport capacity help his vacation 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.090
 for us, of course, the next holiday beginning and he as well 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.230
 economically advanced so you do not have unlimited vehicles and staff 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.670
 have available 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.840
 In the workshops, however, the storage space is growing while employees were out 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.970
 other divisions requested but there are too few workshops 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.240
 to disposal 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.530
 Therefore, the works council demands the closed Friedrichsfelde again 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.109
 open by that we the 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.499
 Special measures in civil engineering laid by the Federal Railway Authority have to cope 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.769
 of course stay scheduled work and also for unscheduled as well 

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:50.219
 Repairs and bouncers and for that the same remains natural 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.270
 everything stands or is still in use and that 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.610
 Creates great care, especially at employees of close to work 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.340
 maintenance 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.930
 how far he is at a wave of different 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.220
 the teachers make themselves felt in the form that the opposition is 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.759
 Vehicle at the Meiringer gets from day to day 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.619
 the growing lack of understanding about the ongoing chaos is intensifying 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:16.900
 To feel employees 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.559
 they are shocked themselves 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.099
 our goal is the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.659
 However, the mood is always the topic she was was yesterday's topic of the Frenchman 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.379
 take the workers they have joined the company and of course 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
 not at all understand what is currently happening 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.619
 his new investors 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.929
 Roads had Berlin symbol 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.909
 I was a bit around there 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.249
 that depresses the mood 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.349
 Tomorrow try to make it too big 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.259
 Caravan through Alban Berg and do everything 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.869
 The suburban train at the garden show will not give an interview later in the week 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.849
 but they inform how it goes on 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.420
 Pressure makes also the traffic senator she lets check whether the contract with 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.489
 the subway can be terminated before 2017 and who is re-tendering this
