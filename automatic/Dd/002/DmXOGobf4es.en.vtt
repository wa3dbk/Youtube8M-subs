00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
too sure who the exact founder of this

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
too sure who the exact founder of this
would<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.650> say<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.099> probably<00:00:26.369> isn't

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
would be like I say there probably isn't

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
would be like I say there probably isn't
really<00:00:26.760> an<00:00:26.849> exact<00:00:27.330> founder<00:00:27.810> because<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.529> has

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
really an exact founder because it has

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.220 
really an exact founder because it has
been<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:28.980> since<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.640> black<00:00:29.880> ops<00:00:30.090> 2<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.599> it's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
been out since like black ops 2 but it's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.720 
been out since like black ops 2 but it's
pretty<00:00:31.349> cool<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> basically<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.579> same

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
pretty cool you do it basically the same

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.900 
pretty cool you do it basically the same
way<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.750> would<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> black<00:00:34.350> ops<00:00:34.620> 2<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
way as you would in black ops 2 but it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.130 
way as you would in black ops 2 but it
definitely<00:00:36.090> does<00:00:36.390> look<00:00:36.420> sick<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
definitely does look sick I'm not a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
definitely does look sick I'm not a
hundred<00:00:37.290> percent<00:00:37.440> sure<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.070> it

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
hundred percent sure if you can do it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.369 
hundred percent sure if you can do it
with<00:00:38.280> snipers<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.059> game<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.960> definitely

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
with snipers in this game you definitely

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
with snipers in this game you definitely
can<00:00:40.559> though<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> shotgun<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.000> let's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
can though with the shotgun so let's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.500 
can though with the shotgun so let's
start<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.390> off<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:43.219> class<00:00:44.219> setup<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
start here off with class setup and that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
start here off with class setup and that
didn't<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.110> make<00:00:46.350> any<00:00:46.410> sense<00:00:46.649> let's<00:00:47.129> start

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
didn't really make any sense let's start

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.389 
didn't really make any sense let's start
here<00:00:47.760> off<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.270> anyways<00:00:48.770> class<00:00:49.770> setup<00:00:50.100> we'll

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
here off but anyways class setup we'll

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.029 
here off but anyways class setup we'll
go<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> load<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.079> here's<00:00:52.530> basically<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
go to load out and here's basically the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.470 
go to load out and here's basically the
class<00:00:53.160> setup<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.579> guys<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> need

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
class setup you guys are going to need

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.779 
class setup you guys are going to need
you<00:00:54.629> guys<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.960> pick<00:00:55.340> basically<00:00:56.340> whatever<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
want it's pretty Universal on that sense

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.650 
want it's pretty Universal on that sense
that<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.670> don't<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.059> need<00:01:00.270> necessarily

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that you don't really need necessarily

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540 
that you don't really need necessarily
this<00:01:01.140> class<00:01:01.410> main<00:01:01.980> thing<00:01:02.129> you're<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
this class main thing you're going to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.359 
this class main thing you're going to
need<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> tac-19<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:04.949> believe

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
need is the tac-19 and I do believe

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.640 
need is the tac-19 and I do believe
that's<00:01:05.790> pretty<00:01:06.330> much<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.990> you're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that's pretty much all you're going to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.429 
that's pretty much all you're going to
need<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.909> tac-19<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.750> then<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> guys<00:01:10.110> can

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
need is the tac-19 and then you guys can

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.350 
need is the tac-19 and then you guys can
sort<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.799> mess<00:01:11.010> around<00:01:11.159> from<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.939> how

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
sort of mess around from there so how

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120 
sort of mess around from there so how
you<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.630> do<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.869> trick<00:01:13.110> shot<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.470> it's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you want to do this trick shot is it's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
you want to do this trick shot is it's
fairly<00:01:14.670> simple<00:01:15.240> takes<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.840> bit<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
fairly simple takes a little bit of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.469 
fairly simple takes a little bit of
practice<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> hardest

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
practice but it's not one of the hardest

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.789 
practice but it's not one of the hardest
trick<00:01:18.659> shots<00:01:18.840> I'd<00:01:18.960> say<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.350> medium

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
trick shots I'd say it's like medium

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.520 
trick shots I'd say it's like medium
level<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
level what you want to do is you want to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.700 
level what you want to do is you want to
shoot<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.790> wait<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.259> maybe

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
shoot just wait a little bit like maybe

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
shoot just wait a little bit like maybe
a<00:01:25.830> half<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.159> second<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> second<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.330> then

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
a half a second or a second you then

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.560 
a half a second or a second you then
