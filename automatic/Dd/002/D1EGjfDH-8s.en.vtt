editing<00:01:30.030> software<00:01:30.740> but<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.950> probably<00:01:32.220> wouldn't

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
editing software but I probably wouldn't

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.820 
editing software but I probably wouldn't
use<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.870> a<00:01:33.900> few<00:01:34.230> minor

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
use it I just have a few minor

use it I just have a few minor
reservations<00:01:35.730> about<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:37.310> think<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
reservations about this I think it just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.649 
reservations about this I think it just
uses<00:01:38.730> an<00:01:39.120> internal<00:01:39.840> memory<00:01:40.880> I'd<00:01:41.880> prefer<00:01:42.330> if

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
uses an internal memory I'd prefer if

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.460 
uses an internal memory I'd prefer if
you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.900> use<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.440> SD<00:01:43.770> card<00:01:43.800> microsd<00:01:45.470> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
you can use like an SD card microsd and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.890 
you can use like an SD card microsd and
the<00:01:46.950> internal<00:01:47.430> memory<00:01:47.790> has<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.720> said

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
the internal memory has I think it said

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.230 
the internal memory has I think it said
somewhere<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.409> 20<00:01:49.800> /<00:01:50.070> 20<00:01:50.400> minutes<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.820> 20

somewhere like 20 / 20 minutes or 20
some<00:01:51.570> minutes<00:01:52.040> which<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.070> cool<00:01:53.400> but<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.450> know

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
some minutes which is cool but you know

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.969

and
I'm<00:02:10.800> curious<00:02:11.040> about<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.880> aspect<00:02:12.300> ratio

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
I'm curious about the the aspect ratio

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.540 
I'm curious about the the aspect ratio
I'm<00:02:12.990> assuming<00:02:13.500> its<00:02:13.650> regular<00:02:14.070> though<00:02:14.220> not

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I'm assuming its regular though not

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.090 
I'm assuming its regular though not
widescreen<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.960> it's<00:02:16.110> totally<00:02:16.500> clone
