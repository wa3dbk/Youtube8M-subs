the middle coil is junk and it all comes

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.160 
the middle coil is junk and it all comes
out<00:01:52.429> then<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.030> get<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.270> secondary<00:01:53.719> coil<00:01:53.960> off

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
out then to get the secondary coil off

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.840 
out then to get the secondary coil off
I'm<00:01:54.409> setting<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.799> with<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.039> coil<00:01:55.280> resting<00:01:55.759> on

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
I'm setting it with the coil resting on

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.880 
I'm setting it with the coil resting on
the<00:01:55.969> jaws<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.420> my<00:01:56.570> vise<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.049> then<00:01:57.590> hitting<00:01:57.859> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
the jaws of my vise and then hitting the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.260 
the jaws of my vise and then hitting the
middle<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.369> core<00:01:58.609> with<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> rubber<00:01:59.030> hammer

until<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.840> winding<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.259> free<00:02:00.530> that's<00:02:01.369> got

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
until the winding is free that's got

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.160 
until the winding is free that's got
pretty<00:02:01.819> beat<00:02:02.030> up<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:02.450> that's<00:02:02.810> okay<00:02:03.140> because

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
pretty beat up but that's okay because

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.770 
pretty beat up but that's okay because
luckily<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.920> don't<00:02:04.069> need<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.240> chisel<00:02:05.600> works

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
luckily I don't need it the chisel works

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.510 
luckily I don't need it the chisel works

replaced gently to avoid damaging it or

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.540 
replaced gently to avoid damaging it or
scraping<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.170> wires<00:02:24.350> that's<00:02:25.160> why<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:25.400> using

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
scraping the wires that's why I'm using

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.220 
scraping the wires that's why I'm using
a<00:02:25.700> rubber<00:02:25.850> hammer<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:26.690> still<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.140> in

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
a rubber hammer so I can still get it in

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.030 
a rubber hammer so I can still get it in
nice<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
nice and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.070 
nice and
okay<00:02:28.849> it's<00:02:29.030> looking<00:02:29.150> like<00:02:29.390> it's<00:02:29.569> supposed<00:02:29.900> to

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
okay it's looking like it's supposed to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.839 
okay it's looking like it's supposed to
so<00:02:30.319> now<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.769> add<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> secondary<00:02:31.400> winding

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
so now we can add a secondary winding

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.460 
so now we can add a secondary winding
made<00:02:32.030> from<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.390> thick<00:02:32.659> 2<00:02:32.900> gauge<00:02:33.110> copper

place on the end of the cable next he

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.210 
place on the end of the cable next he
added<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.989> little<00:02:48.140> shrink<00:02:48.500> wrap<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.890> protect

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
added a little shrink wrap to protect

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.830 
added a little shrink wrap to protect
the<00:02:49.310> connection<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:50.150> hit<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.510> with<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.629> heat

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840

gun<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.290> shrink<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.010> finish<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.370> off

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
gun to shrink it down and finish it off

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.210 
gun to shrink it down and finish it off
alright<00:02:53.599> so<00:02:53.870> with<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.170> cable<00:02:54.470> bent<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.829> half<00:02:54.859> I

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
alright so with the cable bent in half I

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.860 
alright so with the cable bent in half I
can<00:02:55.459> move<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.700> up<00:02:55.790> next<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.209> transformer

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
can move it up next to the transformer

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.349 
can move it up next to the transformer
and<00:02:56.900> tuck<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.500> down<00:02:57.680> into<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.069> gaps<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:59.180> wire

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
and tuck it down into the gaps the wire

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.330 
and tuck it down into the gaps the wire
is<00:02:59.540> so<00:02:59.750> thick<00:03:00.049> it's<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.349> pretty<00:03:00.560> tight<00:03:00.829> fit<00:03:01.099> and

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
is so thick it's a pretty tight fit and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.339 
is so thick it's a pretty tight fit and
probably<00:03:01.849> couldn't<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.180> any<00:03:02.299> bigger<00:03:02.569> I'm

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
probably couldn't be any bigger I'm

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.930 
probably couldn't be any bigger I'm
pulling<00:03:03.709> one<00:03:03.859> end<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.190> cable<00:03:04.340> back<00:03:04.670> around

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
pulling one end of the cable back around

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.940 
pulling one end of the cable back around
the<00:03:05.060> transformer<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.200> decided<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.739> switch

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the transformer and I decided to switch

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.470 
the transformer and I decided to switch
the<00:03:07.129> positions<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.639> these<00:03:07.790> two<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.239> that<00:03:08.329> it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
the positions of these two so that it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.899 
the positions of these two so that it
forms<00:03:08.750> more<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.109> an<00:03:09.230> ascending<00:03:09.709> coil<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:10.879> I

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
forms more of an ascending coil now I

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.759 
forms more of an ascending coil now I
can<00:03:11.180> press<00:03:11.389> the<00:03:11.540> other<00:03:11.659> side<00:03:11.989> into<00:03:12.230> place<00:03:12.470> and

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
can press the other side into place and

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.069 
can press the other side into place and
the<00:03:12.980> secondary<00:03:13.459> coil<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.970> wrapped<00:03:14.239> as<00:03:14.510> easy<00:03:14.900> as

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
the secondary coil is wrapped as easy as

the secondary coil is wrapped as easy as
that<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:16.010> last<00:03:16.220> step<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.700> put<00:03:16.819> this<00:03:17.090> back

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299

the<00:03:19.549> scenes<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:19.970> broke<00:03:20.150> apart<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.900> I'm<00:03:20.989> gonna

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
the scenes I broke apart so I'm gonna

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.050 
the scenes I broke apart so I'm gonna
try<00:03:21.319> using<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.769> two-part<00:03:22.190> epoxy<00:03:22.280> glue<00:03:22.879> to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
try using this two-part epoxy glue to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.819 
try using this two-part epoxy glue to
see<00:03:23.209> if<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.389> can<00:03:23.569> make<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.870> work<00:03:24.049> both<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
see if I can make it work both the

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.920 
see if I can make it work both the
components<00:03:25.489> get<00:03:25.609> mixed<00:03:25.879> equally<00:03:26.209> then<00:03:26.840> I'll

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
components get mixed equally then I'll

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.629 
components get mixed equally then I'll
add<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.109> glue<00:03:27.409> to<00:03:27.530> all<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.769> exposed<00:03:28.099> surfaces

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
add the glue to all the exposed surfaces

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.430

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
800 what can you do with that mini am

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.180 
800 what can you do with that mini am
I<00:04:12.360> thought<00:04:12.960> it<00:04:13.080> would<00:04:13.140> be<00:04:13.260> fun<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.500> try<00:04:13.710> melting

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
I thought it would be fun to try melting

I thought it would be fun to try melting
some<00:04:14.370> metal<00:04:14.670> which<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.360> can<00:04:15.510> see<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.870> does

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
some metal which you can see this does

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.590 
some metal which you can see this does
easily<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:17.430> metal<00:04:17.700> melts<00:04:17.970> because<00:04:18.270> it's<00:04:18.420> not
