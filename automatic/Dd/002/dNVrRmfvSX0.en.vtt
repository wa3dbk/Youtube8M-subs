00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.320
 because we guarantee the inviolability of 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.420
 the armored door in model Olympus 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.250
 how can you see what the structure is 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.939
 of the door that is made up of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.880
 tubes 45 x 45 x 2 mm 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.119
 thickness is reinforced especially in 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.400
 the closing area that structure is left 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.010
 externally embraced by a sheet of 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.680
 2 millimeters thick internally 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.790
 for a sheet of 1.5 mm 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.290
 thickness 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.860
 the outer sheet is welded from the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.339
 interior with which it is not manipulable 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.339
 from the outside 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.170
 and the inner sheet is welded with a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 special machine that welds by 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 points 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.830
 if we add the amount of welds that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.220
 They have the outer and inner sheet 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.220
 we would add more than 250 points 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 independent welding 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.160
 the blade and the fence join with four 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.310
 bolts welded bead at 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.350
 hot this welding is done so much 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 in sheet as in fence each permio 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 incorporates a detonator and lever that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 He is also soldier from the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.250
 inside of the door with which it is not 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.190
 recordable and make the whole of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.190
 fence and door the most rigid that there is in 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.040
 the Spanish market the door incorporates 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.610
 fencing closed at the bottom a 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.830
 element that we could do without him 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.900
 but that we recommend since rigidity to 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.200
 the whole and triangle to all the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.200
 charges 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.480
 ah 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.180
 the other three important points are 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.660
 the locks that incorporate the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.570
 shields that protect the cylinders and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.470
 cylinders the locks that incorporates 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.390
 the Olympus model imply five points 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.970
 independent attack resistance 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.850
 the locks from a thousand kilos of 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.660
 pressure in case it is manipulated 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.120
 assen the shields and the cylinders and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.550
 they managed to extract the lock 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.130
 side would lock and the lock 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.010
 central would break the shields both the 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.400
 central shield as a lateral shield 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.550
 They are very high-end cemented steel 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.910
 and the cylinder rotors are 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.600
 protected by protective lentils 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.000
 with three extra manganese plates with 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.670
 truncated cone shape are installed from the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.720
 Interior of the door are not accessible 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.720
 from the outside 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.100
 one of the important points at the time 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.370
 to assess the safety of a door is 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.680
 know what gaps the door has to 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.819
 that a thief can try to put the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.150
 lever and to form it 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.909
 in the olympus model all that is the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.430
 outside patient of the fence is lined with 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.709
 edge of sheet with a thickness of tenths 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.439
 when the door is lined with wood and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.659
 it falls directly on the fence in 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.930
 the case that I'm painting this 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:34.170
 means that it is the door that less 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.079
 Slack has wood simulating a 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.139
 exterior door or a door 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:46.150
 interior without perimeter profiles in 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:51.040
 steel brass chrome pvc or similar 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.860
 fencing and door locks shields 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.250
 protection and cylinder are of the levels 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.629
 higher than there are in the market and for 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.629
 duplicated there is no security door 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.629
 Similary
