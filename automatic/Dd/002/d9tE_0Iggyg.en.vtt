00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
through the system but I think that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.720 
through the system but I think that
they'll<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.840> well<00:02:33.990> its<00:02:34.170> program<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.370> do<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730

on the defensive side I don't think I've
seen<00:05:02.199> anybody<00:05:02.590> lethargic<00:05:03.340> or<00:05:03.490> anybody<00:05:03.819> moving

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
seen anybody lethargic or anybody moving

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.300 
seen anybody lethargic or anybody moving
slow<00:05:04.720> today<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.199> mean<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.800> attitude<00:05:06.280> the

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
slow today I mean the attitude the

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.390 
slow today I mean the attitude the
effort<00:05:06.789> was<00:05:06.819> relentless<00:05:07.449> and<00:05:08.219> you<00:05:09.219> know<00:05:09.370> I

think<00:05:09.729> it's<00:05:09.879> a<00:05:10.180> step<00:05:10.360> up<00:05:10.509> from<00:05:10.780> where<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:10.990> need

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
think it's a step up from where we need

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.390 
think it's a step up from where we need
to<00:05:11.259> be<00:05:11.289> but<00:05:11.500> we<00:05:11.620> know<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.979> we've<00:05:12.129> got<00:05:12.159> a<00:05:12.310> long

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400
