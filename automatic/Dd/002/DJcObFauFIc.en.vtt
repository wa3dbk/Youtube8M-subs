rare earth metal that is supposed to be
malleable<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.720> didn't<00:00:40.590> find<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.830> to<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.070> all

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
malleable I didn't find it to be all

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.040 
malleable I didn't find it to be all
that<00:00:41.400> malleable<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.450> could<00:00:42.630> be<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.900> I'm<00:00:42.960> just

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that malleable it could be that I'm just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.040 
weak however take the terrarium metal
and<00:00:46.160> using<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.430> tongs<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:48.060> tweezers<00:00:48.330> place

it in dilute sulfuric acid it will

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.690 
it in dilute sulfuric acid it will
immediately<00:00:52.380> begin<00:00:52.710> giving<00:00:53.250> off<00:00:53.400> large

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
immediately begin giving off large

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.950 
immediately begin giving off large

amounts of hydrogen gas you might think

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.870 
amounts of hydrogen gas you might think
that<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> sulfuric<00:00:58.770> acid<00:00:59.250> would<00:00:59.430> take<00:00:59.610> care

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
that the sulfuric acid would take care

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.510 
that the sulfuric acid would take care
of<00:00:59.940> his<00:01:00.120> 4<00:01:00.360> grams<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:01.020> no<00:01:01.290> time<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.650> all<00:01:01.770> however

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
of his 4 grams in no time at all however

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.429 
of his 4 grams in no time at all however
it<00:01:02.850> took<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.330> 2<00:01:03.660> days<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> fully

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
it took about 2 days for it to fully

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.010 
it took about 2 days for it to fully
dissolve<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.190> found<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> would<00:01:06.480> build<00:01:06.780> up

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
dissolve I found that it would build up

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230 
dissolve I found that it would build up
a<00:01:07.170> protective<00:01:07.710> layer<00:01:07.740> after<00:01:08.370> being<00:01:08.610> still<00:01:08.970> for

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
a protective layer after being still for

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.180 
a protective layer after being still for
several<00:01:09.390> minutes<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.800> then<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
several minutes I would then have to

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.520 
several minutes I would then have to
disturb<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:11.940> glass<00:01:12.300> rod<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:13.380> would

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
disturb it with a glass rod which would

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.290 
disturb it with a glass rod which would
cause<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.800> protective<00:01:14.460> layer<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.880> flake<00:01:15.120> off

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
cause a protective layer to flake off

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.440 
cause a protective layer to flake off
and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> reaction<00:01:16.320> could<00:01:16.500> continue

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
and then the reaction could continue

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.000 
and then the reaction could continue
