00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
extension is people would become very

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
extension is people would become very
risk-averse<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.239> other<00:00:54.390> words<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.750> think

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
risk-averse in other words if you think

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.049 
risk-averse in other words if you think
about<00:00:55.020> how<00:00:55.170> dangerous<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> drive<00:00:56.190> if

has only been around for about a hundred
years<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> no<00:01:32.729> reason<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.689> are

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
years there is no reason to think we are

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.770 
years there is no reason to think we are
even<00:01:34.200> remotely<00:01:34.470> close<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
even remotely close to what will be the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.120 
even remotely close to what will be the
best<00:01:37.070> set<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.220> around<00:01:38.790> driving<00:01:39.630> uh<00:01:39.890> not<00:01:40.890> close

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
best set up around driving uh not close

best set up around driving uh not close
at<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> future<00:01:42.240> um<00:01:43.250> where<00:01:44.250> we're

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
at all it is the future um where we're

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.980 
at all it is the future um where we're
headed<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.030> direction<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.810> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
headed in that direction I like this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.929 
headed in that direction I like this
that<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> step<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that this is this is the step is the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.550 
that this is this is the step is the
step<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.570> take<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.470> are

more than I would dress that computer

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
more than I would dress that computer
really<00:02:15.600> in<00:02:15.900> spite<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.500> fact<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.950> the

really in spite of the fact that the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
Google car drove something like I don't

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.530 
Google car drove something like I don't
even<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:20.130> how<00:02:20.310> many<00:02:20.490> hundreds<00:02:20.970> thousands

tens of thousands of miles and the only

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
tens of thousands of miles and the only
accident<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.480> had<00:02:24.690> was<00:02:24.990> when<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.260> was<00:02:25.350> under

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
accident it had was when it was under

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.180 
accident it had was when it was under
manual<00:02:25.950> control<00:02:26.660> yet<00:02:27.660> despite<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.710> despite

manual control yet despite that despite

manual control yet despite that despite
that<00:02:29.790> that's<00:02:30.090> that's<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.870> instance<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:31.800> so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
that that's that's one instance but so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.800 
that that's that's one instance but so
those<00:02:32.520> what<00:02:32.790> you're<00:02:32.910> saying<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.390> your

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
those what you're saying is that your

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.960 
those what you're saying is that your
emotions<00:02:34.440> over<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.920> are<00:02:35.130> overriding<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
emotions over this are overriding the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.890 
emotions over this are overriding the
empirical<00:02:36.840> facts<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.570> guess<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
empirical facts it's it's a I guess you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.710 
empirical facts it's it's a I guess you
could<00:02:39.930> call<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.440> mental<00:02:41.010> hurdle<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.730> we

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
could call it a mental hurdle but we

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.630 
could call it a mental hurdle but we
still<00:02:43.050> don't<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.290> enough<00:02:43.650> information<00:02:43.770> say

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
still don't have enough information say

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.060 
still don't have enough information say
that<00:02:44.880> our<00:02:45.090> current<00:02:45.480> technology<00:02:45.710> will<00:02:46.710> be<00:02:46.860> one

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
that our current technology will be one

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.520 
that our current technology will be one
hundred<00:02:47.190> percent<00:02:47.400> safe<00:02:48.000> or<00:02:48.480> much<00:02:48.960> safer<00:02:49.410> than

someone with good reflexes on roads were

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.270 
someone with good reflexes on roads were
there<00:02:51.900> still<00:02:52.260> people<00:02:52.770> driving<00:02:53.250> cars

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
there still people driving cars

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.040 
there still people driving cars
themselves<00:02:53.640> no<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.420> certainly<00:02:54.750> an<00:02:54.900> issue

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
themselves no that is certainly an issue

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.360 
themselves no that is certainly an issue
which<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.040> worried<00:02:56.310> about

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
which is you have to be worried about

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.520 
which is you have to be worried about
the<00:02:56.580> people<00:02:56.760> who<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.180> or<00:02:57.420> manually<00:02:58.170> driving

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the people who are or manually driving

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.110 
the people who are or manually driving
their<00:02:58.680> cars<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.100> technology<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.820> still<00:03:00.030> in

their cars the technology is still in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.850 
their cars the technology is still in
its<00:03:00.180> infancy<00:03:00.330> there's<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.290> lot<00:03:01.440> more<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.709> come

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
its infancy there's a lot more to come

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.920 
its infancy there's a lot more to come
but<00:03:01.980> you'd<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.310> open<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.790> driverless<00:03:03.330> car<00:03:03.690> as

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
but you'd be open to a driverless car as

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.760 
but you'd be open to a driverless car as
the<00:03:04.080> technology<00:03:04.260> develops<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.340> course
