00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:08.140
 How about youtube people we are with a 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:11.440
 a boxing can be said of 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.869
 after terror 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.430
 you will already know that this game the truth is 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:20.380
 very good I do not know how I can explain 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.050
 the truth I see it a little more 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.750
 funny that minecraft but buy the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.510
 edition of then a new complex the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 bought my brother but if we play it 2 2 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.930
 Well, as you can see, it has been classified as 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.760
 very good approach to how they see and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.690
 normally it always gets right wrong 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.030
 company 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.780
 what it includes is a memory of 2 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.469
 gigas and then a few stickers contained and 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.379
 then we have unnim boxing something else 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.120
 the way of communicating the video that already 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.100
 I opened an activity to think more 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.769
 fast and everything 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.940
 good achievement my brother the joke is 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.910
 what 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.720
 I have a problem with my partner 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:12.790
 rpm multiplied 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.970
 and rpm that does not want me to let go of its 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.500
 network that sons of bitches the truth if 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.710
 they have given me a good service whatever 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.800
 but unfortunately I do not want 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.480
 be there 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.430
 I sent them several messages not 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.900
 they want to let me out is a mistake 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:38.600
 I want it not to be another either fine 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:44.060
 mancini I do not know something or something different 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.060
 connect the stickers the transits 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.990
 they have all these things like verbena 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.420
 3 are 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.880
 these parents 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.070
 stamped is the truth it looks a bit 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.060
 like that blur the camera is by the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.060
 light and why they did not 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.220
 so that no 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.040
 as you know I liked the terrarium in 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.040
 you 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.090
 and I open this for you 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.770
 you know here is the game itself close 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.120
 is already gravity father has here with 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.380
 all evils just came out a 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.960
 update of this thing is me 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.280
 saying my brother the very good time already 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.920
 I had made a world I had it right 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.280
 advanced but unfortunate was not 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.990
 updated as to be another as well 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.000
 in minecraft he got an update 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.960
 if it's for xbox you can say it 's 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.960
 better start whatever 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.250
 but I was talking 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.830
 this is very little what can be done to 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.010
 who in this game is not very 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.100
 very cool I'm not a huge forever 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.500
 yes I'll tell 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.880
 I've been doing other things and I 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.880
 they make a notification that there 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:19.130
 the manual can be said to have no 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:23.830
 absolutely nothing as we all put 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.830
 this in the box has nothing 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.410
 special 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.549
 says terrarium is beautiful is very 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.319
 flirtatious not so much to wear it not be a 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.810
 place or so but that nothing else 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.680
 put it 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.800
 as collection, you know how the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.440

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.340

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.349

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.599
 hickeys out there that from rpm then 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.220
 Unfortunately, some videos 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.130

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.680
