in March of 33 the problem is in or more
obvious<00:00:42.140> these<00:00:42.620> are<00:00:42.770> more<00:00:42.920> below<00:00:43.130> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
obvious these are more below the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.070 
obvious these are more below the
waterline<00:00:43.580> but<00:00:44.030> they're<00:00:44.180> also<00:00:44.300> more<00:00:44.600> complex

international and character and I just

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.610 
international and character and I just

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
think it's going to be extremely

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.650 
think it's going to be extremely
difficult<00:00:51.950> if<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.220> could<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:52.640> know<00:00:52.850> just<00:00:53.120> for

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
difficult if I could you know just for

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.600 
difficult if I could you know just for
me<00:00:53.810> that<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.260> transcendent<00:00:54.920> challenges<00:00:55.430> that

all<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:09.049> these<00:01:09.170> things<00:01:09.320> we've<00:01:09.560> been<00:01:09.710> delaying

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
all of these things we've been delaying

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.670 
all of these things we've been delaying
on<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.640> just<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.450> know<00:01:11.509> kicking<00:01:12.110> around<00:01:12.350> on

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
on and just you know kicking around on

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.639 
on and just you know kicking around on
for<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:12.920> long<00:01:13.070> long<00:01:13.220> time<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:14.439> think<00:01:15.439> there's<00:01:15.590> a

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
for a long long time I think there's a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.590 
for a long long time I think there's a
serious<00:01:16.069> prospect<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.729> America<00:01:17.210> will<00:01:17.420> go

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
serious prospect that America will go

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.929 
serious prospect that America will go
down<00:01:17.749> as<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:18.079> power<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.189> I<00:01:19.369> think<00:01:19.609> the<00:01:19.700> time<00:01:19.909> I

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
down as a power and I think the time I

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.880 
down as a power and I think the time I
think<00:01:20.630> all<00:01:20.869> these<00:01:20.960> issues<00:01:21.319> are<00:01:21.409> coming<00:01:21.679> out<00:01:21.770> is

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
think all these issues are coming out is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.419 
think all these issues are coming out is
very<00:01:22.159> quickly<00:01:22.429> now<00:01:23.350> secondly<00:01:24.429> transcendent

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
of a few decades and the big big

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.060 
of a few decades and the big big
question<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.710> going<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
question is is that going to be a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.280 
question is is that going to be a
peaceful<00:02:44.400> transition<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.270> will<00:02:45.840> America

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
peaceful transition and will America

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.170 
peaceful transition and will America
continue<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> great<00:02:47.430> power<00:02:47.640> at<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
continue to be a great power at the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.610 
continue to be a great power at the
table<00:02:48.590> when<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.740> transition<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:52.020> completed

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
table when that transition is completed

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.560 
table when that transition is completed
I<00:02:52.770> think<00:02:53.250> both<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.460> those<00:02:53.730> questions<00:02:53.970> are<00:02:54.330> very

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
I think both of those questions are very

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.360 
I think both of those questions are very
much<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.080> air<00:02:55.170> right<00:02:55.290> now<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.220> lot

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
much up in the air right now and a lot

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.680 
much up in the air right now and a lot
will<00:02:56.550> depend<00:02:56.580> on<00:02:56.910> what<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.060> next<00:02:57.330> president

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
will depend on what the next president

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.550 
will depend on what the next president
does<00:02:59.360> that's<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.540> pretty<00:03:00.750> chilling<00:03:01.170> thought

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
does that's a pretty chilling thought

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.310 
does that's a pretty chilling thought
all<00:03:02.340> those<00:03:02.550> things<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.000> said<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.230> it

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
all those things you said you know it

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.140 
all those things you said you know it
seems<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.710> me<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.160> order<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.670> get<00:03:05.880> done

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
seems to me that in order to get done

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.730 
seems to me that in order to get done
the<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.690> things<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.080> David<00:03:07.500> said

going to have to be able to reach across

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.130 
going to have to be able to reach across

presidents<00:03:19.680> have<00:03:19.830> not<00:03:20.010> done<00:03:20.220> when<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.150> think

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
presidents have not done when I think

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.540 
presidents have not done when I think
about<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:22.140> ability<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.770> Lyndon<00:03:23.100> Johnson

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
about the ability that Lyndon Johnson

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.020 
about the ability that Lyndon Johnson
had<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.740> 1964<00:03:25.740> when<00:03:26.070> he<00:03:26.190> had<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.490> get<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> civil

more<00:06:23.040> people<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.520> join<00:06:23.640> the<00:06:24.000> armed<00:06:24.150> forces<00:06:24.240> so

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
more people to join the armed forces so

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.710 
more people to join the armed forces so
that<00:06:24.840> we<00:06:25.080> weren't<00:06:25.290> making<00:06:25.740> our<00:06:26.540> young<00:06:27.540> people

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
again so the next president I think

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.740
