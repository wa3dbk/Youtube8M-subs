00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
cleaner what we're doing is we're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
cleaner what we're doing is we're
sucking<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.270> dirt<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> gravel<00:01:31.259> stays<00:01:31.500> in

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.090 
sucking the dirt out the gravel stays in
the<00:01:31.950> tank<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:33.270> we'll<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.930> turn<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the tank and then we'll have to turn the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.980 
the tank and then we'll have to turn the
hose<00:01:35.250> around<00:01:35.549> put<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> into<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> bucket<00:01:36.600> and

your tank you don't want to change it
right<00:03:45.519> away<00:03:45.670> when<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> tank<00:03:46.390> has<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.049> lot<00:03:47.319> of

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
right away when the tank has a lot of

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.750 
right away when the tank has a lot of
nutrients<00:03:47.890> in<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.100> because<00:03:48.489> you're<00:03:48.610> just

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
nutrients in it because you're just

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.449 
nutrients in it because you're just
going<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:49.000> fill<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.330> up<00:03:49.420> with<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:50.459> nutrients

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
going to fill it up with the nutrients

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.030 
going to fill it up with the nutrients
that<00:03:51.489> are<00:03:51.730> excess<00:03:52.390> doing<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.410> water<00:03:53.650> change

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
that are excess doing the water change

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.089 
that are excess doing the water change
gets<00:03:54.370> them<00:03:54.580> down<00:03:54.790> faster<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.830> then<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.980> get

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
gets them down faster and then to get

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.190 
gets them down faster and then to get
them<00:03:57.280> down<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.730> really<00:03:58.030> low<00:03:58.330> level<00:03:58.750> then<00:03:58.930> you

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
them down to a really low level then you

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.710 
them down to a really low level then you
put<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.500> the<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:01.390> bags<00:04:03.090> here's<00:04:04.090> again<00:04:04.420> mr.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
put in the the bags here's again mr.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.520 
put in the the bags here's again mr.
filter<00:04:05.080> down<00:04:05.260> here<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.840> each<00:04:08.110> one<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.380> these

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
filter down here so in each one of these

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.350 
filter down here so in each one of these
compartments<00:04:08.980> they're<00:04:09.430> sponges<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.120> stuff

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
compartments they're sponges and stuff

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.509 
compartments they're sponges and stuff
in<00:04:10.569> there<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.049> then<00:04:11.530> there's<00:04:11.680> bags<00:04:12.010> in<00:04:12.280> there

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
in there and then there's bags in there

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.400 
in there and then there's bags in there
and<00:04:12.700> there's<00:04:12.849> bags<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.330> there<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:14.200> sponge

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
and there's bags in there and a sponge

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.020 
and there's bags in there and a sponge
on<00:04:14.680> top<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.099> make<00:04:15.220> sure<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.610> nothing<00:04:15.880> goes

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
on top to make sure that nothing goes

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.680 
on top to make sure that nothing goes
through<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.820> all<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.090> all<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.630> very

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
through but all in all this is a very

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.200 
through but all in all this is a very
simple<00:04:20.470> setup<00:04:20.799> it's<00:04:21.250> very<00:04:21.489> nice<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.910> can<00:04:22.030> keep

years<00:05:06.580> ago<00:05:06.730> we<00:05:07.030> thought<00:05:07.270> was<00:05:07.480> great<00:05:07.720> because

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
years ago we thought was great because

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.530 
years ago we thought was great because
we<00:05:08.140> could<00:05:08.410> keep<00:05:08.590> them<00:05:08.800> alive<00:05:09.180> but<00:05:10.180> now<00:05:10.330> that

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
we could keep them alive but now that

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.030 
we could keep them alive but now that
we're<00:05:10.660> really<00:05:10.840> good<00:05:11.140> at<00:05:11.230> keeping<00:05:11.410> anemones

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
we're really good at keeping anemones

alive<00:05:12.370> you'll<00:05:13.240> have<00:05:13.480> a<00:05:13.720> thousand<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.740> them<00:05:14.860> in

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
alive you'll have a thousand of them in

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.680 
alive you'll have a thousand of them in
six<00:05:15.640> months<00:05:15.970> if<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.150> don't<00:05:16.330> do<00:05:16.450> something

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
six months if you don't do something

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.140 
six months if you don't do something
about<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:17.380> they're<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.130> stinging<00:05:18.520> anemone

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
about it and they're a stinging anemone

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.470 
about it and they're a stinging anemone
that<00:05:19.360> stings<00:05:19.660> other<00:05:19.990> anemones<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:20.620> corals

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
that stings other anemones and corals

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.680 
that stings other anemones and corals
okay

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
okay

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.990 
okay
usually<00:05:23.380> mushroom<00:05:23.830> anemones<00:05:24.310> are<00:05:24.490> okay<00:05:24.820> with

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
usually mushroom anemones are okay with

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.240 
usually mushroom anemones are okay with
them<00:05:25.210> because<00:05:25.360> they're<00:05:25.870> they<00:05:26.830> don't<00:05:26.860> seem<00:05:27.190> to

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
them because they're they don't seem to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.190 
them because they're they don't seem to
hurt<00:05:27.460> them<00:05:27.730> but<00:05:28.180> if<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.330> had<00:05:28.450> carpets<00:05:28.930> and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
hurt them but if you had carpets and

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.690 
hurt them but if you had carpets and
stuff<00:05:29.500> like<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:29.920> they'll<00:05:30.190> move<00:05:30.340> away<00:05:30.520> from

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
stuff like that they'll move away from

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.300 
stuff like that they'll move away from
and<00:05:31.240> if<00:05:31.990> you<00:05:32.110> got<00:05:32.260> corals<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.860> stuff<00:05:33.100> your

and if you got corals and stuff your

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.040 
and if you got corals and stuff your
corals<00:05:33.640> will<00:05:33.760> actually<00:05:34.180> never<00:05:34.330> open<00:05:34.870> because

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
corals will actually never open because

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.530 
corals will actually never open because
they're<00:05:35.350> always<00:05:35.470> being<00:05:35.800> stung<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:37.240> what<00:05:37.420> we

butterfly fish they they chew them off
the<00:05:49.930> rock<00:05:50.140> but<00:05:50.410> they<00:05:50.500> leave<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.710> little<00:05:50.950> piece

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
the rock but they leave a little piece

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.620 
the rock but they leave a little piece
on<00:05:51.400> it<00:05:51.580> so<00:05:52.060> then<00:05:52.210> when<00:05:52.330> you<00:05:52.420> take<00:05:52.570> the

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
on it so then when you take the

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.530 
on it so then when you take the
butterfly<00:05:52.960> out<00:05:53.410> then<00:05:53.980> the<00:05:54.190> aphasia<00:05:55.150> comes

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
butterfly out then the aphasia comes

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.900 
butterfly out then the aphasia comes
back<00:05:55.840> there's<00:05:56.530> also<00:05:56.770> a<00:05:56.950> type<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.220> nudibranch

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
back there's also a type of nudibranch

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.360 
back there's also a type of nudibranch
that<00:05:58.180> eats<00:05:58.390> them<00:05:58.690> but<00:05:59.380> you<00:05:59.710> have<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.160> have<00:06:00.340> a

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
that eats them but you have to have a

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.740 
that eats them but you have to have a
supply<00:06:00.880> of<00:06:00.910> baptisia

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
supply of baptisia

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.390 
supply of baptisia
in<00:06:01.930> order<00:06:02.230> to<00:06:02.320> keep<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:02.620> nudibranch<00:06:03.070> alive

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
in order to keep the nudibranch alive

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.280 
in order to keep the nudibranch alive
because<00:06:03.550> it's<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.910> only<00:06:04.030> thing<00:06:04.240> he<00:06:04.390> eats<00:06:04.570> so

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
because it's the only thing he eats so

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.570 
because it's the only thing he eats so
the<00:06:05.440> peppermint<00:06:05.860> shrimp<00:06:05.980> are<00:06:06.250> one<00:06:06.370> of<00:06:06.490> the

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
the peppermint shrimp are one of the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.700 
the peppermint shrimp are one of the
better<00:06:06.730> ones<00:06:07.060> because<00:06:07.900> they<00:06:08.140> don't<00:06:08.320> really

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
better ones because they don't really

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.620 
better ones because they don't really
harm<00:06:08.950> any<00:06:09.100> of<00:06:09.220> your<00:06:09.340> corals<00:06:09.730> you<00:06:10.270> can<00:06:10.450> leave

they got all sorts of concoctions that

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.970 
they got all sorts of concoctions that
you<00:06:25.390> can<00:06:25.540> put<00:06:25.750> in<00:06:25.930> I've<00:06:26.169> heard<00:06:26.740> of<00:06:26.830> people

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
you can put in I've heard of people

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.730 
you can put in I've heard of people
injecting<00:06:27.820> them<00:06:27.970> with<00:06:28.000> the<00:06:28.810> iodine<00:06:29.140> solution

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
injecting them with the iodine solution

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.010 
injecting them with the iodine solution
that<00:06:30.190> doesn't<00:06:30.460> work<00:06:30.700> if<00:06:30.880> you<00:06:31.419> take<00:06:31.630> and<00:06:31.810> pull

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
that doesn't work if you take and pull

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.540 
that doesn't work if you take and pull
them<00:06:32.140> off<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.500> rock<00:06:32.680> all<00:06:32.919> you<00:06:33.130> do<00:06:33.310> is<00:06:33.430> you

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
them off the rock all you do is you

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.240 
them off the rock all you do is you
spread<00:06:33.850> spores<00:06:34.450> and<00:06:34.780> eggs<00:06:35.590> all<00:06:35.919> through<00:06:36.160> the

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
spread spores and eggs all through the

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.510 
spread spores and eggs all through the
tank<00:06:36.490> then<00:06:37.000> you<00:06:37.150> get<00:06:37.270> a<00:06:37.300> population<00:06:37.990> explosion

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
tank then you get a population explosion

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.310 
tank then you get a population explosion
okay<00:06:39.520> so<00:06:40.330> that's<00:06:40.510> why<00:06:40.660> I<00:06:40.750> like<00:06:40.870> peppermint

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
mark on the water change so I'm going to

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.370 
mark on the water change so I'm going to
turn<00:06:48.520> the<00:06:48.700> camera<00:06:48.850> off<00:06:49.090> and<00:06:49.570> we'll<00:06:50.230> see

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
turn the camera off and we'll see

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.280 
turn the camera off and we'll see
