00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.020 
Reeves I believe this is like his first
or<00:05:11.099> second<00:05:11.460> season

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
or second season

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.999 
or second season
I<00:05:12.180> think<00:05:12.780> his<00:05:12.930> second<00:05:13.289> season<00:05:13.470> he's<00:05:13.740> not<00:05:13.979> a

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
I think his second season he's not a

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.339 
I think his second season he's not a
rookie<00:05:14.280> anyway<00:05:14.849> he's<00:05:15.300> still<00:05:15.570> driving<00:05:16.169> down

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
rookie anyway he's still driving down

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.620 
rookie anyway he's still driving down
the<00:05:16.530> field<00:05:16.770> they<00:05:17.490> get<00:05:17.699> a<00:05:17.729> first<00:05:18.060> down<00:05:18.150> on<00:05:18.360> a

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
the field they get a first down on a

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.499 
the field they get a first down on a
third<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.349> 7<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.039> now<00:05:20.639> they<00:05:20.909> have<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.150> first

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
third and 7 and now they have a first

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.020 
third and 7 and now they have a first
and<00:05:21.720> goal<00:05:21.810> dropping<00:05:22.620> back<00:05:22.889> he's<00:05:23.430> looking<00:05:23.849> for

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
and goal dropping back he's looking for

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.390 
and goal dropping back he's looking for
something<00:05:24.270> surveying<00:05:25.139> the<00:05:25.289> field<00:05:25.319> and<00:05:26.130> they

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
something surveying the field and they

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.050 
something surveying the field and they
get<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.759> touchdown<00:05:27.030> oh<00:05:28.460> my<00:05:29.460> gosh<00:05:29.729> can<00:05:30.030> you
