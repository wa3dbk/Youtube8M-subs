00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.159
 minerals 30 it seems to me I'm facing 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.199
 our great friend to my hero who is the 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.239
 proud and noble in the hexagon goatee 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.560
 white and an exclamation point that 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.720
 means he still has a show 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.029
 for me but I knew he always 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.529
 something to confide to me so 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.699
 so we'll talk to him a little bit 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.100
 what did I have to say to you 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.650
 before that we are at the head 30 he 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.090
 there are 70 at the moment and the 30 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.610
 past will be introduced 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.350
 soon but I do not believe that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.100
 it's in the fridge is finally in the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.360
 next extension 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.000
 it will not be the price at the same time 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.130
 west that 3 it seems to me but but that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.190
 will arrive soon so good way 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.630
 I'm still fighting I still have 44 to do 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.680
 by then so it's not in a hurry they are 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.280
 not have to add them all 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.110
 immediately 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.060
 let's go we'll talk to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.489
 improve we'll see what he expects from 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.530
 me my nephew dick tarak has fun often 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.869
 in the northern district made of 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.890
 losing against him will make him happy and 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:13.749
 if he is happy I am 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.829
 yes I got it ok so that's why 

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:17.049
 you see I do not have a lot of 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.700
 lives because I had planned shot I 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.119
 I had a little knowledge of the asset in 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:27.039
 en and leave to lose as much losing the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.679
 as soon as possible so I'll get you 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.399

 in less 59 - 31 something like that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.759
 certainly ofii a bola him is what makes 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 so he sees the dictator 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.999
 actually do it on purpose because I 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.749
 think there is no it does not look 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:02:00.230
 well threatening tanoh savola and I believe 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:04.910

 but I'm going to help him I'm going to hit a 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.890
 little hello to you I beg you to 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.150
 excuse him for the big movements 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.970
 dangerous that the fact is my 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.600
 daily workout you know if 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.320

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.730
 music feydeau pleasure really you want 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.570
 fight with me in this case to return 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.100
 in the house behind 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.160
 me is the room where I train and 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.750
 visually hockey let's go let's fight 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.050
 riots has changed for useful transforming 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.440
 shepherd it was much more classy 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:43.010
 before your level 5a game I'm shaking 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.630
 dalens jean tremblay to have killed ten of 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.850
 life to pop so I pat you 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.270
 well you know the principle 1 the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.300
 goal is to lose we will see how much 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.800
 step it seems to me that they did not 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.220
 many ok already tapas by far we're going 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.680
 go to clinch where he does very 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.420
 very bad 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.870
 fortunately I can type myself otherwise 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.000
 it would be my stripes so we will help him 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.810
 a little no but it's okay at least 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.340
 in less than leila rolls doubled with 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.560
 plus 100% damage 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.739
 it's a crazy life of slap it with 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.780
 hit 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.270
 e can not even let him cows 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.750
 mothers I can not even give him this 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.730
 pleasure 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.800
 I think when he did at least 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.660
 this pitch prestia this can be a 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.390
 critical shot something like that oh 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.360
 No, I'm sorry, you 're too strong for 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.750
 I say tarak I prostrate in front of you 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.850
 in front of your infinite power 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.620
 congratulations in 56 seconds plus he 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.750
 beat me in 5 rounds it's a win 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.980
 overwhelmingly la la la la la 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.110
 I could not face him 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.190
 congratulations if I speak again to juba killed 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.390
 a militiaman when I'm going to tell that 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.460
 my name who will be proud of me yeah I 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.310
 would not like to disappoint 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.930
 I made this your alignment 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.900
 is now 30 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.520
 yes yes to help she's my alignment 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.020
 in ten years of the 30 it is necessary to reach the 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.340
 level 40 for to have another one 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.650
 another bonus went into art of 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.400
 camouflage level 3 scares you me 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.530
 regularly asks 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.810
 it's all well and good what you do but 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.000
 what good is it used to choose a 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.800
 order from level 20 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.440
 when you make the alignment heads 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.590
 from level 20 you can 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.690
 choose to be an order then there is a 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.690
 places that are more focused on strength 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.600
 others over years of invisibility and 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.760
 others on the care of can resurrect 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.650
 the dead I believe me I'm more about 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.450
 visibility camouflage acted suzanne 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.220
 I am part of the order of the eye 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.770
 attentive and I am currently a 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.630
 disciple of sibos g I aim 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.360
 soon to reach the rank of 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.740
 spies silent after hunters 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.270
 remedy and obviously to 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.040
 his supreme and master of illusions 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.780
 nobody can still have them 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.880
 since you have to reach 80 and 100 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.770
 which does not exist yet 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.720
 besides this so it has nothing to do with 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.730
 the wings you can level up 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.790
 without you will not have her hells 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.490
 and do not do aggression but 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.170
 you have bonuses you have bonuses 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.790
 for example I have 5% experience of 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.250
 harvest two mutineers in the areas 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.610
 allies and areas were you going to 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.470
 know since they are these are 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.290
 those low for me who am in heaven 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:41.990
 these are the ones in blue which he 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:43.130
 seems to me yeah if it's not bad but 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.920
 if there is still a lot of brett zone 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.310
 marianne here en tuellement in the field 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.910
 rest here and then all that is 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.520
 all that is good you have exodus there which 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.080
 go up to nothing it's good otherwise is wise to 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.320
 servers and mainly brÃ¢kmar nothing 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.850
 still if I look a little bit if 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.300
 I can go to the Minotaur Island 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.590
 hours is good you have nothing so cd 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.960
 bonus they still have his share the 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.240
 5% know it's not insignificant on a 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.200
 completely passive thing 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.310
 Well, it makes you win a little bit 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.700
 Dictation of loot and harvest 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:23.080
 all that if I say no nonsense I'll 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.300
 check and harvest 6% of the 5% it 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.240
 two seconds ago we went to 6% 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.230
 you know why head is also 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.410
 something here conquest message 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.420
 not good and well very well so a 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.910
 last thing you need to know 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.170
 on the quest I like to do says barak 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.730
 you have to lose against him 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.470
 but be careful not to 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.990
 turn into ghost and have enough 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.730
 of energy to survive a death all 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.820
 just to not die of your 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.370
 dead otherwise it would not validate the head 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.790
 of alignment here is good well I hope 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.780

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.940
 especially you will help find dick

 tarak having left such was really 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.210
 powerful so take a box panoplie 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.800
 if you want to beat it me I have 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.290
 not completed 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.490
