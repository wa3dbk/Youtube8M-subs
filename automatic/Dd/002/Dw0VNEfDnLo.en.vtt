 speak after 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.220
 as we know 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
 1 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 1 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.589
 here is the jingle is now over 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 so then just what is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.050
 nice is that we at the box that is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.369
 really nice we see the smartphone 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.900
 so the iphone 5 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.080
 two sides as for which the new 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.820
 ipad it's something nice so 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.310
 always with a white background sees 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.600
 the iphone before finally it depends 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 white for for iphone 5 white and background 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 black and the black smartphone for the iphone 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.060
 5 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.910
 noah again here is so after this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.220
 who is nice is always it does not open 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.830
 the box we come face to face on the iphone 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.050
 5 which is really lovely that I that 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.899
 I find very very beautiful in white then 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.250
 everyone takes the black but perso 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.840
 I was really for black at 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.770
 beginning but once I saw the white 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:09.450
 I really loved what I loved 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.400
 so that's why so simply 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.489
 after when we are always the same ball 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.680
 we have the base on the little tongue 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.980
 we shoot we went so small fashion 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.590
 Job is below so we the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.570
 modes that are so packed in a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.239
 square is very very nice here 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:35.459
 and so after we have AC adapter and 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:38.780
 the new thread here is the game knows 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.480
 more what is his name 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.810
 I know more saïto I know more 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.810
 here 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.370
 it's not the name that's important it's 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.290
 especially that the cable has really changed 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.629
 in fact what is good is that we can 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.629
 so plug it in both directions and 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.239
 then here I go no more you in 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.760
 speak like that so apart so that well 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.890
 sure the screen sound which is bigger which 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.260
 is now 4 inches so we feel 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.629
 really the difference so a lot of 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.640
 people complain that the screen born and 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.530
 grandis heart length but not in 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.569
 width but I find it all 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.250
 just very very well I think 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.810
 really like that we have a good 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.239
 getting started is really in the hand 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.069
 and especially as I pray for them 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.950
 the first time in the hand but he 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.389
 was so much lighter it's crazy 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.480
 really feel the difference with a 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.620
 iphone 4 or a 4s it's crazy already because 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.370
 that there is more life than two glasses 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.430
 behind and all that so really he 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.769
 lighten up a little bit so here I am 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.420
 nearly finished talking to you that this 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.280
 iphone 5 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.569
 so we'll go to the second part 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.260
 of this video ie the unboxing 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:55.750
 unpacking those of this iphone 5 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.750
 I'll get there go right now 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.860
 so here we are before the very 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.890
 pretty box of this iphone 5 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.100
 so here is the little turn the box 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.960
 so iphone 5 before we have the smartphone 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.610
 so the box and white because everything 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.280
 simply it is white so we make a 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.780
 little trick then the apple 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.930
 so we lost the little logo of to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.450
 icloud who had appeared that he was in 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.740
 permission the iphone 4s 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.880
 So here we are behind 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.830
 characteristics so it's a 16 gigabyte 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.620
 so we open the box of this iphone 5 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.130
 and so we see the iphone 5 well at 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.480
 on it and what a surprise always low 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.590
 in front of the iphone 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.900
 this is it oops you can find on the 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.240
 carpet so really when I took 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.690
 in hand very very very very very light 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.990
 sat super impressed saw what there is 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:05.320
 in it I find that but that's it 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.670
 so how to say so relative by 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.080
 example to the iphone 4 or 4s a device 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.640
 really he is much lighter he has 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.950
 lost his greens life that had 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.900
 behind who really was she very 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.880
 heavy 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:24.880
 so here is behind the good 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.480
 color finally the bicolor though on 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.520
 rumors 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:34.180
 really all so there we have the base with 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.300
 two in all the little papers 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.210
 stickers and everything so we pull and we 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.390
 so has the AC adapter is right at 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.300
 above in a square so we the last 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.120
 buddies but we'll first look at this 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.889
 that there is new or what comes all 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:57.069
 simply in 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:59.680
 the little package then louvre we have the 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.749
 little peak to put the target nano 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.279
 so these new ones because it makes a 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.229
 little pouch now that's 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.479
 slide on the side I find that more 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.029
 nice so we had a good day 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.710
 apple stickers of course we 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.889
 found in all their products 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.289
 so that we can put on the side 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.710
 now let's go inside the 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.529
 box 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:26.409
 we then have that jean my camera 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:28.810
 we have the adapter is that finally 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:32.319
 the two little papers but we have 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.039
 the AC adapter in always in 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:39.340
