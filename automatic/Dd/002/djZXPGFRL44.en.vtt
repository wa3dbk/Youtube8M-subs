the same place so even though I'm

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.449 
the same place so even though I'm
grabbing<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.319> short<00:02:09.560> section<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:09.979> hair<00:02:10.220> I'll

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
grabbing a short section of hair I'll

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.360 
grabbing a short section of hair I'll
stop<00:02:10.700> rolling<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
