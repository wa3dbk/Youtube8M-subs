what I'm thinking is I'm gonna use my
hands<00:00:31.580> as<00:00:31.790> hooks<00:00:32.059> I've<00:00:32.360> said<00:00:32.689> this<00:00:32.809> before<00:00:32.989> and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
hands as hooks I've said this before and

I'm going to pull down through my elbows

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.290 
I'm going to pull down through my elbows
I'm<00:00:37.010> not<00:00:37.250> going<00:00:37.490> to<00:00:37.579> pull<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.970> weight<00:00:38.120> down

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300

allow me to get all the way back and get
a<00:00:45.650> good<00:00:46.040> solid<00:00:46.640> contraction<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:47.660> my<00:00:47.840> left

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
a good solid contraction in my left

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.930 
a good solid contraction in my left
which<00:00:48.350> will<00:00:48.500> give<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:48.770> a<00:00:48.980> thicker<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:49.850> wider

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
which will give you a thicker and wider

which will give you a thicker and wider
back<00:00:50.570> over<00:00:51.440> time

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.950 

and<00:00:56.490> then<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:56.880> two<00:00:57.090> tips<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.750> see

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and then the other two tips you can see

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.270 
and then the other two tips you can see
in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> sign<00:00:58.440> angle<00:00:58.770> they're<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.130> of<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
in the sign angle they're kind of the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
in the sign angle they're kind of the
same<00:00:59.310> but<00:00:59.970> what<00:01:00.150> you<00:01:00.270> want<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.840> keep

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
same but what you want to do is keep

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.070 
same but what you want to do is keep
your<00:01:01.500> chest<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:02.070> when<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.090> doing<00:01:03.420> Latin

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
your chest out when you're doing Latin

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.650 
your chest out when you're doing Latin
movements<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.800> also<00:01:05.370> make<00:01:05.910> sure<00:01:05.940> your<00:01:06.420> back

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
movements and also make sure your back

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.590 
movements and also make sure your back
is<00:01:07.100> rounded<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.370> that<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.850> basically<00:01:09.420> when

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
is rounded like that so basically when

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.820 
is rounded like that so basically when
you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.900> chest<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.440> do<00:01:10.530> both<00:01:10.800> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you have your chest out you do both of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
you have your chest out you do both of
those<00:01:11.100> things<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.910> that<00:01:12.030> allows<00:01:12.300> you<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> get

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
those things but that allows you to get

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.590 
those things but that allows you to get
into<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.200> better<00:01:13.620> position<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.270> full

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
into a better position to get a full

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.180 
into a better position to get a full
contraction<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.440> your<00:01:16.650> lats

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
contraction in your lats

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.770 
contraction in your lats
so<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.729> three<00:01:17.970> most<00:01:18.150> important

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so really the three most important

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
so really the three most important
things<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.950> pull<00:01:20.370> down<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.940> your<00:01:21.000> elbows

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
things are to pull down with your elbows

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
things are to pull down with your elbows
really<00:01:22.140> focus<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> contraction<00:01:23.280> keep

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
really focus on the contraction keep

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.390 
really focus on the contraction keep
your<00:01:24.180> chest<00:01:24.420> out<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.620> arched<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
your chest out and your back arched and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.609 
your chest out and your back arched and
that<00:01:26.760> will<00:01:26.910> give<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.300> some<00:01:27.870> great<00:01:28.020> lat

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
