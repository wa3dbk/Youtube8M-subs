00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.199 
paper with color on one side and white
on<00:00:14.050> the<00:00:14.260> other<00:00:14.460> we're<00:00:15.460> going<00:00:15.700> to<00:00:15.790> start<00:00:16.060> by

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
on the other we're going to start by

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.120 
on the other we're going to start by
taking<00:00:16.420> this<00:00:16.690> left<00:00:17.020> edge<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:17.560> folding<00:00:18.040> it

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
taking this left edge and folding it

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.530 
taking this left edge and folding it
over<00:00:18.220> to<00:00:18.490> this<00:00:18.610> right<00:00:18.850> edge<00:00:21.360> align<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.510> edges

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
over to this right edge align the edges

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.740 
over to this right edge align the edges
nicely<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.439> then<00:00:24.010> make<00:00:24.189> a<00:00:24.220> crease<00:00:24.580> and<00:00:25.480> then

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.550 

unfold<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.880> now<00:00:31.869> we're<00:00:32.020> going<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.290> do<00:00:32.439> the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
unfold and now we're going to do the

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.290 
unfold and now we're going to do the
same<00:00:32.590> thing<00:00:32.980> this<00:00:33.130> way<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:33.400> let's<00:00:33.970> take<00:00:34.120> this

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
same thing this way so let's take this

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.630 
same thing this way so let's take this
top<00:00:34.540> edge<00:00:34.810> and<00:00:35.140> fold<00:00:35.650> it<00:00:35.829> down<00:00:35.950> to<00:00:36.160> this<00:00:36.280> bottom

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
top edge and fold it down to this bottom

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:45.290 
top edge and fold it down to this bottom
edge<00:00:43.140> again<00:00:44.140> just<00:00:44.379> align<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.829> edges<00:00:44.859> nicely

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
edge again just align the edges nicely

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:55.220 
edge again just align the edges nicely
then<00:00:46.300> make<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.629> crease<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.920> then<00:00:49.769> unfold

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.380 

now<00:00:55.920> we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> take<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.790> bottom<00:00:57.239> edge

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
now we're going to take this bottom edge

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
now we're going to take this bottom edge
and<00:00:57.720> we're<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> fold<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.950> up<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.220> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and we're going to fold it up to this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.479 
and we're going to fold it up to this
horizontal<00:00:59.970> crease<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.860> line<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.309> up

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
horizontal crease so just line it up

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.420 
horizontal crease so just line it up
nicely<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.650> can<00:01:04.650> use<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.010> vertical

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
nicely and you can use that vertical

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.010 
nicely and you can use that vertical
crease<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> reference<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
crease as a reference as well for the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.460 
crease as a reference as well for the
middle<00:01:07.909> then<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.119> make<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.420> crease<00:01:10.790> and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
middle then just make the crease and

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
middle then just make the crease and
then<00:01:13.470> turn<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> model<00:01:13.979> over

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.969 

now<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.079> take<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.469> bottom<00:01:19.799> edge

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
now we're going to take the bottom edge

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.580 
now we're going to take the bottom edge
on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.579> left<00:01:20.609> side<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.479> everything<00:01:22.109> left<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
on the left side so everything left of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
on the left side so everything left of
this<00:01:22.710> vertical<00:01:23.189> crease<00:01:23.399> here<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> we're

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
this vertical crease here and we're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.959 
this vertical crease here and we're
going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.899> fold<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.259> side<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.490> align<00:01:26.819> with

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
going to fold this side up to align with

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.090 
going to fold this side up to align with
this<00:01:27.149> vertical<00:01:27.539> crease<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.590> we're<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.859> going

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
this vertical crease so we're just going

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.099 
this vertical crease so we're just going
to<00:01:29.250> bring<00:01:29.429> it<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:30.390> creating<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
to bring it up as if we're creating a

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.830 
to bring it up as if we're creating a
paper<00:01:31.319> airplane<00:01:31.469> and<00:01:32.179> you<00:01:33.179> just<00:01:33.359> align<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
paper airplane and you just align that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
paper airplane and you just align that
entire<00:01:34.170> edge<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.709> vertical<00:01:34.890> crease<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
entire edge with the vertical crease and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.050 
entire edge with the vertical crease and
then<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> crease<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:38.060> you're

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
then you make a crease and then you're

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.370 
then you make a crease and then you're
going<00:01:39.209> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> same<00:01:39.780> thing<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> right

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
going to do the same thing on the right

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to do the same thing on the right
side<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.280> we're<00:01:41.459> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.759> align<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.179> edge

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
side so we're going to align this edge

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.800 
side so we're going to align this edge
here<00:01:42.590> with<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> crease<00:01:44.069> here<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.630> just

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
here with this crease here so we just

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.520 
here with this crease here so we just
bring<00:01:45.959> it<00:01:46.079> over<00:01:46.319> like<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> paper<00:01:46.799> airplane<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
bring it over like a paper airplane and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.589 
bring it over like a paper airplane and
then<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.520> pinch<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.360> make<00:01:51.569> a

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
then you can just pinch and then make a

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.779 
then you can just pinch and then make a
crease<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:55.099> then<00:01:56.099> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.340> flip<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> model

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
crease and then you can flip the model

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.180 
crease and then you can flip the model
over

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.310 

now<00:02:01.910> we're<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.420> take<00:02:02.570> this<00:02:02.750> left<00:02:03.050> edge

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
now we're going to take this left edge

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.470 
now we're going to take this left edge
up<00:02:03.530> here<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.010> we're<00:02:04.670> going<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:04.910> align<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.450> with

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
up here and we're going to align it with

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.630 
up here and we're going to align it with
this<00:02:05.720> vertical<00:02:06.110> crease<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.590> middle<00:02:06.860> so

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
this vertical crease in the middle so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.010 
this vertical crease in the middle so
we're<00:02:07.790> just<00:02:07.820> going<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.240> pull<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.600> whole<00:02:08.750> left

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
we're just going to pull the whole left

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.370 
we're just going to pull the whole left
side<00:02:09.229> over<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.180> pull<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.210> over<00:02:11.450> until<00:02:11.750> that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
side over and pull it over until that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.310 
side over and pull it over until that
edge<00:02:12.620> aligns<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.310> vertical<00:02:13.550> crease

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
edge aligns with the vertical crease

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.460 
edge aligns with the vertical crease
then<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.470> can<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.770> make<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.070> crease<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
then you can just make a crease and it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.740 
then you can just make a crease and it
will<00:02:18.560> look<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:20.450> want<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.690> do

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
will look like that and you want to do

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.480 
will look like that and you want to do
the<00:02:20.870> same<00:02:21.080> thing<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> right<00:02:21.680> side<00:02:21.950> so

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
the same thing on the right side so

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.740 
the same thing on the right side so
we're<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:22.970> align<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.510> edge<00:02:23.720> here

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
we're just going to align this edge here

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.100 
we're just going to align this edge here
put<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.770> vertical<00:02:25.220> crease<00:02:25.460> here<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.930> just

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
put this vertical crease here so just

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.820 
put this vertical crease here so just
pull<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.500> over<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.750> once<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.900> aligns<00:02:30.230> then<00:02:30.710> you

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
pull it over and once it aligns then you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.930 
pull it over and once it aligns then you
can<00:02:30.980> make<00:02:31.130> your<00:02:31.190> crease<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.860> that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.910 

now<00:02:37.600> we're<00:02:37.780> going<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.020> take<00:02:38.230> these<00:02:38.410> two<00:02:38.680> top

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
now we're going to take these two top

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.430 
now we're going to take these two top
corners<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.490> fold<00:02:39.760> them<00:02:39.940> down<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> let's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
corners and fold them down so let's

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.020 
corners and fold them down so let's
start<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:41.920> top<00:02:42.190> left<00:02:42.490> corner<00:02:42.760> and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
start with this top left corner and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.270 
start with this top left corner and
we're<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:43.990> going<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.320> bring<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.890> top<00:02:45.250> edge

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
we're just going to bring this top edge

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.550 
we're just going to bring this top edge
here<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.000> we're<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.020> align<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.530> with

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
here and we're going to align it with

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.920 
here and we're going to align it with
this<00:02:47.800> vertical<00:02:48.250> crease<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.690> edge<00:02:49.900> here

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
this vertical crease and this edge here

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.140 
this vertical crease and this edge here
will<00:02:50.560> align<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.460> top<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:51.910> flap

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
will align with the top of this flap

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.800 
will align with the top of this flap
here<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.680> basically<00:02:54.460> this<00:02:54.610> top<00:02:54.940> corner<00:02:55.390> will

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
here so basically this top corner will

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.760 
here so basically this top corner will
end<00:02:55.990> up<00:02:56.140> right<00:02:56.440> there<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.060> pull<00:02:58.300> it<00:02:58.420> down

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
end up right there so just pull it down

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.170 
end up right there so just pull it down
make<00:02:59.770> sure<00:02:59.800> that<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.250> edge<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.640> line<00:03:00.910> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
make sure that the edge is a line and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.500 
make sure that the edge is a line and
that<00:03:01.540> tip<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.020> right<00:03:02.350> in<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.620> middle<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.510> then

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
that tip is right in the middle and then

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.610 
that tip is right in the middle and then
you<00:03:04.660> can<00:03:04.810> just<00:03:04.960> make<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> crease<00:03:05.710> just<00:03:07.620> like

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you can just make a crease just like

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.530 
you can just make a crease just like
that<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.040> you're<00:03:09.880> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.330> same

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
that and you're going to do the same

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.300 
that and you're going to do the same
thing<00:03:10.750> on<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:10.990> one<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.740> just<00:03:11.950> make<00:03:12.130> sure<00:03:12.160> that

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
thing on this one so just make sure that

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.160 
thing on this one so just make sure that
this<00:03:12.520> edge<00:03:12.760> lines<00:03:13.120> up<00:03:13.330> with<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.660> edge<00:03:13.900> and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
this edge lines up with this edge and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.250 
this edge lines up with this edge and
this<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.040> lines<00:03:15.370> up<00:03:15.520> with<00:03:15.670> this<00:03:15.820> edge<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:17.080> just

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
this one lines up with this edge so just

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.090 
this one lines up with this edge so just
pull<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.560> down<00:03:18.300> line<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.480> edges<00:03:19.510> up<00:03:20.070> make<00:03:21.070> sure

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
pull it down line the edges up make sure

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.040 
pull it down line the edges up make sure
the<00:03:21.370> points<00:03:21.700> in<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.880> middle<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.270> then<00:03:22.780> make<00:03:23.020> a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
the points in the middle and then make a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.490 
the points in the middle and then make a
crease<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:25.450> will<00:03:25.570> look<00:03:25.690> like<00:03:25.840> this

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.230 

now<00:03:29.620> we're<00:03:29.830> going<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.070> take<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.460> top<00:03:30.730> tip<00:03:31.060> and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
now we're going to take this top tip and

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.530 
now we're going to take this top tip and
fold<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.750> down<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.200> bottom<00:03:32.350> tip<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:34.330> just

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
fold it down to the bottom tip so just

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.980 
fold it down to the bottom tip so just
align<00:03:34.870> those<00:03:35.080> tips<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:36.390> then<00:03:37.390> you'll<00:03:37.690> notice

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
align those tips and then you'll notice

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.560 
align those tips and then you'll notice
that<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.260> model<00:03:38.590> really<00:03:38.830> won't<00:03:39.130> lie<00:03:39.340> flat<00:03:39.640> so

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
that the model really won't lie flat so

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.360 
that the model really won't lie flat so
what<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:41.020> want<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.650> open<00:03:41.950> up<00:03:42.160> these

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
what we want to do is open up these

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.250 
what we want to do is open up these
little<00:03:42.670> pockets<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.240> bit<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.960> can<00:03:44.110> see

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
little pockets a bit so that you can see

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.620 
little pockets a bit so that you can see
the<00:03:44.380> white<00:03:44.590> inside<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.130> them<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.480> what<00:03:46.480> we're

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
the white inside of them and what we're

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.720 
the white inside of them and what we're
going<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.900> do<00:03:47.050> is<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.560> edge<00:03:48.130> here<00:03:48.160> that<00:03:48.640> you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
going to do is this edge here that you

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.180 
going to do is this edge here that you
can<00:03:48.850> almost<00:03:49.030> see<00:03:49.300> you're<00:03:50.110> going<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.620> flatten

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
can almost see you're going to flatten

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.449 
can almost see you're going to flatten
that<00:03:51.310> out<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:51.970> we<00:03:52.570> just<00:03:52.780> push<00:03:53.650> down<00:03:53.680> along<00:03:54.250> that

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
that out so we just push down along that

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.840 
that out so we just push down along that
edge<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:56.470> can<00:03:56.650> keep<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.040> other<00:03:57.190> part<00:03:57.730> of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
edge and you can keep the other part of

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.630 
edge and you can keep the other part of
the<00:03:57.970> flap<00:03:58.240> in<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.540> air<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.530> will<00:03:59.740> be<00:03:59.770> 3d<00:04:00.370> and

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
the flap in the air so it will be 3d and

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.240 
the flap in the air so it will be 3d and
it<00:04:00.880> won't<00:04:01.060> lie<00:04:01.180> flat<00:04:01.450> just<00:04:01.690> yet<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.950> now<00:04:03.100> we'll

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
it won't lie flat just yet so now we'll

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.979 
it won't lie flat just yet so now we'll
do<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.489> same<00:04:03.670> thing<00:04:03.850> over<00:04:03.940> here<00:04:04.090> we'll<00:04:04.780> just

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
do the same thing over here we'll just

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.449 
do the same thing over here we'll just
basically<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.830> push<00:04:06.160> down<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:08.459> don't

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
basically just push down and don't

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.900 
basically just push down and don't
flatten<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:10.030> just<00:04:10.360> yet

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.240 

now<00:04:13.660> we're<00:04:13.840> going<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.110> squash<00:04:14.470> down<00:04:14.740> these<00:04:14.950> two

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
now we're going to squash down these two

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.570 
now we're going to squash down these two
3d<00:04:15.760> flaps<00:04:16.200> so<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.260> do<00:04:17.709> this<00:04:17.739> we're<00:04:18.190> just<00:04:18.220> going

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
3d flaps so to do this we're just going

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.340 
3d flaps so to do this we're just going
to<00:04:18.640> pull<00:04:18.880> these<00:04:19.000> two<00:04:19.269> edges<00:04:19.480> apart<00:04:20.050> from<00:04:20.230> each

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
to pull these two edges apart from each

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.560 
to pull these two edges apart from each
other<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.830> you'll<00:04:21.790> notice<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.150> there's<00:04:22.480> a

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
other and you'll notice that there's a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.530 
other and you'll notice that there's a
crease<00:04:22.840> running<00:04:23.200> on<00:04:23.350> this<00:04:23.530> colored<00:04:23.890> part<00:04:24.190> here

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
crease running on this colored part here

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.880 
crease running on this colored part here
so<00:04:25.540> what<00:04:25.840> we<00:04:25.960> want<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.170> do<00:04:26.290> with<00:04:26.410> this<00:04:26.560> crease

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
so what we want to do with this crease

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.700 
so what we want to do with this crease
is<00:04:27.130> align<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.640> with<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.850> edge<00:04:28.090> down<00:04:28.360> here<00:04:28.750> so

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
is align it with this edge down here so

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.150 
is align it with this edge down here so
just<00:04:30.040> align<00:04:30.580> those<00:04:30.940> two<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.740> then<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.980> can

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
just align those two and then you can

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.710 
just align those two and then you can
just<00:04:33.310> flatten<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.790> paper<00:04:34.000> on<00:04:34.240> either<00:04:34.390> side

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
just flatten the paper on either side

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.530 
just flatten the paper on either side
and<00:04:35.640> we're<00:04:36.640> going<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.880> do<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.150> same<00:04:37.180> thing

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
and we're going to do the same thing

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.570 
and we're going to do the same thing
over<00:04:37.630> here<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:38.830> can<00:04:38.950> just<00:04:39.100> pull<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.430> two

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
over here so we can just pull the two

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.080 
over here so we can just pull the two
edges<00:04:39.700> apart<00:04:40.320> notice<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.470> crease<00:04:41.800> here<00:04:42.090> I'll

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
edges apart notice this crease here I'll

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.570 
edges apart notice this crease here I'll
line<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.360> with<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.690> edge<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.170> then<00:04:45.130> just<00:04:45.370> make

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
line it with the edge and then just make

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.020 
line it with the edge and then just make
two<00:04:45.970> creases<00:04:46.240> on<00:04:46.630> either<00:04:46.930> side<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:48.030> it'll

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
two creases on either side and it'll

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.210 
two creases on either side and it'll
look<00:04:49.150> like<00:04:49.330> this

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.400 

now<00:04:53.000> we're<00:04:53.180> going<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.510> take<00:04:53.660> this<00:04:53.840> top<00:04:54.110> layer

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
now we're going to take this top layer

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.380 
now we're going to take this top layer
and<00:04:54.710> we're<00:04:55.160> going<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.520> pull<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.360> we

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
and we're going to pull it up so that we

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.870 
and we're going to pull it up so that we
can<00:04:56.600> see<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.870> layer<00:04:57.050> underneath<00:04:57.470> in<00:04:57.890> the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
can see the layer underneath in the

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.430 
can see the layer underneath in the
layer<00:04:59.090> underneath<00:04:59.510> you'll<00:05:00.110> notice<00:05:00.320> that

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
layer underneath you'll notice that

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.980 
layer underneath you'll notice that
there's<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.860> color<00:05:01.100> triangle<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.990> the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
there's a color triangle and the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.350 
there's a color triangle and the
triangle<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.650> pocket<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.850> can<00:05:05.120> put<00:05:05.270> your

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
triangle is a pocket so you can put your

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.440 
triangle is a pocket so you can put your
finger<00:05:05.690> inside<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:06.290> and<00:05:07.030> what<00:05:08.030> we're<00:05:08.150> going<00:05:08.180> to

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
finger inside it and what we're going to

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.450 
finger inside it and what we're going to
do<00:05:08.600> with<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.930> pocket<00:05:09.170> is<00:05:09.530> we're<00:05:10.220> going<00:05:10.340> to

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
do with that pocket is we're going to

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.970 
do with that pocket is we're going to
take<00:05:10.700> this<00:05:11.030> top<00:05:11.330> layer<00:05:11.630> and<00:05:11.960> we're<00:05:12.620> going<00:05:12.860> to

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
take this top layer and we're going to

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.060 
take this top layer and we're going to
place<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.220> inside<00:05:13.490> so<00:05:14.090> just<00:05:14.750> pull<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.860> top

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
place it inside so just pull the top

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.050 
place it inside so just pull the top
layer<00:05:16.340> down<00:05:16.670> into<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.240> pocket<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.520> then<00:05:19.520> just

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
layer down into the pocket and then just

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.540 
layer down into the pocket and then just
flatten<00:05:20.660> it<00:05:20.750> out<00:05:20.870> so<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.740> it's<00:05:21.890> inside<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
flatten it out so that it's inside the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.000 
flatten it out so that it's inside the
pocket<00:05:22.910> nicely<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:24.290> will<00:05:24.410> end<00:05:24.440> up<00:05:24.680> looking

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
pocket nicely and it will end up looking

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.110 
pocket nicely and it will end up looking
like<00:05:25.040> this

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.150 

now<00:05:28.750> we're<00:05:28.960> going<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.229> take<00:05:29.440> these<00:05:29.650> two<00:05:29.889> top

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
now we're going to take these two top

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.560 
now we're going to take these two top
corners<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.760> we're<00:05:30.910> going<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.150> fold<00:05:31.419> them

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
corners and we're going to fold them

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.140 
corners and we're going to fold them
down<00:05:31.889> so<00:05:32.889> let's<00:05:33.070> start<00:05:33.310> with<00:05:33.460> this<00:05:33.580> top<00:05:33.850> left

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
down so let's start with this top left

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.060 
down so let's start with this top left
corner<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.690> we're<00:05:35.229> going<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.530> bring<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:35.860> down

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
corner and we're going to bring it down

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.939 
corner and we're going to bring it down
so<00:05:36.669> that<00:05:36.699> this<00:05:37.030> top<00:05:37.330> edge<00:05:37.360> lines<00:05:38.320> up<00:05:38.560> with<00:05:38.800> this

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
so that this top edge lines up with this

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.060 
so that this top edge lines up with this
edge<00:05:39.160> here<00:05:40.139> so<00:05:41.139> we'll<00:05:41.380> just<00:05:41.440> align<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:42.040> edges

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
edge here so we'll just align the edges

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.150 
edge here so we'll just align the edges
and<00:05:44.190> then<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.310> can<00:05:45.430> make<00:05:45.610> a<00:05:45.639> crease<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:47.160> you

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
and then you can make a crease and you

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.280 
and then you can make a crease and you
do<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.430> same<00:05:48.460> thing<00:05:48.669> over<00:05:48.910> here<00:05:49.090> so<00:05:50.050> we<00:05:50.080> can

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
do the same thing over here so we can

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.200 
do the same thing over here so we can
just<00:05:50.410> align<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.889> edges<00:05:50.919> and<00:05:51.400> then<00:05:51.610> this<00:05:51.880> point

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
just align the edges and then this point

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.020 
just align the edges and then this point
will<00:05:52.449> end<00:05:52.600> up<00:05:52.750> being<00:05:52.780> right<00:05:53.290> there<00:05:53.580> so<00:05:54.580> just

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
will end up being right there so just

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.790 
will end up being right there so just
pull<00:05:55.300> that<00:05:55.330> down<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:58.229> you<00:05:59.229> can<00:05:59.380> just<00:05:59.530> make<00:05:59.770> a

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
pull that down and you can just make a

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.390 
pull that down and you can just make a
crease<00:06:00.160> as<00:06:00.610> soon<00:06:00.910> as<00:06:01.030> it<00:06:01.180> align

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.950 

now<00:06:04.550> we're<00:06:04.729> going<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:05.000> take<00:06:05.210> these<00:06:05.389> two<00:06:05.690> top

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
now we're going to take these two top

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.830 
now we're going to take these two top
points<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:06.530> we're<00:06:06.770> going<00:06:06.979> to<00:06:07.070> fold<00:06:07.250> them<00:06:07.430> down

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
points and we're going to fold them down

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.330 
points and we're going to fold them down
so<00:06:08.840> let's<00:06:09.050> start<00:06:09.259> with<00:06:09.380> this<00:06:09.530> top<00:06:09.770> left<00:06:10.070> point

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
so let's start with this top left point

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.219 
so let's start with this top left point
and<00:06:10.580> we're<00:06:11.150> just<00:06:11.300> going<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.720> fold<00:06:11.900> it<00:06:12.020> down
