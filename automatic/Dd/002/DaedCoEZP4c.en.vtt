new<00:00:06.810> windows<00:00:07.680> phone<00:00:07.710> has<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:08.460> for<00:00:08.610> example

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
new windows phone has one for example

new windows phone has one for example
but<00:00:09.630> here<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.080> galaxy<00:00:10.440> s5<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.160> see

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
but here on the galaxy s5 we can see

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.280 
but here on the galaxy s5 we can see
that<00:00:11.519> Samsung<00:00:11.940> has<00:00:12.210> implemented<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.019> new

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
that Samsung has implemented a new

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.560 
that Samsung has implemented a new
version<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.400> actually<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:15.030> quite

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
version and one that actually is quite

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.260 
version and one that actually is quite
clever<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.130> we've<00:00:17.250> got<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.730> access

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
clever so what we've got here is access

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.840 
clever so what we've got here is access
to<00:00:18.529> complete<00:00:19.529> settings<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.490> limit

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
to complete settings so you can limit

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.570 
to complete settings so you can limit
the<00:00:21.000> amount<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.480> time<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> day<00:00:22.260> your<00:00:22.890> child<00:00:23.189> can

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the amount of time a day your child can

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580 
the amount of time a day your child can
use<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> phone<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.300> people<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.140> kids<00:00:25.439> will

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
use a phone and people with kids will

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.900 
use a phone and people with kids will
understand<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.160> an<00:00:26.279> important<00:00:26.699> feature

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
understand that's an important feature

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.990 
understand that's an important feature
because<00:00:27.720> kids<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> play<00:00:29.130> games<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
because kids do like to play games and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
because kids do like to play games and
they<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.330> play<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.720> hours<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.230> end<00:00:31.289> so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
they can play them for hours on end so

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.430 
they can play them for hours on end so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
which i think is obviously pretty clear

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
which i think is obviously pretty clear
from<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> visual<00:01:00.449> style<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.649> wouldn't

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
from the visual style of it you wouldn't

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.830
