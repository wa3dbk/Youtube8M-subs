00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.330
 hello I'm red lines today I'm going to 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.460
 make a video about some techniques of 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.380
 how to wash our hair depending on 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.840
 the need that we have if we have 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.930
 place vegetables or if we have tents or 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.540
 if we want the tips very dry it will 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.550
 be a more short video possible I do not know 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.200
 if you can cover all the questions or 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.330
 needs that they made on my page 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.270
 of facebook but in addition to the interior 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.430
 let's start when especially for 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.260
 we have the oily scalp that 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.370
 is one of the reasons to the ones I 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.750
 they write or they have dandruff or they have 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.989
 disability is one of the alternatives 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.910
 what we have is the lemon juice that is 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.970
 super natural of lemon lugo is the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.740
 make citric acid because they help 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.200
 clean and exfoliate the scalp 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.630
 if they are very sensitive and have the leather 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.920
 fatty hair I recommend you 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.989
 dilute this juice a little with water 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.630
 You can apply it in the following way 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.979
 we can use a brochita 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.189
 and they are going placing placing in the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.560
 scalp only this is going to 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.829
 do with the hair before washing and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.630
 they are going to place them directly on the 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:25.569
 scalp that is the affected area 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.280
 Another alternative that is my favorite is 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:32.090
 apple cider vinegar 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.490
 has a 5% acidity this is going to help 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.159
 to stabilize the ph of the hair on 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.599
 all when there is no chemical process and 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.709
 the scalp is very alkaline 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.330
 then apply vinegar apple A 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.319
 of the alternatives that I give them is 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:52.000
 they invest in a package so and 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.000
 then you place the capital 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.750
 and it's easier to apply 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.750
 to apply 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.770
 and they are floating 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.720
 this can be left between 5 or 10 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.060
 minutes depending on the tolerance that 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.790
 have the apple cider vinegar also if 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.290
 is very sensitive dilute the now if 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.450
 you have an injury the color 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.950
 scalp or not inflamed go to the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.590
 dermatologist these are home remedies 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.780
 are tips to give advice do not use it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.830
 if they feel they have a situation 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.850
 much more serious or more careful this 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.120
 is in the case of having the leather 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.879
 fatty scalp 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.030
 I have a lot of dandruff if they are going to use us 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.730
 an anti-dandruff shampoo for example this 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.010
 has to be with a sun can do 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.950
 the following with local shampoo in the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.280
 container they apply to the scalp 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.890
 and let him act for 5 minutes and 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.989
 then the regular use shampoo in which 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.239
 usually she uses that they are going to 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.280
 use in the media and tips 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.900
 in this way they use what they need 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.120
 on the scalp they fight 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.160
 policies for to regulate fat and 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.990
 a much more emollient shampoo for 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.860
 long and point 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.860
 to cut 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.430
 that they placed as to collect the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.889
 hair if they have it too dry and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.319
 this part have it normal natural no 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.180
 they have my fat or very dry one 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.700
 option that I give them is that they use some 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.939
 intensive conditioner while 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.810
 higher quality better still they will use 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.500
 the product with the unwashed hair like this 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.959
 how is it 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.400
 as is before washing and start to 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.999
 apply it in areas where there is a lot 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.609
 more dry more porous more needy 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.230
 this is a way that the hair is 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.519
 agree when I do not even know how 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.870
 have hair when they go to the beach 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.419
 the pool that I told them that hair 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.120
 It was a sponge because if your hair is 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.519
 dry and absorb both salt and chlorine 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.109
 when they go to the pool they also absorb 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.609
 the benefits of the cream bath that 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.829
 you are using if you 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.169
 they have very badly treated hair use it 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.480
 before washing it seems to be a lie but 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.790
 it works they apply it in large 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.930
 amounts in generous amount do 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.390
 all the long 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.390
 of the hair they are applying 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.109
 they let them act for 10 to 15 minutes and 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.299
 then wash if you can place a 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.440
 bathing cap 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.220
 I'm going to use the danny one in which 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.220
 has hello kitty 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.960
 and they leave it for 20 minutes is not 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.780
 necessary to leave it half an hour or 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.340
 sleep with products in the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.450
 hair unless you have it 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.880
 formulated for that for that function 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.370
 when they go to apply the shampoo they have 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.180
 than having pretty wet hair and 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.120
 make sure you distribute it in different 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.450
 parts and not place them in one place 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.900
 because there you can then create dandruff or 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.300
 create irritation and when massage in the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.470
 scalp use the yolk of the 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.570
 fingers do not use the nails and there is shampoo 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.420
 that they need to give it too much healthier 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.969
 but they just apply it and can 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.239
 let it rest 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.549
 in the case of the nutritious shampoos that 

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:18.279
 they have very expensive components very 

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:20.649
 luxurious is good to let it rest 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.839
 five minutes that those nutrients act 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:24.939
 because that will condition the hair 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.429
 if you apply them, rub them and 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:30.069
 once flounder are being wasted 

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:32.879
 in the properties of the shampoo then 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.469
 well let's rinse it and let's 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.249
 demonstrate also how to condition the 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.999
 hair 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:43.669
 If you have already taken the shampoo and have not 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.349
 Modified conditioner will dry a 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.179
 little hair and apply on the 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.449
 condition the conditioner in this 

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:53.239
 moment now if you already used the bathroom 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.009
 cream before shampoo we do not apply 

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:57.109
 conditioned again because it's going to 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.109
 get very heavy hair apply the 

00:05:57.109 --> 00:06:02.720
 conditioner and it is and many times in 

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:05.570
 this moment happens 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.640
 how long this hair long hair 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.110
 that is entangled in the length of 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.270
 hair especially those that have it 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.010
 very long 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.690
 sometimes it is that the hair that is 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.520
 let go then how do we 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.690
 movements as it ends falling off 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.880
 hair if you exceed you notice that there 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.380
 too much fall so go to the doctor 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.050
 every way I have a video can 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.660
 I can only place here where all the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.300
 causes the reasons for the fall of 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.420
 hair and how to prevent them also good 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.300
 in my case this is already I will not use 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.060
 conditioner but if I'm going to place 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.130
 a product 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.800
 in my case I 'm going to use this 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.310
 product that is called fits one for 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.080
 curly hair without rinsing and I'm going 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.570
 to place in the hair sometimes I need 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.210
 more quantity because I have abundant with 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:07:00.130
 the hair without excess water start 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:02.280
 to apply the tips upwards and 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.600
 strand by strands a job well 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.210
 This is generally done in detail 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.950
 beauty salons because I do not know 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.400
 can saturate the hair these are 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:14.290
 specialized products to recover 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.919
 the hair when it is very processed or 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.930
 is very mistreated are enough 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.110
 expensive this was brought to me from 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.669
 united states of europe sorry and here 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.560
 in venezuela there are few places where 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.960
 you get it costs like thousand 300 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.330
 bolivars each container and have little 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.220
 quantity but really its benefits 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.260
 they are many so if anyone has the 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.190
 opportunity to acquire it but it must be 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.370
 applied by a professional 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.870
