00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay so first off let's start with the

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.309 
okay so first off let's start with the
leg<00:00:02.939> muscles<00:00:03.449> will<00:00:03.629> run<00:00:03.810> through<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.140> really

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
leg muscles will run through this really

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.200 
leg muscles will run through this really
fast<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.190> gastrin<00:00:05.609> emius<00:00:05.970> right

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
fast this is the gastrin emius right

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.970 
fast this is the gastrin emius right
here<00:00:06.480> dorsal<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.080> ventral<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:07.649> see<00:00:07.890> it

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
here dorsal and ventral you can see it

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.900 
here dorsal and ventral you can see it
pretty<00:00:08.010> easily<00:00:08.400> both<00:00:08.849> sides<00:00:10.040> we<00:00:11.040> have<00:00:11.280> from

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
pretty easily both sides we have from

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.539 
pretty easily both sides we have from
the<00:00:12.150> ventral<00:00:12.599> view<00:00:12.769> notice<00:00:13.769> there<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.009> no<00:00:14.099> anus

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the ventral view notice there is no anus

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.919 
the ventral view notice there is no anus
here<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:14.910> that's<00:00:15.059> how<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.210> know<00:00:15.450> whether<00:00:15.750> its

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
here so that's how you know whether its

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.099 
here so that's how you know whether its
dorsal<00:00:16.260> eventual<00:00:16.740> anuses<00:00:17.520> dorsal<00:00:18.029> no<00:00:18.630> anus<00:00:18.930> is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
dorsal eventual anuses dorsal no anus is

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.210 
dorsal eventual anuses dorsal no anus is
ventral<00:00:19.820> we<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.810> tibialis

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
ventral we have right here the tibialis

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
ventral we have right here the tibialis
antic<00:00:23.220> kiss<00:00:23.820> longest<00:00:24.810> underneath<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
antic kiss longest underneath that the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.099 
antic kiss longest underneath that the
tibialis<00:00:25.800> antis<00:00:26.400> brevis<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.930> there's

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
tibialis antis brevis and then there's

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.019 
tibialis antis brevis and then there's
another<00:00:28.170> muscle<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.920> towards<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> tip<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
another muscle up towards the tip of the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
another muscle up towards the tip of the
tibia<00:00:30.240> fibula<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.410> called<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
tibia fibula which is called the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
tibia fibula which is called the
extensor<00:00:33.239> kurus<00:00:33.840> let<00:00:34.079> me<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.620> find

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
extensor kurus let me see if I can find

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.420 
extensor kurus let me see if I can find
that<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:36.500> okay<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:37.980> flip<00:00:38.219> this

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that right here okay so if we flip this

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.900 
that right here okay so if we flip this
over<00:00:40.280> then<00:00:41.450> we<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.950> peroneus<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
over then we have the peroneus on the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.049 
over then we have the peroneus on the
other<00:00:45.030> side<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.670> then<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.149> have

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
other side and then from that we have

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
other side and then from that we have
the<00:00:51.949> tibial<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.750> tibial<00:00:54.750> vein<00:00:56.660> right<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.920> so

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the tibial or tibial vein right here so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
the tibial or tibial vein right here so
from<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> M<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:01.109> all

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
from that that's all the M that's all

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.380 
from that that's all the M that's all
the<00:01:01.350> shins<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.789> them<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> we

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the shins of this thing have them and we

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.320 
the shins of this thing have them and we
are<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.589> dorsal<00:01:05.220> view<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.090> have

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
are on the dorsal view so what we have

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.010 
are on the dorsal view so what we have
here<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:10.820> semimembranosus

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
here is we have the semimembranosus

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.890 
here is we have the semimembranosus
underneath<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.970> something<00:01:15.720> else

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
underneath that we have something else

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
underneath that we have something else
semi<00:01:16.830> wind<00:01:17.490> enosis<00:01:18.210> where<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.380> synergies

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
semi wind enosis where is the synergies

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.649 
semi wind enosis where is the synergies
spray<00:01:21.560> heading

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.050 

right<00:01:29.659> through<00:01:29.869> here<00:01:29.899> is<00:01:30.140> some<00:01:30.409> I<00:01:30.500> tendinosis

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.300

let's<00:02:34.310> go<00:02:34.519> there<00:02:34.760> ok<00:02:35.600> ok<00:02:36.109> so<00:02:36.859> gracilis<00:02:37.609> major

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
let's go there ok ok so gracilis major

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.440 
let's go there ok ok so gracilis major
ok<00:02:39.769> with<00:02:40.069> these<00:02:40.220> large<00:02:40.459> frogs<00:02:40.850> we<00:02:41.299> are

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
ok with these large frogs we are

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.140 
ok with these large frogs we are
actually<00:02:42.069> with<00:02:43.069> these<00:02:43.190> large<00:02:43.459> frogs<00:02:43.790> they

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
actually with these large frogs they

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.370 
actually with these large frogs they
have<00:02:44.359> something<00:02:44.810> here<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.019> looks<00:02:45.230> like<00:02:45.290> a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
have something here it looks like a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.160 
have something here it looks like a
muscle<00:02:45.650> split<00:02:46.069> ignore<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.910> we<00:02:47.840> don't<00:02:47.989> know

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
muscle split ignore it we don't know

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.229 
muscle split ignore it we don't know
yeah<00:02:48.410> that's<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:51.440> entire<00:02:51.859> muscle<00:02:52.670> here<00:02:53.090> is

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
yeah that's this entire muscle here is

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.349 
yeah that's this entire muscle here is
the<00:02:53.450> gracilis<00:02:53.630> major<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.310> gracilis<00:02:55.489> minor<00:02:56.060> is

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
the gracilis major the gracilis minor is

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.300 
the gracilis major the gracilis minor is
on<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:57.049> outside<00:02:57.380> near<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.680> skin<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.190> it's

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
on the outside near the skin and it's

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.610 
on the outside near the skin and it's
almost<00:02:58.760> negligible<00:02:59.569> but<00:03:00.079> here's<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.410> piece<00:03:00.590> of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
almost negligible but here's a piece of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.770 
almost negligible but here's a piece of
it<00:03:01.510> ya<00:03:02.650> Sartorius<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:04.639> long<00:03:04.940> sheet<00:03:05.510> like

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
it ya Sartorius is this long sheet like

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.250 
it ya Sartorius is this long sheet like
muscle<00:03:06.260> right<00:03:06.440> here<00:03:06.500> or<00:03:07.400> over<00:03:08.239> here<00:03:08.329> right<00:03:08.930> or

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
muscle right here or over here right or

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.720 
muscle right here or over here right or
over<00:03:09.560> here<00:03:09.620> well<00:03:10.010> yeah<00:03:10.220> there's<00:03:10.489> two<00:03:10.579> legs<00:03:10.790> ok

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.479 

okay<00:03:15.150> underneath<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.840> Sartorius<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.950> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
okay underneath the Sartorius on the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.670 
okay underneath the Sartorius on the
upper<00:03:17.670> side<00:03:18.030> you'll<00:03:18.480> find<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:19.849> excuse<00:03:20.849> me<00:03:21.030> the
