00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
holder there can anyone tell me what

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:48.710 
holder there can anyone tell me what
that<00:04:47.909> is

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
that is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.680 
that is
I<00:04:49.669> know<00:04:50.669> what<00:04:50.849> that<00:04:51.060> is

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
I think that's like 3G so I write down

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.129 
I think that's like 3G so I write down
powers<00:05:11.039> on<00:05:13.129> piece
