00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
the United States Baker so it obviously

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.920 
the United States Baker so it obviously
didn't<00:01:06.430> have<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.580> very<00:01:06.820> good<00:01:07.000> team<00:01:07.299> so<00:01:07.600> it<00:01:07.810> was

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
didn't have a very good team so it was

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.020 
didn't have a very good team so it was
very<00:01:08.110> hard<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.590> recruit<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.189> best<00:01:09.220> American

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
very hard to recruit the best American

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.539 
very hard to recruit the best American
talent<00:01:10.509> because<00:01:10.840> they<00:01:11.530> had<00:01:11.680> an<00:01:11.799> awful<00:01:12.159> record

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
talent because they had an awful record

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.010 
talent because they had an awful record
and<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:12.939> no<00:01:13.060> one<00:01:13.210> was<00:01:13.299> going<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.570> come<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:13.840> play

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
and so no one was going to come and play

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.620 
and so no one was going to come and play
but<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.950> beginning<00:01:15.250> I<00:01:15.430> probably<00:01:15.820> had<00:01:16.180> six<00:01:16.450> or

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630
