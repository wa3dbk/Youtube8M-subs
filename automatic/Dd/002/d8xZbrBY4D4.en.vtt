 only good still relatively mild the five best 8 degrees Werne Narva would do so 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.740
 It looks like it's going to be the weather again and now, of course, we're watching 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.800
 Once it has become like theft, it looks like the NLZ in full glory

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.650

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.140
 And last but not least, there is another one that you are interested in watching and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.560
 Also a serenade from the old days but with very strong support 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.900
 from days Justus Norden 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.900
 because with you live in the late work 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.989
 There is already a year here or here in Schneeberg 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.439
 bit freed 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.859
 and it gets colder and colder we already played well today 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.600
 Soon it will be really frosty in Saxony but 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.080
 that of course later in the weather report 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
 I stand here as in the marketplace of Schneeberg and here are already 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.850
 a lot of miners are gathered again and among them is our today 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.320
 Child's Candle is the mag of what is revealed in the Mark Bastl 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.240
 that was nice stage experience 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.190
 and also piano plays that helped Markus Fahrensmann where you have 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.229
 already 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.449
 stood on stage 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:47.249
 Markus I give the light for the eleven after the show My now we want 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.409
 see if she shines afterwards we hope that it goes well and the detailed 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.409
 Weather report that is synonymous then at the end of the program so discuss 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:57.619
 Thanks to a Schneeberger the tricks have come up with snow conditions 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.619
 so that the eleven is easy to see 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.189
 He first wanted to say that you are here a bit 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.159
 I had to take care of so many people with each other 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.909
 burning 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:08.989
 because torches 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.159
 that one does not light one another here and keep an eye on it 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.299
 did you tell her the procedure of the 11 and the weather report there is 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.279
 equal 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.170
 including the 10 severe frost in the next few days 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.139
 These are temperatures up to minus 15 degrees at night in the Ernst Mountains 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.989
 that could be the world's cold zones next week and we'll look 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.430
 Something happens tonight there will be light snowfall 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.530
 In the mountains, even to the lower lying there can be quite a choice between one 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.560
 there are temperatures 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.449
 from in minus 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.930
 "The Ryder had blues all the way 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.840
 Of course it can also be laughed where the snow falls 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.049
 Respect on the roads 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.739
 the view on the morning temperatures you see already it is noticeably colder than 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.090
 -2 degrees today in the Erzgebirge 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.729
 +2 degrees in the Leipzig area 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:03.229
 Again, light snowfall should occasionally but also a few raindrops and 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:08.799
 we are curious how does the 11 from rather apply here and paarten 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.259
 talk here and then tomorrow from Altenberge Moss Erzgebirge need it 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.349
 I also the light of the Mark 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.439
 we say goodbye to their "sense and shape" tomorrow and they are still looking please 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.150
 Let's take a look at the glowing 11 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.270
