compressor failures I actually did a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.390 
compressor failures I actually did a
video<00:02:17.840> yesterday<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.590> how<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> lot<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.310> these

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
video yesterday on how a lot of these

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.220 
video yesterday on how a lot of these
compressors<00:02:19.790> are<00:02:20.120> failing<00:02:20.360> I'll<00:02:20.870> make<00:02:21.020> sure<00:02:21.170> I

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
compressors are failing I'll make sure I

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.390

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
right up here if I if I nailed that

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
right up here if I if I nailed that
right<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.540> check<00:02:26.750> out<00:02:26.840> exactly<00:02:27.260> what<00:02:27.470> it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
right you check out exactly what it

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.530 
right you check out exactly what it
looks<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.010> how<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.310> fail<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.330> most

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
looks like and how they fail the most

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.020 
looks like and how they fail the most
common<00:02:30.020> ones<00:02:30.319> really<00:02:30.620> seem<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.040> be<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.670> TD<00:02:32.000> is

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
common ones really seem to be the TD is

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.010 
common ones really seem to be the TD is
