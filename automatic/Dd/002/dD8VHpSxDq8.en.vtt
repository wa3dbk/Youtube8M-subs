00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.089
 another little video this time 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 is just an info video and indeed 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.080
 I wanted to ask you what kind of a 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.200
 to use overlay 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.130
 I have just three pieces now 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.359
 to select 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.949
 and I wanted to give you a quick look 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.949
 present 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:32.399
 I have to check her little one for a moment 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:35.870
 tease on and is still mushroom 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.870
 perfect is rather thin 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.129
 I now have several to choose from 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.969
 some are a little less some 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 a little bit bigger and I want you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.199
 now present after a slow 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.699
 Unfortunately, you can not quite see it 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.649
 but you can do the overlays 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.579
 I already have overlay number here 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.030
 three if i put this on 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.710
 could see down here so you guys 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.240
 can see that in the video already nothing 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
 I see now how you will see here 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.650
 front with the cam up here from the man 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.409
 overlay and i thought i present 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 I 'd rather go because that's better 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.020
 I can see one after 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.600
 to do the other and I believe 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.439
 this overlay is that the interface 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 I think I'm still wrong 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.180
 it is right i do that i am 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.720
 just a few times right as it should be 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.659
 Now I'm the red one for a moment 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.159
 immigrated briefly make her smaller 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.079
 how it should fit now could too 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.079
 see how I work with open broadcast 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:52.200
 So that 's overlay number 30 notes 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.890
 number three not one not 23 like it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.170
 you like 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.189
 with her you can down here and very little 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.240
 really changed compared to the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.619
 other we have the other more here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 at the side and at all and still 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.270
 facebook and god the 25 and i think 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.360
 then I'll just show you this 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.360
 next 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.040
 That was a short text here either 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.180
 could overlay three we make 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.220
 police wakes in 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.310
 this is the regular thing now too 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.310
 the next videos will come now 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:37.270
 there is that even there is even 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:41.580
 not clear what's wrong this whole 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.580
 as well as the chain of making 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.460
 that's one thing you already know 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.590
 all of the whole hick or let's play 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.720
 that will not matter for which I am 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.330
 decide the next five six 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.480
 to come videos I'm sorry because 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.610
 I did not even like it 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.370
 watch if that's the breadth of the crowd 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.640
 this is the number two though 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.840
 here and now come to third that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.000
 I got sent sitting today 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.800
 I thought that was really cool 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.580
 But that's just big on the light 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.670
 a lot of space 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.180
 That's why I do not know if I'll give it to you 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.000
 like 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.250
 I'll make it in there for a moment 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.840
 they would have been different too 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.800
 Chamber issued although he got two out 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.080
 and so and here would be the cam namely 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.480
 up here over the minimap here 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.810
 the machete of the victim still has 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.950
 immortalized and yes that's probably number 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.950
 1 so 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.870
 yes i would have to go straight through this 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.110
 that I got written so 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.000
 Write me in the comments 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.640
 1 2 or 3 is the font as one now 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.680
 a little stupid 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.209
 yes maybe I will one again 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.920
 Many people wanted to make video 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.640
 I know with that 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.310
 openbroadcast record what club 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.630
 position I hated that 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.610
 I'll look at it then I'm glad 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.069
 I be driven out 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.000
 So taxi we write in the comments 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.040
 overlay 3 2 or 1 you can still 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.479
 just one very high run that is enough 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.070
 I am perfect every year 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.660
 I'll just comment the comment 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.729
 the most have word from a so 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.650
 refer if you no overlay 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.450
 Of course I want to do something bad because of myself 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.550
 find some things really cool like that 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.750
 That was an effort or that 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.830
 First, I think cool because 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.100
 she is simply cold but still 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.300
 small smaller cool things works too 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.810
 now i am coming i pay very good 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.940
 confused 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.070
 so again from the front that is now 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.860
 also because once in the 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.470
 reviewer lines this year 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.710
 also because he is two this year 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.360
 in which and if all three this year in 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.169
 the cameras I still and everything 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.280
 and let's see if you do not have any 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.510
 you can also do that in the 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.850
 Write comments but I would 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.850
 already like to use 1 even if it only 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.500
 the third one is now but I think one 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.880
 you should already insert something like that 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.590
 at least for the camps and frames or 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.030
 I think that's pretty cool 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.729
 but admit he writes for the 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.889
 comments which you wanted to unite 3 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:25.590
 this only two the other what else i have 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:27.389
 do bruno were the other then thank 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.979
 i see you for and i hope i will 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.780
 switch on again soon 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.050
 if it says hello and heartily 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.050
 welcome
