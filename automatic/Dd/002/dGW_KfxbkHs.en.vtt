00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 yes my friends time the second free 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 tradition is already on 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.670
 Here are the results of the Eifel with the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.590
 fruit in it has won 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 and it's a great thing it's a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.150
 square clock to his right away and that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.859
 is a basic form with comment 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.310
 Actually, everything works 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.150
 on basic forms whether it is now squares 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.630
 rectangles or triangles are with it and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.610
 yes really great things actually possible 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.030
 and therefore we are looking for a grip 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 shoulder off we go we put with 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.340
 a prefabricated form so to speak 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.399
 here is actually how tall and also 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.739
 up a bit further back 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.239
 Once again high is actually said 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.760
 very simple square connected 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.449
 these edges and give a whole 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.080
 bad rectangle just there 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.060
 the edges are slightly stronger 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.869
 emphasize that we just a bit more 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.610
 press on 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.400
 it is just a whole here too 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.409
 simple hb pen i wanted now 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.390
 do not complicate because of that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.400
 i just taken the appell pen and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 sometimes stop pushing something more here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.140
 at the darker areas or just that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.770
 less readers want to have yes and it is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 a message funny shapes the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.689
 ice cube reappears because of the light 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.320
 very individual field and from the year of 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.939
 ice-frozen water so to speak 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.960
 reflected reflected and broken 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:52.439
 it will blur the whole thing a bit 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.689
 and darken something so to speak for now 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.570
 Of course you can etch and then 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.960
 Of course, super stuff yes to the fore 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.590
 bring it is hard if you do that yes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.099
 not caught do not build darkened 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.239
 something dark to be able to show everything 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.350
 Of course, this is very good when I do that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.170
 now blur 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.120
 it is the hp pen then yes i can 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.030
 blur the hp pen much better 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.470
 for example, a night like a pen 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.260
 and then erase it easier 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.280
 accept the finer i 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:35.150
 easy job again working out 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.920
 Highlight the edges of red interest 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.140
 thus the things also still pencil 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.510
 even perhaps correct to 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.030
 are bright 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.820
 a little more pressure-retaining use who so 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.560
 a kind of water had to be in the strings 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:03:00.990
 paint circles curves stop a light 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:04.880
 water pattern that's just beautiful women's 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:10.110
 ice stop now it is very great 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.090
 some fine lines and then down 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.070
 are beautiful shadows we can 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.150
 that's what it does, of course 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.670
 bit three-dimensional if ours 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.670
 ice cubes just so in the area stands 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.490
 it's just a bit weird 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.940
 he does not hover, for example 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.970
 or lies in a glass and yes so 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.830
 shadow looks really great 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.130
 that he did not want to 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.310
 gets big and too long in one direction 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.800
 therefore small shadow actually looks 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.400
 already nice and you then the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.710
 elegant for example, super and that too 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.230
 just by keeping shadow 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.230
 have brought and we can now 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.390
 in the middle of a fruit paint 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.680
 I am in favor of an active disc 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.260
 so decided the kiwis or one 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.510
 lemon children can paint he would be quite 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:15.180
 great paint what the stop a fruit like 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.239
 Make sure that it is nice in the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.070
 middle is and left at the side 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.100
 it overlaps a bit that 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.110
 drawn so arises 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.300
 a bit more the spatial effect 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.880
 and that's a great thing, yes 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.260
 Apply now in the room again 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.860
 I just have it with the brush times 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.550
 Just do everything with 1 fun 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.260
 thing is a little bit taken away 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.260
 maybe that's the middle of now 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.700
 fruit for example and then old loves 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.680
 the whole on one he a gray 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.380
 blur 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.270
 and yes, definitely on the one hand 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.430
 side hold a bit forward 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.900
 let us overlap with us 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.310
 have a great spatial effect 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:05.750
 That's a little on in any case 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:10.190
 want to give away the way then yes one more 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.530
 little decorate the whole between 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.260
 I'll have a little more 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.330
 brought white color and white color 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.610
 on the example on the pencil 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.290
 I have white and black in there 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.750
 So to say it is a whole 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:28.300
 great way to shape something 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.430
 I think slowly is learned 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.980
 maybe not the coolest one but this one 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.530
 time of me but I hope it is so 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:40.070
 have become clear how to do that 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.070
 can and can form very different 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.050
 the superior waves down high 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.050
 as you like it 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.670
 managed has helped and the black 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.470
 these basic forms are made 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.630
 actually quite great to work 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.050
 much is based on that you first 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.410
 grundform draws and then said yes 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.320
 comes to the finished object and thus can 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.870
 to do some great things yes 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.340
 The portrait-course is also coming soon 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.000
 At the start there are only a few left 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.020
 days 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.650
 there is an extra video but 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.690
 now first the faction has set off 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.730
 properly started so you still 21 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.100
 weekend, so to speak now for it 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.320
 time so you have a faction 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.650
 really a bit rest days 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.300
 so you can already draw in the 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.330
 For example, it would be like a week 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.280
 works stressful so i think it and 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.590
 freedom action really very very 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.140
 Relaxing thing and I hope you do 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.390
 I wish you all a lot of fun 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.790
 do not forget that subscribe up then 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:56.620
 Of course, there is always more to it 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.690
 forest and 230 more he makes great 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.080
 results i really can 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:06.480
 great times and yes looking forward to your 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.480
 Next works until then
