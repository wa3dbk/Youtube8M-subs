00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.930
 well here is my room he 's all in 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.110
 white only in plaster for him and show 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.150
 For you to do these lists. 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.469
 the first thing I needed is 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.509
 mark right 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 with a pen and machine with a 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.240
 ruler was actually marking and soon in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 I then used a white ribbon. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.580
 to mark the china wall down to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.859
 is that non-rubber ink is for 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 that each list had a color and not 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.750
 after that you can see 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 that the son on the wall is all 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 got each letter a size I ordered 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.770
 to be cute to be quiet 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.649
 So you can see this. 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.300
 the next step was using a dye from 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 coral in black color 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 I waited two pots of him like you. 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 can see in white paint 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.579
 This was to give a color is dark xd 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.469
 I had to move because I had to 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.399
 so he could not spot later on 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.769
 wall right 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.939
 so it's good for you to fiddle well diluted ink 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.670
 white before 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.520
 remembering that I also used a body is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.479
 sky blue to paint the other walls and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.570
 in these lists 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 I also chose the sky to be part of it. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.310
 and that pink paint of the sky in case I used 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.860
 two drops of the black dye to make a 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.220
 lighter gray 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 Good, I know this cookie that he is very 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.479
 good because just as he is small is 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.780
 easier for you to paint all the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.720
 stripes just like I did there and like you 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.659
 You can see I used the dark sky light blue 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.850
 in the case of the sky and Mexico is now 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.350
 everything half blurred and everything you go 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.460
 talk like our madness art will stay 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.860
 all the river 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.640
 but actually have tape to power 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.409
 Mark 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.280
 so it's all wrong in the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.280
 where the tape 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.030
 and then you can see that the floor too 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.970
 it was all dirty and you better cover it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.899
 before you start painting good here 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.810
 I 'm already taking the tapes between is the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.630
 stripes and you can see how it looks 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.530
 certinho it scores well retained is where 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.930
 Why do not you mix these inks? 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.840
 Lift up all dirty there you realize that 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.970
 some parts when you take it 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.190
 may blur a bit and it may be that the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.380
 extinct is wet then you leave 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.560
 dry the ink well before it is already 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.640
 all tapes and if so stay still 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.130
 marked 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.740
 You can paint is to paint an ink. 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.770
 white to be able to get it right 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.290
 Look how it looks pretty right. 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.300
 people are very good you use these tapes 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.300
 but the problem is that with the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.130
 white acceptance appliance is white gives 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.650
 some confusion in the time to paint it 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.090
 you have a daughter of another color and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.180
 that brings us shows up when it's time for you. 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.620
 draw you can use because it facilitates 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.720
 enough 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.519
 Good, I'm still pulling all the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.140
 tapes is for you see that it's okay to use 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.420
 these tapes and can make other drawings 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.700
 on the wall and use tape to mark it would be 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.120
 A good but good idea of the tape is you. 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.269
 do things that are straighter 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.269
 good 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.550
 Look, it's a little hard for you to take 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.770
 haneke the wall tape alien apps 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.920
 in the case of my little granddaughter it's kind of dangerous 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.190
 and start everything up so be careful when it comes to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.960
 take those tapes well then that part 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.880
 I had already taken all stick tape 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.680
 It was well retained well right 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.020
 you can already see that the other wall 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970
 she is in the healing of the sky that is also 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.710
 in lists 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.260
 good people look like this the three 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.500
 sky blue walls actually pupil in 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.410
 proof does not work much time was made 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.670
 But that was the wall of the window that I 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.620
 I used to make lists knowing look 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.280
 Not even close enough for you to see the colors. 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.550
 huh 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.720
 and it was well retinha people I had 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.180
 enough care to take 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.890
 especially in the footer and 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.430
 mainly was not said in part 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.519
 above is good you also use tape to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.670
 cover so it will not stain the other 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.220
 parties then lots of tape goes there 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.990
 so where do you use white paint and the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.669
 current is that it can do several things 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.470
 different and spend less 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:36.220
 So that's it folks if you want 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:40.120
 see much more then keep an eye out and 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.120
 Kisses and thank you
