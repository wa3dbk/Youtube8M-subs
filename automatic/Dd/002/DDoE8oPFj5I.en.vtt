his fell script for my turtle to cut
down<00:00:19.619> tree<00:00:21.050> basically<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.369> extended<00:00:23.369> this

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
down tree basically I have extended this

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.299 
down tree basically I have extended this
so<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:26.510> turtle<00:00:27.510> will<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:31.130> first<00:00:32.130> boil

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
so that the turtle will and first boil

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.450 
so that the turtle will and first boil
plant<00:00:32.809> going<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> cover<00:00:34.890> art<00:00:35.130> extend

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
plant going up to the cover art extend

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.869 
plant going up to the cover art extend
it<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.860> gotta<00:00:41.040> post<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> drops<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it and you gotta post of all it drops of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.139 
it and you gotta post of all it drops of
Lords<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:43.370> inventory<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> made<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
Lords it had inventory so I made at the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.520 
Lords it had inventory so I made at the
function<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.899> simply<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
function that would just simply do that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.270 
function that would just simply do that
and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> calls<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:48.829> plant<00:00:49.829> function

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and then it calls this plant function

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.389 
and then it calls this plant function
which<00:00:50.640> basically<00:00:51.500> move<00:00:52.500> stuff<00:00:52.800> around<00:00:52.949> bit

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
which basically move stuff around bit

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.990 
which basically move stuff around bit
and<00:00:53.840> places<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:55.370> settings<00:00:56.370> where<00:00:56.879> they're

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and places down settings where they're

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.860 
and places down settings where they're
in<00:00:57.120> slot<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:59.000> right<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.149> course<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.510> England<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
in slot to right of course up England a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.280 
in slot to right of course up England a
square<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.630> wild<00:01:06.630> link<00:01:06.840> which

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
square and then I have a wild link which

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.539 
square and then I have a wild link which
will<00:01:08.030> move<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.409> turtle<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.890> block<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
will move the turtle up one block and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
will move the turtle up one block and
then<00:01:11.850> every<00:01:12.390> 10<00:01:12.600> seconds<00:01:12.990> check<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
then every 10 seconds check to see if a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
then every 10 seconds check to see if a
block<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.570> basically<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.780> check<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
block is there basically this check it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.820 
block is there basically this check it
will<00:01:16.530> mean<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.900> if<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> tree<00:01:19.200> grows<00:01:19.439> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
will mean that and if the tree grows and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.130 
will mean that and if the tree grows and
a<00:01:20.580> block<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:20.939> appear<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.450> front<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.750> turtle

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
a block will appear in front of turtle

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.830 
a block will appear in front of turtle
and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.310> come<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.330> loop<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and then it will come out this loop and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.609 
and then it will come out this loop and
it<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.409> move<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.640> block<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.619> do

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
it will move down the block and then do

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
it will move down the block and then do
the<00:01:28.740> existing<00:01:29.130> code<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.700> set<00:01:29.939> bring<00:01:30.210> wrote

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the existing code that set bring wrote

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.039 
the existing code that set bring wrote
to<00:01:30.810> chop<00:01:31.799> down<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.009> tree<00:01:32.450> when<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.689> done<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
to chop down a tree when this is done it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.260 
to chop down a tree when this is done it
returns<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.470> its<00:01:34.500> normal<00:01:34.770> position<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.640> then

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
returns to its normal position and then

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.190 
returns to its normal position and then
it<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.770> M<00:01:37.950> hold<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.880> starts<00:01:39.210> again<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> will

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it the M hold it starts again so it will

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.639 
it the M hold it starts again so it will
plant<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.280> full<00:01:41.520> saplings<00:01:42.170> but<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.439> sorry

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
plant the full saplings but would sorry

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
plant the full saplings but would sorry
and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.009> prompt<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.430> saplings<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and then prompt or saplings and then it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.039 
and then prompt or saplings and then it
will<00:01:45.950> wait<00:01:46.950> until<00:01:47.310> there's<00:01:47.880> new<00:01:48.030> tree<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.960> i

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
will wait until there's new tree so i

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
will wait until there's new tree so i
will<00:01:49.229> show<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.740> action<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:50.329> but

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
will show you is an action right now but

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:03.940 
will show you is an action right now but
I<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:56.360> then<00:01:58.340> fell<00:02:01.219> you'll<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> planting

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
I just then fell you'll see it planting

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.660 
I just then fell you'll see it planting

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and you wait put the tree to grow then

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.880 
and you wait put the tree to grow then
it'd<00:02:30.030> start<00:02:30.060> getting<00:02:30.600> both<00:02:31.020> partners<00:02:31.830> tree<00:02:33.890> in

off<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:45.000> mean<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.480> could<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.780> more<00:03:46.049> studying

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
off I mean I could have more studying
