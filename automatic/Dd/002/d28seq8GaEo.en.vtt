00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.589

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.990
 these sticks here it is called 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.059
 Nordic walking 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.929
 bought a stick for a long time already last year 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.150
 still very convenient to walk with them when u 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.850
 do you have excess weight or here's the load for you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.439
 gotta carry up go wanna go far 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 where not far away for smaller people 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.779
 with folders you will pass a half to two 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.789
 farther here she has here first these loops 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.590
 wear clothes like that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.520
 and very convenient to hang back here there can be 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 very good weight on the shelf shift 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.320
 to remove his spine from his legs 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.320
 means where to put pal 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.750
 it can be solved right at the level 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.480
 socks do not need to go on like this 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.090
 You burned it is necessary there and then and here 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.060
 Just Order Sochi here set here 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.340
 leaned take a step and put again 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.600
 another stick here then when you do 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.160
 step again and and so here's how to take out 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.530
 she herself strives forward here and again 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.869
 put here further means the stick itself 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.220
 must be tall so that 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.950
 the elbow was here 90 seems 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.570
 approached calm and low 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.770
 low and that's about 90 degrees 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.790
 it turns out that when you stand you 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.670
 laid 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.260
 cozy hands on the shelves and you enough 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.780
 easy even if you stop 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.390
 worth something waiting there transport what 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.670
 something can be done so put and so 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.070
 here 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 palms and lean by the way here for example 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.119
 then you have 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.979
 you will just relax and very 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.159
 greater unloading will put will get your 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.320
 spine and legs can be there for example 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.530
 so here too put here right here 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.170
 so here rely here so here it is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.239
 stand like this 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.580
 hands on the sides but in fact that's almost 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.720
 Well, a very large amount of weight 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.000
 transferred to the shelves 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.319
 it's your spine starting a little bit 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.200
 so here feel relieved by this 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.180
 most you give him a break especially 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.319
 when you walk your spine for a long time 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.560
 of course here's another way that 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.880
 I came up with it quite by accident when 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.840
 thats here you go to put the regiment then 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.239
 make mine this here rely on 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.560
 don't put your hand behind your back 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.269
 away like this and then when you go 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.510
 a hand like that spring 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.700
 it turns out starts to push you 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.130
 push a little bit like up and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.940
 a little bit ahead and with this method 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.760
 walk 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.069
 now even show a few steps 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.989
 that is, you go you so you start 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.700
 back and forth 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.799
 you get a push again let's go there 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.269
 And another push and go as if in all 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.970
 being pushed by someone like this 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.110
 it's very easy to try 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.099
 of course because without trying 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.840
 incomprehensible well for health these things 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.840
 just super everything
