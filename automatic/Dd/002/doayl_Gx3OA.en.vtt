00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 as a shelf and welcome to another 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.130
 chapter in my channel my name is 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.990
 minister , let's make a video of the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 new pc that I armed myself will surely have 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.269
 I saw yesterday's blog and I did not comment 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.830
 it was just the recording of the trip plus that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.540
 day it was very windy and I forgot 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 put the camera on the short wind makes 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.960
 that run not all the audio but 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.180
 I also wanted south jealousy to see 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.369
 a little bit how was the most right now in 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.590
 this video is going to try to arm you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.750
 to the pc as cell phone and so on is the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.160
 continuation of yesterday's video was before 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 to begin with I wanted to make a kind of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.090
 point aside because I was reading the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.489
 comments from yesterday's video and they were 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.899
 much those of the partner or people with silver 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.360
 that you have to get it working 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.489
 besides you already know that I upload a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.079
 video per week as much because I live 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.289
 working live studying and I can not 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.480
 upload more so I was working two 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.430
 months and I spent two salaries on this pc 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.250
 without please save monkeys 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.710
 comments I turned black again 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 let's start from the outside to inside a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 week before buying me on the new pc 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.860
 I bought the monitor is a samsung and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.870
 compared to my old monitor this brings 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.630
 a new technology in quotes that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.460
 it's called dynamic mega contrast what 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.100
 Brightens more colors 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 strong to the image and so on like in a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.840
 true the old monitor I put it next 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 and to use the double monitor for your 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.170
 information does not need any 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.820
 rare configuration the only thing that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 they need is a video plate that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.890
 have double entry for monitor what 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.660
 they plug in and nothing else works the keyboard 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.690
 and the mouse are new are cooler master 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.910
 of the devastator series have little lights 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.979
 so that 's very very good to me 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.280
 It was hyper uncomfortable at first but 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.720
 how everything ends up getting used to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 along with that I bought myself a for 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.399
 steelseries this makes me much 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.080
 I wanted to buy the truth has half 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.600
 subway by half a meter so you have 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.300
 enough space to move the mouse is 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.820
 yes but how work tea a lot so 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.979
 the 5 is recommended my microphone in my 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.430
 camera are the same as before the camera 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.180
 it's a logistics 670 is of very low range 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.710
 scola 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.290
 YouTube more than two years ago 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.210
 it's not true even at 30 fps but 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.100
 good to see if the hits made 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.570
 put a little batteries and support the theme 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.490
 of neven that in subscribers we are the 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.290
 second channel of lol of argentina and in 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.060
 the last extreme we reach 900 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.650
 bieber doing everything with this little camera 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 of crap we will see if they put the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
 batteries the microphone is the opposite end 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.790
 of the camera is a sam's 1101 is of 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.740
 professional capacitors study the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.450
 truth is he who used to ask and I paid 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.180
 a little over two years is a fan 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.010
 detected happening to the inside the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.840
 Cabinet is innocent and there's not much that 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.840
 tell the truth he brought me two guts and 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.300
 with lights is very beautiful the truth is that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.180
 I also have two western hard drives 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.070
 digital caviar blue where the series is 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.560
 unter to each one I have an old one and 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.310
 new the mother is an ultra gigabyte 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.040
 durable has a cete chipset at 91 16 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.800
 gigas of ram that works nothing 2,866 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.290
 frequency improvements that is crazy 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.720
 honestly it's more thanks to that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.880
 they came with 2 specific coolers for 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.960
 the ram because they overheat but 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.970
 they are beasts the micro is a and 546 90 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.800
 it's perfect for the overclock and I do not 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.200
 reached for a new video plate 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.850
 so keep using the old radio 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.010
 in 77 50 of the pc walks almost 10 a 9 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.380
 I would write it down so it's 10 in 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.780
 my opinion would add a ssd so that 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.880
 vote faster and I would change the disk 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.070
 hard for a barracuda or some similar 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.780
 of a range a little higher than the 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.730
 caviar block not the video plate 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.370
 It would also be something that would change you 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.460
 about 750 or something like that and it would be 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.010
 that because I would not reach more the pija 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.860
 so all in all, it's almost 800 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.150
 fps is not that the pool is not good 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.560
 like that the truth is that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.260
 set sail but that would be what 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.050
 I would add to the holy medium I will return 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.760
 black if it's put there today it stays 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.920
 and not much more team I hope you have them 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.070
 been informative this blog with this pc 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.200
 I hope to make editions more copadas more 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.940
 strong and others work a lot more 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.650
 comfortable with this monitor to detect 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.020
 how it is much bigger and the program 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.990
 to edit that huge recorded that always 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.570
 they ask me, they recorded with the program or 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.560
 bs stream I also with that edited with 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.300
 the premier adobe 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.410
 and I make the thumbnail of the videos with the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.410
 photoshop cs 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.410
 the fucking mother is black 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.380
 trumpet
