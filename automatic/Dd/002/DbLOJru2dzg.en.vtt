and most of the songs there's one change
during<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.170> bridge<00:00:10.500> when<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.429> quiets<00:00:11.910> down

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
during the bridge when it quiets down

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
but the verse and the chorus are the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.970 
but the verse and the chorus are the
same<00:00:14.519> four<00:00:14.820> chords<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.630> same<00:00:15.809> order<00:00:16.260> so

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
same four chords in the same order so

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.500 
same four chords in the same order so
this<00:00:17.100> will<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> pretty<00:00:17.789> short<00:00:17.970> tutorial

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this will be a pretty short tutorial

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.029 
this will be a pretty short tutorial
because<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.080> know<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.439> chords<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> C

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
because you know these chords it is a C

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
because you know these chords it is a C
then<00:00:23.039> an<00:00:23.220> E<00:00:23.430> minor<00:00:25.490> then<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> G<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
then an E minor then a G but when you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
then an E minor then a G but when you
play<00:00:27.930> your<00:00:28.080> G<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.500> almost<00:00:28.740> always<00:00:29.070> play<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:29.550> G

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
play your G I almost always play my G

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.840 
play your G I almost always play my G
like<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.060> anyway<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.230> play<00:00:31.920> third<00:00:32.489> fret

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
like this anyway I play third fret

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060 
like this anyway I play third fret
second<00:00:33.390> fret<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.870> everyone<00:00:34.260> knows<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.040> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
second fret like everyone knows but I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.950 
second fret like everyone knows but I
put<00:00:35.280> my<00:00:35.309> ring<00:00:35.550> finger<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.149> third<00:00:36.450> fret<00:00:36.480> of

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
put my ring finger on the third fret of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.770 
put my ring finger on the third fret of
the<00:00:36.989> B<00:00:37.230> string<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.770> my<00:00:38.550> pinky<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> third

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the B string and my pinky on the third

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.619 
the B string and my pinky on the third
fret<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> high<00:00:40.739> E<00:00:40.920> string<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> I'm<00:00:42.450> using

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
fret of the high E string so I'm using

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.400 
fret of the high E string so I'm using
all<00:00:42.809> four<00:00:43.079> fingers<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> makes

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
all four fingers and I think this makes

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.310 
all four fingers and I think this makes
it<00:00:46.590> much<00:00:46.860> much<00:00:47.100> easier<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.610> transition<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.989> D

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it much much easier to transition to a D

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.459 
it much much easier to transition to a D
chord<00:00:49.649> because<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.489> ring<00:00:51.210> finger<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:51.690> does

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
chord because the ring finger now does

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.260 
chord because the ring finger now does
not<00:00:52.500> change<00:00:52.980> position<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
not change position so you can use it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.950 
not change position so you can use it
kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> anchor<00:00:55.260> we'd<00:00:55.649> alley<00:00:56.190> finger

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
kind of as a anchor we'd alley finger

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.979 
kind of as a anchor we'd alley finger
and<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:58.800> D<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> suggestin<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
and to your D so just a suggestin you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.689 
and to your D so just a suggestin you
don't<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.890> that's<00:01:02.489> how<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
don't have to do that but that's how I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.280 
don't have to do that but that's how I
play<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.390> those<00:01:03.899> chords<00:01:04.260> again<00:01:04.500> are<00:01:04.650> c<00:01:04.890> e

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
play it so those chords again are c e

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.510 
play it so those chords again are c e
minor<00:01:08.330> g

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
minor g

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.539 
minor g
d

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
d

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.480 
d
and<00:01:12.670> that<00:01:13.509> is<00:01:13.659> almost<00:01:13.810> all<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.290> song<00:01:14.530> so<00:01:15.460> the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
and that is almost all the song so the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.530 
and that is almost all the song so the
rhythm<00:01:15.729> goes<00:01:15.970> like<00:01:16.119> this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
rhythm goes like this

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:39.419 
rhythm goes like this
II<00:01:19.049> -<00:01:21.630> G<00:01:24.390> d<00:01:27.119> c<00:01:28.119> e<00:01:29.820> minor<00:01:32.640> G<00:01:35.340> D<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.280> verse

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
II - G d c e minor G D that's the verse

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.620 
II - G d c e minor G D that's the verse
and<00:01:39.850> that's<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.390> chorus<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.049> bridge

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and that's the chorus and the bridge

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.749 
and that's the chorus and the bridge
only<00:01:43.630> uses<00:01:43.899> one<00:01:44.049> extra<00:01:44.439> chord<00:01:44.709> it<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.459> cord

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
only uses one extra chord it is a cord

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.460 
only uses one extra chord it is a cord
that<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.909> probably<00:01:46.119> don't<00:01:46.450> play<00:01:46.750> normally<00:01:47.020> so

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
that you probably don't play normally so

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.800 
that you probably don't play normally so
we'll<00:01:48.009> go<00:01:48.429> over<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:48.670> one<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.119> we'll<00:01:49.569> be<00:01:49.690> done

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
we'll go over that one and we'll be done

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.730 
we'll go over that one and we'll be done
so<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.649> bridge<00:01:51.209> goes<00:01:52.209> into<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.750> C<00:01:53.229> starts<00:01:53.649> with

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
so the bridge goes into a C starts with

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.249 
so the bridge goes into a C starts with
the<00:01:53.830> C<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.899> it<00:01:56.020> goes<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.319> D<00:01:57.959> then<00:01:58.959> it<00:01:59.080> goes

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
the C then it goes to a D then it goes

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.499 
the C then it goes to a D then it goes
to<00:01:59.289> a<00:01:59.729> G<00:02:01.470> except<00:02:02.580> when<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.700> play<00:02:03.880> your<00:02:04.030> G<00:02:04.299> in

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
to a G except when you play your G in

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.150 
to a G except when you play your G in
the<00:02:04.810> bridge<00:02:05.439> part<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:07.119> play<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:08.200> actual<00:02:08.619> G

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
the bridge part don't play the actual G

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.670 
the bridge part don't play the actual G
note<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.910> low<00:02:10.239> G<00:02:10.569> note<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.110> play<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:11.650> a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
note the low G note just play it as a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.809 
note the low G note just play it as a
five<00:02:12.010> string<00:02:12.370> chord<00:02:12.700> if<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:15.700> you

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
five string chord if you can if you

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.940 
five string chord if you can if you
listen<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.390> song<00:02:16.600> that's<00:02:17.019> how<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.440> sounds

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
listen to the song that's how it sounds

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.910 
listen to the song that's how it sounds
so<00:02:18.760> it's<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> same<00:02:19.299> G<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:20.049> you<00:02:20.200> always<00:02:20.440> play

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
so it's the same G as you always play

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.610 
so it's the same G as you always play
just<00:02:21.790> don't<00:02:22.090> play<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.600> bottom<00:02:22.870> E<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.260> lot<00:02:23.500> of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
just don't play the bottom E a lot of

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.780 
just don't play the bottom E a lot of
times<00:02:23.769> when<00:02:23.920> I'm<00:02:24.010> trying<00:02:24.190> not<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> play<00:02:24.609> that

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
times when I'm trying not to play that
