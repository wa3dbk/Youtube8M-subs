implemented the dock this definitely has
a<00:00:33.570> better<00:00:34.020> design<00:00:34.590> than<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> Zeppelin<00:00:35.309> mini

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
a better design than the Zeppelin mini

a good amount of bass good clarity does
have<00:01:13.740> its<00:01:13.890> limitations<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:14.760> small

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
have its limitations all these small

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.969 
have its limitations all these small
speakers<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.659> only<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.650> much<00:01:16.710> but

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
speakers can only do so much but

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
speakers can only do so much but
definitely<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.369> good<00:01:17.970> sound<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.450> its<00:01:18.600> size

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
definitely very good sound for its size

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.460 
definitely very good sound for its size
it<00:01:19.380> does<00:01:19.680> cost<00:01:20.180> $400<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.049> designed<00:01:22.229> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it does cost $400 so it's designed to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
it does cost $400 so it's designed to
compete<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.799> stuff<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> Bose

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
