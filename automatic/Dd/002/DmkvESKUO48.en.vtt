00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.720 
quite catch that last step i'm going to
show<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.480> more<00:02:45.540> time<00:02:46.040> take<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> end<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
show you one more time take the end and

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.289 
show you one more time take the end and
loop<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.569> around<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.989> braid<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.530> then<00:02:50.299> wrap

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
loop it around the braid and then wrap

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.970 
loop it around the braid and then wrap
the<00:02:51.480> remaining<00:02:51.930> ends<00:02:52.319> around<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.769> braid

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
the remaining ends around the braid

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.849 
the remaining ends around the braid
loosely<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.810> product<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.620> help

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
loosely that product is going to help

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.440 
loosely that product is going to help
hold<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.280> there<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> don't<00:02:56.790> need<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.329> it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
hold it there so you don't need to do it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.479 
hold it there so you don't need to do it
tightly<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.590> creates<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.069> kind<00:02:59.310> of

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
tightly and it just creates a kind of

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.809 
tightly and it just creates a kind of
loose<00:03:00.180> band<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.780> not<00:03:00.989> very<00:03:01.560> easy

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.410 

i<00:03:06.890> usually<00:03:07.890> get<00:03:08.249> four<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.609> six<00:03:08.849> braids<00:03:09.150> from

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
i usually get four to six braids from

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.989 
i usually get four to six braids from
each<00:03:09.659> section<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.349> usually<00:03:11.159> let<00:03:11.310> my<00:03:11.489> braids<00:03:11.760> air

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:11.999 
each section I usually let my braids air

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.539 
each section I usually let my braids air
dry<00:03:12.299> for<00:03:12.329> maybe<00:03:13.049> an<00:03:13.200> hour<00:03:13.349> or<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.099> then<00:03:14.459> I

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
dry for maybe an hour or so and then I

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.190 
dry for maybe an hour or so and then I
wrap<00:03:14.760> them<00:03:14.939> up<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.269> silk<00:03:15.510> scarf<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.049> keep

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
wrap them up with the silk scarf to keep

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:27.830 
wrap them up with the silk scarf to keep
them<00:03:16.349> neat<00:03:25.819> for<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.909> takedown<00:03:27.120> use<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> light

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
them neat for the takedown use a light

00:03:27.840 --> 00:04:10.110 
them neat for the takedown use a light
oil<00:03:28.049> or<00:03:28.409> pomade<00:03:28.739> i'm<00:03:29.189> using<00:03:29.459> haha<00:03:29.879> boil

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.700 

this<00:04:11.120> is<00:04:11.210> the<00:04:11.390> immediate<00:04:11.690> texture<00:04:12.350> that<00:04:12.530> you

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
this is the immediate texture that you

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.350 
this is the immediate texture that you
get<00:04:12.950> right<00:04:13.220> after<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.520> take<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.910> braids<00:04:14.150> out

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
get right after you take the braids out

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.800 
get right after you take the braids out
this<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:14.750> pre<00:04:15.050> fluffing<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:16.040> can<00:04:16.190> see<00:04:16.370> by

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
this is pre fluffing you can see by

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.150 
this is pre fluffing you can see by
twisting<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:17.989> band<00:04:18.170> tonight<00:04:18.500> at<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.770> end<00:04:18.920> you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
twisting and band tonight at the end you

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.560 
twisting and band tonight at the end you
get<00:04:19.310> much<00:04:19.610> more<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:20.000> curly<00:04:20.360> bob<00:04:20.510> effect<00:04:22.570> for

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
get much more of a curly bob effect for

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.180 
get much more of a curly bob effect for
comparison<00:04:24.110> this<00:04:24.230> is<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.410> braid<00:04:24.680> out<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> did<00:04:25.160> a

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
comparison this is a braid out I did a

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.950 
comparison this is a braid out I did a
year<00:04:25.490> ago<00:04:25.550> where<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:25.970> braid<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.390> all<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.780> way<00:04:26.900> to

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
year ago where I braid it all the way to

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.080 
year ago where I braid it all the way to
the<00:04:27.260> ends<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.250> can<00:04:28.400> see<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:28.700> not<00:04:28.820> really

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the ends so you can see it's not really

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.730 
the ends so you can see it's not really
a<00:04:29.120> curly<00:04:29.480> bob<00:04:29.630> effect<00:04:30.020> was<00:04:30.230> still<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.500> great

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
a curly bob effect was still a great

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:42.980 
a curly bob effect was still a great
look

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990
