better to give them a big round of
applause

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.480 

I<00:04:46.660> didn't<00:04:47.260> expect<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.040> had<00:04:48.220> some

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
I didn't expect to like that had some

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.560 
I didn't expect to like that had some
performance<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.120> thought<00:04:49.300> was<00:04:49.390> gonna<00:04:49.510> be

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
performance I thought was gonna be

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.420 
performance I thought was gonna be
really<00:04:49.780> bland<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.350> boring<00:04:50.410> but<00:04:50.920> it<00:04:51.040> turned

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
really bland and boring but it turned

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:06.660 
really bland and boring but it turned
out<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.700> be<00:04:51.730> really<00:04:52.150> good<00:05:05.670> Southwest

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
out to be really good Southwest

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.670 
out to be really good Southwest
performance<00:05:07.150> at<00:05:07.270> halftime<00:05:07.480> was<00:05:07.990> great<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.620> I

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
performance at halftime was great and I

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.430 
performance at halftime was great and I
think<00:05:08.740> that<00:05:09.130> because<00:05:09.660> we<00:05:10.660> were<00:05:10.780> at<00:05:10.930> st.<00:05:11.200> Pius

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
think that because we were at st. Pius

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.290 
think that because we were at st. Pius
and<00:05:11.710> we<00:05:11.830> were<00:05:11.920> away<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.520> they<00:05:12.670> had<00:05:12.790> never<00:05:12.970> seen

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
and we were away and they had never seen

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.760 
and we were away and they had never seen
anything<00:05:13.600> like<00:05:13.780> that<00:05:13.990> they<00:05:14.440> were<00:05:14.500> really

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
anything like that they were really

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.620 
anything like that they were really
hyping<00:05:15.160> into<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.640> so<00:05:15.760> they<00:05:15.910> made<00:05:16.120> us<00:05:16.390> perform

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
hyping into it so they made us perform

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.180 
hyping into it so they made us perform
better<00:05:17.080> because<00:05:17.410> we<00:05:17.500> were<00:05:17.590> feeding<00:05:17.860> off<00:05:18.040> with

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
better because we were feeding off with

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:53.130 
better because we were feeding off with
their<00:05:18.340> energy

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.680 

it<00:05:54.100> was<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.280> good<00:05:54.430> experience<00:05:54.790> I<00:05:55.120> was<00:05:55.330> glad<00:05:55.540> you

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
it was a good experience I was glad you
