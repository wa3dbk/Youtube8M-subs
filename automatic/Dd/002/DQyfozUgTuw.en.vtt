00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 imagine being able to spend as long as you want 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.480
 in the bath without wasting water that has 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.150
 a lot of people who will like the news 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.860
 because this is what the engineer of the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 city ​​of valinhos in the interior of são 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.809
 he created a system that recycles 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.539
 water during the bath and then 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.289
 to defeat the shower ready to be 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.350
 reused water too much water still 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.420
 but instead of being discarded this lap 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.460
 for the shower pedro engineer 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 mechatronics and created support for 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.090
 separate the soap and filter the water 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 bath time 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.879
 the whole technology is down here 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.910
 where are the sensors and filters for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.940
 treat the water that will be reused and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.670
 This bath here can last for hours. 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.000
 consumed a maximum of 10 liters of water 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.129
 spent 14 times smaller than a bath 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 15 minutes 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.090
 the sensor indicating the presence of 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 impurities was taken advantage of by the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.520
 produces water from the humidity of the air 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 developed by pedro in 2011 and water 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.470
 Pretty very good. 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.650
 heat water also tapped and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.409
 energy savings reaches 70% 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.140
 the indication is not to urinate when the water 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.180
 reach a high level of contamination 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 needs to be thrown out for disposal 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.189
 end of the bath water the option is to use 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.590
 to unload the Swedish shower 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.110
 recently developed also recycles 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.810
 bath water on the hour and costs about 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.090
 two thousand and seven hundred reais, not including 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.240
 the import costs of the shower 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.270
 pedro only uses brazilian pieces today 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.320
 cabin is sold to businesses for 25 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.079
 one thousand reais 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.829
 but the idea is to cheapen up to 5 thousand 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.329
 real 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.070
 today we are basically working 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.299
 with this cabin for this purpose which is the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.850
 commercial purpose 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.259
 oprah residences that have a space for 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.479
 that she enters but in the very future 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.689
 close to our goal is to sell the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.509
 modules in a low-cost kit so that the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.780
 person has home and put in adapt 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.780
 to the bathroom
