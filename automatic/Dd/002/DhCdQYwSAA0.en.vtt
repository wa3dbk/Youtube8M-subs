when<00:00:01.199> most<00:00:01.380> people<00:00:01.469> think<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.979> telephoto

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
when most people think of a telephoto

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.130 
when most people think of a telephoto
lens<00:00:02.490> they<00:00:02.910> think<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.210> one<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.510> magnifies

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
lens they think of one that magnifies

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.990 
lens they think of one that magnifies
and<00:00:04.560> while<00:00:04.770> it's<00:00:04.980> true<00:00:05.280> that<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.520> telephoto

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
and while it's true that a telephoto

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.480 
and while it's true that a telephoto
lens<00:00:06.120> does<00:00:06.630> let<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:06.900> enlarge<00:00:07.799> things<00:00:08.249> that

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
lens does let you enlarge things that

lens does let you enlarge things that
are<00:00:08.579> far<00:00:08.789> away<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.299> can<00:00:09.690> also<00:00:09.839> think<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
you can see with your eye then we think

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.700 
you can see with your eye then we think
of<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.580> lens<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> telephoto<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.720> little<00:00:22.589> bit

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of that lens as a telephoto a little bit

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.439 
of that lens as a telephoto a little bit
of<00:00:22.800> telephoto<00:00:23.220> isn't<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.640> noticeable<00:00:23.820> for

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of telephoto isn't that noticeable for

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.390 
of telephoto isn't that noticeable for
example<00:00:24.839> there<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> difference<00:00:26.009> between<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
example there is a difference between a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310 
example there is a difference between a
50<00:00:26.640> millimeter<00:00:26.939> lens<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> an<00:00:27.630> 80<00:00:27.839> millimeter

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
50 millimeter lens and an 80 millimeter

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.810 
50 millimeter lens and an 80 millimeter
lens<00:00:28.589> but<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.949> wouldn't<00:00:29.189> necessarily<00:00:29.669> look

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
lens but you wouldn't necessarily look

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
lens but you wouldn't necessarily look
at<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> 80<00:00:30.419> millimeter<00:00:30.929> image<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
at the 80 millimeter image and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.020 
at the 80 millimeter image and
immediately<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.099> oh<00:00:32.190> that's<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.580> telephoto

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
immediately think oh that's a telephoto

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
immediately think oh that's a telephoto
image<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.080> we<00:00:34.230> tend<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.470> think<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.710> telephoto

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
image so we tend to think of telephoto

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.540 
image so we tend to think of telephoto
as<00:00:35.900> lenses<00:00:36.900> that<00:00:37.050> present<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.770> telescopic

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

that's<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.370> big<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.000> shake<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.420> lens<00:02:15.599> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
that's this big and I shake the lens a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.660 
that's this big and I shake the lens a
little<00:02:15.930> bit<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.440> don't<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.040> notice<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.489> that

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
little bit I don't really notice it that

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.080 
little bit I don't really notice it that
much<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:19.080> area<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.970> this

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
much because the area that the that this

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.089 
much because the area that the that this
image<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.450> being<00:02:21.660> cropped<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.230> tiny<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.980> if

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
image is being cropped is so tiny but if

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.589 
image is being cropped is so tiny but if
I've<00:02:23.220> only<00:02:23.370> got<00:02:23.580> an<00:02:23.700> area<00:02:23.849> that's<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.330> big

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
I've only got an area that's this big

I've only got an area that's this big
and<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.170> shake<00:02:25.410> by<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.680> same<00:02:25.950> amount<00:02:26.220> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and I shake by the same amount you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.850 
and I shake by the same amount you
notice<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> lot<00:02:27.209> more<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.200> with<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.350> very<00:02:28.440> long

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
notice it a lot more so with a very long

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.650 
notice it a lot more so with a very long
lens<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.550> be<00:02:29.670> harder<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:29.970> frame<00:02:30.420> your

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
lens that can be harder to frame your

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.690 
lens that can be harder to frame your
shot<00:02:30.959> because<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> tiny<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:32.069> motion<00:02:32.489> will

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
shot because the tiny little motion will

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.240 
shot because the tiny little motion will
create<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.000> big<00:02:33.180> change<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.569> your<00:02:33.720> composition

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
create a big change in your composition

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.860 
create a big change in your composition
since<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.340> very<00:02:35.370> long<00:02:35.550> lens<00:02:35.940> makes<00:02:36.239> vibration

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
since a very long lens makes vibration

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
much more of a concern if you're

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
I'm using a lens like this I'm more

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.190 
I'm using a lens like this I'm more

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
apertures and that will mean again

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.759 
apertures and that will mean again
longer<00:03:45.540> shutter<00:03:45.870> speeds<00:03:46.230> which<00:03:46.500> will<00:03:46.650> add

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
longer shutter speeds which will add

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.349 
longer shutter speeds which will add
further<00:03:47.100> complication<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> whole<00:03:48.120> stable

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
further complication to the whole stable

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.979 
further complication to the whole stable
shooting<00:03:48.750> thing<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.239> mind<00:03:51.269> most

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
shooting thing so with that in mind most

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.330 
shooting thing so with that in mind most
of<00:03:52.140> these<00:03:52.200> lenses<00:03:52.440> come<00:03:52.739> with<00:03:52.920> stabilization

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
of these lenses come with stabilization

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.069 
of these lenses come with stabilization
and<00:03:53.850> stabilization<00:03:54.600> will<00:03:54.810> make<00:03:54.930> your

and stabilization will make your

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.890 
and stabilization will make your
telephoto<00:03:55.530> shooting<00:03:55.980> much<00:03:56.340> easier

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
telephoto shooting much easier

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.330 
telephoto shooting much easier

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
stabilization is an internal mechanism

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.180 
stabilization is an internal mechanism
in<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.910> lens<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.390> allows<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.190> rebuild

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
stabilization on and off you might find

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.809 
stabilization on and off you might find
it's<00:04:13.859> better<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.160> turn<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.430> off<00:04:14.549> when<00:04:14.700> you're

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
it's better to turn it off when you're

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:15.740 
it's better to turn it off when you're

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
sometimes tripod movements because

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.400 
sometimes tripod movements because
they're<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.120> controlled<00:04:18.539> can<00:04:18.989> confuse

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
they're so controlled can confuse

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.770 
they're so controlled can confuse
stabilization<00:04:20.250> mechanisms<00:04:20.789> I've<00:04:21.390> also<00:04:21.539> got

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
stabilization mechanisms I've also got

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.510 
stabilization mechanisms I've also got
two<00:04:21.959> different<00:04:22.140> modes<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.860> stabilization

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
two different modes of stabilization

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.140 
two different modes of stabilization
depending<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.419> your<00:04:24.539> lens

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.870 
to come down to how sturdy the sticks
are<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.780> how<00:05:01.900> well<00:05:02.199> they<00:05:02.440> hold<00:05:02.710> your<00:05:03.430> camera

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
are and how well they hold your camera

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.029

like<00:05:06.100> this<00:05:06.220> is<00:05:06.639> in<00:05:07.030> addition<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.419> my<00:05:07.510> auto

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
like this is in addition to my auto

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.260 
like this is in addition to my auto

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
focus and manual focus switch I have the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.689 
focus and manual focus switch I have the
option<00:05:10.660> of<00:05:10.810> changing<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.560> focus<00:05:11.979> range<00:05:12.340> of

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
the autofocus mechanism this is here

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.070 
the autofocus mechanism this is here
just<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.949> speed<00:05:15.340> up<00:05:15.520> auto<00:05:15.850> focusing<00:05:16.479> if<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:17.020> know

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
just to speed up auto focusing if I know

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.510 
just to speed up auto focusing if I know
that<00:05:17.199> I'm<00:05:17.440> working<00:05:17.530> with<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.860> subject<00:05:18.160> that's

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
that I'm working with a subject that's

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.900 
that I'm working with a subject that's
closer<00:05:19.000> then<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.780> might<00:05:20.050> switch<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.070> 1.8

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
closer then I might switch to the 1.8

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.409 
closer then I might switch to the 1.8
meters<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.570> infinity<00:05:23.289> that<00:05:23.440> will<00:05:23.770> allow<00:05:24.100> it<00:05:24.310> to

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
meters to infinity that will allow it to

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.969 
meters to infinity that will allow it to
focus<00:05:25.419> as<00:05:25.570> close<00:05:25.750> as<00:05:25.960> almost<00:05:26.380> two<00:05:26.500> meters<00:05:26.830> if

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
focus as close as almost two meters if

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.830 
focus as close as almost two meters if
my<00:05:27.460> subject<00:05:27.850> is<00:05:27.970> definitely<00:05:28.419> farther<00:05:28.720> away

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
my subject is definitely farther away

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.029 
my subject is definitely farther away
than<00:05:29.080> that<00:05:29.229> then<00:05:29.380> I<00:05:29.440> might<00:05:29.560> want<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:29.830> switch

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
than that then I might want to switch

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.310 
than that then I might want to switch
out<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.430> six<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.180> half<00:05:31.210> meters<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.870> infinity

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
out to six and a half meters to infinity

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.020 
out to six and a half meters to infinity
that<00:05:32.770> will<00:05:32.889> keep<00:05:33.039> it<00:05:33.190> from<00:05:33.250> searching<00:05:33.849> through

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
that will keep it from searching through

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.940 
that will keep it from searching through
the<00:05:34.150> entire<00:05:34.419> focus<00:05:34.720> range<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.440> that<00:05:35.470> will

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
the entire focus range and that will

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.339 
the entire focus range and that will
speed<00:05:36.039> up<00:05:36.250> my<00:05:36.400> autofocus<00:05:36.970> if<00:05:37.389> you're<00:05:38.110> shooting

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
speed up my autofocus if you're shooting

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.290 
speed up my autofocus if you're shooting
a<00:05:38.530> moving<00:05:38.950> subject<00:05:39.250> then<00:05:39.729> you'll<00:05:39.910> want<00:05:40.120> to

a moving subject then you'll want to

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.210

particularly when you're zoomed in all
the<00:05:51.820> way<00:05:51.940> it's<00:05:52.270> difficult<00:05:52.810> to<00:05:52.960> find<00:05:53.229> something

out there in the world when you're
looking<00:05:55.360> through<00:05:55.419> a<00:05:55.599> lens<00:05:55.720> like<00:05:56.020> this<00:05:56.050> so

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
looking through a lens like this so

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.650 
looking through a lens like this so
trying<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.310> get<00:05:57.729> it<00:05:57.849> and<00:05:58.000> follow<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.360> can<00:05:58.539> be

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
trying to get it and follow it can be

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.120 
trying to get it and follow it can be
trickier<00:05:59.080> if<00:05:59.289> you<00:05:59.470> see<00:05:59.680> that<00:05:59.830> it's<00:05:59.919> going<00:06:00.039> to

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
trickier if you see that it's going to

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.040 
trickier if you see that it's going to
be<00:06:00.310> in<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.460> particular<00:06:00.820> place<00:06:01.120> set<00:06:01.780> up<00:06:01.810> your
