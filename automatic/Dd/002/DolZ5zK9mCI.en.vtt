00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.350

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.059

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.059
 3d pompei 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.340
 Some invoked the gods help 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.379
 many lay at the mercy of death 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.060
 but in a lost city 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 the biggest secret is still waiting 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.710
 from 1 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 whatever happens here 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.009
 no god can stop it now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.409
 tom p 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.830
 na I really do not know what 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.720
 I think of this teaser trailer 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.610
 should because pompei brings us stated 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.820
 expected from 27 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.710
 february 2014 in German cinemas 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.280
 tells the story of milo only 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.500
 slave first strong slave year 79 as 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.720
 Mount Vesuvius erupting over the city 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.100
 pompeji and, above all, he must of one 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.869
 ship out with watch like that 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.549
 disaster on this city 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.530
 It's raining while he's on the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.209
 Located to Naples is the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.770
 women he falls madly in love with 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.870
 still has in pompeji and stuff 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.760
 he decides to return there and 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.860
 to look the catastrophe in the eye 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.890
 and to save her and that is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.790
 of course that nature is tremendous 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.920
 catastrophic scenario perfect the whole 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.870
 Comes to german theaters in 3d 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 just wonder, the wars or may 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.930
 the next time honestly the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.640
 first swing at the beginning already with 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.560
 this ashes now with this year 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.819
 ultimately the dead body if you 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.800
 but it can be nice 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.940
 cinematically well captured and then would be 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.280
 I cut this something he hurts 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.660
 Bring this story over and over 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 I find also see the effects already 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.440
 pretty mediocre and I am 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 curious what finally the movie on 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.640
 The end will be in the cast now 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.890
 not all that incredibly famous 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.049
 bavaria must be directed by paul ws 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.549
 anderson and the big fanbase 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.140
 I'm curious who determines one 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.030
 second trailer check is always on 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.650
 little more of the footage too 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.940
 face gets what he is to the trainer 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.290
 likes to break into the comments 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.239
 that was now i take my short one 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.400
 small first confusing or 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.660
 kinky because relatively unsafe 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.739
 impression about what i got from that 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.180
 should keep stripes 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.410
 but that's the way it is sometimes you have to 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.120
 yes also the audience not withheld 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.989
 otherwise water just takes part 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.190
 no short teaser check to 3d lask in 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.269
 make a thumb with it let it 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.709
 We do not like to stay 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.120

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.560

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.299

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.090
 Let it stay if it is 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.040
