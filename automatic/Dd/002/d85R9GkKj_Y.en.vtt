 [Music] 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.709
 it's him all today I'm going 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.690
 introduce the trampoline zebra has 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.330
 manufactured by worlds apart it's for the 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.980
 12 months and more and it looks great guys 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.359
 we will try it right away but 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.359
 first we will open the box 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.419
 here is what we find inside 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.970
 of the box the trampoline canvas on 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.079
 which child will jump with a 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.149
 decor of so vcore zebras the head 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.520
 of the zebra bed that we will be able 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.200
 to put on a handle seems there is 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.150
 a handle to which the child goes 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.620
 to be able to stand 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.920
 so we have the different elements 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.640
 who will be able to do the support of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.620
 our trampoline 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.030
 we have a small box in 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.250
 which normally there must be 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.380
 three are different when the child 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.540
 will jump on the canvas it's going that must 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.550
 make sounds a priori and we 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.400
 tips the dea for the for the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.960
 feet of the trampoline as well as the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.799
 different tools and the record 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.590
 of use 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:25.319
 now we adapt 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:25.319
