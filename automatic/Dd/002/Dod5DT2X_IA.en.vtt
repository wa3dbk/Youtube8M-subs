these muffins into three pieces one two

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.840 
these muffins into three pieces one two
three<00:04:32.740> lay<00:04:33.740> this<00:04:33.919> on<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.370> plate<00:04:34.610> like<00:04:34.820> this

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
three lay this on to the plate like this

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.440 
three lay this on to the plate like this
this<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.690> called<00:04:36.110> shingling<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:37.789> put<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.180> like

this is called shingling to put it like

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.420 
this is called shingling to put it like
that<00:04:38.479> is<00:04:38.840> ash<00:04:38.960> like<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.560> way<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.740> shingle<00:04:40.370> the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
that is ash like the way you shingle the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.070 
that is ash like the way you shingle the
roof<00:04:40.550> or<00:04:40.820> something<00:04:40.849> all<00:04:41.570> right<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:41.840> sauce

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
roof or something all right this sauce

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.190 
roof or something all right this sauce
is<00:04:42.110> still<00:04:42.560> nice<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:42.860> warm<00:04:43.539> which<00:04:44.539> means<00:04:44.840> that

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
is still nice and warm which means that

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.350 
is still nice and warm which means that
when<00:04:45.830> we<00:04:45.919> put<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.190> whipped<00:04:46.610> cream<00:04:46.820> on<00:04:46.849> top<00:04:47.000> of

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
when we put the whipped cream on top of

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.580 
when we put the whipped cream on top of
this<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.780> whipped<00:04:47.960> cream<00:04:48.169> is<00:04:48.229> going<00:04:48.349> to<00:04:48.440> start

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
this the whipped cream is going to start

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.150 
this the whipped cream is going to start
melting<00:04:48.830> so<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:50.139> think<00:04:51.139> maybe<00:04:51.740> we'll<00:04:51.950> put<00:04:52.099> the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
melting so I think maybe we'll put the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.360 
melting so I think maybe we'll put the
whipped<00:04:52.280> cream<00:04:52.460> on<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.700> side<00:04:52.729> instead<00:04:53.450> so

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
whipped cream on the side instead so

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.950 
whipped cream on the side instead so
there's<00:04:55.370> chocolate<00:04:55.820> sauce<00:04:56.000> right<00:04:56.389> or<00:04:56.599> the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
there's chocolate sauce right or the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.379 
there's chocolate sauce right or the
strawberry<00:04:57.710> sauce<00:04:57.889> right<00:04:58.220> onto<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.639> muffin

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.820
