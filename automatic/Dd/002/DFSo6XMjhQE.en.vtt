00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it's pretty much the best way to make

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.359

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
get into this I'll just be using this

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
get into this I'll just be using this
kitchen<00:00:35.579> knife<00:00:40.670> plastic<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.809> got<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> 64

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649

gigabyte<00:00:47.010> model<00:00:47.219> because<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> 128<00:00:48.559> was<00:00:49.559> out

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
gigabyte model because the 128 was out

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580 
gigabyte model because the 128 was out
on<00:00:50.190> pre-order<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.300> thought<00:00:51.510> I'd<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.930> 64

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
on pre-order so I thought I'd just go 64

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
on pre-order so I thought I'd just go 64
I<00:00:52.800> usually<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> base<00:00:53.940> model<00:00:54.210> but

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I usually just use the base model but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
I usually just use the base model but

since you could get a big upgrade for
the<00:00:56.699> hundred<00:00:57.000> dollars<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:57.539> opted<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739

pictures and stuff online but I'm really
interested<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.170> how<00:01:55.530> practical<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
interested to see how practical this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
interested to see how practical this
large<00:01:57.270> screen<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.710> made<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.920> right

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
large screen is and if I made the right

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.940 
large screen is and if I made the right
decision<00:01:59.640> because<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.170> does<00:02:01.920> not

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
decision because this thing does not

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.289
