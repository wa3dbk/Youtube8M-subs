00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
better ones I've tried from the first

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.700 
better ones I've tried from the first
time<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.399> opened<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> put<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.350> held

my<00:01:58.950> lashes<00:01:59.189> held<00:01:59.729> them<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> pretty<00:02:00.810> much

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
my lashes held them up and pretty much

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.990 
my lashes held them up and pretty much
all<00:02:01.259> day<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> consistency

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
all day it was like the consistency

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
all day it was like the consistency
which<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> perfect<00:02:03.780> from<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> get-go<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.710> my

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
which is perfect from the get-go on my

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190 
which is perfect from the get-go on my
lashes<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.299> best<00:02:06.509> way<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.960> describe

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
lashes and the best way I can describe

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800 
lashes and the best way I can describe
it<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> feels<00:02:08.190> almost<00:02:08.729> rubbery<00:02:09.060> or<00:02:09.330> rubber

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
it is it feels almost rubbery or rubber

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.770 
it is it feels almost rubbery or rubber
light<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.410> doesn't<00:02:10.920> dry<00:02:11.250> dry<00:02:11.879> which<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.480> why<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
light it doesn't dry dry which is why I

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
light it doesn't dry dry which is why I
don't<00:02:13.050> think<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.290> has<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> problem<00:02:13.680> with

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
don't think it has a problem with

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.460 
don't think it has a problem with
flaking<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> touch<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.660> feels<00:02:16.050> like

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
flaking when I touch it it feels like

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.949 
flaking when I touch it it feels like
almost<00:02:16.709> bouncy<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:18.030> crunchy<00:02:18.480> or<00:02:18.720> really

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
almost bouncy not like crunchy or really

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.530 
almost bouncy not like crunchy or really
stiff<00:02:19.319> warning<00:02:19.890> though<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.700> pretty<00:02:21.030> clumpy

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
stiff warning though it is pretty clumpy

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.510 
stiff warning though it is pretty clumpy
especially<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.500> brush<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.739> sometimes<00:02:23.370> on

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
especially on the brush and sometimes on

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
especially on the brush and sometimes on
my<00:02:23.550> lashes<00:02:24.060> I'll<00:02:24.209> get<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> big<00:02:24.750> glob<00:02:24.989> but<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
my lashes I'll get like a big glob but I

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.199 
my lashes I'll get like a big glob but I
don't<00:02:25.770> mind<00:02:25.980> clumpy<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.520> much<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:26.970> it

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
don't mind clumpy so much because it

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.869 
don't mind clumpy so much because it
helps<00:02:27.450> my<00:02:27.569> lashes<00:02:27.840> look<00:02:28.050> full<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.069> thick<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
helps my lashes look full and thick and

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.910 
helps my lashes look full and thick and
like<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.150> actually<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.840> lashes<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.500> one<00:02:31.680> thing

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
like I actually have lashes so one thing

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.860 
like I actually have lashes so one thing
I<00:02:32.069> didn't<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.459> about<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.629> brush

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
I didn't like about this is the brush

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.780 
I didn't like about this is the brush
it's<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> plastic<00:02:34.800> ones<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.670> I'm

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
it's one of the plastic ones and I'm

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.580 
it's one of the plastic ones and I'm
just<00:02:36.000> not<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> fan<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.510> how<00:02:36.780> its<00:02:36.989> shaped<00:02:37.230> it's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
just not a fan of how its shaped it's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.369 
just not a fan of how its shaped it's
subtle<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.459> goes<00:02:38.640> out<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.260> then

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
subtle but it goes out in out and then

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.229 
subtle but it goes out in out and then
to<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> point<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.250> eyes<00:02:41.489> are<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:41.790> shaped<00:02:42.150> like

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
to a point my eyes are not shaped like

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.750 
to a point my eyes are not shaped like
that<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:42.870> anyways<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.590> was<00:02:43.980> still<00:02:44.280> able<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.610> use

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
that but anyways I was still able to use

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
that but anyways I was still able to use
the<00:02:45.060> brush<00:02:45.269> obviously<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.440> formula

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
the brush obviously and the formula

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.530 
the brush obviously and the formula
definitely<00:02:47.459> outweighs<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> brush<00:02:48.180> being

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
definitely outweighs the brush being

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.960 
definitely outweighs the brush being
difficult<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.530> me<00:02:49.650> well<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:49.980> hope<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.670> covered

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
difficult for me well I hope I covered

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.699 
difficult for me well I hope I covered
everything<00:02:51.300> nothing<00:02:51.989> else<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.260> really<00:02:52.379> coming

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
everything nothing else is really coming

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.470 
everything nothing else is really coming
to<00:02:52.800> mind<00:02:53.010> right<00:02:53.099> now<00:02:53.250> yes<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.120> would<00:02:54.450> recommend

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
to mind right now yes I would recommend

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.600 
to mind right now yes I would recommend
this<00:02:55.050> as<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> mascara<00:02:55.709> for<00:02:56.010> monolids

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
this as a mascara for monolids

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.180 
this as a mascara for monolids
