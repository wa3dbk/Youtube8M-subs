with<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> lot<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.830> novel<00:00:20.189> features

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
with a lot of novel features

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.570 
with a lot of novel features
I<00:00:20.880> asked<00:00:21.600> founder<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.140> CEO<00:00:22.350> David<00:00:23.010> Laury<00:00:23.250> what

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
I asked founder and CEO David Laury what

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.429 
I asked founder and CEO David Laury what
he<00:00:23.640> thought<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.180> three<00:00:24.600> most<00:00:24.930> important

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
he thought the three most important

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.920 
he thought the three most important
items<00:00:25.800> were<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.279> would<00:00:26.910> say<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.300> well<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
items were I would say that well the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.349 
items were I would say that well the
most<00:00:28.140> most<00:00:28.470> obvious<00:00:28.949> feature<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.210> fact

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
most most obvious feature is the fact

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.540 
most most obvious feature is the fact
that<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> canard<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.949> has<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> canard

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that it's a canard so it has a canard

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.380 
that it's a canard so it has a canard
surface<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.450> front<00:00:33.680> then<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.390> big

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
surface on the front then you have a big

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.799 
surface on the front then you have a big
V<00:00:36.630> tail<00:00:37.040> with<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> slight<00:00:38.370> V<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> back<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
V tail with a slight V at the back in

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.790 
V tail with a slight V at the back in
order<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> keep<00:00:40.469> control<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.540> route<00:00:42.930> at

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
order to keep control of the route at

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.360 
order to keep control of the route at
high<00:00:44.430> angles<00:00:44.879> angles<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.750> attack<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
high angles angles of attack and you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.940 
high angles angles of attack and you
have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> swept<00:00:47.850> wing<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.530> want<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
have a swept wing because you want the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.319 
have a swept wing because you want the
CG<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:51.020> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.379> range<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.270> okay<00:00:54.270> for

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
CG to be in the range that is okay for

deck then the canopy is a is pretty big

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
deck then the canopy is a is pretty big
and<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> canopy<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> closes

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and in we have the canopy that closes

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
and in we have the canopy that closes
like<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.500> an<00:01:22.590> actuator<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
like this with an actuator and then you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.840 
like this with an actuator and then you
can<00:01:24.659> unlock<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.500> push<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> away<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
can unlock it and push it away if you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.840 
can unlock it and push it away if you
need<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> case<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> an<00:01:28.259> emergency<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.189> then

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
need to in case of an emergency and then

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.330 
need to in case of an emergency and then
you've<00:01:30.000> been<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.659> order<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.140> able<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.409> get

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you've been in order to be able to get

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.030 
you've been in order to be able to get
up<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> aircraft<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> pivot<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
up the aircraft you have a pivot that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.760 
up the aircraft you have a pivot that
opens<00:01:35.460> when<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.640> canopy<00:01:36.060> opens<00:01:36.770> mechanically

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
opens when the canopy opens mechanically

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.950 
opens when the canopy opens mechanically
linked<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:39.090> goes<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
linked that goes like this

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
linked that goes like this
and<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.979> jump<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> aircraft

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and then you can jump on the aircraft

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.139 
and then you can jump on the aircraft
with<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.799> side<00:01:44.430> sticks<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.000> are

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
with it so you have side sticks that are

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
with it so you have side sticks that are
mechanically<00:01:45.570> linked<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.890> controls<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
mechanically linked to the controls you

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.780 
mechanically linked to the controls you

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
don't have time to build it or they

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.679 
don't have time to build it or they
don't<00:03:03.030> want<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.359> buy<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.250> secondhand<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.689> and

don't want to buy a secondhand one and

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.490 
don't want to buy a secondhand one and
the<00:03:07.230> second<00:03:07.799> thing<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.189> that<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.500> unveil

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the second thing is that we have unveil

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860 
the second thing is that we have unveil
on<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.799> web<00:03:10.980> about<00:03:11.909> about<00:03:12.359> two<00:03:12.540> weeks<00:03:12.720> ago

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
on the web about about two weeks ago

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.500 
on the web about about two weeks ago
though<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.500> existence<00:03:13.889> of<00:03:13.980> cobalt<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.519> we've

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
though the existence of cobalt and we've

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.379 
though the existence of cobalt and we've
had<00:03:15.689> more<00:03:16.049> than<00:03:16.170> 500<00:03:16.560> leads<00:03:16.950> right<00:03:17.760> now<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.150> so

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
had more than 500 leads right now so so

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.589 
had more than 500 leads right now so so
I<00:03:18.419> guess<00:03:19.849> it's<00:03:20.849> not<00:03:21.030> an<00:03:21.180> aircraft<00:03:21.329> for

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
I guess it's not an aircraft for

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.750 
I guess it's not an aircraft for
everyone<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.139> know<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.620> there<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.430> lot<00:03:23.730> of

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
people that don't like canards but I

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.270 
people that don't like canards but I
mean<00:03:26.099> this<00:03:26.310> aircraft<00:03:26.790> should<00:03:27.590> open<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.889> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
