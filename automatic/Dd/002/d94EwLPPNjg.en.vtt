is the big one so anyway without further

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.140 
is the big one so anyway without further
ado

you that Remo Joey is slowing it down

you that Remo Joey is slowing it down
currently<00:01:51.540> we're<00:01:51.660> at<00:01:51.690> about<00:01:51.900> 10<00:01:52.350> frames<00:01:52.590> per

currently we're at about 10 frames per
second<00:01:53.250> I've<00:01:53.730> seen<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.300> hit<00:01:54.480> 25<00:01:55.050> to<00:01:55.260> 30<00:01:55.500> frames

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
second I've seen it hit 25 to 30 frames

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.600 
second I've seen it hit 25 to 30 frames
per<00:01:56.070> second<00:01:56.930> which<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:57.960> pretty<00:01:58.260> good<00:01:59.160> for<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
per second which is pretty good for the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.610 
per second which is pretty good for the
Dallas<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:01.050> second<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.500> you'll<00:02:01.590> probably

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
Dallas the second thing you'll probably

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.770 
Dallas the second thing you'll probably
notice<00:02:01.980> that<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.540> not

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
notice that is that this is not

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.260 
notice that is that this is not
fullscreen<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.990> developers<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.970> this

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
fullscreen and the developers and this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.690 
fullscreen and the developers and this
is<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> gas<00:02:10.070> but<00:02:11.070> I'm<00:02:11.190> guessing<00:02:11.370> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
is just the gas but I'm guessing that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820 
is just the gas but I'm guessing that
it's<00:02:12.540> not<00:02:12.690> fullscreen<00:02:13.200> because<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.590> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's not fullscreen because I think that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
it's not fullscreen because I think that
might<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.340> been<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.850> big<00:02:15.210> cause<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.110> was

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
might have been a big cause of what was

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.290 
might have been a big cause of what was
causing<00:02:16.740> all<00:02:17.130> these<00:02:17.250> problems<00:02:17.640> before<00:02:17.820> is

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
causing all these problems before is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.450 
causing all these problems before is
that<00:02:18.930> Nintendo<00:02:19.110> 64<00:02:19.860> games<00:02:20.040> were<00:02:20.220> not

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
that Nintendo 64 games were not

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.130 
that Nintendo 64 games were not
originally<00:02:21.180> designed<00:02:21.210> for<00:02:21.860> 16:9<00:02:22.860> ratio<00:02:24.140> they

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
originally designed for 16:9 ratio they

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.460 
originally designed for 16:9 ratio they
weren't<00:02:25.380> made<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.830> aspect<00:02:26.130> ratio<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
weren't made for that aspect ratio and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.430 
weren't made for that aspect ratio and
returning<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.680> its<00:02:28.800> original<00:02:29.240> ratio<00:02:30.440> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
returning it to its original ratio I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.580 
returning it to its original ratio I
think<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.480> probably<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:34.020> most<00:02:34.230> ingenious

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
think is probably the most ingenious

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.840 
think is probably the most ingenious
ideas<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.280> could<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:37.490> there<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.640> not

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
ideas I could think of there is not

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.220 
ideas I could think of there is not
currently<00:02:39.150> an<00:02:39.480> option<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.960> make<00:02:40.110> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
currently an option to make it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
currently an option to make it
fullscreen<00:02:40.790> but<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.820> think<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.300> would

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
fullscreen but I think that would

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.250 
fullscreen but I think that would
degrade<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> quality<00:02:44.600> if<00:02:45.600> you've<00:02:45.780> ever<00:02:45.930> used

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
degrade the quality if you've ever used

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.150 
degrade the quality if you've ever used
the<00:02:46.410> Dallas<00:02:46.800> before<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.090> originals<00:02:48.920> I'm<00:02:49.920> sure

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
the Dallas before the originals I'm sure

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.100 
the Dallas before the originals I'm sure
even<00:02:50.520> with<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> fact<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.660> been<00:02:51.780> slowed

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
even with the fact that it's been slowed

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.900 
even with the fact that it's been slowed
down<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> bit<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:53.130> remote<00:02:53.430> joy<00:02:53.700> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
down a bit because of remote joy that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.510 
down a bit because of remote joy that
you<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.209> tell<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.650> quality<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.280> much

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
you can tell that the quality is much

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.010 
you can tell that the quality is much
better<00:02:56.760> than<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.150> used<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.630> you'll<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.930> able

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
better than it used to be you'll be able

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.820 
better than it used to be you'll be able
to<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.320> here<00:02:58.500> as<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.739> video<00:02:59.040> plays<00:02:59.310> through

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
to see here as this video plays through

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.540 
to see here as this video plays through
but<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.819> some<00:03:03.090> immense<00:03:03.450> improvement

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
but it's it's some immense improvement

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.240 
but it's it's some immense improvement
the<00:03:05.550> audio<00:03:05.790> quality<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.830> although<00:03:07.830> still

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
the audio quality is although still

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.670 
the audio quality is although still
quite<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> bit<00:03:08.849> glitchy<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.690> huge

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
quite a bit glitchy is a huge

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.110 
quite a bit glitchy is a huge
improvement<00:03:11.010> over<00:03:11.310> what<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.640> used<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:11.970> I'm

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
improvement over what it used to be I'm

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.280 
improvement over what it used to be I'm
not<00:03:12.180> going<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.450> play<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.690> right<00:03:12.810> now

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
not going to play it right now

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.220 
not going to play it right now
mainly<00:03:14.099> because<00:03:14.220> remote<00:03:14.670> joy<00:03:15.110> kind<00:03:16.110> of

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
mainly because remote joy kind of

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.860 
mainly because remote joy kind of
degrades<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:18.000> an<00:03:18.090> extent<00:03:20.660> if<00:03:21.660> you're

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
degrades it to an extent if you're

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.670 
degrades it to an extent if you're
wondering<00:03:22.170> why<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:22.319> at<00:03:23.220> least<00:03:23.370> from<00:03:23.880> my

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
wondering why it's at least from my

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.180 
wondering why it's at least from my
opinion<00:03:25.680> when<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:26.209> see<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.830> its

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
opinion when I see is that the its

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.059 
opinion when I see is that the its
degraded<00:03:29.790> mainly<00:03:30.630> because<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:31.590> PSP<00:03:31.980> is

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
degraded mainly because the PSP is

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.960 
degraded mainly because the PSP is
limited<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.580> Bram<00:03:32.970> or<00:03:33.239> memory<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.730> fact

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
limited on Bram or memory and the fact

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.580 
limited on Bram or memory and the fact
that<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.209> has<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.480> play<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.870> game<00:03:37.350> or

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
that it has to play this game or

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.190 
that it has to play this game or
emulator<00:03:38.069> while<00:03:38.760> at<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.000> same<00:03:39.239> time<00:03:39.540> running

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
emulator while at the same time running

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.840 
emulator while at the same time running
a<00:03:40.410> program<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.920> stream<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.430> computer

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
a program to stream it to the computer

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.640 
a program to stream it to the computer
just<00:03:42.360> takes<00:03:42.569> up<00:03:42.750> more<00:03:42.930> than<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.230> usually<00:03:43.440> does

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
just takes up more than it usually does

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.479 
just takes up more than it usually does
and<00:03:44.130> slows<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.209> down<00:03:45.239> quite<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.720> bit

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
and slows it down quite a bit

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.420 
and slows it down quite a bit
but<00:03:47.489> as<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.849> can<00:03:47.940> see<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:49.500> video<00:03:49.799> is<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.160> very

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
but as you can see the video is not very

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.670 
but as you can see the video is not very
glitchy<00:03:50.760> at<00:03:51.000> all<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.140> all<00:03:52.290> under<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
glitchy at all this is all under the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.470 
glitchy at all this is all under the
default<00:03:52.920> settings<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.610> haven't<00:03:53.970> messed<00:03:54.360> with

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
default settings I haven't messed with

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.240 
default settings I haven't messed with
it<00:03:54.690> at<00:03:54.810> all

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.510 

so<00:03:59.030> it's<00:03:59.300> it's<00:03:59.960> a<00:04:00.080> huge<00:04:00.500> improvement<00:04:00.890> I'd<00:04:01.280> say

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
so it's it's a huge improvement I'd say

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.130 
so it's it's a huge improvement I'd say
I<00:04:01.700> don't<00:04:02.660> know<00:04:02.750> what<00:04:03.110> seven<00:04:03.560> eight<00:04:03.830> out<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.190> ten

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
I don't know what seven eight out of ten

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.720 
I don't know what seven eight out of ten
even<00:04:06.140> not<00:04:06.320> comparing<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.070> what<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.430> used<00:04:07.460> to

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
even not comparing it to what it used to

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.210 
even not comparing it to what it used to
be<00:04:07.790> this<00:04:08.660> is<00:04:08.870> just<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.350> huge<00:04:09.620> improvement<00:04:09.920> even

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
be this is just a huge improvement even

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.590 
be this is just a huge improvement even
if<00:04:10.460> this<00:04:10.610> was<00:04:10.790> just<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.120> first<00:04:11.150> one<00:04:11.480> you've

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
if this was just the first one you've

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.230 
if this was just the first one you've
seen<00:04:11.630> I'd<00:04:11.960> still<00:04:12.260> give<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.830> good<00:04:13.730> seven<00:04:14.120> or

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
seen I'd still give it a good seven or

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.140 
seen I'd still give it a good seven or
eight<00:04:14.360> out<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.570> ten<00:04:14.840> this<00:04:15.050> is<00:04:15.230> a<00:04:16.030> really<00:04:17.030> great

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
eight out of ten this is a really great

which is makes it all that much more

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.600 
which is makes it all that much more
amazing<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.960> fact<00:05:18.169> that<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.740> know<00:05:18.860> this

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610

person<00:05:20.000> has<00:05:20.090> managed<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.540> do<00:05:20.690> so<00:05:20.960> much

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.370 

I<00:05:23.650> mean<00:05:24.190> it's<00:05:24.490> gonna<00:05:24.850> take<00:05:24.970> time<00:05:25.389> it's<00:05:25.930> you

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
know it's not finished you know the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.140 
know it's not finished you know the
quality<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.500> sound<00:05:29.800> like<00:05:29.950> I<00:05:30.040> said<00:05:30.310> still

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150

quality and the sound like I said still
needs<00:05:31.389> improvement<00:05:32.669> but<00:05:33.669> I<00:05:34.060> think<00:05:34.540> this<00:05:34.630> is

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
needs improvement but I think this is

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.500 
needs improvement but I think this is
just<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:35.050> major<00:05:35.260> improvement<00:05:36.120> if<00:05:37.120> you<00:05:37.270> want<00:05:37.450> to
