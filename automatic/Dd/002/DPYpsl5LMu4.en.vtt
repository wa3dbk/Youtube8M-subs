00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.590
 hello how about youtubers good in this 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.330
 I'm going to teach you how to enable 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 iron windows 8 as you have realized 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.720
 windows 8 has taken the opportunity 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.910
 of transparency in the bar 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.310
 tasks and in the extra 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.090
 as you can see, something blue is coming out 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.130
 good 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.919
 what they are going to do 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.990
 is to right click a desktop and 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.590
 now customize 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.600
 here 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.540
 They go to the bottom and choose black theme 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.320
 in high contrast 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.320
 we were doing 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.430
 good the subject will click on color 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.860
 and been leaving like this 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.420
 the good week this is right click on 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.750
 the desk again and we're going to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750
 personalize 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.620
 then 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.290
 they choose any topic they have but 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.260
 except the determined seconds because 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.510
 because these have some colors 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.380
 very clear mobile then it does not work 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.110
 in this case I will leave you this topic is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.390
 Cuba and listening to the video will be link and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.680
 you can download it good applies 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.680
 and we wait for it to be applied 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.820
 well once explained, we will remain like this 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.220
 we only click on save changes 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.409
 and as you can see , the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.409
 transparency in the taskbar 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.200
 well now we only close this but 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.530
 there is a problem that when we move the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.600
 window is distorted good that's not 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.159
 I know why it's done but I'm going to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.190
 leave a program that is solve 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.930
 this item 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.990
 and for that they are going to download this 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.040
 error file called blend damos 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.040
 right click very strange 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.610
 and it is only this program 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.260
 they will be double and they will be good 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.580
 they will have it as here they will be very very 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.380
 transparent, you are not going to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:36.840
 cover and only gives in hype 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.840
 and now we are going to see a window 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.859
 and as we see in the distortion and good 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.719
 this is creating these videos it 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.480
 finds that he used what having 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.040
 but I do not know why in the 28 new 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.670
 functions then I decided to do it 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.989
 we eat and if it is possible and I do not 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.329
 what works would not continue to be us 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.609
 we ate well so we stayed in the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.629
 video you have to restore good 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.629
