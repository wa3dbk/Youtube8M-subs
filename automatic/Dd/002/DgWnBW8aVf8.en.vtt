00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

in<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.750> lesson<00:00:00.989> I'd<00:00:01.230> like<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.560> look<00:00:01.709> at<00:00:01.800> two

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
in this lesson I'd like to look at two

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.530 
in this lesson I'd like to look at two
different<00:00:01.979> techniques<00:00:02.550> known<00:00:02.909> as<00:00:03.090> hammer-ons

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
different techniques known as hammer-ons

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.079 
different techniques known as hammer-ons
and<00:00:03.720> pull-offs<00:00:04.190> this<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.339> where<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.609> produce<00:00:05.970> a

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
and pull-offs this is where we produce a

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.820 
and pull-offs this is where we produce a
note<00:00:06.270> from<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> string<00:00:06.810> without<00:00:07.140> plucking<00:00:07.500> it

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
note from the string without plucking it

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.410 
note from the string without plucking it
and<00:00:08.130> although<00:00:08.730> there<00:00:08.970> are<00:00:09.090> separate

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
and although there are separate

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.320 
and although there are separate
techniques<00:00:09.870> they're<00:00:10.380> often<00:00:10.710> used<00:00:10.740> together

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
techniques they're often used together

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.049 
techniques they're often used together
let's<00:00:12.330> start<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> hammer-on<00:00:13.139> as<00:00:13.880> the<00:00:14.880> name

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
let's start with a hammer-on as the name

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.120 
let's start with a hammer-on as the name
suggests<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.109> where<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.560> hammered<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
suggests this is where we hammered the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
suggests this is where we hammered the
string<00:00:17.430> onto<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.850> fret<00:00:18.090> board<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.600> finger

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
string onto the fret board with a finger

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.070 
string onto the fret board with a finger
of<00:00:19.020> our<00:00:19.140> fretting<00:00:19.560> hand<00:00:20.480> let's<00:00:21.480> try<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.750> by

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
of our fretting hand let's try this by

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960 
of our fretting hand let's try this by
using<00:00:22.320> our<00:00:22.500> middle<00:00:22.859> finger<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.460> hammer<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.820> at

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
using our middle finger to hammer on at

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.999 
using our middle finger to hammer on at
the<00:00:24.090> fifth<00:00:24.359> fret<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> top<00:00:25.140> string<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.380 

once<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.250> practiced<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.820> until<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
once you have practiced this until you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
once you have practiced this until you
get<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> clear<00:00:33.810> note<00:00:34.080> we'll<00:00:34.560> try<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.830> with<00:00:35.070> our

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
get a clear note we'll try it with our

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.330 
get a clear note we'll try it with our
other<00:00:35.340> fingers<00:00:36.440> try<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.650> from<00:00:37.920> your<00:00:38.070> first

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
other fingers try going from your first

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.530 
other fingers try going from your first
finger<00:00:39.440> then<00:00:40.440> middle<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.510> third<00:00:42.960> and

all<00:00:48.720> at<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.290> fifth<00:00:49.530> fret<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:59.000> as<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
all at the fifth fret like this as you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.450 
all at the fifth fret like this as you
can<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.900> using<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.350> plucking<00:01:01.890> hand<00:01:02.040> first

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
can see I'm using my plucking hand first

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.060 
can see I'm using my plucking hand first
finger<00:01:02.909> to<00:01:03.089> mute<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.989> next<00:01:04.290> string<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
finger to mute the next string so that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
finger to mute the next string so that
if<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.580> catch<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.180> by<00:01:06.360> mistake<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.080> won't

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
if I catch this one by mistake you won't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.270 
if I catch this one by mistake you won't
actually<00:01:07.590> hear<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:10.290> time<00:01:10.560> let's<00:01:11.100> try

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
actually hear it this time let's try

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030 
actually hear it this time let's try
this<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:11.850> notes<00:01:12.120> one<00:01:13.110> plucked<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> one

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this with two notes one plucked and one

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.410 
this with two notes one plucked and one
hammered<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:16.250> pluck<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> open<00:01:17.820> top<00:01:18.030> string

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
hammered on pluck the open top string

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300 
hammered on pluck the open top string
then<00:01:18.750> hammer<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> third<00:01:19.830> fret<00:01:20.040> with

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
then hammer on at the third fret with

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
then hammer on at the third fret with
your<00:01:20.430> first<00:01:20.729> finger<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.540> this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.840 

once<00:01:25.260> you're<00:01:25.470> achieving<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.280> clear<00:01:26.580> notes

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
once you're achieving to clear notes

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.480 
once you're achieving to clear notes
then<00:01:27.420> move<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.140> using<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:29.070> fingers

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
then move on to using all your fingers

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
then move on to using all your fingers
as<00:01:29.670> before

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020 

this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> great<00:01:37.920> technique<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.430> improving

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
this is a great technique for improving

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
this is a great technique for improving
the<00:01:39.240> strength<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.750> agility<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.409> your

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the strength and agility in your

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.929 
the strength and agility in your
fretting<00:01:41.159> hand<00:01:43.189> when<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.340> confident<00:01:44.790> with

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
fretting hand when you're confident with

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.850 
fretting hand when you're confident with
the<00:01:45.030> hammer<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.360> we'll<00:01:46.020> move<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> pull

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the hammer on we'll move on to the pull

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.580 
the hammer on we'll move on to the pull
off<00:01:47.479> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> where<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.960> play<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> note<00:01:49.409> by

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
off this is where we play a note by

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.100 
off this is where we play a note by
pulling<00:01:50.039> the<00:01:50.159> string<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> side<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.990 

as<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.530> I'm<00:01:55.979> plucking<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.729> string

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
as you can see I'm plucking the string

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.420 
as you can see I'm plucking the string
with<00:01:57.179> what<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.780> normally<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.380> fretting<00:01:58.799> hand

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
with what is normally my fretting hand

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.790 
with what is normally my fretting hand
let's<00:02:01.300> try<00:02:01.510> this<00:02:01.570> using<00:02:02.230> all<00:02:02.350> our<00:02:02.560> fingers

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
let's try this using all our fingers

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.730 
let's try this using all our fingers
starting<00:02:03.370> with<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.550> first<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.780> middle<00:02:05.230> and

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
starting with the first the middle and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:17.760 
starting with the first the middle and
third<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.570> fourth<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.140> back<00:02:09.009> again

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.710 

when<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.520> are<00:02:18.610> comfortable<00:02:18.850> with<00:02:19.300> doing<00:02:19.480> this

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
when you are comfortable with doing this

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.460 
when you are comfortable with doing this
we'll<00:02:20.500> try<00:02:20.740> this<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:21.220> note<00:02:21.460> exercise<00:02:22.470> this

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
we'll try this to note exercise this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.140 
we'll try this to note exercise this
time<00:02:23.740> we'll<00:02:23.980> pluck<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> string<00:02:24.610> normally<00:02:25.060> at

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
time we'll pluck the string normally at

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.780 
time we'll pluck the string normally at
the<00:02:25.240> third<00:02:25.480> fret<00:02:25.750> top<00:02:26.140> string<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:27.340> pull<00:02:27.640> off

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the third fret top string then pull off

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.730 
the third fret top string then pull off
with<00:02:28.000> our<00:02:28.150> fretting<00:02:28.540> hand<00:02:28.570> first<00:02:29.260> finger<00:02:29.710> to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
with our fretting hand first finger to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.800 
with our fretting hand first finger to
the<00:02:30.100> open<00:02:30.400> string<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:31.150> so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
