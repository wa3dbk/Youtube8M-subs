00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.670 

this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.659> much<00:01:12.810> present<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.229> put<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.500> there

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680

pieces that look like you haven't resins
them<00:02:30.859> yet<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:32.030> it'll<00:02:32.180> look<00:02:32.299> like<00:02:32.359> just<00:02:32.689> plain

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
them yet so it'll look like just plain

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.710 
them yet so it'll look like just plain
cardstock<00:02:34.000> I'm<00:02:35.000> going<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.239> make<00:02:35.359> sure<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.689> of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.760 
cardstock I'm going to make sure all of
those<00:02:36.670> get<00:02:37.670> an<00:02:37.790> extra<00:02:38.269> bit<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.780> resin

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:50.300 

so<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.550> they<00:02:42.760> will<00:02:44.160> match<00:02:45.210> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.860 

hardness<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.030 

surrounding<00:02:55.709> areas

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
surrounding areas

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.090 
surrounding areas
so

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.370 

this<00:03:01.730> stand<00:03:02.060> inside<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:02.720> falling<00:03:03.110> down<00:03:03.230> I

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
this stand inside is just falling down I

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.140 
this stand inside is just falling down I
can<00:03:03.650> feel<00:03:03.680> it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.120 

I<00:03:08.180> hope<00:03:08.600> I'm<00:03:08.780> not<00:03:08.930> blocking<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.530> way<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:09.770> can't

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
I hope I'm not blocking the way I can't

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.650 
I hope I'm not blocking the way I can't
to<00:03:10.340> cameras<00:03:11.030> viewfinder<00:03:11.300> right<00:03:11.690> now

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.900 

where<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.260> battery<00:03:18.770> doesn't<00:03:18.980> die<00:03:19.130> my<00:03:19.520> cameras

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
where the battery doesn't die my cameras

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.490 
where the battery doesn't die my cameras
really<00:03:20.180> acting<00:03:20.570> up

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.500 

but<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.270> just

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
but so this is just

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.940 
but so this is just
I'm<00:03:27.870> doing<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.140> quick

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
I'm doing a quick

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.620 
I'm doing a quick
obsession<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.150> really<00:03:31.450> all<00:03:31.569> you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
obsession but this is really all you

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.670 
obsession but this is really all you
have<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.990> do<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:33.610> just<00:03:33.970> like<00:03:34.239> this

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
have to do is just like this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.860 
have to do is just like this
try<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> cover<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.670> whole<00:03:37.819> thing

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.190 

and<00:03:41.080> it'll<00:03:41.560> dry<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.069> it'll<00:03:42.190> be<00:03:42.340> hard

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.630 

try<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.700> make<00:03:51.700> sure<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:52.860> brush<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.069> on

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
try to make sure to brush it on

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.520 
try to make sure to brush it on
hard<00:03:56.210> so<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:56.600> there's<00:03:57.080> less<00:03:57.410> drips

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
hard so that there's less drips

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.040 
hard so that there's less drips
because<00:04:00.100> drips<00:04:00.550> lead<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.570> more<00:04:01.780> stuff

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
because drips lead to more stuff

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.729 
because drips lead to more stuff

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.570 
like I said that's not as big a deal and
this<00:06:32.139> will<00:06:32.320> probably<00:06:32.530> grip<00:06:32.860> down<00:06:33.040> anyway<00:06:33.340> but

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
this will probably grip down anyway but

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.409 
this will probably grip down anyway but
you<00:06:34.450> want<00:06:34.630> to<00:06:34.690> go<00:06:34.780> for<00:06:34.960> this<00:06:35.080> glassy<00:06:35.710> look<00:06:36.419> does

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
you want to go for this glassy look does

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:38.909 
you want to go for this glassy look does
that<00:06:37.540> means<00:06:37.720> you've<00:06:37.900> applied<00:06:38.110> a<00:06:38.230> good<00:06:38.530> second

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
that means you've applied a good second

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.320 
that means you've applied a good second
layer<00:06:40.440> so<00:06:41.440> that's<00:06:41.590> really<00:06:42.310> how<00:06:42.550> you<00:06:42.580> resin<00:06:43.090> a

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
layer so that's really how you resin a

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.990 
layer so that's really how you resin a
piece<00:06:43.660> of<00:06:43.870> your<00:06:44.080> halo<00:06:44.290> armor<00:06:45.990> okay
