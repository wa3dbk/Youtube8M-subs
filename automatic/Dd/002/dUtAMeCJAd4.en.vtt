thank<00:00:10.020> you<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.230> tuning<00:00:10.350> in<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.710> noon<00:00:10.980> Network

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:11.640 
thank you for tuning in to noon Network

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.430 
thank you for tuning in to noon Network
today<00:00:11.940> we're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.270> discuss<00:00:12.660> core

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
today we're going to discuss core

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.220 
today we're going to discuss core
aerating<00:00:14.010> and<00:00:14.220> overseeding<00:00:15.059> our<00:00:15.270> main<00:00:15.930> goal

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
aerating and overseeding our main goal

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.890 
aerating and overseeding our main goal
with<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.040> get<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> thicker<00:00:17.900> weed-free

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
with this is to get a thicker weed-free

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.730 
with this is to get a thicker weed-free
lawn<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.860> as<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.849> over<00:00:21.060> time<00:00:21.630> soil<00:00:22.619> gets

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
lawn and as you know over time soil gets

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.370 
lawn and as you know over time soil gets
compacted<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.820> thinner<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> lawn<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.170> more

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
compacted the thinner the lawn the more

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.050 
compacted the thinner the lawn the more
susceptible<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.100> to<00:00:26.280> actually<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.730> crab

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
susceptible it is to actually have crab

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
susceptible it is to actually have crab
grass<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.510> weeds<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.780> usually<00:00:28.050> fill<00:00:28.410> into

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
grass and weeds I usually fill into

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.130 
grass and weeds I usually fill into
those<00:00:28.949> thin<00:00:29.310> areas<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.600> we<00:00:30.720> want<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.990> do

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
those thin areas so what we want to do

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.050 
those thin areas so what we want to do
is<00:00:31.350> aerate<00:00:32.220> it<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.460> oversee<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.550 

so<00:00:38.060> with<00:00:38.270> core<00:00:38.480> aerating<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.020> overseeding

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
so with core aerating and overseeding

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.800 
so with core aerating and overseeding
this<00:00:40.040> will<00:00:40.250> actually<00:00:40.430> be<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.060> solution<00:00:41.780> to

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
this will actually be the solution to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.990 
this will actually be the solution to
this<00:00:42.050> issue<00:00:42.260> it's<00:00:43.130> actually<00:00:43.490> one<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.790> best

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
this issue it's actually one of the best

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.940 
this issue it's actually one of the best
cultural<00:00:44.570> practices<00:00:44.990> you<00:00:45.110> could<00:00:45.260> possibly<00:00:45.680> do

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
cultural practices you could possibly do

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.440 
cultural practices you could possibly do
for<00:00:46.160> your<00:00:46.850> turf

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
for your turf

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.480 
for your turf
it's<00:00:47.900> usually<00:00:48.080> done<00:00:48.320> during<00:00:48.710> late<00:00:49.100> summer

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
it's usually done during late summer

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.790 
it's usually done during late summer
early<00:00:49.790> fall<00:00:50.120> depending<00:00:50.960> on<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> season<00:00:51.590> and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
early fall depending on the season and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.620 
early fall depending on the season and
what<00:00:52.400> we're<00:00:52.520> actually<00:00:52.640> doing<00:00:53.120> with<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.390> core

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
what we're actually doing with the core

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.240 
what we're actually doing with the core
aeration<00:00:54.020> we're<00:00:54.590> going<00:00:54.830> over<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.070> whole

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
aeration we're going over the whole

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.010 
aeration we're going over the whole
entire<00:00:55.280> lawn<00:00:55.820> with<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.330> commercial<00:00:56.660> size

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
entire lawn with a commercial size

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.619 
entire lawn with a commercial size
aerator<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.010> what<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.700> does<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.239> actually

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
aerator and what it does is actually

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.810 
aerator and what it does is actually
pulls<00:00:59.960> out<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.559> cores<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.129> alleviates<00:01:01.700> the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
pulls out the cores and alleviates the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.000 
pulls out the cores and alleviates the
compaction<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:03.410> actually<00:01:03.710> done<00:01:03.890> with

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
compaction and it's actually done with

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.260 
compaction and it's actually done with
tines<00:01:04.430> on<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.790> machine<00:01:05.059> they're<00:01:05.180> usually

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
tines on the machine they're usually

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.380 
tines on the machine they're usually
about<00:01:05.600> 1<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.140> 2<00:01:06.380> inches<00:01:06.800> long<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.390> with

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
about 1 to 2 inches long and with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.030 
about 1 to 2 inches long and with
pulling<00:01:08.780> these<00:01:08.900> cores<00:01:09.259> out<00:01:09.440> it's<00:01:09.860> gonna

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
pulling these cores out it's gonna

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.640 
pulling these cores out it's gonna
alleviate<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.790> compaction<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.600> break<00:01:12.470> up

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
alleviate the compaction and break up

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.140 
alleviate the compaction and break up
the<00:01:12.680> soil<00:01:13.009> so<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.369> can<00:01:13.490> get<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.700> best<00:01:13.880> out<00:01:14.030> of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
the soil so you can get the best out of

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.540 
the soil so you can get the best out of
your<00:01:14.240> watering<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:15.320> air<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.009> nutrients

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
your watering the air and the nutrients

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.820 
your watering the air and the nutrients
from<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.910> fertilization<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:20.649> now<00:01:21.649> we're

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
from the fertilization so now we're

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.740 
from the fertilization so now we're
gonna<00:01:21.920> discuss<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.580> heavy<00:01:22.850> overseeding<00:01:23.600> that

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
gonna discuss the heavy overseeding that

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.359 
gonna discuss the heavy overseeding that
is<00:01:23.869> done<00:01:24.110> right<00:01:24.410> after<00:01:24.740> we<00:01:24.830> do<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.070> core

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
is done right after we do the core

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.190 
is done right after we do the core
aeration<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.330> reason<00:01:26.570> why<00:01:26.660> we<00:01:26.810> do<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:26.930> right

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
aeration the reason why we do it right

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.510 
aeration the reason why we do it right
after<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.619> because<00:01:27.649> we've<00:01:27.920> opened<00:01:28.369> up<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
after is because we've opened up the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.670 
after is because we've opened up the
soil<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.450> seeds<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:29.930> fall<00:01:30.140> into<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.470> hole

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
soil so the seeds can fall into the hole

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.790 
soil so the seeds can fall into the hole
and<00:01:30.920> they<00:01:31.399> can<00:01:31.520> get<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.759> best<00:01:32.110> germination<00:01:33.110> so

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
and they can get the best germination so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.620 
and they can get the best germination so
we're<00:01:33.979> trying<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.310> thicken<00:01:34.610> up<00:01:34.790> that<00:01:34.940> lawn<00:01:35.210> so

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
we're trying to thicken up that lawn so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.359 
we're trying to thicken up that lawn so
the<00:01:35.720> lawn<00:01:35.899> is<00:01:36.080> less<00:01:36.350> susceptible<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.009> crab

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
the lawn is less susceptible to crab

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.969 
the lawn is less susceptible to crab
grass<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.940> weeds

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.160 

and<00:01:42.979> what<00:01:43.130> you'll<00:01:43.310> actually<00:01:43.720> expect<00:01:44.720> from

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
and what you'll actually expect from

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.530 
and what you'll actually expect from
doing<00:01:45.500> this<00:01:45.619> core<00:01:45.920> aeration<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.729> overseeding

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
doing this core aeration and overseeding

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.560 
doing this core aeration and overseeding
at<00:01:47.659> first<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.740> will<00:01:48.950> see<00:01:49.280> all<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.060> plugs<00:01:50.330> that

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
at first you will see all the plugs that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.389 
at first you will see all the plugs that
were<00:01:50.659> pulled<00:01:50.899> out<00:01:51.080> from<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.560> times<00:01:51.890> will<00:01:52.369> be

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
were pulled out from the times will be

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.440 
were pulled out from the times will be
on<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.970> ground

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
on the ground

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.810 
on the ground
I<00:01:53.479> do<00:01:53.899> recommend<00:01:54.439> just<00:01:55.250> leaving<00:01:55.700> them<00:01:55.790> there

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
I do recommend just leaving them there

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.850 
I do recommend just leaving them there
they<00:01:56.299> do<00:01:56.360> hold<00:01:56.780> nutrients<00:01:57.290> that<00:01:57.470> eventually

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
they do hold nutrients that eventually

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.889 
they do hold nutrients that eventually
will<00:01:58.220> break<00:01:58.430> down<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.420> very<00:01:59.479> good<00:01:59.840> for

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
will break down and it's very good for

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.529
