00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
digging this out but this is this is

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.240 
digging this out but this is this is
exactly<00:00:07.470> why<00:00:07.620> places<00:00:08.069> get<00:00:08.220> down<00:00:09.260> this<00:00:11.150> is<00:00:12.150> just

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
exactly why places get down this is just

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
exactly why places get down this is just
wet<00:00:14.750> hygroscopic<00:00:16.340> suit<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:18.050> salt<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.289> can

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
wet hygroscopic suit and salt you can

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.109 
wet hygroscopic suit and salt you can
see<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.060> it's<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.210> quite<00:00:22.490> turning<00:00:23.490> into<00:00:23.609> into

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that's that's wet he's moist so you know

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
that's that's wet he's moist so you know
the<00:00:35.460> whole<00:00:35.550> environment<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.170> full

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the whole environment in here is is full

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
the whole environment in here is is full
and<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.800> chimney<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:39.149> through<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> whole

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
and that chimney all through the whole

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.950 
and that chimney all through the whole
there<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:41.370> full<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.239> horrible<00:00:42.600> wet

there is full of this this horrible wet
mushy<00:00:43.620> moist<00:00:44.930> chemical<00:00:45.930> soot<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:48.180> know

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
mushy moist chemical soot and you know

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.110 
mushy moist chemical soot and you know
this<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.600> what's<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.050> any<00:00:49.640> fireplace<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this is what's in any fireplace and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.959 
this is what's in any fireplace and
that's<00:00:52.020> why<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:53.070> chimneys<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.820> know

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that's why in these chimneys you know

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
that's why in these chimneys you know
these<00:00:54.180> these<00:00:54.449> areas<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.550> all

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
these these areas that we see that all

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150 
these these areas that we see that all
blocked<00:00:57.030> off<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:58.680> there's<00:00:58.980> an

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
blocked off now but in here there's an

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
blocked off now but in here there's an
absolute<00:00:59.899> chemical<00:01:00.899> warfare<00:01:01.289> zone<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
absolute chemical warfare zone and it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
absolute chemical warfare zone and it's
it's<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.650> salts<00:01:05.010> coming<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.640> stuff

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it's just salts coming out of this stuff

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.240 
it's just salts coming out of this stuff
you<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.810> my<00:01:07.080> hands<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.950> dry

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you know my hands are going to be so dry

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.280 
you know my hands are going to be so dry
driving<00:01:08.820> home<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:10.080> eat

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
driving home now this is just about eat

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.609 
driving home now this is just about eat
your<00:01:10.530> hands<00:01:10.770> away<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.130> horrible

your hands away it's horrible
so<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:14.880> good

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so you know this is a very good

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.200 
so you know this is a very good
illustration<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.700> sorts<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> issues

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
illustration of the the sorts of issues

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.100 
illustration of the the sorts of issues
that<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:19.170> face<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:21.030> why<00:01:21.240> wally<00:01:21.600> builder

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that we face and it's why wally builder

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
that we face and it's why wally builder
gets<00:01:22.350> away<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> wally<00:01:24.030> dump

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
gets away with so much and wally dump

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
gets away with so much and wally dump
man<00:01:24.600> gets<00:01:24.930> away<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.200> even<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
man gets away with even more because of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.429 
man gets away with even more because of

very salty and horrible and grotty it's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
very salty and horrible and grotty it's
this<00:02:05.880> chemical<00:02:06.299> soup<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:06.869> dealing

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
this chemical soup that we're dealing

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.779 
this chemical soup that we're dealing
with<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:08.220> know<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> whole<00:02:08.489> place
