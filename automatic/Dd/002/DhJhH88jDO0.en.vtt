00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.689 
let's take a look at what he did panama
has<00:00:57.270> two<00:00:57.629> seasons<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.500> good<00:00:58.680> season<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
has two seasons the good season and the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150 
has two seasons the good season and the
rainy<00:00:59.940> season<00:01:00.420> guess<00:01:01.020> which<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
rainy season guess which one this is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.670 
rainy season guess which one this is
it's<00:01:03.120> all<00:01:03.420> starting<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.080> sense<00:01:04.229> now

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it's all starting to make sense now

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
it's all starting to make sense now
maybe<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:06.090> why<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> flights<00:01:06.840> were<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
maybe that's why the flights were so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.740 
maybe that's why the flights were so
cheap<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.400> hotels<00:01:08.880> are<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.299> cheap<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
cheap and the hotels are so cheap and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.140 
cheap and the hotels are so cheap and
the<00:01:10.409> rental<00:01:10.710> car<00:01:10.920> smelled<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> flooded

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

the rental car smelled like a flooded
pet<00:01:12.450> store<00:01:12.810> maybe<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:13.890> why<00:01:14.070> Dan<00:01:14.400> Neal

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
