fun<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.750> only<00:01:18.869> when<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.229> push<00:01:19.440> on<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> gas

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
fun it's only when you push on the gas

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.450

about<00:01:20.220> 5%<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.680> mean<00:01:22.680> take<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> over

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460

about 5% or more I mean take it over
techtronic<00:01:25.700> third<00:01:26.700> gear<00:01:27.090> fourth<00:01:28.050> gear<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.640> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
techtronic third gear fourth gear and I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.100 
techtronic third gear fourth gear and I
can't<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.450> into<00:01:30.539> fifth<00:01:30.720> gear<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.080> now

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
can't go into fifth gear right now

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.310 
can't go into fifth gear right now
because<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> ESP<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:33.979> second<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
because of the ESP but down second and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
because of the ESP but down second and
then<00:01:37.320> even<00:01:37.710> coming<00:01:38.160> up<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:41.240> everything

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
then even coming up to first everything

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.969 
then even coming up to first everything
shifts<00:01:42.840> fine<00:01:43.080> it's<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.450> there

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
shifts fine it's just that right there

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.120 
shifts fine it's just that right there
barely<00:01:49.979> even<00:01:50.039> pushing<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.399 

that's<00:01:56.730> what<00:01:56.909> I'm<00:01:57.030> getting

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.719 

so<00:02:01.070> let<00:02:01.549> me<00:02:01.640> know<00:02:01.759> what<00:02:01.880> y'all<00:02:02.030> think<00:02:02.270> thanks
