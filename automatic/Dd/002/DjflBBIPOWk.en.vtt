zombies<00:02:43.940> are<00:02:44.030> too<00:02:44.180> stupid<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.570> go<00:02:44.690> around<00:02:44.930> and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
zombies are too stupid to go around and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.410 
zombies are too stupid to go around and
then<00:02:46.430> they'd<00:02:46.700> have<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.940> break<00:02:47.090> through<00:02:47.269> this

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
then they'd have to break through this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.780 
then they'd have to break through this
one<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:50.450> one<00:02:50.510> which<00:02:51.320> these<00:02:52.160> stools<00:02:52.519> are

very<00:02:53.060> powerful<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.780> doubt<00:02:54.200> azam<00:02:54.470> be<00:02:54.620> could

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
very powerful I doubt azam be could

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.670 
very powerful I doubt azam be could
break<00:02:54.920> through<00:02:55.070> one<00:02:55.340> within<00:02:55.760> oh<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.299> don't<00:02:56.540> know

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
break through one within oh I don't know

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.160

50<00:02:57.680> minutes

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.070 

and<00:03:00.380> then<00:03:01.160> even<00:03:01.580> if<00:03:01.849> they<00:03:01.970> get<00:03:02.120> up<00:03:02.240> here<00:03:02.660> they'd

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
and then even if they get up here they'd

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.470 
and then even if they get up here they'd
have<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.290> go<00:03:03.440> around<00:03:03.560> or<00:03:04.069> through<00:03:04.280> here<00:03:04.610> so

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480
