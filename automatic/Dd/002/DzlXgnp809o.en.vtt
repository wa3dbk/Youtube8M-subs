so I'm going to open up my minecraft

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.770 
so I'm going to open up my minecraft
server<00:01:30.840> folder<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.030> here<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> everything

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
server folder and here is everything

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.690 
server folder and here is everything
that<00:01:34.079> runs<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> server<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.159> right<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that runs the server and right here you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
that runs the server and right here you
can<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:35.850> world<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> world<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
can see world that's the world that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.670 
can see world that's the world that
actually<00:01:38.369> loads<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> server<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
actually loads on the server so you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.990 
actually loads on the server so you
either<00:01:41.159> get<00:01:41.640> rid<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.119> by<00:01:42.899> deleting<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:44.000> or

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
either get rid of that by deleting it or

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.170 
either get rid of that by deleting it or
just<00:01:45.720> move<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.170> desktop<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.740> save<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
just move it to your desktop to save it

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.670 
just move it to your desktop to save it
but<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> pretty<00:01:48.540> much<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.380> rid<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
but you pretty much you get rid of that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.310 
but you pretty much you get rid of that
then<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.310> move<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.509> new<00:01:51.689> map<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> got

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
then you move the new map that you got

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.920 
then you move the new map that you got
into<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.159> folder<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.479> rename<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.310> world

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
into the folder if you rename it world

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.410 
into the folder if you rename it world
