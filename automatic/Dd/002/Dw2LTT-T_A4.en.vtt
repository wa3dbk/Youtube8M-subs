00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
sit down play for about 15 minutes and

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.940 
sit down play for about 15 minutes and
then<00:03:17.629> get<00:03:17.900> interviewed<00:03:18.379> about<00:03:18.470> our<00:03:18.709> thoughts

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
then get interviewed about our thoughts

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.350 
then get interviewed about our thoughts
of<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.190> game<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.640> if<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.849> actually<00:03:20.030> want<00:03:20.330> to

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
of the game so if you actually want to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.170 
of the game so if you actually want to
check<00:03:20.569> out<00:03:20.690> Gold<00:03:21.590> Glove<00:03:21.860> he<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.340> probably<00:03:22.730> on

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
check out Gold Glove he is probably on

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.360 
check out Gold Glove he is probably on
the<00:03:23.390> far<00:03:23.599> cry<00:03:23.780> 3<00:03:23.810> page<00:03:24.319> by<00:03:24.560> now<00:03:24.680> what<00:03:25.190> you're

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
the far cry 3 page by now what you're

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.030 
the far cry 3 page by now what you're
actually<00:03:25.519> seeing<00:03:25.970> however<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.470> game<00:03:27.769> type

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
actually seeing however is the game type

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.580 
actually seeing however is the game type
domination<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.090> now<00:03:29.659> I<00:03:29.690> thought<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.440> I'd

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
domination and now I thought that I'd

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.080 
domination and now I thought that I'd
break<00:03:30.769> it<00:03:30.950> down<00:03:31.099> for<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.430> in<00:03:31.579> terms<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.940> how<00:03:32.060> it

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
break it down for you in terms of how it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.539 
break it down for you in terms of how it
feels<00:03:32.450> how<00:03:32.599> plays<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.260> weapons<00:03:33.680> as<00:03:33.829> well<00:03:34.370> as

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
feels how plays the weapons as well as

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.210 
feels how plays the weapons as well as
the<00:03:35.390> game<00:03:35.599> type<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.140> what<00:03:36.530> we<00:03:36.650> were<00:03:36.799> told<00:03:37.010> us

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
the game type so what we were told us

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.979 
the game type so what we were told us
that<00:03:37.370> domination<00:03:38.060> was<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.359> quicker<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.780> the

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
that domination was the quicker of the

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.630 
that domination was the quicker of the
game<00:03:39.200> types<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:40.069> is<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.310> reason<00:03:40.370> they

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
game types and that is the reason they

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.020 
game types and that is the reason they
chose<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:42.379> plays<00:03:42.620> exactly<00:03:42.799> like<00:03:43.670> Call

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
chose it and it plays exactly like Call

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.509 
chose it and it plays exactly like Call

this flag it caps it very slowly in to

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.599 
faster caps reflagged points the only
difference<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.959> win<00:03:54.260> by<00:03:54.829> holding

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
difference is that you win by holding

the flag points for more time than the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.690 
the flag points for more time than the
the<00:03:59.390> other<00:03:59.480> team<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.739> it's<00:04:00.890> not<00:04:01.099> based<00:04:01.430> on

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
the other team and and it's not based on

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.520 
the other team and and it's not based on
points<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.299> up<00:04:02.480> at<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.780> top<00:04:02.959> you<00:04:03.200> can<00:04:03.319> see<00:04:03.379> this

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
points so up at the top you can see this

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.160 
points so up at the top you can see this
little<00:04:03.769> bar<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.329> hold<00:04:05.480> three<00:04:05.780> flags

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
little bar and if you hold three flags

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.349 
little bar and if you hold three flags
the<00:04:06.560> bar<00:04:06.829> will<00:04:07.069> increase<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.549> your<00:04:08.000> side

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
the bar will increase to your side

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.170 
the bar will increase to your side
faster<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.409> hold<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.889> it<00:04:10.190> will<00:04:10.489> increase<00:04:10.760> fast

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
faster you hold to it will increase fast

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.599 
faster you hold to it will increase fast
but<00:04:11.569> not<00:04:11.720> as<00:04:11.780> fast<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.470> if<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.829> holds<00:04:12.980> one<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
but not as fast and if it holds one the

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.849 
but not as fast and if it holds one the
other<00:04:13.819> team<00:04:14.180> will<00:04:14.329> start<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.750> win<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.530> see

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
other team will start to win so you see

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.339 
other team will start to win so you see
how<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.190> it's<00:04:16.639> basically<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:17.570> same<00:04:17.810> idea

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
how it is it's basically the same idea

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.870 
how it is it's basically the same idea
but<00:04:18.440> without<00:04:18.769> points<00:04:19.220> now<00:04:19.340> how<00:04:19.459> does<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.729> play

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
but without points now how does it play

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.140 
but without points now how does it play
it<00:04:20.450> plays<00:04:20.959> clunky<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.859> says<00:04:22.190> pre-alpha<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.000> it

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
it plays clunky it says pre-alpha and it

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.060 
it plays clunky it says pre-alpha and it
is<00:04:23.270> pre<00:04:23.479> alpha<00:04:23.630> but<00:04:24.169> damn<00:04:24.440> this<00:04:24.650> game<00:04:24.860> better

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
is pre alpha but damn this game better

lot like Battlefield it's got its own

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.100 
lot like Battlefield it's got its own

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
well and as far as I can tell the team

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.670 
well and as far as I can tell the team
perks<00:04:50.419> which<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:50.810> activate<00:04:51.199> by<00:04:51.320> pressing

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
perks which you activate by pressing

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.260 
perks which you activate by pressing
both<00:04:51.860> left<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.340> right<00:04:52.460> triggers<00:04:53.000> are

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
both left and right triggers are

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.719
