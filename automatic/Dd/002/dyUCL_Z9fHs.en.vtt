Lotus that of the Alpha Black Lotus that
I<00:00:14.490> opened<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.139> he<00:00:16.139> wanted<00:00:16.350> me<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.470> go<00:00:16.680> over<00:00:16.949> it

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
I opened and he wanted me to go over it

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.220 
I opened and he wanted me to go over it
what<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> stuff<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
what I can see that kind of stuff so I

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.450 
what I can see that kind of stuff so I
figured<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.500> was<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> good<00:00:19.859> idea<00:00:19.949> there's<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
figured that was a good idea there's a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.550 
figured that was a good idea there's a
little<00:00:20.640> echo<00:00:20.910> inherent<00:00:21.390> picked<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> best

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
little echo inherent picked the best

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.009 
little echo inherent picked the best
place<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> best<00:00:23.279> lighting<00:00:23.840> I'm<00:00:24.840> going

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
place with the best lighting I'm going

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
place with the best lighting I'm going
to<00:00:25.080> mail<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.320> off<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.880> it's

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to mail it off but as you see it's

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.380 
to mail it off but as you see it's
pretty<00:00:27.180> clean<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.699> off<00:00:29.880> center<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
pretty clean so it's it's off center of

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.630 
pretty clean so it's it's off center of
course<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.109> normal<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.529> alpha<00:00:31.859> but

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
course with this normal with alpha but

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
course with this normal with alpha but
there<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:33.000> some<00:00:33.239> defects<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.440> card

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
there are some defects with on the card

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
there are some defects with on the card
it<00:00:34.860> when<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.340> open<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.270> alpha<00:00:36.510> starter<00:00:36.780> it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it when you open an alpha starter it's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
it when you open an alpha starter it's
wrapped<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.620> plastic<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.219> let<00:00:38.309> me<00:00:38.399> take<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> off

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
wrapped in plastic so let me take it off

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
wrapped in plastic so let me take it off
but<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.960> wrapped<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.620> rears<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
you give you get these little creases in

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
try to show it without the glare you can

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.660 
try to show it without the glare you can
see<00:00:56.070> there's<00:00:56.489> some<00:00:56.640> imperfections<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:58.489> can<00:00:59.489> get

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
see there's some imperfections I can get

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
see there's some imperfections I can get
it<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:01.199> focus<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:03.019> you'd<00:01:04.019> actually<00:01:04.170> see

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it to focus you know you'd actually see

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
it to focus you know you'd actually see
some<00:01:04.769> imperfections<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.299> that's<00:01:06.420> due

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
some imperfections on it and that's due

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.560 
some imperfections on it and that's due
to<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> wrapping<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.090> itself

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
to the wrapping of it actually it itself

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.010 
to the wrapping of it actually it itself
there's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.860> fold<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:12.020> where

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
there's a little fold right there where

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.510 
there's a little fold right there where
they<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.290> crease<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> bottom<00:01:14.220> by

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
they just crease it at the bottom by

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.330 
they just crease it at the bottom by
accident<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.530> typical<00:01:17.100> with

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
accident and that's that's typical with

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.600 
accident and that's that's typical with
the<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> front<00:01:19.140> card<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.740> any<00:01:19.979> card<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.460> can

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the the front card of any card you can

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
the the front card of any card you can
tell<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> edging<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> off<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
tell that the edging is kind of off a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.179 
tell that the edging is kind of off a
little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> yeah<00:01:25.979> I'm

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
little bit because of that so yeah I'm

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
little bit because of that so yeah I'm
still<00:01:26.369> pretty<00:01:26.580> pumped<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.030> mean<00:01:27.299> regardless<00:01:28.259> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
still pretty pumped I mean regardless of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
still pretty pumped I mean regardless of
the<00:01:28.770> grade<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> still<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.729> alpha<00:01:29.850> Lotus<00:01:32.540> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the grade it is still in alpha Lotus and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
the grade it is still in alpha Lotus and
I<00:01:33.810> am<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> send<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.380> off<00:01:34.470> today<00:01:34.680> because

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
I am going to send it off today because

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.840 
I am going to send it off today because
of<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.180> mean<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.659> freaking<00:01:37.049> awesome<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.640> then

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
of I mean it's freaking awesome and then

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370 
of I mean it's freaking awesome and then
you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> bubbles

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can see that you can see the bubbles

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.330 
you can see that you can see the bubbles
there<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:41.240> believe<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.390> those<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.659> from<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
there I believe in those are from the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.240 
there I believe in those are from the
the<00:01:44.340> actual<00:01:44.579> cellophane<00:01:45.619> itself<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.130> we'll

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the actual cellophane itself but we'll

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.359 
the actual cellophane itself but we'll
see<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.640> come<00:01:47.670> back<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> grade

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
see what they come back with as a grade

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.560 
see what they come back with as a grade
it's<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.490> gonna<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> ten<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.210> there's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it's not gonna be a ten that there's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.830 
it's not gonna be a ten that there's
just<00:01:51.630> no<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:53.360> still<00:01:54.360> freaking<00:01:54.659> cool

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you can see some imperfections in the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.109 
you can see some imperfections in the
actual<00:02:01.140> card<00:02:01.380> itself<00:02:04.159> yeah<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> didn't<00:02:05.939> show<00:02:06.060> it
