really basic and you can go ahead and
add<00:00:49.200> more<00:00:49.469> designs<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.280> you'd<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.579> so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.229 
we're gonna start off we're going to
grab<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> two<00:00:53.100> central<00:00:53.489> pieces<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
kind of with 90 degree angles so we're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.099 
kind of with 90 degree angles so we're
just<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.270> bevel<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.690> edge<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> bit

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
just going to go on bevel the edge a bit

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.310 
just going to go on bevel the edge a bit
on<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> top<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> bottom<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
on the top one you can do the bottom and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.800 
on the top one you can do the bottom and
top<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.890> shoulders<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.610> more

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.649 
top if your shoulders are a bit more
rigid<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
rigid but you can just go there as you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.600 
rigid but you can just go there as you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.240 
made a little bevel which kind of puts
it<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.420> almost<00:01:15.420> 50<00:01:15.900> degree<00:01:16.200> slant<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it on a little almost 50 degree slant it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
it on a little almost 50 degree slant it
will<00:01:17.400> change<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.000> heat<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.479> do

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
will change you can heat it up and do

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.010 
will change you can heat it up and do
that<00:01:18.750> later

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that later

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.370

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.340 
cut those out of the top and bottom now
though<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.869> connector

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
though it's going to be like connector

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
though it's going to be like connector
points<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.070> part<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> standard

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

design nothing I'm adding just little
bits<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:36.240> using<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:36.689> little<00:01:36.900> cut<00:01:37.110> off

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
bits now using those little cut off

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
bits now using those little cut off
parts<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.979> cut<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.430> you're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
parts we just cut from you're going to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
parts we just cut from you're going to
go<00:01:39.270> ahead<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.659> trace<00:01:39.840> those<00:01:40.020> onto<00:01:40.290> paper<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
go ahead and trace those onto paper and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469 
go ahead and trace those onto paper and
you<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> rotate<00:01:41.250> them<00:01:41.579> around<00:01:41.759> so

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you just going to rotate them around so

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.499 
you just going to rotate them around so
you<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.850> diamond<00:01:44.850> shape

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you get like this kind of diamond shape

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
you get like this kind of diamond shape
desk<00:01:46.200> thing<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> be<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
desk thing this is going to be the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
desk thing this is going to be the
connector<00:01:48.570> between<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.170> top<00:01:49.409> part<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> your

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
connector between the top part of your

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.560 
connector between the top part of your
shoulder<00:01:50.369> plate<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> bottom<00:01:50.970> part<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
shoulder plate and the bottom part you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
shoulder plate and the bottom part you
can<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> styrofoam<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> want

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can do this out of styrofoam if you want

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
can do this out of styrofoam if you want
but<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.780> teaching<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:55.140> how<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.470> on

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
but I'm here teaching me how to do it on

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.080 
but I'm here teaching me how to do it on
a<00:01:55.590> TV<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.860> foam<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.280> won't<00:01:56.430> look<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.729> good<00:01:56.880> but

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
a TV a foam they won't look as good but

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.600 
a TV a foam they won't look as good but
it'll<00:01:57.479> serve<00:01:57.810> its<00:01:57.990> purpose<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> can

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
it'll serve its purpose so as you can

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.370 
it'll serve its purpose so as you can
see<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.420> you've<00:02:00.689> married<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.140> sides

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
see because you've married the sides

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.340 
see because you've married the sides
they<00:02:01.619> should<00:02:01.860> fit<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.460> pretty<00:02:02.729> easily<00:02:02.790> now

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
they should fit in pretty easily now

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.480 
they should fit in pretty easily now
like<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.439> said<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:04.770> easy<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.369> we're

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
like I said it was easy so all we're

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
like I said it was easy so all we're
gonna<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.909> start<00:02:06.570> gluing<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> together<00:02:07.469> now

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
gonna do is start gluing it together now

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.260 
gonna do is start gluing it together now
this<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.459> gonna<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.759> stage<00:02:09.000> where<00:02:09.209> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
this is just gonna be a stage where you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.999 
this is just gonna be a stage where you
just<00:02:09.450> want<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.619> glue

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
just want to really get that glue

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.340 
just want to really get that glue
bonding<00:02:11.790> nicely

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
bonding nicely

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.730 
bonding nicely
you<00:02:12.620> don't<00:02:12.800> want<00:02:12.920> any<00:02:13.390> yucky<00:02:14.390> pots<00:02:15.080> sticking

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
you don't want any yucky pots sticking

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.650 
you don't want any yucky pots sticking
out<00:02:15.890> because<00:02:16.130> otherwise<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.270> gonna<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.600> a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
out because otherwise this is gonna be a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.200 
out because otherwise this is gonna be a
focal<00:02:18.020> point<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.440> your<00:02:18.650> costume<00:02:19.040> from<00:02:19.760> every

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
focal point on your costume from every

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.790 
focal point on your costume from every
single<00:02:20.390> angle<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.050> camera<00:02:21.080> will<00:02:21.500> see<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
single angle the camera will see the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.260 
single angle the camera will see the
shoulders<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.700> want<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:22.910> make<00:02:23.000> sure<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
shoulders so you want to make sure the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.180 
shoulders so you want to make sure the
gluing<00:02:23.600> process<00:02:23.630> goes<00:02:24.230> quite<00:02:24.530> smoothly<00:02:24.860> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
gluing process goes quite smoothly and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.520 
gluing process goes quite smoothly and
everything<00:02:25.820> fits<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.210> nicely<00:02:26.450> as<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.350> see

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
everything fits in nicely as you can see

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.340 
everything fits in nicely as you can see
there<00:02:27.820> that's<00:02:28.820> somewhat<00:02:29.300> alright<00:02:29.660> I'm<00:02:30.110> kind

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
there that's somewhat alright I'm kind

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.900 
there that's somewhat alright I'm kind
of<00:02:30.380> speeding<00:02:30.650> through<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.640> doesn't

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
of speeding through this so it doesn't

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.550 
of speeding through this so it doesn't
really<00:02:32.030> take<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.750> too<00:02:32.870> much<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.050> your<00:02:33.170> time<00:02:33.230> but

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
really take up too much of your time but

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.460 
really take up too much of your time but
that<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:34.120> good<00:02:35.120> enough<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.630> don't<00:02:36.080> look<00:02:36.230> fine

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
that is good enough I don't look fine

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.500 
that is good enough I don't look fine
once<00:02:36.680> we<00:02:36.740> paint<00:02:36.950> up<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:37.850> this<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.210> little

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
once we paint up now this is a little

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.330 
once we paint up now this is a little
design<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.290> don't<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.830> do<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.220> I'm

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
design that you don't have to do but I'm

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.130 
design that you don't have to do but I'm
doing<00:02:40.670> just<00:02:40.820> because<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.150> gives<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.630> bit

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
doing just because it gives it a bit

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.220 
doing just because it gives it a bit
more<00:02:42.290> 3d<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.190> depth<00:02:43.610> between<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.990> flat

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
more 3d and depth between just the flat

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.580 
more 3d and depth between just the flat
surfaces<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.480> pauldron<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.410> cut

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
surfaces of the pauldron so I just cut

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.140 
surfaces of the pauldron so I just cut
out<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.740> little<00:02:48.980> diagonal<00:02:49.340> shape<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.970> we're

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
out a little diagonal shape and we're

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150 
out a little diagonal shape and we're
just<00:02:50.210> gonna<00:02:50.330> raise<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.990> tiny<00:02:51.230> bit<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:51.860> you're

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
just gonna raise it a tiny bit so you're

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.140 
just gonna raise it a tiny bit so you're
cutting<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.490> out<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.670> then<00:02:52.760> gluing<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.120> back

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
cutting it out and then gluing it back

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.910 
cutting it out and then gluing it back
pretty<00:02:53.450> much<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.110> with<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> little<00:02:54.680> lip

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
pretty much but just with a little lip

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.090 
pretty much but just with a little lip
just<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.550> gives<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.820> bit<00:02:55.910> more<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
just so it gives it a bit more of a a

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.680 
just so it gives it a bit more of a a
terraced<00:02:58.100> effect<00:02:58.460> and<00:02:58.670> depth<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.210> field<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.630> a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
terraced effect and depth of field and a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.260 
terraced effect and depth of field and a
bit<00:02:59.810> more<00:02:59.960> detail<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:01.280> can<00:03:01.400> do<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.820> how<00:03:02.090> many

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
bit more detail you can do that how many

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.510 
bit more detail you can do that how many
times<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.660> want<00:03:02.980> now<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> next<00:03:04.250> part<00:03:04.370> we're

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
times you want now the next part we're

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.640 
times you want now the next part we're
gonna<00:03:04.610> do<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.240> bottom<00:03:06.170> part<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.620> just

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
gonna do is the bottom part that just

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.970 
gonna do is the bottom part that just
overhangs<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.580> triceps<00:03:08.240> now<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.560> is<00:03:09.710> a<00:03:09.740> bit

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
overhangs the triceps now this is a bit

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.040 
overhangs the triceps now this is a bit
different<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.150> you're<00:03:11.330> gonna<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.750> just

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
different and you're gonna have to just

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.760 
different and you're gonna have to just
make<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.680> work<00:03:13.480> between<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:14.720> you've<00:03:14.870> done<00:03:15.170> so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
make it work between what you've done so

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.020 
make it work between what you've done so
you're<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:16.010> following<00:03:16.130> what<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.580> literally

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
you're just following what I literally

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.520 
you're just following what I literally
did<00:03:17.270> there<00:03:17.450> draw<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.810> up<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:17.990> the<00:03:18.080> templates

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
did there draw it up on the templates

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.110 
did there draw it up on the templates
transfer<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.100> across<00:03:19.280> onto<00:03:19.580> your<00:03:19.700> foam<00:03:19.880> and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
transfer it across onto your foam and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.730 
transfer it across onto your foam and
then<00:03:20.630> you're<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:20.900> going<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.110> cut<00:03:21.350> out<00:03:21.380> and

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
then you're just going to cut out and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.070 
then you're just going to cut out and
bevel<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.250> edges<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:22.850> glue<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.300> together<00:03:23.420> now

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
bevel the edges and glue it together now

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.760 
bevel the edges and glue it together now
this<00:03:24.260> should<00:03:24.590> just<00:03:25.580> slot<00:03:26.000> straight<00:03:26.480> in<00:03:26.770> as

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
this should just slot straight in as

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.500 
this should just slot straight in as
long<00:03:28.010> as<00:03:28.130> your<00:03:28.250> sizes<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.000> your<00:03:29.090> measurements

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
long as your sizes and your measurements

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.970 
long as your sizes and your measurements
were<00:03:29.600> right<00:03:29.810> following<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.320> templates<00:03:30.770> but

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
were right following the templates but

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.500 
were right following the templates but
yeah<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.460> should<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:31.730> slot<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:32.300> that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
yeah it should just slot in like that

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.410 
yeah it should just slot in like that
and<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.380> can<00:03:33.560> glue<00:03:33.710> it<00:03:33.830> in<00:03:33.920> straight<00:03:34.370> away<00:03:34.420> now

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
and you can glue it in straight away now

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.300 
and you can glue it in straight away now
of<00:03:35.690> course<00:03:35.870> this<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.230> looking<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.560> bit<00:03:36.740> plain<00:03:37.010> a

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
of course this is looking a bit plain a

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.510 
of course this is looking a bit plain a
bit<00:03:37.600> simple<00:03:38.600> not<00:03:38.870> much<00:03:39.020> detail<00:03:39.250> like<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.340> said

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
bit simple not much detail like I said

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.070 
bit simple not much detail like I said
this<00:03:40.730> is<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.880> drop<00:03:41.300> one<00:03:41.480> on<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.720> draft<00:03:41.930> but

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
this is the drop one on the draft but

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.190 
this is the drop one on the draft but
the<00:03:42.170> very<00:03:42.530> basic<00:03:43.450> shoulder<00:03:44.450> which<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:44.960> can<00:03:45.110> go

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
the very basic shoulder which you can go

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.230 
the very basic shoulder which you can go
ahead<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.440> add<00:03:45.650> more<00:03:45.890> layers<00:03:46.490> and<00:03:46.820> depth<00:03:47.030> on

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
ahead and add more layers and depth on

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.240 
ahead and add more layers and depth on
but<00:03:47.480> once<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.750> know<00:03:47.870> how<00:03:48.020> to<00:03:48.080> do<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.470> you

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
but once you know how to do this you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.660 
but once you know how to do this you
should<00:03:49.280> be<00:03:49.700> able<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> do<00:03:50.270> your<00:03:50.630> own<00:03:50.780> design

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
should be able to do your own design

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.740 
should be able to do your own design
pretty<00:03:52.670> easily<00:03:52.850> you're<00:03:53.270> just<00:03:53.390> applying<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
pretty easily you're just applying the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.380 
pretty easily you're just applying the
same<00:03:53.930> principle<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.280> with<00:03:55.490> that<00:03:55.580> big<00:03:55.820> diamond

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
same principle so with that big diamond

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.760 
same principle so with that big diamond
D<00:03:56.450> shape<00:03:56.690> thing<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.080> just<00:03:57.230> want<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.410> trim<00:03:57.620> it

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
D shape thing you just want to trim it

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.990 
D shape thing you just want to trim it
up<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:58.040> course<00:03:58.250> it's<00:03:58.370> probably<00:03:58.610> not<00:03:58.670> gonna<00:03:58.790> fit

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
up of course it's probably not gonna fit

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.400 
up of course it's probably not gonna fit
exactly<00:03:59.150> anymore<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.020> you<00:04:00.110> just<00:04:00.200> go<00:04:00.320> ahead

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
exactly anymore but you just go ahead

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.320 
exactly anymore but you just go ahead
and<00:04:00.590> trim<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:00.920> up<00:04:01.040> now<00:04:01.430> we're<00:04:01.580> gonna<00:04:01.670> give<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.210> a

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
and trim it up now we're gonna give it a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.570 
and trim it up now we're gonna give it a
beveled<00:04:02.870> edge<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.190> kind<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.340> give<00:04:04.460> it<00:04:04.550> a

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
beveled edge just to kind of give it a

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.040 
beveled edge just to kind of give it a
bit<00:04:04.730> more<00:04:04.820> 3d<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:05.420> it's<00:04:05.570> not<00:04:05.660> this<00:04:05.780> big

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
bit more 3d so it's not this big

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.080 
bit more 3d so it's not this big
rectangle<00:04:06.620> square<00:04:06.800> block<00:04:07.250> with<00:04:07.430> 90-degree

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
rectangle square block with 90-degree

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.840 
rectangle square block with 90-degree
angles<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.950> this<00:04:10.070> just<00:04:10.310> allows<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.670> give

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
angles and this just allows it to give

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.320 
angles and this just allows it to give
it<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:10.970> bit<00:04:11.090> more<00:04:11.320> feel<00:04:12.320> more<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:13.030> 3d<00:04:14.030> design

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
it a bit more feel more of a 3d design

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.810 
it a bit more feel more of a 3d design
so<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.140> speak<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.680> did<00:04:16.070> mine<00:04:16.280> originally<00:04:16.670> out<00:04:16.760> of

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
so to speak I did mine originally out of

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.270 
so to speak I did mine originally out of
styrofoam<00:04:17.060> because<00:04:17.450> I<00:04:17.660> got<00:04:17.900> better<00:04:18.280> ability

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
styrofoam because I got better ability

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.099 
styrofoam because I got better ability
to<00:04:19.520> carve<00:04:19.910> because<00:04:20.239> foam<00:04:20.570> is<00:04:20.750> quite<00:04:20.930> difficult

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
to carve because foam is quite difficult

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.480 
to carve because foam is quite difficult
to<00:04:21.350> do<00:04:21.500> these<00:04:21.650> angles<00:04:21.979> but<00:04:22.130> make<00:04:22.250> sure<00:04:22.280> you

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
to do these angles but make sure you

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.010 
to do these angles but make sure you
give<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.640> a<00:04:22.760> good<00:04:22.880> sand<00:04:23.210> right<00:04:23.570> now<00:04:23.690> I'm<00:04:23.840> just

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
give it a good sand right now I'm just

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.650 
give it a good sand right now I'm just
put<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.199> in<00:04:24.289> raw<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:24.979> you<00:04:25.069> can<00:04:25.190> see<00:04:25.340> it's<00:04:25.460> quite

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
put it in raw so you can see it's quite

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.360 
put it in raw so you can see it's quite
iffy<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:26.900> go<00:04:27.199> ahead<00:04:27.319> with<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> nice<00:04:27.800> fine<00:04:28.069> grade

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
iffy but go ahead with a nice fine grade

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.029 
iffy but go ahead with a nice fine grade
sandpaper<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.180> should<00:04:29.300> look<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.569> lot<00:04:29.720> nicer

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
sandpaper and it should look a lot nicer

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.520 
sandpaper and it should look a lot nicer
so<00:04:31.039> that<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.460> pretty<00:04:31.580> much<00:04:31.789> the<00:04:31.970> basic<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
so that is pretty much the basic the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.969 
so that is pretty much the basic the
basic<00:04:34.009> gist<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.669> what<00:04:34.940> this<00:04:35.740> pauldron<00:04:36.740> thingy

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
basic gist of what this pauldron thingy

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.770 
basic gist of what this pauldron thingy
is<00:04:37.190> as<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.729> can<00:04:37.849> see<00:04:37.970> my<00:04:38.150> one<00:04:38.419> on<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.599> right

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
is as you can see my one on the right

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.210 
is as you can see my one on the right
has<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> lot<00:04:39.259> more<00:04:39.289> depth<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.830> feel<00:04:39.949> but<00:04:40.099> you

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
has a lot more depth and feel but you

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.129 
has a lot more depth and feel but you
can<00:04:40.370> go<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.639> add<00:04:40.759> that<00:04:40.879> yourself<00:04:41.330> otherwise

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
can go and add that yourself otherwise

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.230 
can go and add that yourself otherwise
