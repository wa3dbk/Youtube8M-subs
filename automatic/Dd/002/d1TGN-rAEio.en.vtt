00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.319 
that way we can get one tower in one
lane<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.820> start<00:01:02.850> rotating

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
lane and then they can start rotating

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.579 
lane and then they can start rotating
throughout<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> map<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.409> start

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
throughout the map and then we can start

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380 
throughout the map and then we can start
grouping<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.549> Pope<00:01:05.760> comp<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.150> zigs

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
grouping with our Pope comp with zigs

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
grouping with our Pope comp with zigs

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
jungle where we walk together to get

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.499 
jungle where we walk together to get
vision<00:01:32.369> control<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> scary

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509

control<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.729> usually<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.240> lose<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> 220<00:01:39.960> lens

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
control and usually we lose the 220 lens

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
control and usually we lose the 220 lens
or<00:01:40.350> something<00:01:40.650> random<00:01:40.920> happens<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.880> die

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
