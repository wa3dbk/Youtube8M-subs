00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
edge and so with that what you can do is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.550

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
you can go from there or easier if you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.520 
you can go from there or easier if you
do<00:02:26.180> have<00:02:26.360> another<00:02:26.540> sewing<00:02:26.870> machine<00:02:27.260> at<00:02:27.380> this
