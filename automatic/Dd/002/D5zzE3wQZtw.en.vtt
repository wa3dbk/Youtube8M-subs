00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:30.140
 tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:32.769
 the same after this tidy 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.510
 almost ladies model gf3 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.610
 panasonic suddenly shot like that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.650
 here is a specific brutal boy 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.559
 the apparatus looking at him 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.120
 remember not only the gf1 mirrorless 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.020
 and the legendary and lichku 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.020
 ivan kay 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.600
 This panasonic gf1 and me he very 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.880
 like matrices to four third 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.130
 now has supposedly a density of 16 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.990
 megapixels but top and cell 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.050
 reached the sensitivity of the device 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.630
 night vision 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.790
 12800 iso it is clear that with the same area 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.000
 sensor in super breakthrough as not 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.250
 foreseen but as practice has shown 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.650
 g f2 and f3 dynamic range 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 ergonomics may vary 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:39.740
 Excellent organization just shooting 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.390
 classic mechanical units work 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.080
 clear to good door lock 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.930
 everywhere there fell a real metal and a layer 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.780
 a lot of species except on battery 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.320
 compartment on the plugs for hot shoe 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.960
 and on the lenses by the way right here have 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.210
 hot shoe there is a perforation for 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.710
 sound is the left right channel recording 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.509
 sound that is the channel here is two 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.300
 there is a built-in flash she 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.209
 thrown out like this and maybe 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.290
 few brands are directed to the ceiling 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.340
 this makes the display display 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.019
 three-inch he certainly sensory 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.850
 there is no optical viewfinder but you can 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.989
 stick an electronic model called 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.060
 lv f 2 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.230
 on the same test x1 came to us two 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:36.230
 Lens this miniature baby 1442 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.300
 and telephoto telephoto we have 45 175 both have 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.330
 built-in stabilizer and as you know 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.890
 panasonic unlike olympus 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.830
 inside the camera the stabilization system is not 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.209
 puts fundamentally 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.560
 definitely overdone with management 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.799
 1442 zoom 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.510
 there are two swing keys one 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.970
 of them are responsible for the actual zoom 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.160
 other for focus in manual mode 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.470
 manual mode but drive in 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.519
 using is not at all convenient of course 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.250
 via touch screen 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.770
 but as a matter of fact, they didn’t realize 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.090
 especially it's tough while shooting in 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.560
 it despite the fact that on the teaser too 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.560
 have this key 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.420
 it can be zoomed 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.970
 habitually by hand which is much more convenient 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.040
 Actually there are no more problems in 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.860
 economics i didn't discover everything else 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.760
 extremely comfortable but the most chic and this 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.030
 horizon level in two axes on display 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:40.160
 it's like a gyro pilots very comfortable 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.470
 I liked super easy and now 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.720
 The weather is not sunny 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.700
 snow had to take pictures in 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.440
 indoors but it was for the best 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.900
 check the behavior of the matrix at high 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.310
 iso minimum shooting values ​​were on 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.380
 iso 400 with it and start so here's the frame 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.170
 where it can be seen that not wide angle 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.650
 did without a light barrel 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.480
 distortion here you can see that with dynamic 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.150
 the range is all right even on and by yourself 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.780
 700 and the light falls quite smoothly without 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.270
 failures if you're so fourth frame 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.280
 There is no soap here but for panasonic 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.170
 Clear could be and higher 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.020
 still this zoom is not a record holder 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.480
 the sharpness of the line panasonic 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.460
 stick on and put iso 1600 but 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.280
 here the flight is normal dirt no snapshots 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.940
 quite adequate but if you shoot on 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.880
 the long end is 175 millimeters this is 350 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.300
 millimeters of the usual tape 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.730
 a shutter speed of 180 is already smas 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.650
 and no stabilizer here helps out 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.370
 but it looks like this 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.600
 iso 1600 and if you insolent and spin 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.490
 iso 12800 it turns out so easy 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.140
 purple toning like sometimes likes 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.200
 do fashion photo 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.600
 finally reducing speed to iso 3200 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.390
 and it is clear that for such a matrix to work in 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.710
 This mode is not too easy, but from 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.080
 from 1250 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.610
 looks absolutely safe and 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.049
 optimal for indoor shooting 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.819
 now as for the video camera 

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:14.719
 of course removes full format clothes 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.229
 avi herring 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:21.249
 this 30 frames a second 1080 p or 60 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.749
 1080 second shots and shoots well 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:26.869
 however zoom due to the above 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:28.669
 keys on new lenses can 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:29.059
 add undesirable time to shooting 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.399
 jerks 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:33.709
 keep that in mind but of course the record 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:35.599
 started by pressing one button here 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:38.679
 here on the butt like on all cameras 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:41.839
 panasonic without mirror type 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:44.569
 sum up and so the pros are great 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:47.209
 chic performance and ergonomics and 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.899
 just crazy look good 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.269
 range 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:53.509
 dynamically and the ability to high of about 

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:55.849
 the matrix, it found cons not 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.989
 record clarity and not comfortable keys 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.599
 lens zoom 

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:01.729
 but in general it is excellently performed 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:04.159
 the camera has collected the best features 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.159
 predecessors and looking not afraid 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:09.519
 this word and tapered waiting for updates 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.519
 firmware
