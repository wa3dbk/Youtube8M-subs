seconds and 5/10 of a second and then at
this<00:00:24.180> run<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.849> could<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.210> watch<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
this run I you could just watch the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
this run I you could just watch the
video<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> you'll<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.039> end<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
video and you'll see at the end that the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
video and you'll see at the end that the
actual<00:00:29.880> in-game<00:00:30.119> clock<00:00:30.750> broke<00:00:31.019> which<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
actual in-game clock broke which is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.920 
actual in-game clock broke which is
accurate<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> way<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.880> every<00:00:33.480> tenth<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
accurate all the way to every tenth of a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.729 
accurate all the way to every tenth of a
second<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:35.390> man<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.200> broke<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.620> you'll

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
second and man so it broke what you'll

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.959 
second and man so it broke what you'll
see<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> end<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.579> didn't<00:00:38.820> work

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
see at the end of it that it didn't work

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.240 
see at the end of it that it didn't work
and<00:00:39.239> then<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.930> had<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.649> throw<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> Sony

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and then I had to throw on the Sony

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.549 
and then I had to throw on the Sony
Vegas<00:00:41.399> time<00:00:41.700> code<00:00:41.940> which<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> accurate<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
Vegas time code which is accurate to a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
Vegas time code which is accurate to a
thousandth<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> second<00:00:44.879> anyways<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.480> that's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
thousandth of a second anyways so that's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.209 
thousandth of a second anyways so that's
my<00:00:45.870> screw-up<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.500> would<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.800> broken<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
my screw-up I would have broken the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.619 
my screw-up I would have broken the
record<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.670> didn't<00:00:47.910> screw<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.270> there

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
record if I didn't screw that up there

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
record if I didn't screw that up there
on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> fourth<00:00:49.500> jump<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.460> had<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.760> made<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
on the fourth jump if I had just made it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
on the fourth jump if I had just made it
across<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.930> boost<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.500> would<00:00:52.710> have

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
across with one boost I would have

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.170 
across with one boost I would have
probably<00:00:53.070> done<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> minute<00:00:53.969> 15

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
probably done this in a minute 15

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.590 
probably done this in a minute 15
minutes<00:00:54.840> 16<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.890> would<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.190> been<00:00:56.370> G<00:00:56.670> G<00:00:57.149> no

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
minutes 16 which would have been G G no

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
minutes 16 which would have been G G no
one<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:57.960> broke<00:00:58.140> dat<00:00:58.410> record<00:00:58.710> but

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
one would have broke dat record but

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
one would have broke dat record but
anyways<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.969> made<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> time<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.379> by

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
anyways I made up the time here by

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.529 
anyways I made up the time here by
feasting<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> last<00:01:02.789> jump<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.359> way

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
feasting on the last jump all the way

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.939 
feasting on the last jump all the way
across<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:04.049> even<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.379> best

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
across not even my best

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.580 
across not even my best
I<00:01:05.040> guess<00:01:05.309> launched<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.850> last<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
I guess launched on the last one but it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.140 
I guess launched on the last one but it
was<00:01:07.770> enough<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> recover<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> time<00:01:08.850> because

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
was enough to recover the time because

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.940 
was enough to recover the time because
on<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.360> third<00:01:09.630> jump<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.590> really

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
on that third jump which that was really

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.020 
on that third jump which that was really
really<00:01:11.100> well<00:01:11.280> done<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> third<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.000> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
really well done on the third one I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.609 
really well done on the third one I
don't<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.479> saw<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.750> where<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.049> moved

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
don't know if you saw it where I moved

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
don't know if you saw it where I moved
it<00:01:13.799> off<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> leaves<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.700> II<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.060> I'm

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it off the leaves then II was here I'm

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.609 
it off the leaves then II was here I'm
coming<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> end<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> my<00:01:16.350> ramblings

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
coming to the end of it my ramblings

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.649 
coming to the end of it my ramblings
about<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> end<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> video<00:01:17.850> I'm

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
about to end as well with the video I'm

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.120 
about to end as well with the video I'm
not<00:01:18.720> sure<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.170> saw<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> Sony<00:01:19.619> Vegas<00:01:19.799> time

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
not sure if you saw the Sony Vegas time

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.859 
not sure if you saw the Sony Vegas time
code<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.700> seventy<00:01:21.090> seven<00:01:21.390> point<00:01:21.570> six

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
code that was seventy seven point six

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.749 
code that was seventy seven point six
seconds<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.710> minute<00:01:22.979> 17<00:01:23.369> seconds

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
seconds which is one minute 17 seconds

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
seconds which is one minute 17 seconds
and<00:01:23.909> six<00:01:24.180> tenths<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> second<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.619> ingame

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and six tenths of a second the ingame

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.880 
and six tenths of a second the ingame
clock<00:01:25.950> broke<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.049> whatever<00:01:28.049> my<00:01:28.229> time<00:01:28.470> code<00:01:28.740> is
