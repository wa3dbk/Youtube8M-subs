cool some of the sections on the drum

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.930 
cool some of the sections on the drum
machine<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.009> 20<00:00:14.309> velocity

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
machine can be you have the 20 velocity

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.300 
machine can be you have the 20 velocity
sensitive<00:00:15.360> triggers<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:15.990> right<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.740> xrx

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
sensitive triggers here right the xrx

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.310 
sensitive triggers here right the xrx
drum<00:00:17.580> sounds<00:00:23.240> right<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.480> very<00:00:24.570> cool<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> have

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
drum sounds right it's very cool to have

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.440 
drum sounds right it's very cool to have
these<00:00:25.439> velocity<00:00:25.949> sensing<00:00:31.880> right<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.329> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
these velocity sensing right so it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
these velocity sensing right so it's
these<00:00:34.079> pads<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.680> great<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.130> work<00:00:35.309> with

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
these pads are great to work with

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
these pads are great to work with
because<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> nuances<00:00:37.110> out

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
a great I've got ten different bases in

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.669 
a great I've got ten different bases in
here<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.479> mess<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.560> I've

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
here that I can mess with and then I've

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.109 
here that I can mess with and then I've
got<00:01:37.859> you<00:01:38.039> know<00:01:38.159> slide<00:01:38.820> bases<00:01:39.390> funk<00:01:40.609> and<00:01:41.609> I<00:01:41.909> can

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
got you know slide bases funk and I can

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.630 
got you know slide bases funk and I can
program<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.109> pads<00:01:43.640> another

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
program them just with the pads another

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
program them just with the pads another
reason<00:01:44.969> for<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.179> MIDI<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.509> Jack<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.469> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
reason for the MIDI in Jack is if I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.169 
reason for the MIDI in Jack is if I
don't<00:01:46.829> want<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> pads<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
don't want to do it here on the pads I

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.690 
don't want to do it here on the pads I
can<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.840> keyboard<00:01:49.319> or<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.219> could<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
can do it on keyboard or I could do it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.399 
can do it on keyboard or I could do it
if<00:01:50.789> I<00:01:50.850> had<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> MIDI<00:01:51.270> guitar<00:01:51.420> rig<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.200> had<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
if I had a MIDI guitar rig if I had a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.069 
if I had a MIDI guitar rig if I had a
rolling<00:01:53.310> guitar<00:01:53.610> rig<00:01:53.850> GI<00:01:54.479> 20<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:54.959> something

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
rolling guitar rig GI 20 or something

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
rolling guitar rig GI 20 or something
took<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> MIDI<00:01:55.709> out<00:01:55.859> of<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.459> could

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
took the MIDI out of that I could

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.609 
took the MIDI out of that I could
program<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.390> bass<00:01:57.689> sounds<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
program the bass sounds with that and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.289 
program the bass sounds with that and
it's<00:01:58.740> very<00:01:58.979> cool<00:01:59.219> also<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.000> base<00:02:00.149> is

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
it's very cool also the base is

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's very cool also the base is
polyphonic<00:02:00.929> as<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.709> bass

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
polyphonic as well so you can do bass

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.710 
polyphonic as well so you can do bass
chords<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:02.789> really<00:02:03.060> works<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:03.659> of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
chords which really works out kind of

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.630 
chords which really works out kind of
cool<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.739> next<00:02:04.979> thing<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.189> wanted<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.459> show<00:02:05.610> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
cool the next thing I wanted to show you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.359 
cool the next thing I wanted to show you
is<00:02:05.880> some<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.239> patterns<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.989> here

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
is some of the patterns that are in here

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.039 
is some of the patterns that are in here
500<00:02:08.369> patterns<00:02:08.729> loaded<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.269> here<00:02:09.539> let's<00:02:09.959> just

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
500 patterns loaded in here let's just

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.479 
500 patterns loaded in here let's just
take<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> peek<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.739> some<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> cool<00:02:11.220> ones

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
take a peek of some of the cool ones

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.430 
take a peek of some of the cool ones
I've<00:02:12.209> got<00:02:12.390> kind<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.720> Latin<00:02:13.019> thing<00:02:13.170> going<00:02:13.440> on
