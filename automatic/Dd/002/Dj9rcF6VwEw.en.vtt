make the most common mistake that people
make<00:00:10.849> he<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:11.910> not<00:00:12.240> rocking<00:00:12.840> long<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.920> deep

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
make he is not rocking long and deep

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820 
make he is not rocking long and deep
enough<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.929> spinning<00:00:15.929> too<00:00:16.230> fast<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.770> too

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
enough and spinning too fast and too

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.820 
enough and spinning too fast and too
soon<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.940> looks<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:20.600> again<00:00:21.740> I'm<00:00:22.740> not

soon it looks like this again I'm not
rocking<00:00:23.250> very<00:00:23.490> well<00:00:23.730> coming<00:00:24.359> off<00:00:24.600> too<00:00:24.840> quickly

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
rocking very well coming off too quickly

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.640 
rocking very well coming off too quickly
and<00:00:25.470> spinning<00:00:26.310> way<00:00:26.430> too<00:00:26.490> soon<00:00:26.820> wait<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> are

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
and spinning way too soon wait you are

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.279 
and spinning way too soon wait you are
there<00:00:28.650> has<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.070> time<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.400> takes<00:00:29.880> place

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
there has to be a time that takes place

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.200 
there has to be a time that takes place
your<00:00:31.289> rock<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.279> long<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.730> deep<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
your rock has to be long and deep and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
your rock has to be long and deep and
even<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.350> rock<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.040> your

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
even if you don't rock well then your

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.150 
even if you don't rock well then your
toss<00:00:35.430> has<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.420> long<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.809> deep<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
toss has to be long and deep you have to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
toss has to be long and deep you have to
physically<00:00:38.640> give<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> ball<00:00:39.210> time<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
physically give the ball time to go to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.350 
physically give the ball time to go to
where<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> strike<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> goal

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
where you want to strike it in the goal

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.799 
where you want to strike it in the goal
so<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:44.120> don't<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.300> too<00:00:45.539> quick

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
so you go like this don't be too quick

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.950 
so you go like this don't be too quick
and<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:47.100> rotation<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.360> must<00:00:48.570> give<00:00:48.840> them

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and do your rotation you must give them

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.490 
and do your rotation you must give them
all<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:57.300> may<00:00:57.480> not<00:00:57.600> look<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.289> I'm

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
all time it may not look like it but I'm

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049 
all time it may not look like it but I'm
actually<00:00:58.620> putting<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> slight<00:00:59.399> pause<00:00:59.699> in

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
actually putting the slight pause in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually putting the slight pause in
between<00:01:00.239> my<00:01:00.989> toes<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.730> strike<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.359> give

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
between my toes and my strike to give

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.539 
between my toes and my strike to give
the<00:01:03.629> ball<00:01:03.780> time<00:01:08.119> some<00:01:09.119> other<00:01:09.210> mistakes<00:01:09.750> are

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
the ball time some other mistakes are

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
the ball time some other mistakes are
improper<00:01:11.549> setup<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> ball<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
improper setup of the ball so when you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.609 
improper setup of the ball so when you
do<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.710> toss<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.850> ball<00:01:15.060> doesn't<00:01:15.990> come<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
do your toss the ball doesn't come to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.969 
do your toss the ball doesn't come to
the<00:01:16.710> optimal<00:01:17.130> point<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.820> looks<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.979> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the optimal point it looks like this you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.730 
the optimal point it looks like this you
in<00:01:20.100> fact<00:01:20.280> maybe<00:01:20.549> even<00:01:21.150> lose<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> ball<00:01:21.740> by

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
in fact maybe even lose the ball by

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
in fact maybe even lose the ball by
having<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> ball<00:01:23.369> too<00:01:23.610> far<00:01:23.850> forward<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.960> toss

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
having a ball too far forward your toss

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.640 
having a ball too far forward your toss
the<00:01:25.830> ball<00:01:26.040> may<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.850> forward<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the ball may go forward and be out of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.149 
the ball may go forward and be out of
reach<00:01:29.390> much<00:01:30.390> better<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.409> rock<00:01:31.619> start

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
reach much better to have the rock start

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
reach much better to have the rock start
on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> equator<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> ball<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:34.439> when

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
on the equator of the ball and then when

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.990 
on the equator of the ball and then when
you<00:01:34.680> come<00:01:34.920> off<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> left<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.909> right

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you come off to the left or the right

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.870 
you come off to the left or the right
the<00:01:36.840> ball<00:01:37.110> should<00:01:37.320> actually<00:01:37.530> come<00:01:38.040> back<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the ball should actually come back on a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
the ball should actually come back on a
slight<00:01:39.210> angle<00:01:41.780> repeat<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:44.040> ball<00:01:44.280> should

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
slight angle repeat that the ball should

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.280 
slight angle repeat that the ball should
come<00:01:44.759> back<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> slight<00:01:45.899> angle<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
come back on a slight angle so you can

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.889 
come back on a slight angle so you can
test<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.829> by<00:01:50.189> doing<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.670> few<00:01:50.850> tosses<00:01:51.450> without

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
test that by doing a few tosses without

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.920 
test that by doing a few tosses without
striking<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:53.280> how<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> ball<00:01:53.759> comes<00:01:56.930> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
striking and see how the ball comes the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
striking and see how the ball comes the
task<00:01:58.229> should<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.890> only<00:01:59.040> come<00:01:59.280> back<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.670> an

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
task should not only come back at an

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
task should not only come back at an
angle<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.810> toss<00:02:01.170> should<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.860> enough

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
angle the toss should have enough

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.899 
angle the toss should have enough
velocity<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.960> striking<00:02:04.469> points<00:02:04.909> at

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
velocity to be the striking points at

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.240 
velocity to be the striking points at
the<00:02:06.000> same<00:02:06.390> time<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.140> man<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.619> or

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the same time that your man is or

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.620 
the same time that your man is or
perhaps<00:02:08.610> after

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
perhaps after

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.990 
perhaps after
delay<00:02:09.930> you<00:02:10.860> shouldn't<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.580> wait<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> long

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
delay you shouldn't have to wait a long

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.620 
delay you shouldn't have to wait a long
time<00:02:12.830> again<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.220> means<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.330> ball

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
time again what that means is the ball

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.880 
time again what that means is the ball
should<00:02:15.990> toss<00:02:16.760> fairly<00:02:17.760> fast<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.200> striking

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
should toss fairly fast to this striking

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.850 
should toss fairly fast to this striking
point<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.120> test<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.690> by<00:02:22.170> tossing<00:02:22.800> it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
point you can test that by tossing it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.010 
point you can test that by tossing it
coming<00:02:23.220> off<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.490> wall<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.030> if<00:02:24.810> there's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
coming off the wall and see if there's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.930 
coming off the wall and see if there's
enough<00:02:25.200> velocity<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.040> ball<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> come<00:02:26.670> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
enough velocity for the ball to come and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.550 
enough velocity for the ball to come and
I<00:02:27.300> can<00:02:27.330> touch<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.020> up<00:02:28.140> side<00:02:28.410> rail<00:02:30.410> that's<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
I can touch the up side rail that's a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.090 
I can touch the up side rail that's a
little<00:02:31.830> bit<00:02:31.920> too<00:02:32.100> soft<00:02:36.680> that's<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.860> little

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
little bit too soft that's a little

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.140 
little bit too soft that's a little
better<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.840> two<00:02:39.900> things<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.440> check<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.580> one<00:02:41.820> is

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
better so two things to check the one is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.170 
better so two things to check the one is
the<00:02:42.690> ball<00:02:42.930> should<00:02:43.170> come<00:02:43.410> back<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.610> rock<00:02:44.790> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the ball should come back in your rock I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.200 
the ball should come back in your rock I
should<00:02:46.050> say<00:02:46.200> your<00:02:46.380> cost<00:02:46.790> secondly<00:02:47.790> your<00:02:47.970> Tosh

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
should say your cost secondly your Tosh

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.270 
should say your cost secondly your Tosh

constrain<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.870> wall<00:02:52.080> now<00:02:53.480> also<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> see

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
constrain the wall now also what I see

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.830 
constrain the wall now also what I see
happening<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.680> people<00:02:56.220> will<00:02:56.760> check<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.210> people

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
happening is people will check it people

happening is people will check it people
will<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:58.080> fine<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:59.190> then<00:02:59.490> they'll<00:02:59.760> change

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
will be fine but then they'll change

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.450 
will be fine but then they'll change
everything<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:01.050> do<00:03:01.110> at<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.560> time<00:03:01.650> ready<00:03:02.250> to

don't<00:03:06.240> forget<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.440> toss<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:08.160> the

don't forget that the toss is the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.460 
don't forget that the toss is the
