00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello everyone with you channel everything about android 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.910
 and today we will talk about the module for 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.119
 xposed module called ecsta 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.790
 ast what is the way i think that many 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.820
 with this application are already familiar with my 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.529
 Now this module is installed 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.310
 see what this notification looks like 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.310
 now after configuring this module 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.070
 module and here it is activated that is it 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.350
 installed in the smartphone was restarted and 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.150
 Now I will briefly explain why this 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.750
 module and then show some of it 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.220
 the settings that he immediately that the video will be 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.930
 short and in my case but gave 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.680
 extra features all 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.740
 encounter system notifications 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.480
 this is when here's how you saw 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.160
 there was such a notice now she has 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.920
 I'm completely tuned in and there are 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.810
 such situations when jumped out this 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.759
 managed to save the change 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.710
 managed to save changes 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.009
 the application tried to make some 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.640
 changes or there was an error and where 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.469
 this error occurred is not clear and then 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.289
 there is a notification anode displayed on 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.810
 split second and repeat and read it 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.409
 notice is almost impossible so 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.100
 here is the given given module x posture tone 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.979
 exactly made so that you can 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.049
 customize this 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.270
 I already showed the notice showed 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.850
 when i switched 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.950
 directly in a pose like this 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.590
 customized notification 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:49.100
 and now let's move on to the module itself and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.229
 I will say right away that let's say if you click on 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.670
 test button you see what 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.950
 the notification now contains after 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.999
 settings 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 application name what exactly happened 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.459
 and 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.670
 application icon that is after 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.009
 setting you will be received by you 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.320
 opportunity to read what 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.510
 the application is directly shown 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.600
 will be its icon and what changes 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.860
 are made 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.210
 as I entered xposed it was written that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.940
 application and method provided 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.660
 super user rights access ie everything 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.280
 detailed information was displayed in 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.140
 given 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.570
 system message and the whole thing is possible 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.260
 configure using this module will say 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.540
 that I basically lacked that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.500
 module because often after 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.380
 installations 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.060
 there are no applications popping up 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.400
 managed as I said there save 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.080
 changes well and it is not clear who tried 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.980
 save changes or this again 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.450
 installed application or is it 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.760
 application which is some kind of background 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.280
 works and at the same time it will be possible 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.170
 track and make sure that the background 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.860
 some kind of application do some 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.620
 changes you all system notifications 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.370
 get the opportunity to their settings 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.050
 there are ticks here 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.890
 enable application icon in the mouth 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.680
 notifications 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.290
 set the size of the icon set the position 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.630
 where will be up on the pop up 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.140
 icon well let's say the size of the icon we 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.000
 Now let's set it to the maximum 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.980
 we will test how this whole thing 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.820
 look like this icon 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.130
 big will be that is what i was talking about 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.860
 in my case it is not necessary i will leave 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.600
 default ie application 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.730
 adjusts size position title 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.360
 applications in toast allows 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.800
 show 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.230
 if you put a check here, it will be 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.730
 here it is a notice that is the name 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.160
 set the font for this title position 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.800
 name color name my case here I am 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.320
 set the application name to red 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.620
 text so that she immediately rushed and how 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.620
 see that here is the name of the application 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.040
 bold red text style background 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.160
 what well here as you see fit 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.770
 can be set by default can be 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.480
 install kitkat ie everything is possible 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.400
 Well, let's for example see how it will be 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.810
 look like jellybin notice here 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.520
 so here's a little black see that all of me 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:34.840
 everything can be customized right from the very 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.940
 module and see how this whole thing 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.150
 will look on your android 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.610
 hall devices light example 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.030
 such is their pressure left by me 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.250
 Well, that is, the ability to customize the type 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:52.060
 font color in toast 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.850
 again look here blue color if 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.220
 you set up another light with me 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.100
 notifications can be changed and font 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.470
 adjust the horizontal displacement of the same 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.700
 performed in my main function is 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.620
 the duration of the appearance of the toast than 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.600
 the more you set the time the more 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.060
 this notification will be delayed 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.220
 how it all looks like there is an opportunity 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.110
 read there what changes what 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:22.330
 application and where did your system 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.870
 Here in my opinion very interesting 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.400
 a module that will help you a lot 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.260
 decide who often 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.960
 pops up all sorts of systemic 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:38.669
 the message then this module will give 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:42.669
 the ability to still control what 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.940
 happening on your smartphone what 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.340
 applications work out you get 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.229
 opportunity to read system 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.150
 messages they so jumped out 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.050
 the message is not clear what was in it 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:59.410
 written here is such a very short 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.800
 review of a very useful module x toast for 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.169
 xposed x and xii of the program will be 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.810
 watch the video on this one 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.930
 I will tell right away that the magnificent 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.880
 general program itself and gives 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.060
 many possibilities on this 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.979
 finish subscribe to the channel 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.979
