00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.340
 then we are going to make the pot that 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.460
 I create them here I have what is 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.890
 the container where the 5 liters come 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.480
 of water if this is the water that I 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.989
 I take then what I'm going to do is that 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.989
 I'm going to remove 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.660
 and here I have this tool that is 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.540
 to open a hole I'm already throwing a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.370
 myth 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:47.079
 we heat then I'm going to cut 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.739
 around here with this part 1 2 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.739
 one 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.220
 then very carefully he goes 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.560
 cutting up 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.560
 in the end almost never remains but good 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.380
 but now when I finish 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.100
 I'm going to open the gaps to not have 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.820
 that 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.820
 thinking 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.440
 now I am going to proceed 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.550
 we are going to open a hole 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.770
 you know when you do not have 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.150
 a moment does not have a pot or something 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.100
 who simply looks for what he has in 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.560
 home of you do not worry that always 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.710
 will always find a bottle 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.710
 plastic 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.180
 sure you will find it so be a 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.610
 little bit of sodium burke you're going to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.700
 find plastic of course 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.300
 is transparent and will use it to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.280
 grains asking whatever 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.400
 already for another type of plant is not so 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.400
 important 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500
 we are opening here 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.190
 I'm finishing 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.460
 what is the part of opening the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.460
 holes 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.690
 I think that here I have to make a 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.440
 hollow because this yours of our 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.330
 church 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.310
 I will not take advantage since I have the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.610
 team I do not have hot team is 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.210
 warm 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.210
 simple 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.620
 now those who were missing 14 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.780
 It does not realize then and there 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.430
 finished 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.430
 [Music] 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.739
 so 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.420
 to this part of here you do what 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.650
 does the same thing you can cut a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.680
 piece that is too big too 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.680
 big 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.070
 and the capita of this that is the capita 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.200
 original with what's coming 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.840
 [Music] 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.959
 I was alone and there he opens the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.370
 screams opens as you want not 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.170
 have to use a thing like that 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.540
 I have them, I'm lucky because 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.040
 my friend pÃ³sito that is full and 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.280
 then every time a lack later 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.890
 You will find something that one needs 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.319
 and I found that kind of tool that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.959
 It is very good to drill 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.780
 here I have it good, I'll finish 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.730
 with this 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.720
 is what I wanted to teach them how I 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.980
 I used to make a good basilica or pot 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.109
 recycling recycling good concept 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.519

 imagine I started as the first video 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.330
 I think someone told me about those issues 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.330
 nobody is interested because it seems that the 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.430
 person was wrong in life follow your 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.919

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:53.270
