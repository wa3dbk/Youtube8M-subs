00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.920
 hello everyone and we are in a student movement that we learned to 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.850
 solve 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.249
 positions my problem 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.690
 that we can find interviews 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.199
 newspapers in the daily press at any kiosk 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.199
 we can find chess positions 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.520
 vienna - they will go that we are going to see is this one in which they say to us that they play black 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.220
 inhuman 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.779
 to resolve the opposition 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.699
 we already explained 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.069
 previous texts 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.070
 we have to fight to honor that position and see 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 which highs after its start transports 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.440
 all that kind of e 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 of options we have to value them 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.519
 is not what we are going to fix that we apply to 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.070
 they are not so ready of the material and we can check the black 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.530
 they carry two other bishops in exchange for three pianos, with which advantage of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.270
 material 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.290
 black ones 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.510
 in exchange for industrialists who are seventh say they are about to 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.400
 to crown 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.530
 with which after surpassing you can lose 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.330
 In nothing 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.940
 I have not seen we are now the question of the kings 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.250
 the irrigation as it is to check this more or less protected although it will arrive immediately 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.039
 will be seen out by these plans and the white king this 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.520
 very threatened 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.410
 we look at the bishops 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.430
 they're like 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.730
 some blazers 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.880
 that are cutting the way of King Henry can not escape 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.260
 you only have these three boxes to move 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.300
 ok and we also have an open column here 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.470
 Something very important 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.260
 lies and 92 material advantage and they are about to crown us 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.530
 what we have to look for we are too fast something fast attack 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.690
 spanair and we will pass forcing embers 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.799
 the councilmen, as we already know, are the parks 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.590
 changes and direct threats 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.340
 let's start with the ajax that we are forcing 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.360
 the check how many we have here because I want two shocks 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.440
 a check is 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.160
 to cic 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.870
 h 2 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.050
 and according to the polls 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.340
 tower I see 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.370
 we will be the financial check 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.749
 the king is going to capture us here 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.700
 and we will lose everything that is said that we are going to discard in a more 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.139
 fast afternoon 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.489
 let's think then 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.009
 counted relegated 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.309
 torrevieja we make them tower b 1 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:22.530
 You have two options 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.530
 one for example would be laugh f2 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.169
 price 2 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.169
 tower 8 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.899
 we are always doing 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:40.659
 a maneuver we have to remember the other manne pieces 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.940
 although we are paying 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.110
 in these is here 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.349
 the farms around here are also playing poorly 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.179
 if you are giving in the field of aek 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.669
 the ranks of the queenside can also attack 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.579
 and it's more 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.579
 it is necessary that he attack 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.589
 while small animal of tower on the this is burning 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:59.690
 but for one 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.329
 and they make me see how the pact recapture 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.499
 nor would we capture tower by towers 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.620
 king f2 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.639
 iturra f1 checkmate 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.170
 do not give in this first medal we have learned 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.559
 endorsed the final 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.009
 and then they were going out our 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.479
 our idea 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.619
 we'll see 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:21.639
 another position 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.839
 and see if we can think 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 how to solve it 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.359
 doing opposition is a problem of white 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.629
 with the good contributions to the tie 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.319
 we find it easier 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.759
 fix it 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.759
 we must focus on accounting for the material 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.339
 here the moors have two penises of advantage 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.229
 but also if we look closely 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.339
 you could vandalize like this enclosure and this tower 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.339
 they are not playing anything say we're going 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.289
 we could receive natalia de menos 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.199
 because in this principle at first this tower 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.239
 is helping me to our attack on the kingside 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.369
 for the face of right stick before we only have three pieces 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:12.619
 that they might be enough oo you may not see them in olive 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.749
 a piece more than tato trends 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.909
 what problem can we find to stop the rest of the tower from here 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.969
 attack the king's flank 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.090
 very complicated 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.270
 so to focus on the attack on the kingside 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.330
 i in the exhibition of the king that is disputed at home before him weak 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.839
 I will be when it is almost exposed land has no box 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.320
 those that I will go 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.490
 are threatened is to say if we get andÃºjar king 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.479
 would be jaca 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.860
 so let's think about the possible factors 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.229
 I do have these moments 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.180
 four serves 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.819
 to strap 7 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.999
 others the magic of probing 7 and camacho 7 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
 let's apply fast jaques 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:02.419
 so when advancing 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.320
 in our 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.409
 method 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.599
 to solve problems 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.050
 Lady G8 Check 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.770
 if we make us saturate us with the tower 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.779
 brazil for towers could be or acquire food they do for towers 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.039
 i laughed for bishop 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.750
 here the biologists and buses 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.750
 but love in a way quite written 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.279
 More options we have 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.759
 We are g7 for example 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.520
 / g 7 we will do one more season 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.900
 and good catches in record and again we would lose 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.919
 the match 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.809
 finally ladies and 7 check 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:43.099
 another option that we have 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.129
 and nothing would come out 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.129
 with which also discarded 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.139
 so a back discharge to wash hands in anfi g7 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.960
 yes actresses actresses and of checkmate the only option is to capture with bishop 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.139
 but we almost saw some moves 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.779
 what is juan with ladies and 5 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.779
 towards it there will be prosthetic jaca 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.440
 in this problem we have applied again the first value method previously 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.779
 the positions 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:17.039
 value the game 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.860
 on the king's flank with 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.930
 the game of all my pieces we remember these three pieces 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.300
 we have valued the position of the king 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.240
 and we have focused the sharp moves we have begun to speak for the 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.249
 check 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.249
 obtained a solution 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.650
 what else have we quoted as we have used 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.300
 Well, the tactical theme 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.360
 open it with a shrinkage is open but we have cleared it so that our lady 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.089
 I could take care of this column 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:47.819
 and checkmate 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:51.300
 we have taken advantage of placed at 15 7 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.490
 to my rival 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.490
 worth gloves cap or worse yet what is more attraction 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.460
 colo colo is set 7 for parents to his bishop 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.699
 g7 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.210
 and it's a matter of playing at my leisure 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.809
 in agreement
