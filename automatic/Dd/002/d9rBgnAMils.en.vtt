in<00:02:01.409> your<00:02:01.469> mind<00:02:02.149> yes<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.160 

he<00:02:07.409> got<00:02:07.770> nobody<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.280> fight<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.729> fluid<00:02:09.170> but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
he got nobody to fight with fluid but

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.330 
he got nobody to fight with fluid but
they're<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> same<00:02:10.649> weight<00:02:10.830> class<00:02:10.860> right<00:02:11.310> I

they're in the same weight class right I

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.110 
they're in the same weight class right I
mean<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> makes<00:02:11.730> sense<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.970> they<00:02:12.090> would

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
mean it makes sense that they would

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.800 
mean it makes sense that they would
inevitably<00:02:12.480> me<00:02:19.819> would<00:02:20.819> be<00:02:21.000> no<00:02:21.239> kind<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.540> threat

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
inevitably me would be no kind of threat

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.229 
inevitably me would be no kind of threat
