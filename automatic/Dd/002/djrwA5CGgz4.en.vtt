00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.950
 at the Westphalian riding and 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.530
 driving school in Münster handorf is all right 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.600
 Today at the dressage place for one 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.700
 special riding lesson the new 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.880
 manager of the riding school jörg 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.900
 Jacob explains how to sit in the saddle 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.300
 can make exercise very easy 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.539
 Beautiful field all of trainee cans 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.550
 eggs show the exercises and in the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.529
 Unfortunately, it is often the case today 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.990
 that we sit a lot in the office 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.629
 desk also sit us less 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.040
 move naturally 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.720
 often by car to the stables 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.070
 drive and just as it used to be that one 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.629
 First of all the horses on foot from the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.519
 had to get there already coupling 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.129
 has moved or just bike to the stall 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.129
 drove or even for now 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.339
 riding club is ridden this phase are 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.930
 now all almost died away unfortunately or 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.199
 extremely shortened 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.690
 more important are regular seat 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.460
 Exercises josi mayer suggests 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.930
 first the bow at all 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.699
 overturn that if we now 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.290
 gymnastic exercises with the legs 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.830
 they do not do one more 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.590
 Horse's body tapping for the first exercise 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.260
 should josi's legs circular out of the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.470
 let the hip circle out like when 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.670
 cycle 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.439
 Many people think bike riding is 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.750
 I can simply ride a bicycle 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.550
 but on the horse, that the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.640
 fourth belly is also a bit wider 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.490
 that's the hull of the bike then 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.170
 but more difficult and you start with the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.850
 tiptoe to gyrate that we once 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.470
 to go to the loosening of the ankles 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.460
 then also later in the ankle 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.420
 clearly down 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.909
 Down feathers can be the next exercise 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.070
 to stretch the buttocks and lower 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.840
 back muscles is as I would 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.430
 make any case first content 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.740
 let and then that too will 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.360
 is held once 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.520
 that will be the rein that long 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.780
 hands hang down right and left and 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.030
 then you take turns with you 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.790
 the elbow of the right elbow to the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.790
 left as left knee and back again 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.040
 below it and below it soy 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.150
 must be accurate and then one 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.420
 experienced balanced rider has 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.900
 then go back over then 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.200
 This exercise can also be done in step 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.200
 do 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.129
 you stay there to let it sink 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:44.750
 in this position you can circle completely 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:47.870
 slowly with both legs to the top 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.810
 out of the hips so exactly 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.549
 very slowly moves even slower 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.840
 It is important how from the front you can do that 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.540
 now also see very well that the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.459
 wider really knee and thigh 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.310
 out of the saddle and there 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.220
 moving will not be hand 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.930
 supports very well 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.349
 the leader really is her too 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.150
 hip joint or the buttocks so in one 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.950
 position lets you see that it falls 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.629
 me very hard that he no 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.489
 compensatory movements and speak 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.200
 if the leg goes forward the remains 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.220
 upper body also the front and always 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.590
 still so calm with the carried hand 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.169
 still slow yes that I really quite 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.359
 out targeting the muscles of the 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.970
 next exercise shows josi meier aware 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.629
 how unstable her seat is in her 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.909
 if they are too long, they will take effect 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.870
 stirrups ride the balance goes 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.569
 lost 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.729
 We once have the wing mast 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.169
 significantly shortened the rider takes the 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:50.989
 stirrup still further up the front 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.150
 really what they are under the bale 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.379
 then also here in the foot down 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.510
 under springs can 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.459
 and now lets give it once 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.680
 rein to indulge once because trains 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:06.139
 Adhere to it once 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.790
 down through mistakes so exactly that 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.690
 riders now really after 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.479
 down in the ankle can spring through times 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.039
 remain stand tall in the saddle 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:20.349
 I'll stay there for a while 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.349
 without holding you tight 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.400
 but you see that the value falls 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.470
 rider a little harder exactly 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.150
 That's why the reins are still in the lead 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.840
 I always give up that 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.000
 can concentrate my balance 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.130
 good even now for the training of the balance 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.139
 and also the coordination remains 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.330
 the rider just twice at the top 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.630
 have easy and only sit down once 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.630
 two times in addition to a change 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.520
 get up and sit down once 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.950
 You can also implement it twice 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.780
 sit and even stand what 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.080
 again the coordination of the 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.970
 It is important that the 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.470
 hand always stays calm and nice 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.380
 will be carried 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.740
 afterwards the light seat in 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:10.500
 taken trot and then graf josi 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.540
 meyer in the crotch pull up her legs 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.190
 So that 's me and just bend 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.130
 now the hip joint knee joint and 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.990
 also sees the ankle with so now 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.390
 you also clearly that the rider 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.820
 really her leg angling in 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.860
 upper body has remained completely straight and 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.020
 not as it has done before the 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.670
 Kneeling in the hip is to the left 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.750
 has slipped down and by hand 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.090
 the leg has raised in the ninth 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.140
 the rider lets her arms out 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.270
 slowly circle before going to school 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.800
 continues 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.330
 often get explained in the riding lesson 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 teacher leaves then let yours 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.680
 hand still silently silently rest 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.370
 let stand the hand alone endeavors 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.360
 every rider to rest 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.820
 key point is the shoulder 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.980
 if you have tight and tight shoulder muscles 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.140
 blocked is not the hand 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.150
 independent or poor 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.450
 regardless of the shoulder of the body 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.340
 21 but these exercises should be easy 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.770
 to that I serve every riding lesson new 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.050
 feel where is my today 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.030
 balance where is my focus today 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.890
 which parts do i have? 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.650
 the last time much improved 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.770
 more clearly served so I then 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.080
 always from the beginning on my start 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.550
 base my balance the inner 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.920
 balance nor the outer 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.260
 to find equilibrium 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.630
 Josie Meyer and all have a good time 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.290
 made and allowed now the place 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.290
 leave
