00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.510
 and nothing more and nothing less than macrosad 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.880
 campus in the city they wanted and it's over 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.710
 to present and then xbox one john 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.260
 because it's just a box of 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.450
 complete entertainment now the xbox 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.310
 one is divided into four parts 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.560
 fundamentals but we already have three here 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.840
 behind us we have the kinect in 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.369
 xbox one and practically a control which 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.230
 is the fourth any application of 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.519
 smart class the kleenex as you can see 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.019
 will already be included in the xbox one and 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.210
 there are things that have changed a lot already 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.940
 has a lot of depth sensors 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.729
 already has more details regarding 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.430
 oscillation of limbs or axes 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.350
 coordinated and also the most important 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.570
 who can also read biometrics is 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.640
 say your heartbeat if you have any 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.409
 say your temperature low and so on 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.760
 also a part of the commands we see 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.100
 that is much more accurate is you 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.449
 you can have a total interaction from 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.949
 how to turn on your xbox until how 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.900
 interact with him directly you can 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.760
 switch to the action very fast but 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.590
 quickly since they are doing the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.820
 processes one with another then they changed 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.140
 of you are watching a program 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.149
 television is simply a command of 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.350
 voice and you're automatically playing 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.600
 Why are you 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.100
 now it's still multi tasking inside 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.450
 of the xbox one console 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.610
 control is also one of the things 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.580
 most important that they designed 47 designs 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.890
 designs entered in this 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.600
 control that in addition to that obviously 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.970
 they fixed the beat peace which was something 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.610
 fundamental and very necessary in the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.340
 controls has force feedback is to say 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.729
 some pressure sensor and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.720
 movement per trigger per button in addition 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.360
 that is obviously the redesign 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.830
 aesthetic of the latter also the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 potatoes the console how interesting is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.690
 that obviously we already have the new 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.009
 redesigned the blu-ray optical drive and that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.350
 we have a practice then when we have 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.550
 an ethernet port in a real box spring 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.250
 we have a connected to connect 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.030
 evidently new connects two usb 3 a 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.460
 hdmi and an hdmi and it's obviously out one 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.049
 optical outlet of good water and the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.450
 current where obviously 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.509
 you connect and put the light on the side 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.319
 we also have a last usb of this 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.780
 side 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.780
 and then redesign also the kinect 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.960
 one of the most important things that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.420
 you have the service is the interaction 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.940
 between these four objects in 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.380
 entertainment and others in the apart 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.510
 entertainment that there was a lot of focus 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 besides all not to be served in the cloud and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.530
 of new ones now 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.510
 strategic aliases because for example 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.040
 with the nfl where you can see your match and 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.080
 Also while you are doing your 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.640
 party being running an application or 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.900
 be watching a game or change 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.060
 automatically a game that you're 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.430
 playing search statistics see your 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.920
 fantasy team or even make a 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.780
 call in skype there is also a new 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.150
 proposal do you think is xbox 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.909
 entertainment that joins xbox music 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.860
 which is attached to the video which is 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.220
 production of original content 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.319
 one of them will be the new series of 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.480
 television the tail or in the action eb 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.040
 directed by steven spielberg insofar 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.129
 game ads there were not many 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.019
 explosives or strong ads because 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.230
 are waiting for the e3 but if it was done 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:22.090
 the announcement of force 5 also of fifa 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.060
 14 I sent the 14 madden 25 and the new 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.970
 canon or the new the new imagination of 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.290
 call of duty ghosts xbox one will be 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.470
 available at the end of the year we do not know 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.180
 either the exact date nor the price nor in 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.500
 what format is going to sell also a 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.150
 very important thing that is mentioned is 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.739
 that due to the new architecture of 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.920
 system will not be possible the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.810
 retrocompatibility 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.580
 that is to say all the games of how 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.560
 presents are not going to be available in 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.420
 xbox 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.959
 as more information went out 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.959
 we will continue to support 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.180
