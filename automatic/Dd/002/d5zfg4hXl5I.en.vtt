00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 mykonos new york with the brake it bayer 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.319
 only seven notebooks here on one 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.660
 exhibition where we really are 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.010
 presented as a highlight of the day here 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 we have gotten one 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.440
 beautiful 15 6 inch display with 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.480
 a beautiful keyboards we can see 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.189
 there is something funny because we problem 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.160
 have such a hinge in there the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.240
 We will see it for the first time 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.830
 but we definitely have one 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.580
 new design that not only allows us 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.350
 the whole, as it were 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 yes in this weird format too 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.580
 but also as a tablet 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.810
 but also as a notebook and the design 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.610
 means he should equal the problem 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.200
 to fold on it with one hand 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.580
 but before that our process to us 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.150
 have headphones including microphone 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.600
 in a usb 3.0 namely even as blue 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.059
 is 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.460
 but you have the 30 meters electricity 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.470
 output so if the device is off yes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.720
 already from the hdmi and displayport 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.040
 all front to you nothing except 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.900
 a nice impact here 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.300
 to make her feel comfortable when 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.010
 one has on it or on the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.659
 the other side here we have one more 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 Stake at reader with a dummy inside 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.810
 just usb 2.0 volume control on and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.420
 switch off current and kenzingen others 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.280
 fall in more often because here are natural 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 not just a skeleton inside the processor 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.580
 but i3 or i5 then you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.200
 accordingly and further down can 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 the device I can work here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 but you can see that built quite stable 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.930
 I should here in the center bridge 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.760
 then this is the rectangle 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 Of course, siebel is not broken 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.240
 Although one-hand offer to go too 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.440
 fold 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.790
 even goes 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.900
 and then I can not just sit there like this 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.100
 Fold backwards as before 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.990
 looked so much further 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.040
 fold back then it becomes almost one 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.900
 emergency call, so to speak 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.250
 and then I put on a touchpad 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.410
 appeal and I can do it all here 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.730
 to use in notebook mode so to speak 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.650
 That can go much further back 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.970
 but now work a bit the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.500
 glass surface so i will do the whole thing 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.060
 here a little bit on the side 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.400
 pull and then you 'll see me here 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.870
 it may just as well here back 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 works wunderts me can I round 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.880
 also close again and then you see 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.800
 here too 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.150
 We take this particular form factor 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.280
 already on a trio again 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.590
 seen from next does not come yet 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.850
 very united as the whole one too 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.070
 work because praise is 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.940
 of course something else done with it 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.780
 the whole thing when that's turned down like 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 you can see 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.410
 a corresponding here also comes on 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.790
 Of course, the metals are also good 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.980
 otherwise you can see how it works 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.990
 The whole thing is a bit too 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.820
 transfigured to look a bit like that 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.920
 of course the enterprise spaceship with 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.720
 the 14th of May so together with the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.220
 movie star will appear at 14 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.900
 when i'm such short of the bottom 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.940
 show then you can see we can 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.320
 not really easy the ramps 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.610
 or festival somehow exchange though 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.640
 Of course we still have speakers 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.560
 dolby home theater even sound 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.270
 and a few they screw up 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.150
 probably also easy to solve 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.470
 will cede to the whole device 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.280
 otherwise, of course, this is normal 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.720
 windows 8 installed 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.770
 So nothing special can actually 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.350
 you do not just wonderfully use here 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.240
 with touch but also with the keyboard 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.830
 and mouse is accordingly now 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.290
 Of course, what else will be natural 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.610
 see this is beautiful and fast 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.420
 I can short the camera 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.420
 come in if I find that 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.460
 but of course we are a few programs 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.709
 on it among other things here we have so 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.000
 nothing at all that he has seven goals 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.160
 We can also help each other 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.870
 look at how to make the notebook ideal 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.520
 can use with all this 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.870
 funny features as you can see 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.760
 For example, we have it in the video 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.220
 and everything is here for us 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.780
 very nice shown here after a very 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.370
 old windows media player mode 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.450
 We've been watching what's on 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.070
 iris prosieben here in the first person 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.750
 new york my name is the gas is on 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.300
 14 may as I said comes to a hitherto 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.250
 Unknown price but it feels 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.900
 very good at very high quality past that 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.820
 you can build here very plastic 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.250
 but there is not the keyboard 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.650
 also very good and the trackpad is too 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.410
 nice and fast here until the next one 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.519
 led forces that was that it is at the 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.519
 7th austria
