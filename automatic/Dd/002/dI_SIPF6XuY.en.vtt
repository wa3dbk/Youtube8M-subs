00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
peripherals there will be not much cable

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.510 
peripherals there will be not much cable
clutter<00:06:20.160> instead<00:06:21.270> if<00:06:22.270> you<00:06:22.810> can<00:06:23.020> fit<00:06:23.470> a<00:06:23.770> lot<00:06:24.310> of

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
just right here actually for the cable

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.130 
just right here actually for the cable
management<00:06:39.610> we<00:06:39.940> have<00:06:40.060> to<00:06:40.210> quit<00:06:40.480> oh<00:06:40.690> we<00:06:41.050> have

management we have to quit oh we have
keeper<00:06:41.560> 30<00:06:41.980> millimeters<00:06:42.610> right<00:06:42.850> here's<00:06:43.060> for

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
keeper 30 millimeters right here's for

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.540 
keeper 30 millimeters right here's for
the<00:06:43.510> cable<00:06:43.690> management<00:06:43.960> 30<00:06:44.590> rules<00:06:44.800> yeah<00:06:45.160> so

hole right here so for is with the

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.070 
hole right here so for is with the
silicon<00:06:50.440> grauman's<00:06:50.830> mmhmm<00:06:51.460> yeah<00:06:51.550> and<00:06:52.210> let<00:06:52.960> me

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
silicon grauman's mmhmm yeah and let me

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.810 
silicon grauman's mmhmm yeah and let me
put<00:06:53.290> it<00:06:53.380> down<00:06:53.530> I'll<00:06:53.800> be<00:06:53.950> show<00:06:54.130> you<00:06:54.190> the<00:06:54.460> back<00:06:54.670> of

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
put it down I'll be show you the back of

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.900 
put it down I'll be show you the back of
a<00:06:54.940> fan<00:06:55.270> right<00:06:55.540> here<00:06:59.460> yeah<00:07:00.460> this<00:07:00.700> is<00:07:00.850> a

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
a fan right here yeah this is a

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.770 
a fan right here yeah this is a
connector<00:07:01.360> right<00:07:01.540> here<00:07:01.600> so<00:07:02.590> you<00:07:03.400> can<00:07:03.580> put<00:07:03.820> yeah

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
connector right here so you can put yeah

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.020 
connector right here so you can put yeah
for<00:07:05.110> additional<00:07:05.920> friends<00:07:06.130> when<00:07:06.670> you<00:07:06.760> put<00:07:06.940> it

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
this is this is a kind of like a fairing

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.930 
this is this is a kind of like a fairing
controller<00:07:12.400> for<00:07:13.050> the<00:07:14.340> additional<00:07:15.340> fans<00:07:15.760> that

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
controller for the additional fans that

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.390 
controller for the additional fans that
you<00:07:16.000> can<00:07:16.090> still<00:07:16.300> in<00:07:16.420> the<00:07:16.510> case<00:07:16.720> and<00:07:17.500> that<00:07:17.890> can

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
you can still in the case and that can

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.240 
you can still in the case and that can
be<00:07:18.430> controlled<00:07:19.030> by<00:07:19.960> this<00:07:20.620> connector<00:07:21.130> on<00:07:21.220> the

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250
