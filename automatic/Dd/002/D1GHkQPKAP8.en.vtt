00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.070
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.600
 Prefab Store 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.519
 let alone his dot ru in our next 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.380
 video I want to show how 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.600
 beautify it in general movements themselves as 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.500
 painting correctly from 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.230
 balloon ladies things I did not have any 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.110
 blood to the ground but the movements themselves and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.899
 the correctness of opening the torch in general 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.750
 identical when used or when 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.550
 work with the same can only 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.129
 paint means in this case very 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.140
 interesting good example not me 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.140
 going model again mark 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:11.490
 paint black glossy here and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.979
 But before you, but in general, the soil on 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.229
 the black 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.080
 very dan enough in general something rare 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.080
 1500 grit option 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.209
 from the company 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.740
 from the same company as the actual paint 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.739
 means again 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.550
 how do you work with cylinders before 

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:41.069
 How to start painting is desirable 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.800
 cannon just miss the hot water 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:50.060
 maybe ten minutes there and good 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.170
 mix the model itself 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.619
 big and fasten again on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.679
 double-sided tape adhesive tape on the roof 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.140
 in such a way that we can 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:08.630
 it was convenient to turn it around 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.720
 and paint as we feel comfortable again 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.810
 most such a brush 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.230
 antistatic here but today I want 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:24.010
 try such a very interesting method 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.010
 one friend of mine suggested to me 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.370
 how to minimize hit with different 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.890
 dust particles when you work 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.459
 in the usual sample the usual room 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.069
 which can contain dust and all that 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.739
 anything means a way very 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.010
 simple this is an ordinary freshener 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.829
 air in a spray can 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.269
 looking before painting we are now just 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.730
 spray it around our room in 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:19.159
 near here 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:24.280
 models from cylinders are so sprayed here in 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:27.319
 In general, here's a bullet for all we nailed 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.480
 effect we take our irreplaceable 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:37.510
 brush again but doing a few 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.510
 movements to try as much as possible 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:48.980
 clean leave our body because it 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:54.260
 just the very first moment when you need 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.690
 the very beginning to do the right thing 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.560
 no longer correct because all 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:10.510
 corrections inevitably leading to bad 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:14.650
 quality means first 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.510
 open you need to cover click on 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.019
 trigger called so this 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.860
 spray can need not on the model itself 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.479
 just before her and accordingly 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.639
 exercise movement well in this case 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.349
 20 25 centimeters need here on this 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.430
 about a distance to keep but more 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.780
 closer if the hand is already full 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.160
 pass 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.889
 till the very end we will end 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.910
 speak already outside 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:53.080
 models, respectively, try so 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.080
 we will succeed I start from always 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.520
 process the model from below 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.320
 try this case and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:11.710
 work well let's start all the same snow 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:11.710
 everything is like this 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:38.690
 we put a primer not to try to fill in everything 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:48.200
 Immediately also do not forget about the internal 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:55.930
 the part where we have the doorstep and enough I 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.930
 I thought that we could see 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.919
 say that the surface in general 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.330
 almost ideally desirable to work 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.290
 of course in the ventilated room 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.840
 because after all this is enough 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:12.950
 a rare general material which is based 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.169
 gas is based in general, and gas itself 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.659
 paint to dissolve 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:21.039
 in soil based on solvent base 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.039
 sent drying
