00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello my dear pokemon friends and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.290
 Welcome to the announced 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.490
 key talent many of you ask 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.410
 now probably bright as 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 announced key talent for the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 people who follow me on twitter 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.509
 already know about it 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.289
 I've also had it somewhere before 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.720
 differently I believe but for many 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 Is it new today? I am now 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 I do not have a blatant crib here 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.029
 a few points written down as 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.039
 I give you this bowl challenge 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.480
 explain that marcell challenge is the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.899
 new spectators challenge the really 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.120
 this is very simple 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.200
 I think so never gave 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 and in my opinion a pretty 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 interesting project could become first 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.989
 many thanks to otto paul for this 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.070
 krasse logo that she made me 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.780
 that she probably already has 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 in the background and yes 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.079
 Starting today , the key challenge begins 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.190
 so exactly from this time if 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.110
 this as well as online is first of all 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 on twitter has who can ask me 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.489
 Do not just do that over sky 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 The thing is, unfortunately, I just have to 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.210
 Skype if I do that too 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.119
 via twitter facebook i know where 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.670
 about what whatsapp or no idea 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.799
 youtube em would not know 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.790
 then it will just go down everywhere 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.680
 and I simply would not have an overview 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.840
 more and I would just blatantly like that myself 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.189
 make unnecessary stress that I just 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.799
 no longer create this channel 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.700
 do 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.920
 That's why the best conditions are written 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.930
 people skype takes two takes 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 minutes it's really not a big one 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.880
 drama and definitely worth it 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.570
 So soko-ladder platform was there 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 platform n 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.299
 not really but you know what I mean 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.860
 my cool crass and yes that's up 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.740
 in any case the prerequisite because there 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.390
 you have to sign up with me 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.270

 also with exactly five days later 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.970
 more there is not I guess I 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.660
 it should not be 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.760
 be problem and yes the whole will be like that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.940

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.100
 then I say 200 now 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.410
 people there are on it and then look 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.490

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.690

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.720
 he has exactly two minutes time 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.040
 not answered in these two minutes 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.600
 I'm sorry for being the next one 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.740
 but it can still be that here 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.700
 still drive comes so definitely 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.620
 not good 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.550
 It's not that I'm not 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.560
 can separate everyone 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.270
 but I'll come back later 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.920
 First of all, what does that mean? 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.570
 bowl challenge or why is called 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.830
 this key challenge was keyed 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.350
 not much thought soja 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.990
 six times against six we are clear against 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.750
 six clans or new people the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.590
 shots challenge means like me 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.510
 am the key and you have to do that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.450
 Keys get into the challenge 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.400
 to enter and if so if 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.900
 the bowl challenge starts me 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.730
 first with the key phase the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.959
 key phase is following me say 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 now just an example first 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.890
 fight against otto paul otto paul plays 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:31.390
 against me otto paul says to me racer 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.459
 i want to be with you peru andrew ayew or 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.620
 Play audio only these 54 are allowed 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.060
 no agent was no nrw no underground 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.300
 ag no nothing and these five also a f 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.310
 you 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:48.250
 these 50 are allowed and if he says so 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.600
 we play then we play everything 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.250
 there is and everything is a us and pio that 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.080
 is everything allowed if one says ok 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.730
 play audio then we play everything 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.370
 is new and julius wpt he knows it yes 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.650
 and the thing is when Paul loses 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.269
 very out then he is completely out of the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.830
 whole talent was flown out 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.220
 and if he wins, he really is 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.660
 I'll tell you in there because if I 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.880
 key phase is over there are 16 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.850
 people in the school is the one 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.290
 key phase can survive 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.769
 There are 16 people who win me 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.180
 have to 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.229
 and as the key phase complete 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 I will not pass by either 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.290
 Participants accept more completely 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.570
 exactly 16 people 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.310
 if these 16 people are then on 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.710
 then each one goes straight to the key 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.900
 tournament and doing the bowl is easy 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.090
 as follows 16 people and you 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.250
 transgress all against each other at a 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.900
 endless tournament in an instant 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.330
 co-phase against each other 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.690
 The winner of this tournament will be 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.600
 be the master of the keys and have 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.950
 thus won this challenge and then 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.970
 this challenge is for everyone 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.350
 completely over, however, it will open 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.520
 each case a second or even 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.780
 a kick or a fourth phase 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.740
 depending on how long we change this 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.440
 you make fun of the idea 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.960
 pretty cool because it's the challenger 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.070
 I'll quickly made the 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.960
 Record key phase completely live 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.940
 the key tournaments as one says 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.440
 Of you must definitely the camp 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:20.800
 save video and send me and 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.270
 then I'll take this I 'll take it 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.320
 Me as good as it always comes 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.150
 co-moderator in the key tournament 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.640
 and yes, as you said, you have to if yours 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.100
 to send couch so that I can do it all 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.210
 can also record 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.430
 and the winner as I said is the 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.800
 master the key and has the chance 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.720
 his title in the second phase, then 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.810
 in the second season, I 'll say yes 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.400
 defend because in the second season 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.600
 So it would be that only 15 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.370
 people come to the tournament because of 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.270
 Master of shots automatically 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.590
 is qualified for 16 so for 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.560
 the fisherman will automatically play 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.410
 qualify directly in it 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.490
 and yes well I guess this is it 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.930
 have been far first 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.790
 if you have any questions are open 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.620
 or she likes to write in the 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.610
 Comments 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.980
 I am sure I have determined 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.000
 forget something and if I am today 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.410

 Klaus and the castle is active and yes 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.180
 but as I said you can do it all again 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.280
 and read in the description 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.870
 there are no specific teams in the 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.560

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.450
