00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.670
 the heart rate monitors help us control 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.500
 the intensity of the training 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.889
 knowing that heart rate are 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.720
 you have in every moment you know what 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.710
 intensity you should go in each session of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.660
 training 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.540
 if you have to do a job for 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.460
 example there is continuous career there 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.360
 more incidence of aerobic capacity 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.880
 you have to go to a few beats of 65 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.400
 or 70 percent 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.880
 there are a lot of variety of heart rate monitors in 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.880
 the market 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.220
 and what I'm going to show you is the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.230
 most used and consisting of a 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.970
 receiver that is the watch and an emitter that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.720
 captures your heart rate 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.300
 heart with a ribbon that is placed at the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.730
 height of the chest that controls in the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.430
 heart rate of your heart will 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:09.470
 place this piece on the ribbon 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.220
 by means of square brackets 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.970
 before placing is very important to 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.840
 moisten the electrodes because otherwise 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.130
 there is a good connection and it does not capture well 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.509
 the heart rate 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.509
 the tape is placed 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 around the body 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.990
 below the breastplate to get 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.990
 okay the heart rate 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.090
 by means of this contraption we can go 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.520
 seeing both the heart rate that 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.399
 we have in each moment then 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.860
 depending on the model that of the heart rate monitor 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.689
 that we have can be divided by zones 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.939
 if for example we want to do a job 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.899
 aerobic will tell us that we are in a 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.969
 determined area and if we are doing 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.979
 an anaerobic work where there is no 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.899
 presence of oxygen means that 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.370
 we are giving more intensity and we will be 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.130
 using the will be in another area 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.530
 different it is important to control these 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.200
 zones to know if you're doing a 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.160
 correct training or no zones 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.380
 heart rate monitors that mark us make 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.150
 reference to the capacity that you're 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.069
 working at every moment if by 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.500
 example is a day that you are going to do 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.630
 continuous race is within an area 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.660
 in which is a low intensity a 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.269
 trot softly and does not rise much 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.880
 pulsations if another day you are going to make a 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.100
 series work is more intense the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.510
 heart rate is higher then 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.680
 will belong to others 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.650
 the different one there are some pulsometers that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.590
 record the data made during 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.290
 each training session 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.700
 there are some besides that include the gps 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.410
 inside the device itself then after 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.110
 of having done the exercise and for 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.080
 have an accounting to post 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:18.209
 better all the training can be 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.370
 enter into several sections and there 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.620
 record all the training all 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.620
 sessions held a week or month
