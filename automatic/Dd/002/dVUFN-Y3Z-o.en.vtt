00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050 
bogged down in losses is common and it's
natural<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.500> mostly<00:00:20.039> due<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.369> humans

losing<00:00:32.130> low<00:00:32.309> games<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.850> something<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.600> don't

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
practice it doesn't quite work that way

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.319 
practice it doesn't quite work that way
because<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.010> doesn't<00:00:38.040> equip<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:38.910> any<00:00:39.210> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329

the tools necessary to prevent these
losses<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.300> results<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.379> two

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
losses this results in one of two

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.740 
losses this results in one of two
outcomes<00:00:44.129> either<00:00:44.789> you'll<00:00:45.090> avoid<00:00:45.420> games

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
outcomes either you'll avoid games

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.209 
outcomes either you'll avoid games
altogether<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.800> don't<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
altogether because you don't want to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
altogether because you don't want to
risk<00:00:47.370> losing<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:47.969> you'll<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.690> frustrated

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
risk losing or you'll be so frustrated

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
risk losing or you'll be so frustrated
when<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> play<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.039> you'll<00:00:50.160> feel<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when you play and you'll feel like the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.729 
when you play and you'll feel like the
odds<00:00:51.000> are<00:00:51.300> against<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.500> course

odds are against you and of course
ironically<00:00:53.370> neither<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.850> these<00:00:53.969> things

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ironically neither of these things

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
ironically neither of these things
really<00:00:54.510> address<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> core<00:00:55.320> problems<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
really address the core problems and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
really address the core problems and
neither<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.699> beneficial<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.660> progress

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
as a league player in fact they are both

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.049 
as a league player in fact they are both
quite<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.109> opposite<00:01:01.649> focusing<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.760> past

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
quite the opposite focusing on your past

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.840 
quite the opposite focusing on your past
is<00:01:03.300> only<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.809> useful<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> tool<00:01:04.589> for

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
is only really useful as a tool for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.130 
is only really useful as a tool for
reflection<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.939> unfortunately<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.020> don't

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
reflection and unfortunately you don't

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510 
reflection and unfortunately you don't
really<00:01:07.320> tend<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.650> use<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
really tend to use it in that way you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.160 
really tend to use it in that way you
don't<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.939> focus<00:01:09.270> more<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> emotional

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
don't to focus more on the emotional

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
don't to focus more on the emotional
aspects<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.280> influence<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
aspects and it will influence your

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.100 
aspects and it will influence your
future<00:01:12.270> gains<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.869> you'll<00:01:13.049> be

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
future gains because you'll be

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
future gains because you'll be
frustrated<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.400> won't<00:01:14.670> play<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.000> well

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
frustrated and you won't play as well

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
frustrated and you won't play as well
basically<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.170> trying<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.409> say<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
basically what I'm trying to say here is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
basically what I'm trying to say here is
that<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.310> normal<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> focus<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.540> losses

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that it's normal to focus on your losses

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
that it's normal to focus on your losses
and<00:01:18.869> care<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.500> much<00:01:19.619> about<00:01:19.950> them<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> want

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and care so much about them but I want

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.969 
and care so much about them but I want
to<00:01:21.030> inject<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> different<00:01:22.259> perspective<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to inject a different perspective that

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.460 
to inject a different perspective that
it<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.340> actually<00:01:23.610> okay<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> lose<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.930> games

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
first and foremost losses are

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.160 
first and foremost losses are
statistically<00:01:28.189> extremely<00:01:29.189> common<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.880> are

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
statistically extremely common and are

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.330 
statistically extremely common and are
completely<00:01:31.170> inevitable<00:01:31.590> when<00:01:32.189> you're

one and I will link it in the
description<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.799> then<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.130> day<00:03:41.310> there<00:03:41.519> is

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
description and then the day there is

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.699 
description and then the day there is
zero<00:03:41.940> sense<00:03:42.269> worrying<00:03:42.720> about<00:03:42.840> losses<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.560> mean

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
zero sense worrying about losses I mean

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.410 
zero sense worrying about losses I mean
the<00:03:43.799> correct<00:03:44.100> attitude<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.090> want<00:03:45.269> to

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the correct attitude is that you want to

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.870 
the correct attitude is that you want to
win<00:03:45.720> more<00:03:45.959> games<00:03:46.019> not<00:03:46.680> lose<00:03:47.100> less<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:47.670> now

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
win more games not lose less now now

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.190 
win more games not lose less now now
this<00:03:48.030> sounds<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.360> bit<00:03:48.480> silly<00:03:48.720> because<00:03:49.079> it's

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
this sounds a bit silly because it's

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.930 
this sounds a bit silly because it's
kind<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.530> same<00:03:49.709> thing<00:03:50.010> basically<00:03:50.670> what<00:03:50.910> I

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
kind of the same thing basically what I

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.280 
kind of the same thing basically what I
mean<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.450> want<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.630> focus<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:52.170> your

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
mean is that you want to focus on your

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.050 
mean is that you want to focus on your
good<00:03:52.440> things<00:03:52.680> focus<00:03:53.400> on<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.579> stuff<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.910> need
