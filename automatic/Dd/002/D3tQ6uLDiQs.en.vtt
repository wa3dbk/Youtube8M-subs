 very good guys good let's start 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.669
 for the installation of the games but a 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.090
 long before we start we have to have 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:24.430
 the morton that is this program and the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.290
 vote order is what we're going to 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.730
 run on what we are going to download 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.750
 now 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.489
 ok if we have those two programs if 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.770
 you do not have it in the description would have 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.930
 a link to take to download it and 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.070
 plus 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.850
 we go to the link that will be called link of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.030
 download and entail here and here 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.080
 we downloaded what would be the file 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 torrent allen we download it and once 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.900
 downloaded would let us this file what 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.110
 same 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.710
 well as I said this is a file 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.130
 torrent is missing the author and once 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.130

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.080
 once downloaded the files by 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.270

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.130
 download vais voucher to the folder 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.440

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.200
 folder and we will have all these files 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.630

 once extracted from enlisting times of 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.430

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.220

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.690
