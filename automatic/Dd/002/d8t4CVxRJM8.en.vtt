00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
the jar instead of mixing it so I'm

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.260 
the jar instead of mixing it so I'm
going<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.050> pour<00:00:32.230> in<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.950> buttermilk

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
making sure to catch the pips with my

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.910 
making sure to catch the pips with my
hands<00:00:55.870> cuz<00:00:56.110> you<00:00:56.200> don't<00:00:56.290> want<00:00:56.500> those<00:00:56.620> in<00:00:56.680> there

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
hands cuz you don't want those in there

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.680 
hands cuz you don't want those in there
so<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.400> final<00:00:57.700> step<00:00:57.880> I'm<00:00:58.090> just<00:00:58.300> gonna<00:00:58.390> put<00:00:58.600> in

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
so the final step I'm just gonna put in

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.410 
so the final step I'm just gonna put in
a<00:00:58.840> little<00:00:59.050> bit<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.590> salt<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.700> little<00:01:01.090> bit<00:01:01.360> of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
a little bit of salt and a little bit of

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.770 
a little bit of salt and a little bit of
pepper<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.870> shut<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.800> lid<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.689> is

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
pepper to shut the lid and then it is

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.380 
pepper to shut the lid and then it is
shaking<00:01:05.049> time<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.920> think<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:06.610> might<00:01:06.939> go<00:01:07.119> quite

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390
