00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
in you need to cute the harddrive hotter

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.150 
in you need to cute the harddrive hotter
I<00:01:19.070> would<00:01:19.280> come<00:01:20.000> out<00:01:20.120> like<00:01:20.300> this<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.140> you<00:01:22.040> need

to remove the connector very gently and
here<00:01:25.220> is<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.550> hard<00:01:25.760> drive<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.060> is<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.180> SATA<00:01:26.540> 2.5

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
here is the hard drive it is a SATA 2.5

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.980 
here is the hard drive it is a SATA 2.5
inches<00:01:27.770> slim<00:01:28.550> hard<00:01:28.850> drive<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:29.690> need<00:01:29.840> to

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
inches slim hard drive so you need to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.050 
inches slim hard drive so you need to
buy<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.140> similar<00:01:30.440> one<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.490> can<00:01:31.640> upgrade<00:01:31.760> it

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
buy a similar one and you can upgrade it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:46.440 
buy a similar one and you can upgrade it
to<00:01:32.090> one<00:01:32.390> terabyte<00:01:32.570> or<00:01:32.870> so<00:01:33.610> again<00:01:34.610> reconnect
