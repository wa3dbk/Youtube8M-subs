00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.810
 when you see us receiving almost two 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.360
 months only of work 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.060
 I want to be asking you some classes 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.060
 that surprised in some way 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.210
 in conclusions you can get out of town 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.210
 of disk pass was a complete 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.680
 it's a time 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.310
 the story repeats it preparing well 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.970
 actually 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.350
 time will be demonstrating or going 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.350
 discounting because the truth 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.750
 we are going to facts by the case 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.970
 shrink 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.520
 it's not something that says golden that 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.820
 I got here the possibility to 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.380
 impressionism 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:18.850
 English there are truths 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.850
 you really have to receive the reality 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 I think it has always been old 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.100
 values 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.240
 after 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.240
 but people 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 it states 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 so 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.980
 2012 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.980
 it is repeated in 2003 where it is activated 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.250
 spatially insectary the lie of 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.590
 still africa system 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.760
 and thing that has to be fixed 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.970
 balance and it has proven commitment 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.440
 directive of the assembly 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:40.590
 readability agent function and 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:40.590
 economic at the level of truth 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.240
 12 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.360
 and says the song and director 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.970
 presenting here 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.710
 an order to the directive so that 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.710
 come from the tests 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.239
 one has marked as favors his 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.239
 management 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.410
 works 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.700
 sometimes walk around the club to 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.750
 really check how the network is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.360
 municipal 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.890
 solid 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.760
 definitely not in the line of 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.760
 Canary sky something positive 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.760
 Y 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.209
 nor the hour 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.209
 but I did not know 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.760
 again 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.030
 there are no rents when I have 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.030
 and now 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 because he has traveled the market not 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.600
 he can die 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:24.000
 we have taken determined 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.000
 situation he wrote 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.280
 a great improvement because there is no capacity 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:43.130
 also called the application after 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.229
 Christ 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.229
 screams leads more journalistic 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.790
 of credit is a board of directors 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.790
 in the diet 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 made 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.860
 details 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.840
 loved ones 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.840
 the description of all 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.249
 they take to you telling you that if you do not 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.550
 paid, they canceled the service 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:42.139
 especially because always 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.600
 in other payments sold 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.880
 so 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:57.289
 which is precisely the pass secretary 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:59.449
 so they can see what a quantity is like 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.139
 visitor of this commission notes that the 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.280
 seer surprises him 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.210
 because there are housing operations 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.260
 two% 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.900
 it is also everything 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.900
 if you are going to talk 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.390
 and time will show what it is 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.000
 possible 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.150
 and still to prove 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.240
 I will see what to walk if really in 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.240
 this stage is only the 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.240
 irresponsible 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:41.380
 basically they are incapable or if there 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.360
 something else 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.570
 when he's a junkie and the wine that 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.570
 OK
