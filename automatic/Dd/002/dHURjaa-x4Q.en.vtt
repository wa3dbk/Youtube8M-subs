00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
bought it now and i think a week after

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.589 
bought it now and i think a week after
the<00:00:14.370> fact<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.759> probably<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.179> good<00:00:15.210> time<00:00:15.570> all

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the fact is probably a good time all

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.859 
the fact is probably a good time all
ready<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.260> give<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> review<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.820> i<00:00:18.300> compare<00:00:18.840> i

want to compare it to my favorite

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.890 
want to compare it to my favorite
foundation<00:00:20.460> which<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.480> natural

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
foundation which is that the natural

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.220 
foundation which is that the natural
effects<00:00:22.199> by<00:00:22.740> cover<00:00:23.010> effects<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> m40

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
effects by cover effects in at the m40

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.439 
effects by cover effects in at the m40
which<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.500> spoke<00:00:25.740> about<00:00:25.980> last<00:00:26.039> week<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.240> want

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
which I spoke about last week and I want

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.330 
which I spoke about last week and I want
to<00:00:27.539> compare<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.349> NARS<00:00:28.560> sheer<00:00:28.650> glow<00:00:28.890> in

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
to compare it to the NARS sheer glow in

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
to compare it to the NARS sheer glow in
Barcelona<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.240> once<00:00:30.810> again<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.260> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
Barcelona and once again it's in a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.410 
Barcelona and once again it's in a
medium<00:00:31.710> color<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.759> i<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
medium color and i think that the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.630 
medium color and i think that the
textures<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.620> compared<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.370> another

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
textures do compared to one another

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.209 
textures do compared to one another
meaning<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.230> medium<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.920> heavy

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
meaning that is about a medium to heavy

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.910 
meaning that is about a medium to heavy
foundation<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.469> sheer<00:00:40.710> glow

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
foundation and this one the sheer glow

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.360 
foundation and this one the sheer glow
foundation<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:42.680> one<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> most<00:00:44.070> popular

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
foundation is one of the most popular

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
foundation is one of the most popular
foundations<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.180> sure<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.600> hear<00:00:45.809> all

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
foundations and I'm sure you hear all

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.810 
foundations and I'm sure you hear all
the<00:00:46.170> Guru's<00:00:46.350> talk<00:00:46.710> about<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> time

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the Guru's talk about it all the time

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.260 
the Guru's talk about it all the time
but<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.110> say<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.250> great<00:00:50.579> reviews<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
but I say it has great reviews for a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.180 
but I say it has great reviews for a
reason<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.719> I'm<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.350> happy<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> picked

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
reason and I'm so so happy that I picked

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.889 
reason and I'm so so happy that I picked
it<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.399> even<00:00:54.090> though<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> price<00:00:54.449> point<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it up even though the price point is a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
it up even though the price point is a
little<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.230> higher<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:56.730> Canada<00:00:57.210> this

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
little bit higher so in Canada this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.060 
little bit higher so in Canada this
foundation<00:00:57.870> goes<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.260> about<00:00:58.350> fifty<00:00:58.800> dollars

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
foundation goes for about fifty dollars

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
foundation goes for about fifty dollars
Canadian<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.910> sephora<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> NARS

counters<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.570> holt<00:01:03.570> renfrew<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> whatnot

and<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> bay<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.729> everything<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and and the bay and everything but I

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.690 
and and the bay and everything but I
really<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:08.070> foundation

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
really really like this foundation

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.100 
really really like this foundation
because<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:09.090> only<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> packaging

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
because not only them is a packaging

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.859 
because not only them is a packaging
pretty<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.430> comes<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.630> very

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
pretty but it comes out in a very

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
pretty but it comes out in a very
buildable<00:01:13.380> foundation<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.520> even<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.240> can

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
buildable foundation so even you can

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.179 
buildable foundation so even you can
keep<00:01:15.630> applying<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.530> heavier<00:01:16.920> coverage

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
keep applying more for heavier coverage

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.060 
keep applying more for heavier coverage
and<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.540> color<00:01:18.780> matches<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.350> skin<00:01:19.409> dead<00:01:19.890> on

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and the color matches my skin dead on

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.240 
and the color matches my skin dead on
and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.250> somewhat

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and I really really like the somewhat

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
and I really really like the somewhat
shimmery<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> would<00:01:24.570> call<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.780> more

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
shimmery so I would call it more

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.190 
shimmery so I would call it more
luminous<00:01:25.590> finish<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> gives<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
luminous finish that it gives you and I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
luminous finish that it gives you and I
don't<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.009> set<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.369> too<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:29.640> loose

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
don't like to set it with too much loose

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
don't like to set it with too much loose
powder<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.439> kind<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
powder because I think that it kind of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.730 
powder because I think that it kind of
negates<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.329> kind<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.720> glowing<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
negates the the kind of glowing look you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499 
negates the the kind of glowing look you
get<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.040> end<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.390> not

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
get at the end and I like that it's not

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
get at the end and I like that it's not
too<00:01:36.780> hokey<00:01:37.049> meaning<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:37.950> don't

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
too hokey meaning that is not they don't

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.950 
too hokey meaning that is not they don't
use<00:01:38.220> big<00:01:38.490> chunks<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.090> glitter<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.840> know

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
use big chunks of glitter like you know

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.510 
use big chunks of glitter like you know

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
without looking like a super heavy heavy

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.650 
without looking like a super heavy heavy
and<00:03:34.900> super<00:03:35.139> powdered<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.849> really<00:03:37.450> like

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
and super powdered up and I really like

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.120 
and super powdered up and I really like
this<00:03:37.810> foundation<00:03:38.319> I<00:03:38.380> don't<00:03:38.590> use<00:03:38.769> very<00:03:38.919> much

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
this foundation I don't use very much

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.120 
this foundation I don't use very much
product<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.700> use<00:03:39.760> maybe<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.169> DAB<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:41.919> I<00:03:41.950> just

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
product I use maybe just a DAB so I just

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.000 
product I use maybe just a DAB so I just
because<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.760> opening<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:43.630> large<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.319> says

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
because the opening is so large it says

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.620 
because the opening is so large it says
shake<00:03:45.250> well<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.790> shake<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.419> know

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
shake well so you shake it you know

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.199 
shake well so you shake it you know
fairly<00:03:47.049> vigorously<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.980> then<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.940> take<00:03:49.060> my

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
fairly vigorously and then I take my

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.479 
fairly vigorously and then I take my
fingertip<00:03:49.660> clean<00:03:50.019> completely<00:03:50.829> wash<00:03:51.010> my<00:03:51.190> hands

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
fingertip clean completely wash my hands

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.789 
fingertip clean completely wash my hands
dab<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.359> top<00:03:52.569> which<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.109> usually<00:03:53.620> had<00:03:53.769> a

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
dab it on the top which is usually had a

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.170 
dab it on the top which is usually had a
little<00:03:53.980> air<00:03:54.099> bubble<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.549> top<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.030> just

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
little air bubble on the top and I just

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.819 
little air bubble on the top and I just
apply<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.720> all<00:03:55.780> over<00:03:55.930> my<00:03:56.290> face<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.500> that's

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
apply that all over my face and that's

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.039 
apply that all over my face and that's
enough<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.030> don't<00:03:58.180> need<00:03:58.480> much<00:03:58.690> foundation

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
enough so I don't need much foundation

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.349 
enough so I don't need much foundation
and<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.440> don't<00:03:59.709> plan<00:03:59.919> on<00:04:00.099> using<00:04:00.280> much<00:04:00.910> more<00:04:01.209> than

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
and I don't plan on using much more than

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.750 
and I don't plan on using much more than
just<00:04:01.389> a<00:04:01.660> fingertip<00:04:02.019> per<00:04:02.829> day<00:04:03.160> because<00:04:03.609> I<00:04:03.700> think

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
just a fingertip per day because I think

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.460 
just a fingertip per day because I think
that<00:04:04.000> always<00:04:04.419> having<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.930> little<00:04:05.139> bit<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.260> your

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
that always having a little bit of your

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.240 
that always having a little bit of your
skin<00:04:06.030> having<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.120> great<00:04:07.389> healthy<00:04:08.250> balanced

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
skin having a great healthy balanced

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.839 
skin having a great healthy balanced
skin<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.750> very<00:04:10.810> important<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.889> I<00:04:12.609> don't

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
skin is is very important and I don't

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.339 
skin is is very important and I don't
think<00:04:13.150> it's<00:04:13.299> important<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.720> cover<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:14.139> all<00:04:14.319> up

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
think it's important to cover it all up

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.830 
think it's important to cover it all up
entirely<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.370> if<00:04:15.489> you're<00:04:15.640> younger<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.239> you

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
entirely and if you're younger and you

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.449 
entirely and if you're younger and you
know<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.079> your<00:04:17.109> early<00:04:17.440> 20s<00:04:17.859> or<00:04:17.919> whatever<00:04:18.190> I

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
know in your early 20s or whatever I

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.159 
know in your early 20s or whatever I
think<00:04:18.969> that<00:04:19.120> less<00:04:19.329> foundation<00:04:19.810> is<00:04:19.900> always

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
think that less foundation is always

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:20.789 
think that less foundation is always
more<00:04:20.380> because

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
more because

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.309 
more because
don't<00:04:21.129> think<00:04:21.489> it's<00:04:21.639> necessary<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.210> just<00:04:23.050> cake

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:23.319 
don't think it's necessary to just cake

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.379 
don't think it's necessary to just cake
over<00:04:23.680> all<00:04:24.039> of<00:04:24.250> your<00:04:24.370> skin<00:04:24.669> so<00:04:24.879> you<00:04:24.970> can't<00:04:25.270> see

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
over all of your skin so you can't see

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.119 
over all of your skin so you can't see
your<00:04:25.509> skin<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.810> me<00:04:25.930> underneath<00:04:26.440> anymore<00:04:26.889> like

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:27.129 
your skin and me underneath anymore like

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.999 
your skin and me underneath anymore like
I<00:04:27.220> don't<00:04:27.280> think<00:04:27.550> that's<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.060> very<00:04:28.710> healthy<00:04:29.710> way

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
I don't think that's a very healthy way

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.740 
I don't think that's a very healthy way
for<00:04:30.250> your<00:04:30.370> skin<00:04:30.669> either<00:04:30.819> if<00:04:31.240> you're<00:04:31.509> just

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
for your skin either if you're just

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.080 
for your skin either if you're just
going<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.110> work<00:04:32.229> or<00:04:32.440> just<00:04:32.500> going<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:33.009> school<00:04:33.310> so

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
going to work or just going to school so

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.050 
going to work or just going to school so
I<00:04:34.810> think<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:36.039> this<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.430> great<00:04:36.580> foundation

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
I think that this is a great foundation

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.270 
I think that this is a great foundation
I'm<00:04:37.449> really<00:04:37.659> happy<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.169> bought<00:04:38.409> it<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.740> I

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
I'm really happy that I bought it and I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.559 
I'm really happy that I bought it and I
do<00:04:39.340> think<00:04:39.819> that<00:04:39.909> I'll<00:04:40.090> probably<00:04:40.270> need<00:04:40.509> to

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
do think that I'll probably need to

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.710 
do think that I'll probably need to
adjust<00:04:40.780> my<00:04:41.229> skin<00:04:41.560> color<00:04:42.159> my<00:04:43.150> foundation<00:04:43.569> color

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
adjust my skin color my foundation color

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.350 
adjust my skin color my foundation color
to<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.020> little<00:04:44.349> shade<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.860> shade<00:04:45.069> lighter<00:04:45.360> once

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
to a little shade of shade lighter once

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.899 
to a little shade of shade lighter once
my<00:04:46.810> skin<00:04:47.199> starts<00:04:47.500> fading<00:04:47.680> from<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.069> tan<00:04:48.310> so

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
my skin starts fading from the tan so

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.309 
my skin starts fading from the tan so
hopefully<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.509> won't<00:04:49.840> need<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.110> do<00:04:50.289> that

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
hopefully I won't need to do that

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.930 
hopefully I won't need to do that
anytime<00:04:50.740> soon<00:04:51.099> because<00:04:51.250> I'm<00:04:51.400> really<00:04:51.639> attached

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.399 
I don't really want to have to purchase
another<00:05:07.509> one<00:05:07.780> because<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:08.050> is<00:05:08.169> quite

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
another one because it is quite

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.089 
another one because it is quite
expensive<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:10.419> just<00:05:11.379> really<00:05:11.560> like<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.979> way

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
expensive and I just really like the way

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.469 
expensive and I just really like the way
it<00:05:12.219> looks<00:05:12.250> on<00:05:12.520> my<00:05:12.639> skin<00:05:12.879> I<00:05:12.909> like<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.270> way<00:05:13.389> it

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
it looks on my skin I like the way it

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.390 
it looks on my skin I like the way it
feels<00:05:13.539> because<00:05:14.469> it<00:05:14.560> doesn't<00:05:14.590> feel<00:05:14.919> too<00:05:15.129> heavy

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
feels because it doesn't feel too heavy

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.330 
feels because it doesn't feel too heavy
and<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.840> is<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:16.990> little<00:05:17.229> bit<00:05:17.379> moisturizing<00:05:18.099> for

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
and it is a little bit moisturizing for

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.790 
and it is a little bit moisturizing for
my<00:05:18.460> skin<00:05:18.789> it<00:05:19.030> feels<00:05:19.750> kind<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:20.050> like<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.349> mineral

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
my skin it feels kind of like a mineral

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.010 
my skin it feels kind of like a mineral
foundation<00:05:21.190> but<00:05:21.879> it<00:05:22.030> stays<00:05:22.180> on<00:05:22.449> let<00:05:22.659> your<00:05:22.780> skin
