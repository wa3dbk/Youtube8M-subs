conversion<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.630> far<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.680> let's<00:00:23.010> take<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> look

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
conversion so far so let's take a look

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.720 
conversion so far so let's take a look
at<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.619> three<00:00:25.830> SVT<00:00:26.279> ast<00:00:26.939> 185<00:00:27.480> version

at the three SVT ast 185 version
basically<00:00:29.730> engine<00:00:30.269> two<00:00:30.480> liter<00:00:31.520> engines<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
basically engine two liter engines and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.720 
basically engine two liter engines and
gearboxes<00:00:32.730> fully<00:00:33.420> bolt<00:00:33.719> in

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
finish the key box the selectors the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.470 
finish the key box the selectors the
cables

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
cables

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.680

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
now will be to do the wiring system so

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.990 
now will be to do the wiring system so
I'm<00:00:52.089> gonna<00:00:52.350> install<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.559> factory<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.940> the

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
I'm gonna install the factory in the

small out so I'm going to use the
standard<00:02:21.470> standard<00:02:22.470> integral<00:02:22.920> off<00:02:23.130> for<00:02:23.370> now

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
standard standard integral off for now

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.550 
standard standard integral off for now
get<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.050> standard<00:02:25.560> engine<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:28.170> my

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
