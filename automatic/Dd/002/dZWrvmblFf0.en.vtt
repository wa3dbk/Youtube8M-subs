about<00:00:11.429> still-life<00:00:12.269> pencil<00:00:12.780> sketches<00:00:13.230> for

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
about still-life pencil sketches for

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.240 
about still-life pencil sketches for
beginners<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:15.330> best<00:00:15.630> way<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
beginners the best way to do that is to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.599 
beginners the best way to do that is to
just<00:00:17.670> grab<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.180> any<00:00:18.660> final<00:00:18.990> objects<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.920> would

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
just grab like any final objects I would

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.769 
just grab like any final objects I would
suggest<00:00:20.820> grabbing<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:22.130> cylinder<00:00:23.130> shape<00:00:23.359> jar<00:00:24.359> um

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
suggest grabbing a cylinder shape jar um

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.910 
suggest grabbing a cylinder shape jar um
and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.640> maybe<00:00:26.910> something<00:00:27.449> circular

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
and then like maybe something circular

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.799 
and then like maybe something circular
so<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.390> get<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> different<00:00:31.170> variation<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
so to get like a different variation of

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.580 
so to get like a different variation of
shapes<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.260> then<00:00:35.540> composing<00:00:36.540> them<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
shapes and then composing them in a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.700 
shapes and then composing them in a
simple<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.760> table<00:00:39.410> another<00:00:40.410> thing

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
simple way on your table another thing

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
simple way on your table another thing
that<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.010> want<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.030> light

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
that you want to think about is light

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
that you want to think about is light
source<00:00:42.750> where<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.590> light<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.100> directly

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
source where your light is directly

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.029 
source where your light is directly
coming<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.590> talk<00:00:46.800> about

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
coming from so that you can talk about

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.540 
coming from so that you can talk about
shadows<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.450> things<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.930> nature<00:00:49.550> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
shadows and things of that nature the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
shadows and things of that nature the
first<00:00:50.850> thing<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.360> started<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.899> doing<00:00:51.930> was

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
first thing that I started out doing was

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.180 
first thing that I started out doing was
actually<00:00:53.570> thinking<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.930> looking<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
actually thinking about looking at the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.990 
actually thinking about looking at the
shapes<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.840> everything<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.820> be

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
shapes of of everything so this would be

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
shapes of of everything so this would be
like<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> circular<00:01:00.989> shape<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> lid<00:01:01.980> part

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
like a circular shape for the lid part

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.800 
like a circular shape for the lid part
and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.750> shape<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
and then this shape is kind of like a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.920 
and then this shape is kind of like a
rectangular<00:01:06.810> shape<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.600> vertical

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
rectangular shape in a vertical

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.719 
rectangular shape in a vertical
direction<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.860> drawing<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> box<00:01:12.330> like

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
direction so drawing like a box like

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.030 
direction so drawing like a box like
think<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> box<00:01:16.130> for<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.400> part<00:01:18.979> like<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
think of a box for this part like a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.039 
think of a box for this part like a
basic<00:01:21.560> box<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.549> has<00:01:23.759> four<00:01:24.119> sides<00:01:24.560> one<00:01:25.560> two

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
basic box so it has four sides one two

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.580 
basic box so it has four sides one two
three<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:29.390> then<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> other<00:01:30.750> side<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.350> be

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
three and then the other side would be

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.100 
three and then the other side would be
right<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.900> your

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
right here and then so you have your

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.999 
right here and then so you have your
circle<00:01:35.329> you<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.509> another<00:01:36.869> circle<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.560> top<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
circle you have another circle on top of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.789 
circle you have another circle on top of
that<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.400> sides<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.290> then<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
that you have your sides and then you

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490 
that you have your sides and then you
know<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> label<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.210> looks<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
know for the label that looks like a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
know for the label that looks like a
basic<00:01:47.159> square<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.820> creating<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.450> square<00:01:52.189> on<00:01:53.189> top

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
basic square so creating a square on top

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
basic square so creating a square on top
of<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.259> rectangular<00:01:55.490> shape

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.120 

next<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.469> have<00:02:02.500> your<00:02:03.399> circular<00:02:04.149> palette

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
next you have your circular palette

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:17.870 
next you have your circular palette
which<00:02:06.130> can<00:02:06.460> go<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:07.210> know<00:02:07.390> maybe<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.349> here

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.000 

so<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.180> really<00:02:19.269> about<00:02:19.840> putting<00:02:20.410> shapes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
so it's really about putting shapes

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.390 
so it's really about putting shapes
inside<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.970> shapes<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.690> there's<00:02:23.650> one<00:02:23.920> circle

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
inside of shapes so there's one circle

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.940 
inside of shapes so there's one circle
there<00:02:24.700> then<00:02:25.300> there's<00:02:25.569> an<00:02:25.780> outer<00:02:26.140> circle<00:02:26.530> which

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
there then there's an outer circle which

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.680 
there then there's an outer circle which
is<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:28.060> lid<00:02:28.390> that's<00:02:29.349> creating<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.519> sense<00:02:31.510> of

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
is your lid that's creating a sense of

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.949 
is your lid that's creating a sense of
depth<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.110> see<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.650> there's<00:02:35.860> an<00:02:36.069> inside

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
depth so you see that there's an inside

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.910 
depth so you see that there's an inside
part<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.349> lid

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
part of the lid

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.289 
part of the lid
and<00:02:39.900> then<00:02:40.900> for<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.530> cylinder<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.510> tube<00:02:43.840> like

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
and then for the cylinder the tube like

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.530 
and then for the cylinder the tube like
the<00:02:46.299> tube<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:48.069> was<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:51.540> triangular

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the tube this was like a a triangular

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:03.720 
the tube this was like a a triangular
shape<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:01.230> then<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.470> have<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.709> circular<00:03:03.190> shape

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
shape and then you have a circular shape

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.610 
shape and then you have a circular shape
at<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.269> tip<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:06.930> then<00:03:07.930> another<00:03:08.260> circular

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
at the tip and then another circular

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.990 
at the tip and then another circular
shape<00:03:09.160> for<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:12.630> actual<00:03:13.630> top<00:03:14.049> part<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:15.010> so

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
shape for the actual top part of it so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.860 
shape for the actual top part of it so
it's<00:03:16.150> all<00:03:16.359> about<00:03:17.400> simplifying<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.329> shapes<00:03:19.660> of

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
it's all about simplifying the shapes of

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.379 
it's all about simplifying the shapes of
each<00:03:20.139> object<00:03:20.609> within<00:03:21.609> themselves<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.269> you

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
each object within themselves so you
