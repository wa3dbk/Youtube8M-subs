we<00:00:27.260> knew<00:00:27.470> when<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:28.039> increase<00:00:28.400> your<00:00:28.670> muscle

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850

muscle tissue reduces cortisol and we'll

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.190 
muscle tissue reduces cortisol and we'll
talk<00:00:53.120> about<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:53.450> a<00:00:53.600> second

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
talk about that in a second

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.110 
talk about that in a second
but<00:00:54.410> two<00:00:54.649> huge<00:00:55.039> problems<00:00:55.309> with<00:00:55.550> cyclists<00:00:56.090> that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
but two huge problems with cyclists that

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.090 
but two huge problems with cyclists that
need<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.690> be<00:00:56.719> addressed<00:00:56.960> or<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.710> guys<00:00:57.860> have<00:00:58.010> to

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
need to be addressed or you guys have to

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.590 
need to be addressed or you guys have to
have<00:00:58.190> less<00:00:58.370> liquid<00:00:58.670> carbohydrates<00:00:59.239> and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
have less liquid carbohydrates and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360 
have less liquid carbohydrates and
understand<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:00.500> you're<00:01:00.620> on<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.800> bike<00:01:00.980> you

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
understand that you're on the bike you

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.740 
understand that you're on the bike you
need<00:01:01.550> liquid<00:01:01.820> carbohydrates<00:01:02.360> then<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:02.660> I'm

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
need liquid carbohydrates then and I'm

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.139 
need liquid carbohydrates then and I'm
fine<00:01:02.989> with<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:03.519> post-workout<00:01:04.519> if<00:01:05.059> you

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
fine with that but post-workout if you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.550 
fine with that but post-workout if you
don't<00:01:05.269> really<00:01:05.389> need<00:01:05.630> liquid<00:01:06.020> carbohydrates

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
don't really need liquid carbohydrates

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.459 
don't really need liquid carbohydrates
this<00:01:07.039> theory<00:01:07.579> that<00:01:07.789> you<00:01:08.329> want<00:01:08.539> to<00:01:08.659> get

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
glycogen synthesis so you want to have

to store carbohydrates better because it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:42.940

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
to understand that our body doesn't just

to understand that our body doesn't just
need<00:02:04.969> salt<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.389> potassium

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899

it needs a variety of other electrolytes
it<00:02:08.420> needs<00:02:08.629> things<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:08.959> manganese<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.310> means

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
it needs things like manganese it means

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.890 
it needs things like manganese it means
things<00:02:10.759> like<00:02:10.909> calcium<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.540> these<00:02:11.689> things

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
things like calcium and these things

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.569 
things like calcium and these things
like<00:02:12.049> magnesium<00:02:12.409> there's<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.159> lot<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.489> other

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
like magnesium there's a lot of other

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:14.430 
like magnesium there's a lot of other
electrolytes<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.180> are

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
electrolytes that are

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.530 
electrolytes that are
NEADS<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:15.730> only<00:02:15.850> focus<00:02:16.210> on<00:02:16.300> proper

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
NEADS so we only focus on proper

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.090 
NEADS so we only focus on proper

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
electrolytes but not just during the

electrolytes but not just during the
ride<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.850> actually<00:02:19.150> be<00:02:19.270> more<00:02:19.570> beneficial<00:02:20.050> to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
ride you actually be more beneficial to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.830 
ride you actually be more beneficial to
three<00:02:20.680> hours<00:02:20.980> before<00:02:21.130> your<00:02:21.400> cycle<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.240> get<00:02:22.600> a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
three hours before your cycle to get a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.450 
three hours before your cycle to get a
good<00:02:23.290> amount<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.590> electrolytes<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.190> men

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
good amount of electrolytes in men

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.550 
good amount of electrolytes in men
because<00:02:25.060> electrolytes<00:02:25.510> are<00:02:25.630> stored<00:02:25.960> in

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
because electrolytes are stored in

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.380 
because electrolytes are stored in
muscle<00:02:26.950> cells<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.580> if<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.760> muscle<00:02:28.060> cell<00:02:28.180> has

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
muscle cells and if a muscle cell has

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.330 
muscle cells and if a muscle cell has
electrolytes<00:02:28.870> before<00:02:29.230> activity<00:02:29.710> it'll<00:02:30.250> be

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
electrolytes before activity it'll be

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.240 
electrolytes before activity it'll be
more<00:02:30.520> efficient<00:02:31.380> anti<00:02:32.380> cortisol<00:02:32.800> nutrition

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
more efficient anti cortisol nutrition

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.280 
more efficient anti cortisol nutrition
and<00:02:33.400> why<00:02:33.910> cortisol<00:02:34.450> because<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:34.900> stress

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and why cortisol because these stress

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.100 
and why cortisol because these stress
hormone<00:02:35.680> cycle<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.390> high<00:02:37.510> intensity<00:02:37.990> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
hormone cycle it is high intensity it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.360 
hormone cycle it is high intensity it
points<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:38.590> for<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> most<00:02:38.890> part<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.310> not

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
points but for the most part it is not

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.070 
points but for the most part it is not
and<00:02:40.060> I'm<00:02:40.210> not<00:02:40.330> saying<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.750> any

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
and I'm not saying that any

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.650 
and I'm not saying that any
disrespectful<00:02:41.770> but<00:02:41.940> when<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.210> these<00:02:43.330> long

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
disrespectful but when you do these long

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.810 
disrespectful but when you do these long
bouts<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.230> activity<00:02:44.350> your<00:02:45.100> body<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.490> gonna

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
bouts of activity your body is gonna

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.130 
bouts of activity your body is gonna
release<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.240> stress<00:02:46.450> hormone<00:02:46.720> cortisol

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
release the stress hormone cortisol

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.690 
release the stress hormone cortisol
which<00:02:47.290> breaks<00:02:47.500> down<00:02:47.620> muscle<00:02:47.800> tissue<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.430> we

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
which breaks down muscle tissue so we

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.370 
which breaks down muscle tissue so we
