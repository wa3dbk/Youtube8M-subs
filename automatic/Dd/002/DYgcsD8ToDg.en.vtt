00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.760
 There were flowers for in this Olic before the match against Cologne and a lot of live from 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.890
 the ranks and that is quite remarkable it eventually happens 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.729
 not that a player who changes to FC Bayern 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.829
 to be celebrated by their own fans is pure game ninth minute tee off from 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.550
 Cologne goalkeeper Thomas Kessler brings the ball on calls and there is indeed running 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.510
 he praised Vettel a first shot on goal 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.939
 First, Cologne should look ahead 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 for the HSV 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.720
 Cologne Seitz 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.460
 I give games on Wednesday, I get it right trouble again 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790
 Melle missed the ball 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.740
 BenjamÃ­n loses the duel he makes last with Aline the 1 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.090
 0-leadership 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.010
 For the guests 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.280
 before, everyone had only Ohta Redelfs HSV 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.560
 the Solar Charger in the first half no pace no ideas 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.110
 no precision until now threatens opportunities before the break 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.110
 Example Mark Williams are 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
 Service nothing 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.200
 survived on the man all talked better before the game and I in the first 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.140
 Passing ready to use 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.680
 but with little ball contacts and many more 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.100
 CDs are 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.360
 it might have been with him in Hamburg but not one 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.460
 Guest list that we did not even play a few second round hour 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.340
 the first FC Cologne 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.899
 not paying attention Albert Streit on his own penalty area lets the ball 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.899
 Women in front 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.290
 the strengthening 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.580
 so what we have to chance in 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.939
 like to weaken 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.579
 Herti but symptomatic Albert Streit is once again a chance from the beginning 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.340
 they did not use that or something like that looked like Prince of Wales 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.049
 Lanig 64 The Minutes gives corner kick for HSV by substitute Koch 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.800
 Cristal Ann must have looked back for a break 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.360
 and then again 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.770
 Percent go out 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.710
 and the Royce Matthei are 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.710
 64 minutes the very first scoring chances 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.689
 the hamburger 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.939
 three points ahead of BVB qualifying for the Europa League 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 she was in danger of HSV slowly panic 68 she again Trochowski whether the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.549
 Mel honored with 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.899
 big chance 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.749
 comes from the background 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.819
 and there has 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.909
 Cologne defense of course gives Hannspree Jerome l 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.329
 the dream couple is oriented the way 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.909
 the percent who it was and still the hamburger continues black 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.939
 Example the loyalty 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.839
 also substituted with this raw material 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.909
 88 percent of the game time times one of the rare Cologne counter-XXI 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.469
 and that was the goal scorer finished 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.559
 but it will not flee with anything 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.829
 fourth goal of the season for the Frenchman Cologne, he makes little progress 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.349
 was limited to defending 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.989
 she also runs out 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:04.420
 away from the gate and this was the last chance for HSV in 28 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.530
 Steinheim play probably the worst performance 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.940
 This season's three big chances throughout the game was a disaster 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.009
 and therefore a very bitter farewell for 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:17.569
 OLED stand 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.909
 in the sold out house was still celebrated
