 villarrosa is 100 years old and opened 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.640
 like an Andalusian house and since then 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.290
 it has not stopped being a stage 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.220
 formerly what was the time of the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.640
 singing cafes 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.490
 villarrosa has what it is right now 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.620
 the most emblematic place of flamenco 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.650
 there is a place in all spain that has 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.080
 more flamenco history than its walls 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.479
 have seen so much because by villa rosa 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.880
 Well, all the figures have passed 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.510
 of the golden age of flamenco and 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 even a pretty enough time 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.430
 highlight is the time when it was 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.710
 don antonio chacón singing in front 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.360
 also the artistic direction was 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.600
 zebra for queen 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.300
 joanito valderrama that is to say the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.160
 Flamenco's greatest figures have 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.380
 a very great story over here has 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.720
 passed from cousin of ribera the king 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.320
 alfonso 13 the one who had a relationship 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.479
 quite close with the local even 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.580
 there are legends that the royal palace 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.320
 communicated villarrosa with a 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:14.300
 catwalk have passed Sunday bullfighters 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.120
 ava gardner hemingway a lot of people and 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.780
 it is still happening what happens that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.580
 maybe because today he is given another 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.440
 value to art and I do not know I do not know there's no that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.040
 palate that was formerly not for 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.410
 for to appreciate or to taste 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.810
 certain certain things but it's still happening 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.730
 people known people popular people 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.980
 known from the world of television 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.050
 society if not from the point of 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.160
 gastronomic view 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.350
 you can ride a wide menu of 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.090
 tapas one of the specialties of the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.740
 home also the cocido madrileño the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.770
 paella also that makes it our 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.990
 very good cook and we have also 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:03.560
 well enough commercial offer for 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.060
 practically all the whole world does not 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.710
 they make presentations of events 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.110
 product presentations 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.840
 we work a lot with groups with agencies 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.430
 tour operators and then also with people 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.130
 from street level which is what it does 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.640
 also that this stage has recovered 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.710
 Spanish public which for now 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.290
 a few years then he had stopped 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.710
 frequent the flamenco tablados 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.960
 because they were or still are some 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.060
 not a little more focused on what is the 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.780
 tourism and not so much to their own 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.780
 Spanish not 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.729
