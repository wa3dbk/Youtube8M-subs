00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
your map you have the the tree in the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.170 
your map you have the the tree in the
iron<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.409> metal<00:01:50.060> or<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.180> the

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
tree will fall down in the metal will

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.270 
tree will fall down in the metal will
stay<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.130> wall<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.880> let's<00:02:03.210> try<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:04.280> roll

stay on the wall so let's try here roll
down<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.060> hit<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> flag<00:02:07.399> level<00:02:08.399> successfully

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
down and hit the flag level successfully

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.250 
down and hit the flag level successfully
completed<00:02:09.780> next<00:02:10.200> level<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.879> yeah<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.260> first

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
