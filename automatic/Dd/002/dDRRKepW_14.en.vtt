braided stuff for casting for fish and I
don't<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.579> pretty<00:01:02.730> good<00:01:02.910> but

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
don't know it's it's pretty good but

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
don't know it's it's pretty good but
let's<00:01:03.210> let's<00:01:03.480> key<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.559> exciting

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
let's let's key on this this is exciting

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
let's let's key on this this is exciting
this<00:01:05.430> line<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.760> far<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:06.119> concerned<00:01:06.479> so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
this line as far as I'm concerned so

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.880 
this line as far as I'm concerned so
tell<00:01:07.260> us<00:01:07.380> about<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
tell us about it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.609 
tell us about it
suffix<00:01:08.280> 832<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.630> first<00:01:09.960> braid<00:01:10.350> that

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
suffix 832 is the first braid that

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.640 
suffix 832 is the first braid that
incorporates<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.610> single<00:01:12.479> strand<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> gore<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
incorporates a single strand of gore the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950 
incorporates a single strand of gore the
fiber<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> brain<00:01:15.360> yeah

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
fiber in in the brain yeah

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.100 
fiber in in the brain yeah
so<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.500> eight<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.070> 832<00:01:17.640> stands<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.540> there's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so the eight the 832 stands for there's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.340 
so the eight the 832 stands for there's
eight<00:01:19.409> strands<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.299> braid<00:01:21.479> 32<00:01:22.049> fixed

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
eight strands in the braid 32 fixed

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
eight strands in the braid 32 fixed
bridge<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.799> there<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.009> seven<00:01:23.369> strands<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
bridge so there are seven strands of a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.570 
bridge so there are seven strands of a
Dyneema<00:01:25.049> fiber<00:01:25.290> yeah<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.100> strand<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
Dyneema fiber yeah and one strand of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.270 
Dyneema fiber yeah and one strand of
gore<00:01:26.790> yeah<00:01:27.270> what's<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> reason<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.500> put<00:01:29.040> four

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
gore yeah what's the reason you put four

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.649 
gore yeah what's the reason you put four
what's<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> reason<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.850> procore<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.479> should

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
what's the reason a procore and I should

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.649 
what's the reason a procore and I should
say<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> advantage<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.570> all<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
say and what is the advantage of all the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
say and what is the advantage of all the
testing<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.409> working<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> scientists

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
testing and working with the scientists

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.499 
testing and working with the scientists
at<00:01:36.060> Gore<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.079> found<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.729> Gore<00:01:38.729> has<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
at Gore what we found is that Gore has a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
at Gore what we found is that Gore has a
natural<00:01:40.049> water<00:01:40.259> resistancy<00:01:40.829> yep<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.880> also

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
natural water resistancy yep it also

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
natural water resistancy yep it also
increases<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> tensile<00:01:43.170> strength<00:01:43.500> because

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
increases the tensile strength because

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.090 
increases the tensile strength because
it<00:01:44.340> reduces<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> amount<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> friction<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it reduces the amount of friction in the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
it reduces the amount of friction in the
life<00:01:47.479> line<00:01:48.479> goes<00:01:48.659> through<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:48.960> guides
