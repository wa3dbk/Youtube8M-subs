00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
to move down longer lengths of material

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.099 
to move down longer lengths of material
that<00:00:05.970> we<00:00:06.090> wish<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.330> join<00:00:06.479> together<00:00:06.840> could<00:00:07.080> be

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
that we wish to join together could be

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.489 
that we wish to join together could be
making<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> big<00:00:07.649> tabletop<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.610> instance<00:00:09.499> the

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:10.499 
making a big tabletop for instance the

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.049 
making a big tabletop for instance the
long<00:00:10.679> bar<00:00:10.919> works<00:00:11.190> exactly<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.669> same<00:00:11.879> as<00:00:11.999> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
long bar works exactly the same as a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.480 
long bar works exactly the same as a
short<00:00:12.299> bar<00:00:12.539> clamp<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.289> in<00:00:13.410> place<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.280> only

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
short bar clamp it in place the only

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.190 
short bar clamp it in place the only
difference<00:00:14.789> with<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.119> my<00:00:15.389> material<00:00:15.869> I'm

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
difference with this is my material I'm

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.160 
difference with this is my material I'm
going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> make<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> shelf<00:00:16.950> here<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.570> material

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
going to make a shelf here the material

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.169 
going to make a shelf here the material
is<00:00:19.289> thicker<00:00:19.529> than<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.920> bar<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.789> I've<00:00:20.910> actually

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
is thicker than the bar so I've actually

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.919 
is thicker than the bar so I've actually
used<00:00:21.529> some<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.679> the<00:00:23.090> spacer<00:00:24.090> tabs<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.720> here

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
used some of the spacer tabs on here

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.950 
used some of the spacer tabs on here
which<00:00:25.050> I'll<00:00:25.199> cover<00:00:25.380> later<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:26.730> Center<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
which I'll cover later to Center it to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
which I'll cover later to Center it to
do<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.919> on<00:00:29.099> my<00:00:29.279> ball<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.730> into

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
do that all we do is on my ball it into

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.849 
do that all we do is on my ball it into
the<00:00:30.210> middle<00:00:30.419> place<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.259> bar<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> center

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the middle place the bar in the center

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.580 
the middle place the bar in the center
of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> wood<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> press<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> excess<00:00:34.230> tabs

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
of the wood and press the excess tabs

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.130 
of the wood and press the excess tabs
down<00:00:34.980> make<00:00:35.730> sure<00:00:35.760> they're<00:00:36.120> equal<00:00:36.510> both<00:00:36.690> sides

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
down make sure they're equal both sides

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.959 
down make sure they're equal both sides
so<00:00:37.710> you've<00:00:37.829> got<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> same<00:00:38.280> number<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.670> spacer

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
so you've got the same number of spacer

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.779 
so you've got the same number of spacer
tabs<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.289> can<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.100> left<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.610> Ledge

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
tabs and you can see it's left a Ledge

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:42.170 
tabs and you can see it's left a Ledge
there

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
there

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.439 
there
well<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.780> ledge<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.520> equal<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> ledge<00:00:45.270> on

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
well that ledge is equal to the ledge on

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.299 
well that ledge is equal to the ledge on
the<00:00:45.629> back<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.199> that's<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.590> Center<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the back so that's how you Center it on

00:00:47.309 --> 00:02:00.130 
the back so that's how you Center it on
any<00:00:47.489> thickness<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.090> wood

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.479 

right<00:02:01.140> we've<00:02:01.349> seen<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.159> move<00:02:02.310> along

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
right we've seen how we can move along

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.279 
right we've seen how we can move along
with<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.849> long<00:02:03.030> bar<00:02:03.299> along<00:02:03.630> any<00:02:03.840> length<00:02:04.140> of

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
with the long bar along any length of

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.410 
with the long bar along any length of
material<00:02:04.890> doesn't<00:02:05.549> make<00:02:05.759> any<00:02:06.000> difference<00:02:06.299> how

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
material doesn't make any difference how

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
material doesn't make any difference how
long<00:02:06.599> it<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.200> index<00:02:07.590> using<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> single

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
long it is we can index using a single

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.420 
long it is we can index using a single
dowel<00:02:08.549> to<00:02:09.119> transfer<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.170> joint<00:02:10.380> genie<00:02:10.709> along

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
dowel to transfer the joint genie along

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.059 
dowel to transfer the joint genie along
the<00:02:11.610> length<00:02:12.319> keep<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> tool<00:02:13.620> between<00:02:13.799> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
the length keep the tool between the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.309 
the length keep the tool between the
joint<00:02:14.310> same<00:02:14.819> as<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> short<00:02:15.390> bar<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.870> let's

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
joint same as with a short bar and let's

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.509 
joint same as with a short bar and let's
offer<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.650> up<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.829> where<00:02:17.130> we're<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.459> to

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
offer it up to where we're going to

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.569 
offer it up to where we're going to
attach<00:02:17.670> our<00:02:18.120> shelf<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.870> wish<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.829> attach<00:02:20.099> it<00:02:20.310> on
