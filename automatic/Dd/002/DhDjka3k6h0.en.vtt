00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.310 
process going and now i will create a
new<00:02:07.680> sound<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.460> just<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.869> in<00:02:09.869> messing<00:02:10.229> around

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
new sound it's just a in messing around

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.700 
new sound it's just a in messing around
on<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> guitar<00:02:10.710> it<00:02:10.979> sort<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.160> different<00:02:11.550> it's

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
on the guitar it sort of different it's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.530 
on the guitar it sort of different it's
concentrating<00:02:13.710> on<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.860> happy<00:02:14.790> accidents<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
concentrating on the happy accidents and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.030 
concentrating on the happy accidents and
the<00:02:15.600> eccentricities<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.830> sort<00:02:16.980> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the eccentricities that just sort of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.980 
the eccentricities that just sort of
occur<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.640> rather<00:02:17.760> than<00:02:17.970> letting<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.660> go<00:02:18.840> by

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
occur and rather than letting that go by

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
occur and rather than letting that go by
as<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> glitch<00:02:19.620> or<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.950> sort<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.280> one-off<00:02:20.880> I'll

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
as a glitch or is sort of a one-off I'll

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.570 
as a glitch or is sort of a one-off I'll
practice<00:02:21.780> something<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.620> were<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.490> know

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
practice something so if I were you know

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.260 
practice something so if I were you know
just<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.330> set<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> delay<00:02:25.350> sort<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.710> random

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
just the set the delay sort of a random

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.880 
just the set the delay sort of a random
setting<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.450> then<00:02:27.540> step<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.410> would<00:02:28.710> sort

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
setting and then step on it would sort

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.220 
setting and then step on it would sort
of<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.100> what<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.340> sign<00:02:29.960> yeah<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:31.080> kind<00:02:31.200> of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
of see what that sign yeah that kind of

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.080 
of see what that sign yeah that kind of
acts<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.410> sort<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.740> slap<00:02:32.070> backe<00:02:32.370> sound<00:02:32.760> so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
acts like sort of a slap backe sound so

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600 
acts like sort of a slap backe sound so
the<00:02:33.390> first<00:02:34.230> thing<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:35.520> it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the first thing you know and then it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.360 
the first thing you know and then it
says<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.360> very<00:02:36.570> very<00:02:36.840> simple<00:02:37.080> setup<00:02:37.440> but

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
says I have a very very simple setup but

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.980 
says I have a very very simple setup but
by<00:02:38.700> sort<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.120> manipulating<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.690> different

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
by sort of manipulating in different

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.720 
by sort of manipulating in different
ways<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.800> what<00:02:40.950> happens<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.430> that's

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
ways we can see what happens so that's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.580 
ways we can see what happens so that's
not<00:02:41.880> kind<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.150> slap<00:02:42.330> back<00:02:42.600> delay<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.380> what<00:02:43.500> if

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
not kind of a slap back delay so what if

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.960 
not kind of a slap back delay so what if
we<00:02:43.650> were<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.800> use<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> toggle<00:02:44.400> switch<00:02:44.820> with

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
we were to use the toggle switch with

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.500 
we were to use the toggle switch with
the<00:02:45.000> slap<00:02:45.330> back<00:02:45.570> late<00:02:45.810> what<00:02:46.020> might<00:02:46.290> occur

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.550 

that's<00:02:54.510> sort<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.690> an<00:02:54.780> interesting<00:02:54.900> whatever

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that's sort of an interesting whatever

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.220 
that's sort of an interesting whatever
then<00:02:55.740> we<00:02:55.860> might<00:02:56.780> see<00:02:57.780> what<00:02:57.900> happens<00:02:58.080> if<00:02:58.170> we

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
then we might see what happens if we

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:08.540 
then we might see what happens if we
click<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> little<00:02:58.770> while<00:03:07.430> alright<00:03:08.430> that's

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
click on a little while alright that's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.490 
click on a little while alright that's
something<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:08.880> might<00:03:09.300> could<00:03:10.140> end<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:10.380> his

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
something that might could end up his

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.340 
something that might could end up his
music<00:03:10.860> down<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.519> line<00:03:11.780> when<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.840> started<00:03:13.200> using

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
music down the line when I started using

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.830 
music down the line when I started using
the<00:03:13.680> toggle<00:03:14.010> switch<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.580> as<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.880> picking

flicking between the two pickups that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.729 
flicking between the two pickups that

the<00:03:47.190> whammy<00:03:47.400> pedal<00:03:47.519> for<00:03:47.849> me<00:03:47.879> was<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.120> was<00:03:48.420> a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
the whammy pedal for me was it was a

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.070 
the whammy pedal for me was it was a
great<00:03:49.159> invention<00:03:50.159> because<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.970> never<00:03:51.420> had<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
great invention because I never had the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.530 
great invention because I never had the
patience<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.310> when<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.459> get<00:03:53.670> your<00:03:53.849> original

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
patience like when you get your original

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.270 
patience like when you get your original
record<00:03:54.870> deal<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> couple<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.860> thousand

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
record deal you get a couple of thousand

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.100 
record deal you get a couple of thousand
dollars<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.670> spend<00:03:56.879> on<00:03:57.000> gear<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.840> everyone

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
dollars to spend on gear so everyone

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.160 
dollars to spend on gear so everyone
