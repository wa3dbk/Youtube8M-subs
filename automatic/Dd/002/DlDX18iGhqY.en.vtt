based<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.630> contraption<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.740> aden<00:00:13.950> i'm

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
based on this contraption of aden i'm

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.350 
based on this contraption of aden i'm
gonna<00:00:14.460> make<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.030> when<00:00:15.210> you're

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
gonna make it so that when you're

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.730 
gonna make it so that when you're
sitting<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.780> car<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.289> you're<00:00:16.440> sitting<00:00:16.590> in

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
sitting in the car and you're sitting in

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.380 
sitting in the car and you're sitting in
your<00:00:16.800> jalopy<00:00:17.160> or<00:00:17.430> whatever<00:00:17.730> car<00:00:17.970> using<00:00:18.300> an

your jalopy or whatever car using an

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.019 
your jalopy or whatever car using an
airboat<00:00:18.660> jeep<00:00:19.250> you'd<00:00:20.250> push<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> specific

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
airboat jeep you'd push a specific

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.599 
airboat jeep you'd push a specific
button<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.420> keyboard<00:00:21.949> i<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.490> you

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
button on your keyboard i use like you

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.859 
button on your keyboard i use like you
space<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> then<00:00:24.210> there's<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.390> hollow<00:00:24.570> emitter

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
space and then there's a hollow emitter

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.200 
space and then there's a hollow emitter
that<00:00:25.019> emits<00:00:25.320> where<00:00:25.590> you're<00:00:25.710> looking<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.210> this

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that emits where you're looking at this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.080 
that emits where you're looking at this
is<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.289> easy<00:00:28.849> except<00:00:29.849> you're<00:00:30.060> not

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
is really really easy except you're not

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150 
is really really easy except you're not
really<00:00:30.359> using<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.929> laser<00:00:31.170> pointer<00:00:31.410> receiver<00:00:31.800> so

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
really using a laser pointer receiver so

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.209 
really using a laser pointer receiver so
i<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.430> ahead<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.610> remove<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.050> in<00:00:34.219> this

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
i can go ahead and remove that in this

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.319 
i can go ahead and remove that in this
one<00:00:35.489> you're<00:00:35.700> using<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.239> pod<00:00:36.630> controller<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> i

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
one you're using a pod controller so i

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.850 
one you're using a pod controller so i
can<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.690> ahead<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.899> remove<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.440> these

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
can go ahead and remove all these

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
can go ahead and remove all these
because<00:00:41.600> i'm<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> mount<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> pretty

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
because i'm going to mount to pretty

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
because i'm going to mount to pretty
much<00:00:43.410> everything<00:00:43.649> back<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.100> onto<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
much everything back up onto here so you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.279 
much everything back up onto here so you
can<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.420> ahead<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.690> why<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.050> wire<00:00:46.200> tool

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
can go ahead your why of your wire tool

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.819 
can go ahead your why of your wire tool
and<00:00:47.510> your<00:00:48.510> hollow<00:00:48.660> mitr<00:00:49.020> i<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.739> whole

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and your hollow mitr i like my whole

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.930 
and your hollow mitr i like my whole
emitter<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.280> usually<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> front<00:00:50.820> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
emitter to usually be in the front of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.600 
emitter to usually be in the front of
the<00:00:51.030> car<00:00:51.590> your<00:00:52.590> hallowed<00:00:52.949> grid<00:00:53.660> up<00:00:54.660> there

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
the car your hallowed grid up there

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.590 
the car your hallowed grid up there
y'all<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> need<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.000> advance<00:00:57.239> pod

easy well done on also don't forget to
put<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.070> weight<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.869> 0.01<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.439> makes<00:01:34.650> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
put the weight on this 0.01 it makes it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.359 
put the weight on this 0.01 it makes it
your<00:01:35.070> life<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.640> much<00:01:35.790> simpler<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.280> ahead

and I can grab the white tulle I even
have<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.659> nope<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.840> better<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
have it nope but better go get that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
have it nope but better go get that
alright<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.310> i<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> way<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> but

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
alright so i don't have the way to but

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.289 
alright so i don't have the way to but
normally<00:01:45.630> we'd<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> weight<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:47.100> 0.01<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
normally we'd put the weight the 0.01 so

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
normally we'd put the weight the 0.01 so
that<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.680> you're<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> old<00:01:49.950> jeep<00:01:50.159> wouldn't<00:01:50.430> do

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that it you're the old jeep wouldn't do

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
that it you're the old jeep wouldn't do
this<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.180> sagging<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:52.290> not

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
our system wired up now we have to go

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.840 
our system wired up now we have to go
wire<00:03:16.600> power<00:03:16.840> jump<00:03:17.109> drive<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.590> yet<00:03:18.430> again<00:03:18.549> we

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
wire power jump drive so yet again we

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.870 
wire power jump drive so yet again we
need<00:03:19.030> an<00:03:19.120> ad<00:03:19.239> chip<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.819> gate<00:03:22.269> chip<00:03:23.880> arithmetic

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880
