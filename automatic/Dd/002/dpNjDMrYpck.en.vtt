the car wash with this car for probably
a<00:05:57.719> year<00:05:57.780> or<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.680> don't<00:05:59.370> know<00:05:59.460> i<00:05:59.789> just<00:05:59.849> had

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
a year or so I don't know i just had

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.820 
a year or so I don't know i just had
sort<00:06:00.599> of<00:06:00.630> bad<00:06:00.780> experience<00:06:01.349> with<00:06:01.469> scratches

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
sort of bad experience with scratches

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.649 
sort of bad experience with scratches
appear<00:06:02.159> in<00:06:02.490> before<00:06:02.820> when<00:06:03.030> i've<00:06:03.120> used<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.449> car

appear in before when i've used a car
wash<00:06:03.870> I<00:06:04.139> think<00:06:04.590> they<00:06:04.680> pick<00:06:04.919> up<00:06:05.130> some<00:06:05.789> bits<00:06:06.030> of

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
wash I think they pick up some bits of

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.140 
wash I think they pick up some bits of
grit<00:06:06.509> you<00:06:06.930> know<00:06:07.080> and<00:06:07.229> dirt<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.880> you<00:06:08.880> know<00:06:09.000> it

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
grit you know and dirt and you know it

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.060 
grit you know and dirt and you know it
affects<00:06:09.509> all<00:06:09.719> comes<00:06:09.990> against<00:06:10.530> the<00:06:10.620> car<00:06:10.800> body

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
affects all comes against the car body

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.399 
affects all comes against the car body
when<00:06:11.849> it's<00:06:12.000> being<00:06:12.180> watched<00:06:12.509> at<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:13.050> going<00:06:13.349> to

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
when it's being watched at is going to

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.700 
when it's being watched at is going to
put<00:06:13.560> a<00:06:13.590> scratch<00:06:13.889> on<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.219> car<00:06:14.250> so<00:06:14.699> I<00:06:14.909> tend<00:06:15.479> to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
put a scratch on the car so I tend to

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.890 
put a scratch on the car so I tend to
prefer<00:06:16.710> to<00:06:16.949> wash<00:06:17.370> my<00:06:17.669> own<00:06:17.699> car<00:06:18.150> from<00:06:18.539> time<00:06:18.750> to

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
prefer to wash my own car from time to

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.589 
prefer to wash my own car from time to
time<00:06:18.960> anyway<00:06:19.469> at<00:06:19.889> least<00:06:20.099> until<00:06:20.310> it's<00:06:20.759> a<00:06:21.389> bit

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599
