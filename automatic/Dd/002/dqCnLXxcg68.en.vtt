00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
thought that if I didn't document it at

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
thought that if I didn't document it at
this<00:00:22.080> point<00:00:22.320> somebody<00:00:23.130> would<00:00:23.310> probably<00:00:23.760> hit

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
this point somebody would probably hit

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
thing i found was this thing here this
is<00:00:43.320> supposed<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.920> centered<00:00:44.879> over<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> leg

is supposed to be centered over the leg
I<00:00:45.870> moved<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> right<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.059> works<00:00:48.480> out

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
I moved it to the right but it works out

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.279 
I moved it to the right but it works out
all<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:49.370> we<00:00:50.370> opened<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.899> I've<00:00:52.020> got

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
all right we opened this up and I've got

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
all right we opened this up and I've got
to<00:00:52.610> go<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> decide<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.960> i'm<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.449> lock<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to go to decide how i'm going to lock it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.189 
to go to decide how i'm going to lock it
in<00:00:57.780> place<00:00:58.820> drill<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> pin<00:01:00.660> likely<00:01:01.109> in

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
in place drill it for a pin likely in

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.799 
in place drill it for a pin likely in
about<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> position<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.629> want

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
about this position here we don't want

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.509 
about this position here we don't want
it<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.350> far<00:01:04.619> over<00:01:04.860> center<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> wait

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it going this far over center the wait

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.050 
it going this far over center the wait
may<00:01:05.729> tip<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> whole<00:01:06.869> thing<00:01:07.170> over<00:01:07.820> but<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
may tip the whole thing over but that

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
may tip the whole thing over but that
will<00:01:09.240> decide<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:10.170> I've<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> refractory

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
will decide when I've got the refractory

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
will decide when I've got the refractory
and<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> weights<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> be

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and so I know if the weights going to be

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.499 
and so I know if the weights going to be
like<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> where<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> burner<00:01:15.030> goes<00:01:15.270> in

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
like this is where the burner goes in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.870 
like this is where the burner goes in

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
so I've just got to put the refractory

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.080 
so I've just got to put the refractory
in<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.989> couple<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.349> stages<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.099> that'll<00:02:13.819> be<00:02:13.940> all

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
in a couple of stages and that'll be all

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.050 
in a couple of stages and that'll be all
done<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.230> only<00:02:15.470> other<00:02:15.500> thing<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.160> changed

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
done the only other thing that I changed

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.240 
done the only other thing that I changed
that<00:02:17.330> really<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:19.510> little<00:02:20.510> bushing<00:02:20.959> here

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
that really is this little bushing here

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.979 
that really is this little bushing here
I've<00:02:22.250> made<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> couple<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.120> these<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.599> put<00:02:23.720> them

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
I've made a couple of these and put them

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.410 
I've made a couple of these and put them
in<00:02:24.440> right<00:02:24.769> in<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.849> this<00:02:27.010> hinge<00:02:28.420> works

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
in right in here so this hinge works

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420 
in right in here so this hinge works
nicely<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.709> these<00:02:30.890> bolts<00:02:31.250> up

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
nicely and I can just do these bolts up

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.220 
nicely and I can just do these bolts up
right<00:02:31.670> tight<00:02:32.000> screw<00:02:32.480> them<00:02:32.630> right<00:02:32.810> into<00:02:32.989> this

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
right tight screw them right into this

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.309 
right tight screw them right into this
piece<00:02:33.560> I'm<00:02:34.400> gonna<00:02:34.580> do<00:02:35.120> all<00:02:35.360> thread<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:35.930> center

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
piece I'm gonna do all thread and center

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.229 
piece I'm gonna do all thread and center
punching<00:02:36.799> it<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.069> sort<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.459> thing<00:02:37.519> don't

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
punching it and that sort of thing don't

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.930 
punching it and that sort of thing don't
have<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.599> do<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.430> could<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.610> do<00:02:40.760> these

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
have to do that I could just do these

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.970 
have to do that I could just do these
right<00:02:41.209> up<00:02:41.360> tight<00:02:41.599> and<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.900> bushings<00:02:42.349> turn

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
right up tight and the bushings turn

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.759 
right up tight and the bushings turn
right<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.459> here<00:02:44.200> well<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.319> worked<00:02:45.590> out

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
right in here well that worked out

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.180 
right in here well that worked out
pretty<00:02:45.829> good<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.290> think<00:02:48.590> I'm<00:02:48.709> just<00:02:48.739> about

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
pretty good so I think I'm just about

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.449 
pretty good so I think I'm just about
ready<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:50.239> put<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.599> refractory<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.650> put

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
ready to put the refractory in and put

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.630 
ready to put the refractory in and put
the<00:02:52.610> burner<00:02:52.819> in<00:02:53.090> here<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.680> lighter<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:55.010> only

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
the burner in here and lighter up only

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.759 
the burner in here and lighter up only
other<00:02:55.760> thing<00:02:55.849> I've<00:02:56.299> got<00:02:57.079> myself<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:58.510> crucible

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
other thing I've got myself a crucible

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.620 
other thing I've got myself a crucible
put<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:01.599> imitation<00:03:02.599> plinth<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.230> here<00:03:04.630> and

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
put the imitation plinth in here and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.449 
put the imitation plinth in here and
it'll<00:03:05.840> go<00:03:06.110> on<00:03:06.140> there<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:07.069> think<00:03:07.280> this

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
it'll go on there and I think this

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.289 
it'll go on there and I think this
crucible<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.269> going<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.540> fit<00:03:10.299> quite

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
crucible is just going to fit quite

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.800 
crucible is just going to fit quite
nicely<00:03:11.410> it'll<00:03:12.410> be<00:03:13.030> that's<00:03:14.030> pretty<00:03:14.269> dark<00:03:14.630> in

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
nicely it'll be that's pretty dark in

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.259 
nicely it'll be that's pretty dark in
there<00:03:15.160> it'll<00:03:16.160> actually<00:03:16.400> sit<00:03:16.850> up<00:03:16.970> higher<00:03:17.239> than

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
there it'll actually sit up higher than

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.420 
there it'll actually sit up higher than
that<00:03:18.400> probably<00:03:19.400> up<00:03:19.700> somewhere<00:03:20.180> about<00:03:20.420> here

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
that probably up somewhere about here

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.099 
that probably up somewhere about here
when<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.639> refractories<00:03:23.389> in<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.750> we've<00:03:23.870> got<00:03:24.079> a

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
when the refractories in and we've got a

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:34.000 
when the refractories in and we've got a
Plimpton<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:26.889> okay<00:03:32.350> guess<00:03:33.350> that's<00:03:33.620> about<00:03:33.799> all

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
Plimpton it okay guess that's about all

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.949 
Plimpton it okay guess that's about all
there<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.609> see<00:03:34.819> with<00:03:35.060> that<00:03:35.269> pretty<00:03:35.690> simple

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
there is to see with that pretty simple

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.940 
there is to see with that pretty simple
huh<00:03:36.519> talk<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.819> later
