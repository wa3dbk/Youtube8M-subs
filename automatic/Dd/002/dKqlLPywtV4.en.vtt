boss thought the butterfly and the
nicest<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.090> put<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> fridge

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
nicest way is to put it in the fridge

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840

which<00:01:07.290> puts<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.890> sleep<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.460> they're

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
which puts them to sleep because they're

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
which puts them to sleep because they're
cold-blooded<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> freezer

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
cold-blooded and then put in the freezer

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:20.990 
cold-blooded and then put in the freezer
and<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.220> die<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.490> its<00:01:14.760> sleep<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> we

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and it will just die in its sleep so we

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
and it will just die in its sleep so we
have<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> set<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:22.619> job<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
have to set it in the first job is to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120 
have to set it in the first job is to
put<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> pin<00:01:23.790> through<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> thorax<00:01:25.439> without

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
put a pin through the thorax without

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.990 
put a pin through the thorax without
breaking<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.960> antenna<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.100> legs<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
breaking the antenna or the legs and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.740 
breaking the antenna or the legs and
this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> difficult<00:01:31.200> process<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.570> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this is a difficult process and I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.469 
this is a difficult process and I
normally<00:01:34.200> break<00:01:34.409> something<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:36.240> one's

50 but before their towers I felt I was
a<00:03:48.830> bit<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.520> caterpillar<00:03:50.000> really<00:03:50.390> just

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
a bit of a caterpillar really just

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
a bit of a caterpillar really just
traveling<00:03:51.950> around<00:03:51.980> sniffing<00:03:52.640> things<00:03:53.170> Hey<00:03:54.970> yes

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
traveling around sniffing things Hey yes

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.020 
traveling around sniffing things Hey yes
it<00:03:56.330> took<00:03:56.510> me<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.690> while<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.459> really<00:03:58.459> figure<00:03:58.760> that

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
it took me a while to really figure that

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.120 
it took me a while to really figure that
I<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.270> guess<00:03:59.720> I<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.260> didn't<00:04:00.890> really<00:04:01.570> blossom<00:04:02.570> and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
I I guess I I didn't really blossom and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:24.880 
I I guess I I didn't really blossom and
until<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.160> started<00:04:04.970> dancing<00:04:05.180> when<00:04:23.710> I'm<00:04:24.710> dancing

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.679 
until I started dancing when I'm dancing
I<00:04:25.870> go<00:04:26.870> into<00:04:27.230> this<00:04:27.410> space-time<00:04:27.800> continuum

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:29.689 
I go into this space-time continuum

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.779 
I go into this space-time continuum
and<00:04:30.049> I<00:04:30.349> make<00:04:30.649> these<00:04:30.919> shapes<00:04:31.309> and<00:04:31.639> those

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
and I make these shapes and those

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:42.960
