00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.790 
day the reason I really like this recipe
is<00:00:25.660> because<00:00:25.990> it<00:00:26.080> takes<00:00:26.200> about<00:00:26.380> 15<00:00:26.770> minutes

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
is because it takes about 15 minutes

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.470 
is because it takes about 15 minutes
from<00:00:27.130> start<00:00:27.400> to<00:00:27.520> finish<00:00:27.550> but<00:00:27.970> it<00:00:28.090> tastes<00:00:28.420> like

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
from start to finish but it tastes like

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.440 
from start to finish but it tastes like
you<00:00:29.080> spent<00:00:29.410> hours<00:00:29.500> making<00:00:30.070> this<00:00:30.460> dish<00:00:30.700> I've

and they're sauteing and the bacon fat
we'll<00:01:27.490> talk<00:01:27.670> about<00:01:27.790> our<00:01:28.000> second<00:01:28.360> layer<00:01:28.479> of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
we'll talk about our second layer of

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.240 
we'll talk about our second layer of
flavor<00:01:28.900> which<00:01:29.380> are<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.619> sweetness<00:01:30.010> from<00:01:30.070> the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
flavor which are the sweetness from the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.330 
flavor which are the sweetness from the
Allegro's<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.960> can<00:01:32.049> just<00:01:32.260> coarsely<00:01:32.710> chop<00:01:32.979> I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
Allegro's you can just coarsely chop I

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.130 
Allegro's you can just coarsely chop I
actually<00:01:33.939> like<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.360> leave<00:01:34.510> them<00:01:34.659> in<00:01:34.750> quarters

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
actually like to leave them in quarters

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.230 
actually like to leave them in quarters
because<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.799> like<00:01:36.430> them<00:01:36.640> with<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:36.820> little<00:01:37.119> bit<00:01:37.210> of

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
because I like them with a little bit of

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.530 
because I like them with a little bit of
texture<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.790> we're<00:01:39.909> just<00:01:39.939> going<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.240> cut<00:01:40.390> these

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
texture so we're just going to cut these

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.410 
texture so we're just going to cut these
into<00:01:40.750> chunks<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.520> add<00:01:42.520> our<00:01:42.549> second<00:01:43.060> layer<00:01:43.090> of

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
into chunks and add our second layer of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.370 
into chunks and add our second layer of
flavor<00:01:43.659> which<00:01:43.869> is<00:01:43.990> going<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.200> be<00:01:44.290> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
flavor which is going to be the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.020 
flavor which is going to be the
sweetness<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.400> Allegro's<00:01:45.850> will

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
sweetness that the Allegro's will

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.859 
sweetness that the Allegro's will
incorporate<00:01:46.540> in<00:01:46.689> so<00:01:46.960> let<00:01:47.320> this<00:01:47.500> saute<00:01:48.869> get

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
incorporate in so let this saute get

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.330 
incorporate in so let this saute get
them<00:01:50.020> nice<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.259> covered<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.860> bacon<00:01:51.130> fat

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
them nice and covered in the bacon fat

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.690 
them nice and covered in the bacon fat
and<00:01:51.689> we'll<00:01:52.689> cook<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:53.020> down<00:01:53.229> for<00:01:53.590> about<00:01:53.740> 5-6

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
and we'll cook this down for about 5-6

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.940 
and we'll cook this down for about 5-6
minutes<00:01:55.330> my<00:01:56.049> tomatoes<00:01:56.380> will<00:01:56.500> actually<00:01:56.770> start

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
minutes my tomatoes will actually start

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.800 
minutes my tomatoes will actually start
to<00:01:57.009> melt<00:01:57.310> into<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.820> sauce<00:01:58.030> but<00:01:58.540> they<00:01:58.630> won't

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
to melt into the sauce but they won't

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.340 
to melt into the sauce but they won't
completely<00:01:59.229> disintegrate<00:02:00.750> hmm<00:02:01.750> from<00:02:02.110> all

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
completely disintegrate hmm from all

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.960 
completely disintegrate hmm from all
those<00:02:02.500> great<00:02:02.770> flavors<00:02:02.950> we're<00:02:03.369> developing<00:02:03.790> in

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
those great flavors we're developing in

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.730

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the pan here we're going to move over to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
is a base of cornmeal in a bowl fresh

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.640 
is a base of cornmeal in a bowl fresh
water<00:02:12.130> put<00:02:12.670> your<00:02:12.820> clams<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.269> top<00:02:13.540> what<00:02:14.290> happens

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
to the clams is the grit from the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.300 
to the clams is the grit from the
cornmeal<00:02:16.420> actually<00:02:16.959> works<00:02:17.500> its<00:02:17.709> way<00:02:17.860> into<00:02:18.100> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
cornmeal actually works its way into the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.039 
cornmeal actually works its way into the
shells<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.790> then<00:02:18.940> they<00:02:19.060> expel<00:02:19.510> any<00:02:19.780> other

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
shells and then they expel any other

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.069 
shells and then they expel any other
grit<00:02:20.440> or<00:02:20.769> dirt<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.070> they<00:02:21.340> may<00:02:21.489> have<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.850> them
