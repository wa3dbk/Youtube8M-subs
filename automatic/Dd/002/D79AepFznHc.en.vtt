00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.000
 I was born of Commerzbank 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.150
 We are here today at Tampa Bay in the studio Momo I briefly the new the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
 Imagine 4800 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.850
 Ben 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.750
 we come to the peculiarities of this product 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.310
 on this compact area at the total of 64 mixing channels 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.950
 housed 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 the first 48 10 equipped with here at the consumer with Prechtl stimulation 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.210
 Neuss would do compressor 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.720
 we can send these channels in total to 24 Wussow 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.110
 and additionally twelve serves for Ronny sad or for effects 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.410
 as inputs we can here 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.850
 built in the GDR 24 analog instruments 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.590
 or four different plug-in cards 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.030
 the it among other things in however format Mias ABW format us similar hangover 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.439
 or even as former Wirecard often for the connections to Dr Med 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.210
 via the internal routing matrix 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.830
 each of these inputs sent to any mixing Canaries 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.530
 become 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.680
 or every exit 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.130
 to the mixer channel 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.750
 again to a new entrance 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.590
 on the expenditure side we can use the buses moreover will be map excerpts 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.369
 the stereo sound is directly to metric and that of children 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:16.789
 In addition, there are two times monitor outputs for one 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.789
 small disadvantage brave or for the big studio monitor 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.309
 In addition, with that they again parallel office digital output 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.969
 our DM 4800 has 24 cases 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.439
 the next to many Robbie channels 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.399
 looked at the bus and saw in Augsburg 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.859
 but one of the more taxes can come later 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.000
 the 4800 supports different saunas and modes only five points 1 to 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.819
 to six points 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.859
 either the post office is used as an exit 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.719
 with the corresponding plug-in cards or even the option but so 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.369
 Grundmann not only a hangover 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:59.219
 the additional possibility offers the complete speaker set 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.539
 so it is moderate to measure 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:06.409
 the dynamic automation that DM 4800 if possible not just a controller 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.339
 the spring but also every single mixer channel parameter 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.859
 for a best possible sound result but that the 4800 with a resolution 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.969
 fry from 24 bit Meiners up to 6 90 kilos 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.819
 Another highlight is the fact that it's workshops or dynamic 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.510
 automation data even with small compact saves 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.649
 can save 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.989
 she can not just take someone else to use the book 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.749
 or activate if you work in Bonn later this project 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.329
 would like 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.999
 was particularly important to us in the development that the 4800th 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.999
 to allow a user interface that is as analog as possible 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.569
 for this reason we have the Burgenland complete canal train 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.649
 fitted 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.719
 because not only access to the IKB times full to guest 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:56.209
 but also on the individual parameters Epigenomics or the OFC are 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.649
 Alternatively, the panorama can also be completely different functions Main 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.219
 For example, they can either represent a complete channel train 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.519
 or also individually punches taxes 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.629
 or for example 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.409
 Total level of a completely different mixer channel so that's possible 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.340
 Channels 1 through 24 with the springs to control the volume 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.169
 and with the Panoramaweg on the north side of the channels 25 to 48 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.129
 the optional firewire tomcat relatives or sprue called 32 input and 32 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.289
 Output audio interface 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.279
 Dillenburg does not just allow the bread to be controlled by the bread 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.719
 Transport function 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:36.270
 but also the operation 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.270
 the virtual mixer controls on the screen 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.370
 the DM 4800 will not only be in the studio 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.039
 thanks to the direct access to a chamber parameters 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.830
 the 12 also Sweden 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.500
 and the possibility to speak up to 48 against talking it also excited 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.520
 in live use 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.539
