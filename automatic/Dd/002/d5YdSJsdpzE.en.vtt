00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 The beauty guys starting when they did 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.330
 one more photo dike I am the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 song and today we are going to talk about 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.870
 film framing plans 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.639
 applied in photography and I decided 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.260
 to continue I have to thank the whole 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.630
 people who write the channel 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.820
 there are almost 500 people who are 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.010
 following us and it's very cool that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 know the concept that had this video 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.140
 let's start with the general plan is 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.610
 photography application when you want 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.239
 show the subject and a military environment 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.340
 tom you make a good work system 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.149
 goes with the 'plug' with one big one 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 glatch 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.340
 you put the subject in the corner and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.340
 did not want to show the environment to show 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.660
 nature and scenery all 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 his function is to show where to his sound 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.500
 template where the photos are being taken 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 closing the scenes but we have a plan 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 together and in this kind of plan we have 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.649
 more than one character we have one more 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.239
 Subject to law being photographed 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.400
 the classic example of photography of 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 joint plan is that classic scene of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.750
 wedding photography when you have 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.760
 a name my bride and the guests 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 together behind the cake table after we 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.439
 we have a whole plan the whole plan 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.509
 framework that will move a space 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.000
 below the clasp your model that a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.799
 so little in his head is more 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.900
 used at the entrance of the bride by 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.400
 example also use the picture from 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.520
 For example, the staff is 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.549
 photographing there says son is showing that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.979
 show the model the clothes all the shoe 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 then the frame that you 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.939
 have these elements involved 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.369
 we also have the American plan that 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.229
 classic photograph of a half body is that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.509
 has this name precisely for the films 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.549
 classics and bang bang and you had 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.040
 that scene that will have the duel of the two 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.020
 cowboys and who has shown from thigh to 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.790
 Above them, pulling the gun was a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.320
 little else we have a medium plane is 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.649
 a frame that starts from the waist 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.990
 used in realism and in the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.030
 photography is applied a lot in 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.240
 corporate portraits also in politics 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.289
 efe foto carla so close to arms 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.119
 crusaders 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.580
 so it 's an interesting application 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.380
 for photographer closing the frame more 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.810
 we have the first plan is to have a 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.790
 plan to autograph from gold to 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.250
 that will greatly enhance the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.080
 expression of the person and also the makeup 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.270
 closing still more we have the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.300
 very flat or cross 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.370
 it will close in the face many still 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.250
 cut a little of what is 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.910
 totally expression and value the look 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.950
 is the facial expression is all a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.030
 very applied photography and photography 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.489
 bridal 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.810
 the bride's makeup moment is 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.350
 worked 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.970
 it's a lot and if you want to value it yet 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.130
 plus your picture with the feeling 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.170
 you will see the photo of kohsar 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.280
 because when you squat the eyes of the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.470
 photographed person 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.239
 then hands on the detail plane in the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.239

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.350
 Good guys, these are the main ones. 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.870
 plans and taking advantage of Bruno made a 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.120
 ask us about the angle that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.950
 are used in photography and people 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.650
 will now speak to complement the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120
 subject still framing the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.660
 cinema language 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.760

 also we have good days and right angle 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.380
 when you make the top framing 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.590
 down 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.660
 you will use often is if you 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.510
 want to cause a sensation of 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.220
 inferiority photographed but you 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.410
 You can also shoot a model by
