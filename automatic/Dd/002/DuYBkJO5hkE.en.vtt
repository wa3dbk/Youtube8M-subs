00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Stuntex welcomes all bikers. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Since 2013 World Superbike takes place in Russia at Moscow raceway. 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.700
Interesting event and we did not miss the opportunity to visit it.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.000
Russian Supersport team Rivamoto invited us to spend the race weekend at their disposal,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.500
where we got useful experience and saw the professionals at work.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.380
Rivamoto arrived at Moscow Raceway on the truck and van.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.760
This truck travels throughout Europe and went to Moscow from Italy.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.770
Race weekend always begins on Wednesday and ends on Sunday. 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:53.300
The first two days Wednesday and Thursday are fully devoted to prepairing. Pilots come to team on Thursday and they are not involved in preparation.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.500
The work begins with unloading trucks and assembling box.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.300
During the weekend the team lives in the truck, which is transformed into a living unit.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.800
Each team get place in the empty boxes, depending on the number of motorcycles.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Rivamoto took 2/3 of box as they have 2 bikes.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.900
Thursday is devoted to preparing motorcycles.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.900
They are fully disassembled. 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.350
All systems are checked and serviced.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.900
This is necessary, since the end of each weekend bikes are loaded without checking.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.140
At this time, there was a problem with one bike.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.300
It smoked while working at idle, so mechanics decided to remove the injectors and check the ignition.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.570
On the same day team manager (Jeremy McWilliams) and pilots (Jack Kennedy and Eduard Blokhin) arrived.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.700
Pilots went to rest, but Jeremy received reports from mechanics all evening.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.500
We managed to ride on the Moscow Raceway.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.370
Track is made very qualitatively, its length about 4 km.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.210
Many pilots at this time riding on a scooter to learn the track.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.400
At the end of the day it was time to ride the paddock which is a small town with a full-fledged autonomous infrastructure. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.200
All teams live in trucks.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.760
There are restaurants opposite trucks.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.110
They accompany teams at all stages.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.960
Factory teams have their own, and private deal with restaurant serving several teams.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.450
Pilots live separately in the mobile home park.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.520
At the end of the paddock there is Pirelli block changing tires for all motorcycle.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.850
Also, there are blocks of racing equipment manufacturers and medicine block.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.140
On Thursday, team went to bed very early, because of upcoming first race day,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.540
but we shot video about Rivamoto's bikes till night.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.960
You can see it on our channel.
