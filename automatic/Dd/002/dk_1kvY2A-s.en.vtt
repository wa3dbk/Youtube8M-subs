00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
peppers I think it might be the only one

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.500 
peppers I think it might be the only one
actually<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:49.220> fruit<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.700> rather<00:01:49.880> unique<00:01:50.300> it

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
actually the fruit and rather unique it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.380 
actually the fruit and rather unique it
it<00:01:50.660> has<00:01:50.990> black<00:01:51.560> seeds<00:01:51.920> yeah<00:01:52.580> that<00:01:53.000> no<00:01:53.210> other

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it has black seeds yeah that no other

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.110 
it has black seeds yeah that no other
variety<00:01:53.870> contains<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.250> it's<00:01:55.400> got<00:01:55.520> black<00:01:55.760> seeds

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
variety contains so it's got black seeds

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.670 
variety contains so it's got black seeds
I<00:01:57.520> thought<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.610> was<00:01:58.730> pretty<00:01:58.850> cool

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
I thought that was pretty cool

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.130 
I thought that was pretty cool
so<00:02:03.250> that's<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.490> 12<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.909> 30,000<00:02:05.570> Scoville<00:02:05.870> units

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
so that's it 12 to 30,000 Scoville units

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.210 
so that's it 12 to 30,000 Scoville units
