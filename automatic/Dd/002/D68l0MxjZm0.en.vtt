i hope you enjoyed todays video...

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.020
La concha de la lora...

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.341
Get in the Black Hole now!!!

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.170
Penalty!!! eeeee

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.390
and susbcribe!

00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:03.677
For todays trick we will do the following...

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.920
Step with you NON-Dominant diagonally to the ball

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.480
not in front... but in diagonal

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.700
then step behind the ball with you Dominant foot

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.720
now twist you body to your NON-Dominant side

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.600
as we twist the body.... if you watch closely...

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.900
out Dominant foot will also twist a bit

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.420
because moving your body will make your foot twist a bit naturally

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.340
so this will make our foot face the ball with the outside part

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.600
this is normal position...

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.601
if we twist body...

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.281
foot will twist and face ball with outside part

00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:39.461
SO... Once in this position...

00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:41.421
and your Dominant foot facing the ball

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.701
with the outside part

00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:45.600
we will do a 360 turn

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.282
a full turn

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:50.802
as you turn... leave your foot dead

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:53.822
and as we turn it will automatically roll the ball

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.022
so like this... get in position...

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:57.437
full turn..

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.500
as you see the foot will roll the ball automatically

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.460
Ok?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.740
get in position...

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.160
then full turn and dead foot

00:02:06.582 --> 00:02:08.582
and it will roll like that... :)

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.400
we can perform this trick in 2 methods

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.620
first method is just to combine with other moves

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.900
and try to confuse the opponent

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.680
for example in street football

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.760
simply to humiliate him a bit

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220
second method is to pass the opponent

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.880
like for example in 11 a side football

00:02:36.428 --> 00:02:40.288
so we perform it as we run and then sprint away from the opponent

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.080
a tip i can give you is to do it slowly

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.380
then try to do it faster and faster as you control it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.420
just because you do it faster it doesn't mean it will  be more effective!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.480
if you do it at normal speed and correctly, it will be good enough

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.480
so i hope you enjoyed today's video

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.440
and hopefully you try it in the pitch!

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.440
as you can see is not one of the hardest trick out there

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.920
So go and test this skill!
