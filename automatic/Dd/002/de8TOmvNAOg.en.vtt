running<00:02:43.640> unlocking<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.090> unlock<00:02:45.360> slider

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
running unlocking with the unlock slider

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.030 
running unlocking with the unlock slider
will<00:02:45.870> bring<00:02:46.020> up<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.170> unlock<00:02:46.560> screen<00:02:46.590> rather

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
will bring up the unlock screen rather

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.790 
will bring up the unlock screen rather
than<00:02:47.190> unlocking<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> phone<00:02:48.330> which<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.500> which

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
than unlocking the phone which is which

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.980 
than unlocking the phone which is which
will<00:02:49.920> take<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> couple<00:02:50.220> more<00:02:50.460> steps<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.090> it

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
will take a couple more steps but it

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.120 
will take a couple more steps but it
depends<00:02:52.290> whether<00:02:53.100> what's<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.790> preference

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
depends whether what's your preference

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.620 
depends whether what's your preference
so<00:02:56.130> as<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.580> can<00:02:56.670> see<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
so as you can see you can just do the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.300 
so as you can see you can just do the
normal<00:02:57.720> block<00:02:58.080> as<00:02:58.260> well<00:02:58.410> which<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.010> forgot<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
normal block as well which I forgot to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.360 
normal block as well which I forgot to
mention<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:01.530> cool<00:03:01.710> thing<00:03:01.830> about<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.040> app<00:03:02.160> is

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
mention the cool thing about the app is

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.310 
mention the cool thing about the app is
that<00:03:02.400> everyone<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.150> instantly<00:03:03.540> upon<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.080> boots

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
that everyone is instantly upon in boots

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.440 
that everyone is instantly upon in boots
so<00:03:04.560> there's<00:03:04.740> no<00:03:04.860> need<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.240> open<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.330> app

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
so there's no need to open the app

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.600 
so there's no need to open the app
constantly<00:03:07.050> it's<00:03:07.260> always<00:03:07.410> there<00:03:07.710> but<00:03:08.370> it's

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
constantly it's always there but it's

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.610 
constantly it's always there but it's
also<00:03:08.760> visible<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.390> your<00:03:09.660> multitasking<00:03:10.080> screen

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
also visible in your multitasking screen

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.980 
also visible in your multitasking screen
which<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.130> cool<00:03:11.460> but<00:03:11.700> as<00:03:11.970> mentioned<00:03:12.720> before

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
which is cool but as mentioned before

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.620 
which is cool but as mentioned before
about<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.590> runs<00:03:13.890> upon<00:03:14.280> reboot<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.570> you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
about is that runs upon reboot so you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.780 
about is that runs upon reboot so you
don't<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.230> constantly<00:03:17.130> run<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.700> app
