00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.540
 Karelia died 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.550
 so black knives 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.550
 junior bush 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.269
 everything is possible 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.269
 Today 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.849
 today olympiad 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.029
 last time in the tactical genre 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.679
 builders there was a slight lull 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.469
 Serbian cleric released 

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.460
 magnificent houses of the city lahore so 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.319
 nothing really worthy and not 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.460
 as if by accident 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.189
 corrected developers from 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.999
 Kadima of Russia 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.459
 creating almost the best game of the genre 

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:37.250
 the whole of 2009 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.260
 meet 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.679
 Black's strict video review 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.160
 pea 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.580
 who knows how 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.960
 important to me 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 association of banks he 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.080
 If these frames seem to you extremely 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.960
 familiar not be surprised 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 the game is built on the engine in the rear of the enemy 2 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.250
 and therefore in many ways resembles this 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.870
 very worthy projects 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.900
 not only externally but also falling 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.480
 by mouth 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.190
 we are given several soldiers from 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.840
 five six and twenty and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.880
 orders for example to eliminate enemy 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.660
 anti-aircraft gunners 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.320
 or help the main troops 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.790
 knock out the Germans and sports 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.080
 while opponents are always much more 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.090
 and we are in the minority 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.920
 however as it should be right 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.369
 tactical strategies 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.149
 here to win many troops not 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.319
 it takes the more soldiers we have under 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.639
 guiding the topic is actually more difficult 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.969
 After all, look, we literally manage 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.349
 individually and indeed 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:36.099
 can single out one soldier and on 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.179
 Arrow walk and MSK here themselves 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.580
 aim at the enemy themselves shot 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
 very comfortably 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.249
 but it was all in the rear of the enemy 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.579
 and black jackets as a project is different 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.959
 and first of all he answers with this that 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.549
 We play for the Soviet sea 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.520
 infantrymen 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.030
 about them almost never 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.120
 developed games 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.910
 when bypassed so important 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.430
 fighters who had to be very 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.070
 not easy throughout great 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.260
 domestic 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.750
 under you are those difficulties we and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.160
 we find out at all the company and their here 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.610
 somewhat based on 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.779
 real events 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.310
 Odessa Sevastopol 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.970
 and many other cities and port and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.349
 accurate created and they are the same 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.619
 what were the forties 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.900
 however, we are not a history book 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.769
 if you are not particularly interested in how and what 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.450
 It was 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.470
 who is this black jackets worse not 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.030
 will become 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.830
 because the most fascinating 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.879
 interesting gameplay here 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.109
 before us is gorgeous 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.359
 tactical representative 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.120
 strategies 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.709
 just look how neat 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.530
 we have to act 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.380
 try to use 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.340
 roundabout maneuvers and constantly 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.380
 coming up with all sorts of 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.580
 tricks on the map as you can see a lot 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.109
 objects and all of them must be taken into account 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.199
 you can hide behind houses and inside them 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.049
 be covered behind the trees even 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.999
 crawl under small stones 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.590
 and while one of our fighters distract the enemy 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.760
 others try painting him from behind and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.789
 undermine 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.279
 there are 10 or more dynamic duel 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.119
 when you have to storm for example 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:01.979
 defensive positions of the enemy 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.119
 sometimes all ten minutes of the battle we can 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.899
 lose 90 percent of all our soldiers but 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:08.719
 otherwise it will not work 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.540
 But the missions here are huge and 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.809
 long sometimes one has to 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.169
 take five hours and not always us 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.169
 waiting for help 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.809
 black jackets one of the most difficult 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.879
 tactical strategies of the last 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.399
 years old 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.069
 worth a little mistake like you 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.779
 immediately punishes the opponent 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.169
 evolved not soldiers dead decided 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.939
 far not to withdraw their troops covered 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:32.829
 artillery 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.119
 a little hurried got hit by a machine gun 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.709
 the fire 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.359
 it's hard to even defend here 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.259
 because the enemy is much more than yours 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.750
 an ally soldier will fulfill his goals 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.719
 he doesnâ€™t have a jota dig 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.189
 usually difficult games are quickly tiresome 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.880
 black jackets exception 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.790
 the developers have done every mission 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.649
 are unique 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.239
 then we fight shoulder to shoulder with 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.289
 a crowd of other soldiers and storms in the trenches 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.519
 enemies who themselves hold the line 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.559
 front 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.889
 sometimes have to eliminate only 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.669
 several Fritz deaf village 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.729
 sometimes get the tickets right away 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.879
 losing soldiers under machine gun 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.980
 and always the game will challenge us and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.179
 demand something impossible from us 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.459
 it seems that half of the missions here are just 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.619
 impossible to pass but when you score 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.639
 the last fritz and command 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.729
 congratulates you on the victory seems that 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.999
 really accomplished the feat 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:23.349
 not every year there are such projects that 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.189
 can test for strength even very 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.449
 skillfully x players 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.389
 all lovers of complex tactical 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.110
 strategies 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.969
 strongly recommend 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.969
 facade and made kurdish 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.009
 now I was born she tried the portal 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.949
 Aman Tuleyev stated 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.199
 I didnâ€™t acknowledge during the investigation 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.159
 did not recognize 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.159
 in ramat gan according to the National Bank 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.340
 for small business makers 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.490
 as the country itself admitted 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.860
 on one charge 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.610
 I have this
