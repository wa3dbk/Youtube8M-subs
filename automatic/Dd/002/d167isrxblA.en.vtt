00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.620 
think among the four african americans
celebrate<00:04:56.850> there<00:04:57.850> were<00:04:57.940> any<00:04:58.210> number<00:04:58.600> of

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
celebrate there were any number of

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.470 
celebrate there were any number of
people<00:04:58.990> she<00:04:59.650> wanted<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.190> see<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.940> they<00:05:01.180> come

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
people she wanted to see this they come

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.470 
people she wanted to see this they come
hopefully<00:05:02.470> wanted<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.800> say<00:05:02.980> that<00:05:03.610> yes<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.330> be

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
hopefully wanted to say that yes to be

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.210 
hopefully wanted to say that yes to be
an<00:05:04.570> American<00:05:05.110> whether<00:05:05.650> you're<00:05:05.800> black<00:05:05.890> white

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
an American whether you're black white

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.520 
an American whether you're black white
Hispanic<00:05:06.940> Asian<00:05:07.060> whatever<00:05:07.540> we're<00:05:08.050> all<00:05:08.230> in

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
Hispanic Asian whatever we're all in

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.410 
Hispanic Asian whatever we're all in
this<00:05:08.830> together<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.610> think<00:05:09.730> they<00:05:10.210> also

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
this together and so I think they also

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.750 
this together and so I think they also
are<00:05:11.290> celebrating<00:05:11.950> as<00:05:12.040> well<00:05:12.220> because<00:05:12.580> that

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
are celebrating as well because that

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.330 
are celebrating as well because that
family<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.690> mother<00:05:13.990> gave<00:05:14.260> their<00:05:14.530> life<00:05:14.740> why

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
family that mother gave their life why

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.670 
family that mother gave their life why

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
ability in this country to learn to

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.800

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
lot and I think this is going to really

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.510 
lot and I think this is going to really
make<00:05:47.300> change<00:05:47.660> come<00:05:47.960> a<00:05:48.169> lot<00:05:48.410> faster<00:05:49.190> in<00:05:49.370> this
