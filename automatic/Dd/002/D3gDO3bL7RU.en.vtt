the bat one thing I like about the
handle<00:00:56.879> scales<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:58.050> didn't<00:00:58.320> treat<00:00:58.500> them

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
handle scales are they didn't treat them

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
handle scales are they didn't treat them
like<00:00:58.680> scales<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> times<00:00:59.879> when<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.180> have

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
like scales a lot of times when you have

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
like scales a lot of times when you have
handle<00:01:00.690> scales<00:01:00.960> they're<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.890> squared<00:01:02.250> off

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
handle scales they're really squared off

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
handle scales they're really squared off
they<00:01:02.699> treated<00:01:03.059> them<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.210> two<00:01:03.570> separate

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
they treated them like two separate

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.640 
they treated them like two separate
slabs<00:01:04.549> of<00:01:05.549> aluminum<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> X<00:01:07.020> M<00:01:07.290> strike

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
slabs of aluminum but the X M strike

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440 
slabs of aluminum but the X M strike
fighter<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.460> rounded<00:01:08.850> them<00:01:09.000> off<00:01:09.090> really

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
fighter they rounded them off really

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.660 
fighter they rounded them off really
nicely<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.920> grip<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.280> blade

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
nicely so that when you grip the blade

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.120 
nicely so that when you grip the blade
you're<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.720> having<00:01:13.080> any<00:01:13.200> hot<00:01:13.470> spots<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you're not having any hot spots it's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
you're not having any hot spots it's
really<00:01:14.490> smooth<00:01:14.869> it's<00:01:15.869> nice<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> rounded

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
really smooth it's nice and rounded

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.760 
really smooth it's nice and rounded
which<00:01:17.040> which<00:01:17.400> gives<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.030> lot<00:01:18.270> better<00:01:18.479> grip<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
which which gives a lot better grip you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.170 
which which gives a lot better grip you
can<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.310> milled<00:01:20.549> out<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:20.880> spots

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
can see they have milled out some spots

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.899 
can see they have milled out some spots
there<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.600> traction<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.759> there's<00:01:23.759> some

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
there for traction and there's some

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.910 
there for traction and there's some
ridges<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> finger<00:01:25.380> groove<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
there it's a really steep thumb ramp you

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.649 
there it's a really steep thumb ramp you
can<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> handle<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.090> extends<00:01:36.509> into

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
can see the handle kind of extends into

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420 
can see the handle kind of extends into
the<00:01:36.750> blade<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.259> gives<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.040> some<00:01:38.220> really

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the blade there gives it some really

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.850 
the blade there gives it some really
good<00:01:38.700> traction<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.689> squeezing<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.740> my

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
good traction I'm squeezing back with my

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
good traction I'm squeezing back with my

look at the I don't know for clintus a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.609 
look at the I don't know for clintus a
modified<00:01:48.840> tanto<00:01:49.380> blade

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
