00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.479
 welcome 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.210
 it remains so summer is 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 welcomes our guests 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.409
 Homburg 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.140
 and then the microphone had been a split for two days 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 Dr that was the game pre-decided 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.829
 to deserved victory 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.089
 I think that's great 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.580
 I have partial 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.200
 War times back 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.650
 has seen euro 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.910
 television teams have not fought a bow 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.370
 that wanted 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 Seeing it is just so chosen that joy 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.430
 I'll do it 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.410
 the term the crew 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110
 worst rival 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 no scoring chance did not stand a chance 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.490
 this game also gain in percentage of value 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.760
 that is just revolution 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 wants to get off the WEEKSPIEGEL 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 Red Day for relegation wants to be Hecking 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.030
 the gifts that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.370
 it drove in the first half 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.760
 Mister of a small show in Irwindale and that will probably leave you in 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.900
 the first half had 2 3 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 Concluded nevertheless or maybe leadership would have gone then 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.220
 who may be aware of the weaknesses of planning and construction law 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.100
 went positive 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.880
 now does not arrive 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.770
 my arm had to come 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.310
 Dr the 1 0 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 that should have been distributed poorly 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420
 our left defense side 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.200
 because his characters run band let the sixteen penetrate without 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.480
 that they go in two days, it comes to pressure 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 the Libor completely without a husband and later lower 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.640
 also in front 2 0 but both sets make easy ball losses 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.020
 the eeg novella march 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.649
 Now his advice is "You have had quite a few simple ball losses 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.320
 Ruddy Estevez continue to thin out 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.300
 on screams 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.359
 and the game is on 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.339
 fought the league against relegation and 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.639
 But Kolb 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.529
 the first time in the session is the game 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.159
 clearly in the minus 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.519
 before that was a helmet 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.689
 under pressure he could already go back 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.689
 extremely difficult 22 23 24 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.439
 after Sergio Ramos stay old l 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.029
 at and when it rewards then experienced 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 over 30 were invested for this 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.429
 Slice off again football plays the readiness percent 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.889
 look in the mirror 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.889
 and in the country as well as in the Bund 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.929
 Berlin scored no goal 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.929
 because we do not know 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.469
 Thank you very much Christian Hock I almost never read his game 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.469
 by Dirk Anger Münster 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.049
 Performa rush the local authority 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.219
 Thank you for your kind wishes 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.389
 Percent I believe that under Schröder at the bar a very important factor 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.539
 was today 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:22.009
 Percent we really wanted to enforce our game we absolutely want 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.529
 the sexiest submitted 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.370
 and I believe in food 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.489
 Second we have found very well in the game 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.069
 then the opponents tries to put pressure permanently on them 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.579
 one or the other animal run over in between 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.669
 but some underlined really have percent 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.479
 and the game enforced what I liked the most was the rhythm 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.409
 switch 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.289
 let the ball run in its own ranks that he let me 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.449
 but then again and again to switch again and again appeared the 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.899
 Depth to go 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:55.369
 that partly also includes singer Phoenix 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.680
 Jordanian fun percent of our racer appearance 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.059
 which of course sports SL 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:03.489
 a great 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.819
 want team unity 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.959
 Percent was seen where a man of course 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.419
 were outstanding 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.849
 you just have to call it the Gotthard massif 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:13.880
 of course became 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.859
 a golden dragon has 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.059
 That is 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.139
 especially that is 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.800
 to have withdrawn the research and use 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.870
 because of abuse 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.009
 but the team is in a good mood and the cloud from lower layers 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.970
 a worthy one on icy was 4 and, consequently, percent can 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.229
 I think so 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.229
 if a large part II a decision 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.460
 I have good news for our guests 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.360
 Eintracht 4 against Bayer Leverkusen 3 1 1 and 31 consumers are 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.050
 the match in Kaiserslautern against Mönchengladbach ended 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.050
 19 o'clock now you are asked 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.680
 the teams I believe Simon Schoch Mönchengladbach 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.249
 I have been sitting together ever since 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.610
 I'll be coming to Cooper tomorrow, too 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.099
 Koblenz and the decision must 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.439
 Theoretically, the research could continue 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.479
 From then on, I also watch Yangon 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.669
 we should only continue to look at us » 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:23.659
 the US 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.659
 a good 30% left the right way 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:29.900
 Macusani 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.939
 now regenerate contracts 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.969
 and then additional costs more atmospheric the work 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.799
 OMV won and pulled the hoped for three points again 

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:41.799
 Game brought us focus on concern tomorrow 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.830
 after more quickly reward them 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.210
 as first line 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.249
 Götze whose have our toothless on the ball 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.249
 since the end of the race also have and 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.220
 he had the night before 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.220
 Georg Schaeffler gave Aachen bread baking 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.949
 because she is doing well then to Paris 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:25.310
 Pokerface maybe a district man Samus Aran clubmate 1 8 5 504 000 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:29.129
 Viewers around 8,000 Roma Merkel Red Riding Hood for the Münster fans 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.550
 let themselves be impressed by the spectators 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.550
 first conversations, questions were answered 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.469
 but that's more gentle the last few weeks have been 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.600
 Not just the home games for the sensational are just founded 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.230
 Rowing machine percent endorses non-stop cheer what consumers are particularly good at 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.319
 like is the first outward-three traffic light 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.539
 Dec he froze number of Prussia Schanzer that he makes the from shipping to 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.520
 play and prompt is sensationally a momentous and that makes us happy 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.669
 goes down like oil around you also like Sheens carry the crew 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.659
 against the ASV and that I grew something between six and eleven 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:12.740
 Player and that's the way it should be and that's what it's all about 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.740
 sensational thing 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.169
 Bob Dylan John Lennon those are at first I was not that yet 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.589
 billion-disaster to our guests 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:28.589
 a one-time history league
