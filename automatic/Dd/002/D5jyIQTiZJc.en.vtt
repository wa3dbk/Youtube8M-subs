 the album called this Thursday 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.470
 following what is happening 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.130
 this week we already had seven videos 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.920
 so far and let's go to this is the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.359
 debate over remember to revisit 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.609
 description of this video check it out 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.180
 they help as well as geek my other 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.040
 page, but we have to talk about this 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 theme in the gallery the number of lipsticks 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 Could you see God from the gal machine? 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.770
 Let's talk about what this training is. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.559
 I think there are people who do not know is good. 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.430
 I'm talking here with the father of the donkeys. 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.950
 I'm definitely not with employees. 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.260
 contact between the mother who loses but 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.570
 following encounters in the Greek theater 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.030
 refers to an unexpectedly artificial or 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.800
 unlikely character until fact the event 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.480
 suddenly introduced 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 it is a work of fiction the drama to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.010
 resolve a situation or discourage or 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.909
 a plot that we had in this 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 chapter 742 has school soon to whom 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.840
 knows a wise man is a galera in km 142 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.509
 In my view, we had a god x 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.340
 great machine so bothered me 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.170
 I just wanted to hear your opinion. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 about it because I saw that a lot of people 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.610
 Did you like it and yes I'm speaking at the end? 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.140
 of the soil with the rain 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.540
 we had a right unexpectedly 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 is an unexpected event that has 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.650
 suddenly introduced as it is here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.650
 in the definition of god so ax machine 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.689
 to solve a situation of history 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.880
 old man who did not have a project to be 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.500
 resolved and I do not know if it was the very 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.850
 thighs and still ingesting this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.579
 I would like your opinion on 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.040
 I saw that a lot of people liked this 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.340
 resolution of the sun and some rain 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.610
 people did not understand either, in this case 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.009
 one blow he's boning there with 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.869
 tabasco is that it was just a 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.729
 I think it's a special year because 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.110
 I see in there but I think that for 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.160
 they the pepper was so strong that they 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.040
 they looked like red 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.390
 for his size right there and I think more 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.900
 scared with the face of the sun and goes 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.410
 making faces there is easy but also 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.870
 Last 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.720
 he knows game and grimace and that's what 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 is the Mayan rain at the end earned good 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.070
 it was a way off the beaten up but what made me 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.420
 bothered it was just because she gave in x 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.400
 Let's compare machine with another 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.470
 a situation that has its headquarters in the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.950
 jumping with joy is also what I 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.490
 I want to refer to an episode to 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.710
 bible passage that sandy has 11 11 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.010
 bi gigantic there because of mermaids 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.810
 that was an exaggeration is character speaks 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.700
 that seriously it is taken not sent the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.180
 a joke that was taken seriously 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.800
 But this game is this flower. 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.360
 organization as we have already 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.400
 of Batuque is an exaggeration of the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.500
 character trait was used 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.270
 to walk the plot to explain a 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.180
 prejudice to deepen a sense of 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.730
 little more on the point is in the case of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.140
 shopping and is that god is chic machine 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.260
 it was used in a way to 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.500
 solve something very, very serious in the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.720
 story just set in the new world the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.310
 The eyes are taken care of by a 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.260
 What are you doing, we 're not here? 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.820
 jokes though not that I just 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.070
 even played because it acts of 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.400
 unconscious form but it is a 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.650
 very serious where we see the state 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.660
 frank side defeated by four 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.560
 big old people who are on strike 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.180
 pink basil of lg nec goes without ping 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.239
 and then I just solved everything in a way 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.650
 unconscious knows something old 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.480
 as serious as those resolved from 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.190
 unconscious by rising when the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.040
 People are going to see some op 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.380
 like he had all found on the ground but 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.770
 he, for example, let's say so I 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.300
 I do not know if I came. 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.060
 the same happened to us 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.280
 analyze when the rain returned to the grape 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.530
 with tabasco in mouth swallow 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.150
 English is not mouth-to-mouth and 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.000
 her mouth back but it is a thing of the 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.770
 because it was going to be an action thought by the 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.410
 he is actually saving everything 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.300
 world because psol is also the one 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.729
 moment and cowardice he came back to himself 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.549
 redeemed and he saved the situation 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.539
 no wonder'm old 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.610
 I think you need to have a moment of 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.590
 reflection do you remember when 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.599
 Labaki the blood gets all thoughtful 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.699
 because he saw that the serum made by the flock 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:33.180
 taking all the ruf fatigue that the com 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.370
 one shot is hard and wearing took the whole 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.080
 that impact and where he saw it 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.310
 It's reflected I think I just need 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.900
 a moment of reflection 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.460
 I would like to hear from you 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.909
 especially this case there and that's it 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.440
 guys 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.870
 I hope you enjoyed this debate 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.520
 a more technical debate like this does not 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.770
 is about a country's history about the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.060
 plot is but that's it, see you later tomorrow 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.400
 with that cake schools prejudice 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.400
 sent your questions until the next
