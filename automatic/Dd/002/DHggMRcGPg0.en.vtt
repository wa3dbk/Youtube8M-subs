the way I have them set up now I have

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.940 
the way I have them set up now I have
three<00:02:31.120> verities<00:02:31.540> one<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.650> which<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:32.920> a

three verities one of which is a

permanent boost and fervor which means

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.979 
permanent boost and fervor which means
every<00:02:35.950> time<00:02:36.129> you<00:02:36.310> hit<00:02:36.489> something<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.750> it's<00:02:37.900> a

Krita you'll get more meters so this
build

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
build

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.959 
build
you<00:02:41.019> get<00:02:41.200> destroyers<00:02:41.829> really<00:02:42.370> really<00:02:42.669> fast

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
you get destroyers really really fast

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.759 
you get destroyers really really fast
and<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:45.129> do<00:02:45.280> crits<00:02:45.579> pretty<00:02:45.849> often<00:02:46.030> -<00:02:46.769> pretty

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
and you do crits pretty often - pretty

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.979 
and you do crits pretty often - pretty
excellent<00:02:48.159> it's<00:02:48.879> not<00:02:49.060> probably<00:02:49.689> not<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.959> best

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
excellent it's not probably not the best

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.959 
excellent it's not probably not the best
one<00:02:50.349> out<00:02:50.379> there<00:02:50.530> but<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:51.129> I<00:02:51.280> said<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.849> know

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:51.969 
one out there but like I said you know

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.899 
one out there but like I said you know
this<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.299> like<00:02:52.510> day<00:02:53.409> two<00:02:53.469> of<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.919> game<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.430> t3

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
this is like day two of the game and t3

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.220 
this is like day two of the game and t3
I<00:02:55.239> guess<00:02:55.419> so

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
I guess so

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.720 
I guess so
we're<00:02:56.590> still<00:02:56.769> working<00:02:57.099> on<00:02:57.219> things<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.609> have

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
we're still working on things I have

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.649 
we're still working on things I have
another<00:02:57.939> couple<00:02:58.689> other<00:02:58.810> builds<00:02:59.260> here<00:03:00.659> this

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
another couple other builds here this

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.869 
another couple other builds here this
feature<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.199> really<00:03:02.230> nice<00:03:02.620> by<00:03:02.889> the<00:03:02.919> way<00:03:03.159> you

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
feature is really nice by the way you

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.599 
feature is really nice by the way you
can<00:03:04.060> set<00:03:04.419> things<00:03:04.689> you<00:03:05.019> have<00:03:05.169> up<00:03:05.349> to<00:03:05.500> 20<00:03:05.889> slots

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
can set things you have up to 20 slots

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.890 
can set things you have up to 20 slots
that's<00:03:06.939> a<00:03:07.030> pretty<00:03:07.209> much<00:03:07.389> cover<00:03:07.659> all<00:03:07.870> your

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
that's a pretty much cover all your

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.839 
that's a pretty much cover all your
weapons<00:03:08.349> if<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.829> play<00:03:09.040> more<00:03:09.219> like<00:03:09.370> one<00:03:09.549> weapon

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
weapons if you play more like one weapon

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.439 
weapons if you play more like one weapon
at<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> time<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:13.949> also<00:03:14.949> have<00:03:15.189> this<00:03:15.400> one<00:03:15.639> which<00:03:15.669> is

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
at a time I also have this one which is

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.920 
at a time I also have this one which is
pretty<00:03:16.629> much<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.019> same<00:03:17.199> thing<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.370> have

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
pretty much the same thing but I have

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.179 
pretty much the same thing but I have
Nakano<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.259> Keiko<00:03:21.720> admittedly<00:03:22.720> her<00:03:23.439> abilities

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
Nakano to Keiko admittedly her abilities

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.089 
Nakano to Keiko admittedly her abilities
are<00:03:24.400> not<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.699> great<00:03:24.909> for<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.569> melee<00:03:25.930> build<00:03:26.199> but

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
are not that great for a melee build but

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.409 
are not that great for a melee build but
this<00:03:27.189> one<00:03:27.370> makes<00:03:27.579> it<00:03:27.669> easier<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.090> enter<00:03:28.299> a

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
this one makes it easier to enter a

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.689 
this one makes it easier to enter a
hyper<00:03:28.629> skilled<00:03:28.989> state<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.530> haven't<00:03:30.489> really

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
hyper skilled state I haven't really

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.119 
hyper skilled state I haven't really
tested<00:03:30.849> it<00:03:31.180> out<00:03:31.329> much<00:03:31.509> yet<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.139> it's<00:03:32.889> supposed

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
tested it out much yet but it's supposed

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.830 
tested it out much yet but it's supposed
to<00:03:33.280> get<00:03:33.579> you<00:03:33.729> at<00:03:33.849> read<00:03:34.060> pretty<00:03:34.299> much<00:03:34.479> all<00:03:34.689> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
on an enemy with a lot of parts like the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.530 
on an enemy with a lot of parts like the

stuff like that I could see it'd be

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.800 
stuff like that I could see it'd be
pretty<00:03:44.889> useful<00:03:45.159> the<00:03:46.090> other<00:03:46.239> stuff<00:03:46.509> that<00:03:46.540> she

Mitama<00:07:41.229> scan<00:07:41.499> befell<00:07:41.769> normally<00:07:42.159> but<00:07:42.849> you<00:07:42.939> may

00:07:43.049 --> 00:07:43.059 
Mitama scan befell normally but you may

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.459 
Mitama scan befell normally but you may
have<00:07:43.089> better<00:07:43.389> luck<00:07:43.629> in<00:07:43.749> the<00:07:43.779> infinite<00:07:44.199> mission

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:44.469 
have better luck in the infinite mission

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:46.949 
have better luck in the infinite mission
which<00:07:44.649> is<00:07:44.860> a<00:07:44.889> lot<00:07:45.669> less<00:07:45.819> frustrating<00:07:46.089> to<00:07:46.719> farm

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:46.959 
which is a lot less frustrating to farm

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:49.109 
which is a lot less frustrating to farm
because<00:07:47.429> even<00:07:48.429> if<00:07:48.519> you<00:07:48.610> don't<00:07:48.789> get<00:07:48.879> what<00:07:49.089> you

00:07:49.109 --> 00:07:49.119 
because even if you don't get what you

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:50.790 
because even if you don't get what you
want<00:07:49.419> you<00:07:49.809> can<00:07:49.959> find<00:07:50.169> something<00:07:50.529> else<00:07:50.619> that

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 
want you can find something else that

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.529 
want you can find something else that
may<00:07:50.919> supplement<00:07:51.129> another<00:07:51.610> bill<00:07:51.849> which<00:07:52.119> i

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:52.539 
may supplement another bill which i

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:54.359 
may supplement another bill which i
think<00:07:52.989> is<00:07:53.199> more<00:07:53.379> fruitful<00:07:53.800> honestly<00:07:54.219> than

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:54.369 
think is more fruitful honestly than

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:55.679 
think is more fruitful honestly than
grinding<00:07:54.699> the<00:07:54.789> same<00:07:54.969> mission<00:07:55.239> over<00:07:55.419> and<00:07:55.539> over

00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:55.689 
grinding the same mission over and over

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:57.779 
grinding the same mission over and over
anyway<00:07:56.529> see<00:07:57.219> you<00:07:57.279> guys<00:07:57.339> tomorrow
