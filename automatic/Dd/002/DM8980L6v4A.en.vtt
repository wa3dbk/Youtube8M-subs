to fit the benefits of that can come

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.730 
to fit the benefits of that can come
close<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> having<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.369> solar<00:01:05.580> panel<00:01:05.790> fitted<00:01:06.740> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
close to having a solar panel fitted so

what<00:01:07.890> actually<00:01:08.189> heats<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.520> panel<00:01:08.939> because

what actually heats up the panel because

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.219 
what actually heats up the panel because
if<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
if you know this you can know how to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
if you know this you can know how to
make<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.439> work<00:01:10.560> its<00:01:11.430> radiation<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> Sun

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
make it work its radiation from the Sun

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
make it work its radiation from the Sun
which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> mixture<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> visible<00:01:13.500> room<00:01:13.680> for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
which is a mixture of visible room for

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.999 
which is a mixture of visible room for
infrared<00:01:14.159> light<00:01:14.460> slightly<00:01:15.150> more<00:01:15.299> visible

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
infrared light slightly more visible

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.289 
infrared light slightly more visible
it's<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> radiation<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> hot<00:01:18.060> air<00:01:18.270> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it's the radiation not the hot air that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.880 
it's the radiation not the hot air that
does<00:01:18.540> most<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> hinting<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
does most of the hinting because the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
does most of the hinting because the
panel<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.250> highly<00:01:20.640> insulated<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> air

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
panel is highly insulated so the air

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
panel is highly insulated so the air
temperature<00:01:21.960> doesn't<00:01:22.200> contribute<00:01:22.560> much<00:01:22.970> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
temperature doesn't contribute much and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.070 
temperature doesn't contribute much and
remember<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.360> our<00:01:24.420> eyes<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.840> light

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
remember that our eyes see light

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.600 
remember that our eyes see light
logarithmically<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
logarithmically so what we think of

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.830 
logarithmically so what we think of
light<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.790> being<00:01:27.090> half<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.479> bright<00:01:27.600> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
light as being half as bright is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
light as being half as bright is
actually<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.229> 10<00:01:28.560> times<00:01:28.799> dinner<00:01:29.040> check<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
actually about 10 times dinner check it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
actually about 10 times dinner check it
with<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.150> light<00:01:30.299> meter<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.820> what

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
with a light meter if you like so what

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.640 
with a light meter if you like so what
boosts<00:01:33.299> energy<00:01:33.390> yield<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:34.350> you'll<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
boosts energy yield when you'll get a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
boosts energy yield when you'll get a
greater<00:01:35.220> yield<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:35.970> there's<00:01:36.119> more<00:01:36.210> Sun<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
greater yield when there's more Sun and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.050 
greater yield when there's more Sun and
when<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> panel<00:01:38.070> costs<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> big<00:01:38.759> shadow

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
