the<00:01:57.050> end<00:01:57.759> then<00:01:58.759> Gavin<00:01:58.970> smoked<00:01:59.450> what<00:01:59.720> he

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
the end then Gavin smoked what he

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.779 
the end then Gavin smoked what he

seems absolutely fine how do you think
you're<00:03:04.069> driving<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:06.370> think<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.610> feels<00:03:08.090> like<00:03:08.360> I'm

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you're driving I think it feels like I'm

concentrating a bit more on what I'm
doing<00:03:13.690> well<00:03:14.690> let's<00:03:14.959> adjust<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.290> because

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
doing well let's adjust it because

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.839 
doing well let's adjust it because
you're<00:03:15.709> not<00:03:15.860> driving<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.430> it's<00:03:16.580> more<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:16.819> less

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
you're not driving so it's more or less

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.100 
you're not driving so it's more or less

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
in the official test subjects were aware

of their impairment and hence drove more

and<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.490> garage<00:03:52.700> test<00:03:53.180> was<00:03:53.390> passed<00:03:53.690> with<00:03:54.020> all

it's<00:04:00.489> hard<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.969> generalize<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:01.689> you<00:04:02.349> did<00:04:02.500> a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
it's hard to generalize but you did a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.110 
it's hard to generalize but you did a
run<00:04:02.769> when<00:04:03.189> you<00:04:03.280> were<00:04:03.370> straight<00:04:03.670> which<00:04:03.909> was

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
run when you were straight which was

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.599 
run when you were straight which was
worse<00:04:04.329> than<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:05.500> how<00:04:06.069> do<00:04:06.129> you<00:04:06.219> feel<00:04:06.400> about

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
worse than that so how do you feel about

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.119 
worse than that so how do you feel about
that<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:07.060> feel<00:04:07.450> good<00:04:07.569> about<00:04:07.689> that<00:04:07.840> yeah<00:04:08.140> was<00:04:09.099> it

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
that I feel good about that yeah was it

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.809 
that I feel good about that yeah was it
easier<00:04:09.579> more<00:04:09.879> difficult<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:11.019> same<00:04:11.819> probably

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
easier more difficult the same probably

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.970 
easier more difficult the same probably
more<00:04:12.969> difficult<00:04:13.530> because<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.680> had<00:04:14.859> to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
more difficult because I had to

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.110 
more difficult because I had to
concentrate<00:04:15.280> more<00:04:15.609> I<00:04:15.700> mean<00:04:15.819> that<00:04:15.969> would<00:04:16.090> be

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
concentrate more I mean that would be

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.520 
concentrate more I mean that would be
cars<00:04:16.509> either<00:04:16.810> side<00:04:16.989> smoother

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
cars either side smoother

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.830 
cars either side smoother
you<00:04:17.739> know<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.070> really<00:04:18.549> don't<00:04:18.729> want<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.970> there's

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
you know I really don't want to there's

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.159 
you know I really don't want to there's
any<00:04:19.959> cars<00:04:20.229> more<00:04:20.560> difficult<00:04:21.009> why<00:04:21.280> did<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:21.910> do

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
any cars more difficult why did you do

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.900 
any cars more difficult why did you do
almost<00:04:23.169> better<00:04:23.410> then<00:04:23.830> than<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.370> did<00:04:24.580> before

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
almost better then than you did before

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.100 
almost better then than you did before
you<00:04:25.180> have<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.750> it's<00:04:26.590> paranoia<00:04:27.130> crossed<00:04:27.550> with

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
you have you it's paranoia crossed with

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.390 
you have you it's paranoia crossed with
concentration<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:29.229> know<00:04:29.350> you're<00:04:30.009> paranoid

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
concentration you know you're paranoid

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.300 
concentration you know you're paranoid
of<00:04:30.580> what<00:04:31.210> might<00:04:31.419> happen<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.710> concentrate

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
of what might happen so you concentrate
