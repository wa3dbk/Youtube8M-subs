cornering<00:01:22.900> they<00:01:23.590> do<00:01:23.650> have<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.070> few<00:01:24.310> downsides

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
cornering they do have a few downsides

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.719 
cornering they do have a few downsides
the<00:01:25.780> first<00:01:26.050> one<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.620> while<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.340> pedal

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
the first one is that while the pedal

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.710 
the first one is that while the pedal
cleat<00:01:28.090> itself<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.960> rather<00:01:29.890> large<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:31.240> surface

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
cleat itself is rather large the surface

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.390 
cleat itself is rather large the surface
area<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.170> which<00:01:32.290> you<00:01:32.350> transfer<00:01:33.040> your<00:01:33.070> power

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
area to which you transfer your power

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.640 
area to which you transfer your power
through<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:33.970> actually<00:01:34.840> on<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.049> small<00:01:35.380> side

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
through is actually on the small side

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.460 
through is actually on the small side
and<00:01:36.010> so<00:01:36.760> this<00:01:37.000> translates<00:01:37.659> into<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:38.020> higher

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
and so this translates into a higher

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.950 
and so this translates into a higher
concentration<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:39.549> energy<00:01:39.760> on<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.210> ball<00:01:40.810> of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
concentration of energy on the ball of

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.719 
concentration of energy on the ball of
your<00:01:40.990> foot<00:01:41.320> or<00:01:41.470> greater<00:01:42.040> pounds<00:01:42.520> per<00:01:42.700> square

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
your foot or greater pounds per square

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.690 
your foot or greater pounds per square
inch<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.420> this<00:01:43.900> can<00:01:44.110> sometimes<00:01:44.380> lead<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.490> hot

spots in softer sole shoes maybe if you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.539 
spots in softer sole shoes maybe if you

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.760 
were writing a carbon sole and you went

to a nylon composite you might find that

to a nylon composite you might find that
your<00:01:53.920> speed<00:01:54.159> plays<00:01:54.340> we're<00:01:54.580> not<00:01:54.790> quite<00:01:55.030> as

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
comfortable a second unless often spoken

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.870 
comfortable a second unless often spoken
about<00:01:58.869> issue<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.280> pedal<00:02:00.640> body

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
about issue is that the pedal body

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.830 
about issue is that the pedal body
itself

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
itself

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.660 
itself
wears<00:02:02.409> through<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.830> lifetime<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.400> pedal

wears through the lifetime of the pedal

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.820 
wears through the lifetime of the pedal
so<00:02:04.360> while<00:02:04.540> other<00:02:04.780> manufacturers<00:02:05.500> allow<00:02:05.770> you
