and he connects of the ball is gonna end

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.260

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
now moving on to shooting he has

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.889 
now moving on to shooting he has
incredibly<00:02:05.549> high<00:02:05.820> shot<00:02:06.119> power<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:06.659> means

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
incredibly high shot power which means

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
incredibly high shot power which means

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
likely finish because the goalkeeper

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.710 
likely finish because the goalkeeper
will<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.220> blind<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.670> those<00:02:11.879> shots<00:02:12.180> they<00:02:12.360> travel

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
just pretty much it for his advantages

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.580 
just pretty much it for his advantages
now<00:02:38.340> his<00:02:38.550> negatives<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.330> he<00:02:39.750> had<00:02:39.930> he's<00:02:40.290> just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
now his negatives or he had he's just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.860 
now his negatives or he had he's just
difficult<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.280> dribble<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> ball<00:02:41.940> with<00:02:42.150> his

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
difficult to dribble the ball with his

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.380 
difficult to dribble the ball with his
first<00:02:43.200> touch<00:02:43.440> isn't<00:02:43.770> too<00:02:44.190> great<00:02:44.430> evil<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.180> if

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
first touch isn't too great evil so if

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.820 
first touch isn't too great evil so if
you<00:02:45.750> want<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.960> dribble<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.620> guy

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
you want to dribble with this guy

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.800 
you want to dribble with this guy
anything<00:02:47.310> outside<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.760> penalty<00:02:47.880> area<00:02:48.150> he

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
anything outside the penalty area he

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.350 
anything outside the penalty area he
seems<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.560> most<00:02:49.860> likely<00:02:49.980> useless<00:02:50.820> he's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
seems to be most likely useless he's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360 
seems to be most likely useless he's
just<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.260> clinical<00:02:52.500> finisher<00:02:53.190> if<00:02:53.280> you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
just more of a clinical finisher if you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.280 
just more of a clinical finisher if you
know<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.520> mean<00:02:53.820> he<00:02:54.180> also<00:02:54.360> has<00:02:54.690> medium<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
know I mean he also has medium and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.930 
know I mean he also has medium and
medium<00:02:55.410> works<00:02:55.800> which<00:02:56.190> means<00:02:56.459> he<00:02:56.580> rarely<00:02:56.790> makes

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
medium works which means he rarely makes

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.180 
medium works which means he rarely makes
runs<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.660> positioning<00:02:58.530> why's<00:02:58.740> he<00:02:59.010> is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
runs and positioning why's he is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.730 
runs and positioning why's he is
frequently<00:02:59.880> out<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.330> position<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.560> can

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
frequently out of position so if you can

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.710 
frequently out of position so if you can
handle<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.190> or<00:03:02.459> if<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.730> can't<00:03:03.360> handle<00:03:03.540> your

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
handle that or if you can't handle your

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.480 
handle that or if you can't handle your
striker<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.350> our<00:03:04.500> position<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.100> would

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
striker be in our position I would

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.800 
striker be in our position I would
suggest<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:06.060> move<00:03:06.209> him<00:03:06.360> down<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:06.750> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
suggest you move him down for a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.080 
suggest you move him down for a
centerfold<00:03:07.380> position<00:03:07.890> because<00:03:08.490> he<00:03:08.700> will<00:03:08.910> be

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
centerfold position because he will be

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
centerfold position because he will be
so<00:03:09.420> deadly<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.170> position<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.800> you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
so deadly in that position and you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.590 
so deadly in that position and you
wouldn't<00:03:11.520> have<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> worry<00:03:12.030> about<00:03:12.180> him<00:03:12.450> being

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
wouldn't have to worry about him being

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.199 
wouldn't have to worry about him being
out<00:03:12.750> position<00:03:13.290> all<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.830> time<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:15.120> is

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
out position all the time so that is

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.520 
out position all the time so that is
