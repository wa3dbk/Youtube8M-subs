00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the key goes and I'm not sure what

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.880

that's<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.590> about

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that's all about

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
that's all about
I<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.730> read<00:00:48.360> something<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I think I read something about it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.959 
I think I read something about it
popping<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.469> making<00:00:49.829> contacts<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.850> when

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
popping out making contacts I think when

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.410 
popping out making contacts I think when
you<00:00:51.059> turn<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> switch<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.199> pops<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
you turn the switch on that pops out and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.290 
you turn the switch on that pops out and
then<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.570> ignition<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> cable

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
then your ignition is on but the cable

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.880 
then your ignition is on but the cable
runs<00:00:57.690> directly<00:00:58.020> into<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> back<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
runs directly into the back of that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.939 
runs directly into the back of that
ignition<00:00:59.460> switch<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.680> haven't

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
ignition switch and it has I haven't

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.429 
ignition switch and it has I haven't
taken<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.280> apart<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.940> has<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> threaded<00:01:03.629> little

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
taken it apart it has a threaded little

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.100 
taken it apart it has a threaded little
cable<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.369> rod<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> inside<00:01:06.479> that's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
cable or rod on the inside that's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.500 
cable or rod on the inside that's
threaded<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> end<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.240> supposed

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
threaded on the end so that's supposed

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.480 
threaded on the end so that's supposed
to<00:01:09.720> bolt<00:01:09.990> onto<00:01:10.200> something<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.010> something

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
to bolt onto something and do something

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.179 
to bolt onto something and do something

together<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.329> baling<00:02:03.479> wire<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.049> held

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
together with baling wire is held

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.160 
together with baling wire is held
together<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.590> rust<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.600> decided<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
together with rust and I decided to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.710 
together with rust and I decided to
start<00:02:07.439> saving<00:02:07.829> wire<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.599> this

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720

thing and I think it'll be interesting
I'll<00:02:12.420> wire

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
I'll wire

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.789 
I'll wire
have<00:02:13.689> when<00:02:14.200> I'm<00:02:14.319> done<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:18.250> sparkplug<00:02:18.879> uh

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
have when I'm done and go sparkplug uh

have when I'm done and go sparkplug uh
you<00:02:20.799> think<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.189> old<00:02:21.400> body<00:02:21.610> maybe<00:02:21.939> needs<00:02:22.239> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
you think this old body maybe needs a
