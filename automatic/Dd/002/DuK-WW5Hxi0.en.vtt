hens and ducks here so we have them on
hand<00:00:22.259> all<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.099> to<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.669> outside<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
hand all I have to do is go outside to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.269 
hand all I have to do is go outside to
the<00:00:24.270> nest<00:00:24.509> and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.199> mark<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.650> couple<00:00:25.860> of<00:00:26.070> eggs

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the nest and I mark a couple of eggs

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.100 
the nest and I mark a couple of eggs
with<00:00:26.520> a<00:00:26.550> sharpie<00:00:27.000> marker<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.450> I<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.779> leave

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
with a sharpie marker so I know to leave

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.229 
with a sharpie marker so I know to leave
those<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.219> hens<00:00:29.430> go<00:00:29.700> back<00:00:29.879> every

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
those there and the hens go back every

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.970 
those there and the hens go back every
day<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.750> lay<00:00:30.989> their<00:00:31.169> eggs<00:00:31.379> in<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.770> same

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
day and they lay their eggs in the same

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 
day and they lay their eggs in the same
spot<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.850> makes<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.210> lot<00:00:33.420> easier<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:33.930> us

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
spot so it makes it a lot easier for us

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.410 
spot so it makes it a lot easier for us
to<00:00:34.320> find<00:00:34.590> them<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:35.879> eggs<00:00:36.059> put

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to find them now you get your eggs put

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
to find them now you get your eggs put
them<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.600> some<00:00:36.780> water<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> saucepan<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
them in some water in a saucepan on the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
them in some water in a saucepan on the
stove<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:39.030> gonna<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.539> up<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.840> high

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
stove and I'm gonna put this up to high

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.439 
stove and I'm gonna put this up to high
heat<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.500> cover<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.969> want<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> bring

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
heat I cover it up and I want to bring

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.840 
heat I cover it up and I want to bring
this<00:00:42.659> up<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.109> boil<00:00:43.429> that'll<00:00:44.429> probably<00:00:44.579> take

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this up to a boil that'll probably take

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.759 
this up to a boil that'll probably take
a<00:00:45.059> couple<00:00:45.179> of<00:00:45.510> minutes<00:00:45.839> but<00:00:46.019> once<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.409> comes<00:00:46.620> up

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
a couple of minutes but once it comes up

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.099 
a couple of minutes but once it comes up
to<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> boil<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> lid<00:00:47.969> back<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.269> and<00:00:48.749> you

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
to a boil put the lid back on and you

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.989 
to a boil put the lid back on and you
want<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> shut<00:00:49.679> the<00:00:49.890> stove<00:00:50.159> off<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> point

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
want to shut the stove off at this point

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.419 
want to shut the stove off at this point
but<00:00:51.329> leave<00:00:51.569> it<00:00:51.600> right<00:00:51.929> where<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.289> set<00:00:53.249> your

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
but leave it right where it was set your

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.910 
but leave it right where it was set your
timer<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.059> 10<00:00:54.390> minutes<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.079> let<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.739> go

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
timer for 10 minutes and just let it go

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
timer for 10 minutes and just let it go
with<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.519> lid<00:00:56.729> on<00:00:56.909> and<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.449> touch<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.929> once

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
with the lid on and don't touch it once

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
with the lid on and don't touch it once
that's<00:00:58.649> done<00:00:58.949> it'll<00:00:59.309> look<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.729> that<00:00:59.909> I<00:01:00.210> take

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that's done it'll look like that I take

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.059 
that's done it'll look like that I take
it<00:01:01.050> over<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.379> my<00:01:01.530> sink

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
it over to my sink

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.770 
it over to my sink
now<00:01:02.249> I'm<00:01:02.339> gonna<00:01:02.519> drain<00:01:02.879> off<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.269> this<00:01:03.539> hot

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
now I'm gonna drain off all this hot

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.350 
now I'm gonna drain off all this hot
water<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.850> rinse<00:01:06.120> it<00:01:06.300> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
water and then I just like to rinse it a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
water and then I just like to rinse it a
few<00:01:06.570> times<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.990> some<00:01:07.170> cool<00:01:07.409> water<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:08.130> make

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
few times with some cool water to make

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
few times with some cool water to make
the<00:01:08.430> eggs<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:09.180> bit<00:01:09.299> cooler<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the eggs a little bit cooler so that I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130 
the eggs a little bit cooler so that I
can<00:01:10.380> start<00:01:10.620> handling<00:01:11.130> them<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.520> peel<00:01:11.700> them<00:01:12.140> not

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
can start handling them to peel them not

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140 
can start handling them to peel them not
to<00:01:13.260> peel<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> eggs<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.980> super<00:01:14.370> easy<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.850> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to peel the eggs it's super easy I just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.430 
to peel the eggs it's super easy I just
like<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> hit<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> counter<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.260> few

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
like to hit it on the counter a few

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.230 
like to hit it on the counter a few
times<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.920> crack<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.310> shell<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:17.730> then

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
times to crack the shell and then

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
times to crack the shell and then
applying<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:18.990> downward<00:01:19.200> pressure<00:01:19.410> I<00:01:19.890> roll

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
applying some downward pressure I roll

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
applying some downward pressure I roll
it<00:01:20.400> back<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.640> forth<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.300> look<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it back and forth I look to see that the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050 
it back and forth I look to see that the
shell<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.740> cracked<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> way<00:01:23.550> around<00:01:23.850> if

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
shell is cracked all the way around if

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.520 
shell is cracked all the way around if
there's<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.480> area<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.870> hasn't<00:01:25.110> been<00:01:25.320> cracked

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
there's an area that hasn't been cracked

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
there's an area that hasn't been cracked
go<00:01:26.070> ahead<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.430> give<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.550> another<00:01:26.850> roll<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
go ahead and give it another roll and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.180 
go ahead and give it another roll and
this<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.990> help<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> shell<00:01:28.500> come<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:28.830> pretty

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
this will help the shell come off pretty

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.280 
this will help the shell come off pretty
easily<00:01:29.580> usually<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.360> couple<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.720> pieces<00:01:30.930> or

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
easily usually in a couple of pieces or

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.320 
easily usually in a couple of pieces or
so<00:01:31.470> once<00:01:32.160> that's<00:01:32.430> done<00:01:32.640> you're<00:01:32.910> ready<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
so once that's done you're ready to
