tractor over in the UK which is what it

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120 
tractor over in the UK which is what it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
goes with over there or over here in the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.609 
goes with over there or over here in the
US<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:24.119> ships<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.480> Virtual<00:00:24.869> DJ<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.500> they're

both<00:00:26.000> mapped<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> controller<00:00:27.869> perfectly

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
both mapped to the controller perfectly

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.390 
both mapped to the controller perfectly
so<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.160> any<00:00:29.340> additional

so you don't have to do any additional

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.049 
so you don't have to do any additional
mapping<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.330> anything<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:32.059> from

player you're able to do it that way

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
player you're able to do it that way
some<00:01:22.920> similarities<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.550> differences

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
some similarities and differences

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.960 
some similarities and differences
between<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.480> and<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.690> 6000<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.850> 6000<00:01:26.850> has

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
between this and the 6000 the 6000 has

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.790 
between this and the 6000 the 6000 has
your<00:01:27.240> four<00:01:27.510> hot<00:01:27.810> cues<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.380> then<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.650> would

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
your four hot cues and then you would

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.590 
your four hot cues and then you would
shift<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.090> samples

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
shift and you would get your samples

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.110 
shift and you would get your samples
while<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.050> here<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.580> your<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.910> through

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
while on here you have your one through

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.880 
while on here you have your one through
four<00:01:33.300> hot<00:01:33.540> cues<00:01:33.870> and<00:01:34.080> then<00:01:34.170> switch<00:01:34.470> here

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
four hot cues and then switch here

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.200 
four hot cues and then switch here
and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.580> have<00:01:35.700> five<00:01:35.910> through<00:01:36.150> eight

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
and then you have five through eight

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
and then you have five through eight
Virtual<00:01:37.140> DJ<00:01:37.260> allows<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.830> have<00:01:37.920> eight<00:01:38.100> hot

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
Virtual DJ allows you to have eight hot

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.280 
Virtual DJ allows you to have eight hot
cues<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.910> then<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:39.420> sampler<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.080> your

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
cues and then your sampler and your

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.960 
cues and then your sampler and your
effects<00:01:40.620> is<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.040> done<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.820> it's

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
effects is all done up here so it's

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
effects is all done up here so it's
separated<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.470> three<00:01:43.650> thousand

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
separated this time the three thousand

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
separated this time the three thousand
verses<00:01:44.730> where<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.360> combined<00:01:46.080> on<00:01:46.200> the
