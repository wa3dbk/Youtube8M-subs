 adventure and the number 189 in total the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.859
 the plot of this chapter was waiting for a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 little more revealing however it was a 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.779
 chapter very good the episode is about 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 that after a meeting with a dream 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.160
 chilling end and jake are determined 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.390
 to reconnect with his brother 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 solitary curiosities this episode is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.520
 premiered first in australia on 16 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.059
 March are two episodes in a row that are 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 premiere in another country that is not USA is 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.190
 the fifth episode that does not premiere 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.680
 first in the USA being the other four 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.079
 one last job evergreen astral plane 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.239
 and friends forever in jake's dream 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.820
 when he sees German disguised as 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.580
 bear in his ears you can observe two 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.750
 tombstones with the letters j the joshua and m 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.070
 margaret print 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.990
 in each analysis and theories what 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.730
 first thing we noticed in the chapter is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.010
 that jake's imagination is something 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.870
 crazy this is not new we already had 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.240
 seen before but what I want to highlight 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.460
 is that maybe jake has a power with 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.890
 the dreams you will tell me that because 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.050
 the reason is that jane has 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.330
 demonstrated throughout the series that 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.850
 he is a wise man about dreams but as 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.190
 affirmed this to what came with this is 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 that jake could communicate with jermaine 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.509
 through the dream call it you are 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.550
 telepathy something else but jay managed 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.710
 do it with your own mind converse 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.690
 with your brother it may be that or 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.369
 simply the conversation he had 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.950
 jake with jermaine and nobody has been a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.160
 simple dream thing that destroys my theory 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.410
 previous very easy the first intrigue 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.020
 that the chapter left me is that what the hell 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.420
 was ending with that machine that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 was that my mind failed to give a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.440
 logical medium explanation so I guess 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 that it may be some kind of 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.640
 extraterrestrial technology or something from 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.380
 new technology that is finally being manufactured 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.230
 what made me guess about the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.420
 extraterrestrial technology was that he had 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.000
 of UFO that there was a recording of a 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.610
 hologram saved on it and end says no 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.620
 he managed to decipher this to what he can 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.080
 to refer is that he does not understand the message 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.360
 of the hologram but this theory I 'm not 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 very much in agreement with her since from where 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.580
 Rays would bring technology 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.290
 extraterrestrial thing that is very illogical 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.390
 one thing that I liked about the episode was 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.519
 that we finally saw Joshua's house and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.430
 margaret apart from what we saw in the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.620
 chapter memory of a memory being 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.560
 sincere the house as it was yesterday main 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.180
 it was unfortunately this can be 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.579
 have been one of the few parts 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.920
 revealing of the episode 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.230
 in this chapter we saw that joshua was a 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.870
 creature collector and fence that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.819
 they were too much that was for a long time 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.879
 time the stress and responsibility of 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.769
 jermaine I do not know about you but I noticed that 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.260
 Jake refers to the final game 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.660
 fantasy 7 when he has a sword 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.359
 similar not to say identical to that of 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.459
 'cloud and jake says he expects you to do a 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.100
 triple combo with this doing more 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.140
 reference to the aforementioned game 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.120
 going from the serious side to me yes that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.950
 It hurt the bite in the crotch that 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.130
 he did germain to jake to me I did not 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.020
 like a bite there xd after 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.630
 the little fight between jake and jermaine 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.610
 it starts to burn the house I do not know if I am 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.530
 the only one who did not like or felt bad 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.110
 that the house of Joshua and 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.360
 margaret since it is or was a place 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.580
 important in this series and when 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.820
 We finally managed to see it as if we were 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.160
 he says we were just getting to know 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.990
 end of the episode germain reflects and 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.690
 he goes away accomplice to live his own 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.090
 adventures in the purest style and jake 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.950
 what made me assume that in some 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.420
 future episode make things stand out 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.930
 here I will only say the things of which 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.670
 I'm sure to avoid tangles later 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.680
 The first thing that I found curious was 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.170
 that was what I was doing with 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.450
 that machine not as much as he got it 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.330
 but rather what was its purpose with 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.910
 because Germain wore a suit of 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.220
 bear at first I thought there could be 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.620
 It was just part of Jake's dream but 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.540
 in the end we realized that no 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.090
 they still do not tell us what or why 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.760
 they died I am margaret most likely 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.310
 is that in the future we know in 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.260
 conclusion was a good chapter of the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.330
 I was waiting for a long time 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.570
 good quality time it has 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.430
