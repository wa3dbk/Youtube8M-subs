firewire I have two pcs you this is the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.190 
firewire I have two pcs you this is the
windows<00:00:08.940> XP<00:00:09.059> machine<00:00:09.570> which<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.870> currently

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
windows XP machine which is currently

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.520 
windows XP machine which is currently
locked<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.460> ubuntu<00:00:11.969> machine

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
locked and this is my ubuntu machine

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.939 
locked and this is my ubuntu machine
which<00:00:13.530> will<00:00:13.740> act<00:00:13.860> as<00:00:14.009> an<00:00:14.130> attacker<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:15.949> prove

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
which will act as an attacker to prove

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.920 
which will act as an attacker to prove
you<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.460> windows<00:00:17.820> pc<00:00:18.240> does<00:00:18.539> really

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
you that the windows pc does really

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.210 
you that the windows pc does really
require<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> password<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.560> it<00:00:22.560> asked<00:00:22.769> me<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
require a password so it asked me for a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.009 
require a password so it asked me for a
password<00:00:27.470> input<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.769> password<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.400> unlocked

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
password input the password is unlocked

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.819 
password input the password is unlocked
just<00:00:31.019> lock<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:32.300> on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> other<00:00:34.380> side<00:00:34.800> i

necessary tools installed to perform the
attack<00:00:41.300> I<00:00:42.300> already<00:00:42.930> set<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.430> can

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
attack I already set it up so as you can

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.060 
attack I already set it up so as you can
see<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.600> firewire<00:00:46.289> port<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> now

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
see here the firewire port is now

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.459 
see here the firewire port is now
configured<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> clear<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
configured now if this is clear on the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.750 
configured now if this is clear on the
screen<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.899> configure<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.340> show<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.610> an

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
screen to configure it to show up as an

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.630 
screen to configure it to show up as an
ipod<00:00:54.170> in<00:00:55.170> Windows<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.190> connect<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
ipod in Windows so let's now connect the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.420 
ipod in Windows so let's now connect the
cable<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.600> windows<00:01:01.020> pc<00:01:06.770> as<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> hear<00:01:08.189> it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
cable to the windows pc as you hear it's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.530 
cable to the windows pc as you hear it's
being<00:01:09.150> detected<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.580> let's<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.850> run<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
being detected and let's now run the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.280 
being detected and let's now run the
tool<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> check<00:01:13.260> what's<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> bus<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
tool to check what's on the bus so you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
tool to check what's on the bus so you
can<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.040> detecting<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> computer<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
can see it's detecting the computer and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
can see it's detecting the computer and
we<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:20.040> connection<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.729> poor<00:01:21.030> microsoft

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
we have connection to poor microsoft

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.160 
we have connection to poor microsoft
operating<00:01:21.659> system<00:01:22.490> now<00:01:23.490> let's<00:01:24.060> load<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
operating system now let's load the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.460 
operating system now let's load the
attack<00:01:25.650> tool<00:01:26.240> first<00:01:27.240> I'm<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> order<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
attack tool first I'm going to order to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.649 
attack tool first I'm going to order to
add<00:01:28.590> options<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.220> basically<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
add options so basically that there is

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.950 
add options so basically that there is
four<00:01:30.960> targets<00:01:31.290> available<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.220> tool

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
four targets available in this tool

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.980 
four targets available in this tool
against<00:01:33.960> various<00:01:35.119> ways<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> unlock<00:01:36.750> the

against various ways to unlock the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260 
against various ways to unlock the
password<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> account<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> use

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
password of the account I'm going to use

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600 
password of the account I'm going to use
a<00:01:39.299> third<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.460> patching<00:01:41.460> an

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
a third one which is patching an

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
a third one which is patching an
in-memory<00:01:41.970> dll<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:45.149> users<00:01:45.360> from<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
in-memory dll so that all users from the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.630 
in-memory dll so that all users from the
windows<00:01:45.869> machine<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:47.159> log<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.520> without

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
windows machine can log in without

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.950 
windows machine can log in without
passwords<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.340> up

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
passwords so I'm going to just this up

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
passwords so I'm going to just this up
okay<00:01:53.930> as<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.310> sky<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
okay as you can see now it is a sky in a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.160 
okay as you can see now it is a sky in a
memory<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> signature<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> dl

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.800 

usually<00:02:03.979> takes<00:02:04.250> about<00:02:04.400> 10<00:02:04.909> seconds<00:02:07.720> there<00:02:08.720> it

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
usually takes about 10 seconds there it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.150 
usually takes about 10 seconds there it
is<00:02:08.899> 13<00:02:09.739> seconds<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.429> it's<00:02:10.970> worked<00:02:11.660> okay<00:02:12.470> so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
is 13 seconds and it's worked okay so

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
needed the attack word now when i reboot

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.870 
needed the attack word now when i reboot
the<00:02:24.110> pc<00:02:24.410> will<00:02:24.620> come<00:02:24.800> back<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.190> with<00:02:25.400> with<00:02:25.850> a

the pc will come back on with with a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.600 
the pc will come back on with with a
password<00:02:26.120> but<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.830> just<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.190> show<00:02:28.220> that

password but this is just to show that
the<00:02:28.850> fire<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.630> really<00:02:29.959> attack<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.100> windows

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
the fire can really attack the windows

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.480 
the fire can really attack the windows
memory<00:02:32.920> okay<00:02:33.920> hope<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.550> learn<00:02:34.670> something<00:02:34.700> by
