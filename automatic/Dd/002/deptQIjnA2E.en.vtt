whatever you guys want you guys could
buy<00:01:08.010> different<00:01:08.340> guns<00:01:08.549> try<00:01:08.939> no<00:01:09.000> perks<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.200> know

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
buy different guns try no perks you know

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
buy different guns try no perks you know
open<00:01:10.619> different<00:01:10.890> doors<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.400> essentially<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
open different doors but essentially the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
open different doors but essentially the
game<00:01:12.210> ends<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.900> die<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> think

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
game ends when you all die now I think

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.109 
game ends when you all die now I think
this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> things<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this is kind of one of the things that

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
this is kind of one of the things that
kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.360> kills<00:01:15.600> zombies<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.860> know

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
kind of kills zombies you know you know

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.920 
kind of kills zombies you know you know
no<00:01:17.250> pun<00:01:17.640> intended<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:18.150> killing<00:01:18.420> zombies<00:01:18.750> but

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
no pun intended was killing zombies but

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
no pun intended was killing zombies but
it<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.740> ruined<00:01:20.040> zombies<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> guys

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it just ruined zombies because you guys

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.429 
it just ruined zombies because you guys
can<00:01:20.820> never<00:01:20.850> win<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> game<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
can never win the game I don't think it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
can never win the game I don't think it
should<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.680> something<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.100> extinction

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
should be something like extinction

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
should be something like extinction
where<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.840> guys<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.229> only<00:01:25.470> main<00:01:25.799> objective

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
where you guys the only main objective

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
where you guys the only main objective
is<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.820> alive<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.360> honestly<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is to get out alive because honestly I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.929 
is to get out alive because honestly I
think<00:01:28.140> extinction<00:01:28.950> tried<00:01:29.220> too<00:01:29.460> hard<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.850> be

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
think extinction tried too hard to be

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.030 
think extinction tried too hard to be
like<00:01:30.060> zombies<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.799> failed

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
like zombies and it just kind of failed

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.190 
like zombies and it just kind of failed
i<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.490> i<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.210> enjoy<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> i

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
i think i really do not enjoy it and i

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
i think i really do not enjoy it and i
guess<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> reason<00:01:35.340> why<00:01:35.520> i<00:01:35.579> didn't<00:01:35.820> enjoy<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
guess the reason why i didn't enjoy it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.850 
guess the reason why i didn't enjoy it
was<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.200> reason<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.680> they

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
was just you know that reason was they

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.319 
was just you know that reason was they
were<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.070> trying<00:01:38.430> too<00:01:38.700> hard<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.060> make<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
were just trying too hard to make it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
were just trying too hard to make it
like<00:01:39.420> zombies<00:01:39.900> make<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> their<00:01:40.770> own<00:01:40.799> version

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
like zombies make it their own version

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.789 
like zombies make it their own version
of<00:01:41.520> zombies<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.420> harder<00:01:42.960> survival

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
of zombies but with a harder survival

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
of zombies but with a harder survival
mode<00:01:44.130> incorporate<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> game<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
mode incorporate into the game so you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.730 
mode incorporate into the game so you
guys<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.840> basically<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.500> get<00:01:46.619> out

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
guys it's basically have to get out

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.380 
guys it's basically have to get out
alive<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.240> these

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
alive and you have to take all these

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
alive and you have to take all these
little<00:01:48.570> challenges<00:01:49.110> along<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> way<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
little challenges along the way to

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.620 
little challenges along the way to
survive<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:51.119> didn't<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.570> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
survive so I just didn't like that I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
survive so I just didn't like that I
think<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.079> Ombey<00:01:52.380> i<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.649> how<00:01:52.770> zombies<00:01:52.979> has

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
think it's Ombey i like how zombies has

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.770 
think it's Ombey i like how zombies has
no<00:01:53.490> objective<00:01:53.820> except<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> stay<00:01:54.479> alive<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
no objective except to stay alive it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
no objective except to stay alive it's
be<00:01:54.899> possibly<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.100> should<00:01:56.280> give<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
be possibly can but they should give you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.100 
be possibly can but they should give you
guys<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> way<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> either<00:01:57.090> buy<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.540> way<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.780> or

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
incorporate some kind of thing in the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
incorporate some kind of thing in the
map<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.750> instance<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.110> ascension<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
map so for instance like ascension you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.080

shall<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.890> take<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> lunar<00:02:02.340> lander<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.000> out

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
shall I take a lunar lander and get out

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.639 
shall I take a lunar lander and get out
of<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.210> live<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.780> take<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> rocket<00:02:04.380> somehow

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
of there live or take the rocket somehow

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.289 
of there live or take the rocket somehow
and<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:06.090> don't<00:02:06.119> need

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and get out of there but they don't need

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.020 
and get out of there but they don't need
to<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.479> steps<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.439> extremely<00:02:08.030> hard

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
to have steps or you know extremely hard

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.550 
to have steps or you know extremely hard
steps<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.929> need<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
steps I think they just need to have a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.680 
steps I think they just need to have a
very<00:02:10.920> high<00:02:11.099> round<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.970> may<00:02:12.180> spend<00:02:12.450> some

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
very high round and you may spend some

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.290 
very high round and you may spend some
money<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.080> get

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
money to get

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.000 
money to get
