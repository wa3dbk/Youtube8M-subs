contract<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.380> energy<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:26.549> I<00:02:26.639> become<00:02:28.280> violent

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
contract the energy and I become violent

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.670 
contract the energy and I become violent
how<00:02:31.590> about<00:02:31.859> this<00:02:32.420> making<00:02:33.420> myself<00:02:33.600> non<00:02:34.139> solid

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
how about this making myself non solid

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.260 
how about this making myself non solid
as<00:02:34.920> easily<00:02:35.519> as<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.850> can

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.570 

I'm<00:02:40.270> even<00:02:40.810> able<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.230> admit<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.740> own<00:02:41.770> flying<00:02:42.310> cow

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
I'm even able to admit my own flying cow

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.730 
I'm even able to admit my own flying cow
so<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.390> don't<00:02:43.600> need<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> flight<00:02:44.170> ring<00:02:44.440> like<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
so I don't need a flight ring like the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:56.640 
so I don't need a flight ring like the
rest<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:46.110> energy<00:02:48.150> that's<00:02:49.150> me

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.130 

just<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.800> moment<00:02:58.310> you're<00:02:59.300> telling<00:02:59.660> us<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.960> can

just a moment you're telling us you can

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.100 
just a moment you're telling us you can
duplicate<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.830> powers<00:03:01.220> we<00:03:01.400> already<00:03:01.880> have<00:03:02.210> so

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
duplicate the powers we already have so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.110 
duplicate the powers we already have so
far<00:03:03.380> yes<00:03:03.890> but<00:03:06.460> you<00:03:07.460> see<00:03:07.670> right<00:03:07.910> now<00:03:08.090> my

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
far yes but you see right now my
