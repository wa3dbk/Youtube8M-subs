00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
without my camera and so I just had my

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.300 
without my camera and so I just had my
camera<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.450> me<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> birth<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.500 
just took it out as soon as the baby was
born<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> asked<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.729> client<00:01:12.119> wanted<00:01:12.360> me

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.510 
born and I asked if my client wanted me
to<00:01:12.780> shoot<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.680> photographs<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.220> she<00:01:14.369> did

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to shoot some photographs and she did

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
to shoot some photographs and she did
and<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.330> did<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and so I just did that it's just a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.810 
and so I just did that it's just a
natural<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.680> i<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.860> i<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:18.200> always<00:01:19.820> take

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
natural thing i do i just always take

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.280 
natural thing i do i just always take
out<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.119> camera<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.570> doesn't<00:01:21.600> even<00:01:21.900> matter<00:01:22.110> if

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

my<00:01:25.229> camera<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.530> me<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.040> an<00:01:26.159> extension

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
my camera with me it's like an extension

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.120 
my camera with me it's like an extension
of<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.970> arm<00:01:28.549> several<00:01:29.549> months<00:01:29.790> ago<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:31.130> decided

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of my arm several months ago I decided

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.880 
of my arm several months ago I decided
to<00:01:32.430> sort<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> overcome<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.659> fear<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> painting

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to sort of overcome my fear of painting

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.200 
to sort of overcome my fear of painting
because<00:01:35.280> painting<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.759> something<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.090> I'd

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
because painting is something that I'd

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
because painting is something that I'd
always<00:01:36.479> wanted<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.700> was<00:01:38.700> I've<00:01:39.150> always

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
always wanted to do I was I've always

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
always wanted to do I was I've always
been<00:01:39.630> drawn<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.170> I've<00:01:40.320> always<00:01:40.530> bought

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
been drawn to it I've always bought

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.719 
been drawn to it I've always bought
canvases<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> bought<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.630> paints<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
canvases and bought some paints and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.780 
canvases and bought some paints and
never<00:01:44.729> painted<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:46.159> started<00:01:47.159> something<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
never painted or started something and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
never painted or started something and
painted<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> couple<00:01:48.659> hours<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> stopped

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
painted for a couple hours and stopped

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.710 
painted for a couple hours and stopped
because<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:50.159> know<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.369> I'm<00:01:50.460> doing<00:01:50.729> I've

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
because I don't know what I'm doing I've

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
because I don't know what I'm doing I've
never<00:01:52.020> been<00:01:52.290> trained<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.950> basically<00:01:53.700> just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
never been trained and basically just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
never been trained and basically just
winging<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> needed<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.829> figure<00:01:56.189> out

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
winging it and so I needed to figure out

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.300 
winging it and so I needed to figure out
a<00:01:56.610> feasible<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> push<00:01:58.409> myself<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:59.070> paint

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
a feasible way to push myself to paint

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.060 
a feasible way to push myself to paint
you<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.320> huge<00:02:01.740> income

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you know I I don't have a huge income

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310 
you know I I don't have a huge income
and<00:02:02.460> large<00:02:03.060> canvases<00:02:03.570> cost<00:02:03.840> quite<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> bit<00:02:04.140> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
money and there was just something

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.470 
money and there was just something
driving<00:02:06.479> me<00:02:06.570> though<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.049> need<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
them which was even more crazy to me

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.720 
them which was even more crazy to me
because<00:02:47.350> for<00:02:47.860> me<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.010> wasn't<00:02:48.190> really<00:02:48.550> about

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
because for me it wasn't really about

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.070 
because for me it wasn't really about
people<00:02:48.970> liking<00:02:49.300> them<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> end<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.990> was

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
people liking them in the end it was

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.050 
people liking them in the end it was
just<00:02:50.230> about<00:02:50.380> like<00:02:50.560> getting<00:02:51.160> over<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.670> block

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
just about like getting over that block

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.460 
just about like getting over that block
of<00:02:52.270> not<00:02:53.140> knowing<00:02:53.610> how<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.640> paint<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.210> not

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
of not knowing how to paint and not

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.780 
of not knowing how to paint and not
trusting<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.830> could<00:02:57.010> paint<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:57.700> I'm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
trusting that I could paint and so I'm

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.870 
trusting that I could paint and so I'm
doing<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.120> again<00:02:59.280> for<00:03:00.280> sort<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.550> like<00:03:00.700> my

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880

had to turn people away because I've had
so<00:03:06.790> much<00:03:06.910> interest<00:03:07.500> for<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:08.680> which<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.070> just

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340
