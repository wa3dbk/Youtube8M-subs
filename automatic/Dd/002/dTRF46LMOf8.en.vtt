hey<00:00:00.240> guys<00:00:00.480> it's<00:00:00.810> just<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.110> little<00:00:01.260> experiment<00:00:01.979> I

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hey guys it's just a little experiment I

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.490 
hey guys it's just a little experiment I
did<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.550> see<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.120> fast<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.750> mini<00:00:03.929> Baja<00:00:04.140> would

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
did to see how fast the mini Baja would

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.019 
did to see how fast the mini Baja would
be<00:00:04.620> without<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.130> jack<00:00:05.370> shaft

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
be without the jack shaft

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.040 
be without the jack shaft
I<00:00:07.820> replaced<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.000> tent<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.450> sprocket<00:00:09.929> with<00:00:10.019> a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
I replaced the tent to sprocket with a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.580 
I replaced the tent to sprocket with a
22<00:00:10.679> socket<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.240> see<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.440> they're

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
22 socket you can see here so they're

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.169 
22 socket you can see here so they're
both<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> same<00:00:13.920> size<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.820> pretty<00:00:15.000> much

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
both the same size which is pretty much

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.760 
both the same size which is pretty much
the<00:00:15.299> same<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.900> removing<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.320> jack<00:00:16.590> shaft

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the same as just removing the jack shaft

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.109 
the same as just removing the jack shaft
and<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.160> right<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> clutch<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.880> back

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and going right to clutch the back

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.740 
and going right to clutch the back
sprocket<00:00:18.840> there's<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.980> old<00:00:20.130> one<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.750> there's

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
sprocket there's the old one and there's

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.310 
sprocket there's the old one and there's
a<00:00:21.840> new<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:23.150> see<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.180> much<00:00:24.660> difference<00:00:25.170> in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
a new one see how much difference in

00:00:25.320 --> 00:01:35.370 
a new one see how much difference in
speed<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> makes

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.560 

so<00:01:36.310> as<00:01:36.400> you<00:01:36.490> can<00:01:36.610> see<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.909> pot<00:01:37.119> event<00:01:37.450> is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
so as you can see the pot event is

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.260 
so as you can see the pot event is
pretty<00:01:37.810> much<00:01:37.960> gone<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.820> while<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.119> get

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
pretty much gone it's a while to get

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.830 
pretty much gone it's a while to get
going<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.790> there's<00:01:43.060> definitely<00:01:43.270> way<00:01:43.810> more

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
going but there's definitely way more

00:01:43.840 --> 00:02:29.500 
going but there's definitely way more
talking

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.289 

instead<00:02:30.230> there's<00:02:30.439> some<00:02:31.099> off-roading<00:02:31.670> with<00:02:31.939> it

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.940 

you<00:02:35.299> just<00:02:35.329> have<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.780> get<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.349> we're<00:02:36.799> also

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you just have to get going we're also

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.979 
you just have to get going we're also
just<00:02:37.189> /<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.670> bunch<00:02:37.909> you're<00:02:38.659> not<00:02:38.780> gonna<00:02:38.900> be

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
just / in the bunch you're not gonna be

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.990 
just / in the bunch you're not gonna be
able<00:02:39.049> to<00:02:39.200> do<00:02:39.290> any<00:02:39.439> climbing<00:02:40.400> or<00:02:40.610> anything<00:02:40.790> like

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
able to do any climbing or anything like

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.429 
able to do any climbing or anything like
that<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.079> kind<00:02:42.349> of<00:02:42.409> setup<00:02:42.620> just<00:02:44.439> flat

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
that with this kind of setup just flat

00:02:45.439 --> 00:03:04.060 
that with this kind of setup just flat
roads<00:02:45.799> or<00:02:47.019> flat<00:02:49.269> ish

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.760 

if<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.700> watched<00:03:05.970> my<00:03:06.150> previous<00:03:06.870> video<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
if you watched my previous video of the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.420 
if you watched my previous video of the
top<00:03:08.130> speedrun<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.420> max<00:03:09.660> speed<00:03:09.840> was

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
top speedrun of this the max speed was

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
top speedrun of this the max speed was
54<00:03:11.430> kilometers<00:03:11.910> an<00:03:12.000> hour<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> big

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
54 kilometers an hour so it's a big

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.620 
54 kilometers an hour so it's a big
difference<00:03:13.680> 54<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.550> 85<00:03:14.970> kilometers<00:03:15.450> an<00:03:15.570> hour

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
difference 54 to 85 kilometers an hour

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.050 
difference 54 to 85 kilometers an hour
but<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.260> sacrifice<00:03:16.980> most<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.610> your<00:03:17.700> bottom

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
but you sacrifice most of your bottom

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.240 
but you sacrifice most of your bottom
end<00:03:18.240> which<00:03:18.750> makes<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.590> good<00:03:19.980> for

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
end which makes it not good for

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.880 
end which makes it not good for
off-roading<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.420> stuff<00:03:21.960> so<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.470> went<00:03:22.740> right

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
off-roading and stuff so I went right

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.130 
off-roading and stuff so I went right
back<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> old<00:03:23.460> set<00:03:24.120> up<00:03:24.270> after<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.870> did<00:03:25.050> this

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
back to the old set up after I did this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.710 
back to the old set up after I did this
experiment<00:03:26.070> because<00:03:26.400> bottom<00:03:27.300> ends<00:03:27.540> more

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
experiment because bottom ends more

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.210 
experiment because bottom ends more
useful<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.650> me<00:03:28.800> then<00:03:29.070> top<00:03:29.340> end<00:03:29.580> on<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.970> bike
