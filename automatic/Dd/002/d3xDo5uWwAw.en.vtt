and<00:01:59.440> he's<00:01:59.830> gonna<00:02:00.040> throw<00:02:00.220> down<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.520> pool<00:02:00.729> that

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
and he's gonna throw down the pool that

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.090 
and he's gonna throw down the pool that
there<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.869> pool<00:02:02.080> right<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> pretty

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
there is a pool right this is a pretty

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.450 
there is a pool right this is a pretty
late<00:02:03.340> for<00:02:03.640> cuz<00:02:04.210> it's<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.750> bigger<00:02:04.930> map<00:02:05.200> uh-huh<00:02:05.560> so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
late for cuz it's a bigger map uh-huh so

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.249 
late for cuz it's a bigger map uh-huh so
you're<00:02:06.759> considered<00:02:07.450> pretty<00:02:07.539> safe<00:02:07.810> yeah

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
you're considered pretty safe yeah

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.550 
you're considered pretty safe yeah
probably<00:02:08.619> got<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.890> bit<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.660> IBP<00:02:10.660> attacking<00:02:11.350> with

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
probably got a bit of IBP attacking with

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.430 
probably got a bit of IBP attacking with
proxy<00:02:12.190> right<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.120> it's<00:02:13.630> more<00:02:13.960> safe<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.410> open

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
proxy right it's it's more safe to open

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.840 
proxy right it's it's more safe to open
up<00:02:14.800> around<00:02:15.340> 14<00:02:16.270> pool<00:02:16.510> 15<00:02:16.870> port<00:02:17.080> but<00:02:17.610> 16<00:02:18.610> Oh

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
up around 14 pool 15 port but 16 Oh

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.320 
up around 14 pool 15 port but 16 Oh
we'll<00:02:19.390> do<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:20.350> gives<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> better<00:02:20.800> economy

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
we'll do it gives you a better economy

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.430 
we'll do it gives you a better economy
so<00:02:22.330> there's<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.569> little<00:02:22.720> bit<00:02:22.900> risky<00:02:23.260> though

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
so there's a little bit risky though

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.740 
so there's a little bit risky though
yeah<00:02:23.860> basically<00:02:24.310> by<00:02:24.580> seeing<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.060> gas<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.360> up

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
yeah basically by seeing this gas is up

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.380 
yeah basically by seeing this gas is up
there<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.170> he's<00:02:26.710> gathering<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.190> gases<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.300> he

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
there and he's gathering the gases so he

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.840 
there and he's gathering the gases so he
can<00:02:28.569> get<00:02:28.660> rid<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.190> proxy<00:02:30.190> battle<00:02:30.550> at<00:02:30.730> that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
can get rid of the proxy battle at that

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.290 
can get rid of the proxy battle at that
point<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.270> right<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.790> there's<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.060> busy

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
point that right so there's a busy

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.559 
point that right so there's a busy
scouting<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.680> guess<00:02:35.860> when<00:02:36.100> I'm<00:02:36.250> around<00:02:36.640> 17

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
scouting and I guess when I'm around 17

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.530 
scouting and I guess when I'm around 17
i<00:02:37.690> believe<00:02:37.990> i<00:02:38.230> believe<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.310> uh<00:02:39.520> he<00:02:39.880> put<00:02:40.390> down

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
i believe i believe it's uh he put down

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.960 
i believe i believe it's uh he put down
the<00:02:40.660> pool<00:02:40.900> at<00:02:41.110> 60<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.830> they<00:02:41.920> drawn<00:02:42.280> up<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.550> 18

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the pool at 60 and they drawn up to 18

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.320 
the pool at 60 and they drawn up to 18
and<00:02:43.480> then<00:02:43.810> he<00:02:43.930> made<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.310> extractor<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.340> 18<00:02:45.940> yes

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
and then he made the extractor I 18 yes

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.199 
and then he made the extractor I 18 yes
that<00:02:46.630> because<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:48.040> now<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.490> go<00:02:49.030> for<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
that because right now you go for the

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.630 
that because right now you go for the
overlord<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.260> basically<00:02:50.530> thrown<00:02:50.770> off<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.160> 18

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
overlord so basically thrown off to 18

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.220 
overlord so basically thrown off to 18
and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.740 
and
go<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.800> guests<00:02:53.069> that's<00:02:53.849> right<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.569> the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
go for the guests that's right and the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.320 
go for the guests that's right and the
ester<00:02:55.019> nest<00:02:55.200> uh<00:02:55.519> yeah<00:02:56.519> as<00:02:56.670> soon<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.060> poor

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
ester nest uh yeah as soon as the poor

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.050 
ester nest uh yeah as soon as the poor
finish<00:02:57.690> he<00:02:58.049> had<00:02:58.200> around<00:02:58.860> 300<00:02:59.430> minerals<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.940> we

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
finish he had around 300 minerals so we

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.009 
finish he had around 300 minerals so we
made<00:03:00.269> two<00:03:00.510> queens<00:03:01.260> 1i<00:03:01.860> h<00:03:02.069> each<00:03:02.450> hatchery<00:03:03.450> when

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
made two queens 1i h each hatchery when

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.259 
made two queens 1i h each hatchery when
does<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> olive<00:03:04.470> oil<00:03:04.620> was<00:03:04.830> up<00:03:04.860> by<00:03:05.610> like

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
does the olive oil was up by like

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.740 
does the olive oil was up by like
probably<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.659> 17<00:03:07.620> /<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.069> guess<00:03:08.510> yeah<00:03:09.510> it's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
probably like 17 / I guess yeah it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.850 
probably like 17 / I guess yeah it's
1701<00:03:10.319> okay<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:12.120> sounds<00:03:12.390> right<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.650> over<00:03:13.830> here

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
1701 okay that sounds right so over here

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.729 
1701 okay that sounds right so over here
it<00:03:14.069> makes<00:03:14.220> two<00:03:15.209> lanes<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:16.319> for<00:03:16.470> scouting

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
it makes two lanes just for scouting

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.809 
it makes two lanes just for scouting
purposes<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:18.390> it's<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.110> better<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:20.099> make<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.519> I

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
purposes but it's a better to make for I

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.589 
purposes but it's a better to make for I

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
right right unless he started the melee

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.420 
right right unless he started the melee
and<00:05:52.550> characters<00:05:52.990> research<00:05:53.990> he<00:05:54.620> have<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:55.070> say

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
and characters research he have to say

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.300 
and characters research he have to say
enough<00:05:55.820> gas<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.900> go<00:05:57.050> into<00:05:57.200> lantern<00:05:57.680> so

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
enough gas to go into lantern so

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.460 
enough gas to go into lantern so
basically<00:05:58.760> this<00:05:58.880> really<00:05:59.270> could<00:05:59.480> open<00:06:00.380> the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
also got strong economy that's right

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.100 
also got strong economy that's right
it's<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.230> really<00:06:06.410> good<00:06:06.500> opener<00:06:07.300> for<00:06:08.300> full<00:06:08.930> link
