foundation and they serve a number of
purposes<00:01:13.189> one<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.880> base<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.270> support

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360

purposes one is the base of support
obviously<00:01:18.360> we're<00:01:18.509> holding<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> load<00:01:19.200> through

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
obviously we're holding a load through

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.260 
obviously we're holding a load through
the<00:01:19.590> body<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.460> last<00:01:20.640> thing<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.939> want<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the body and the last thing we want to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.640 
the body and the last thing we want to
ask<00:01:21.360> our<00:01:21.630> foundation<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:23.479> compress<00:01:24.479> such<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
ask our foundation to compress such as a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
ask our foundation to compress such as a
running<00:01:26.040> shoe<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> cross<00:01:26.939> trainer<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.990> if

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
running shoe or a cross trainer so if

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
running shoe or a cross trainer so if
you<00:01:28.259> look<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> weightlifting<00:01:29.460> shoe<00:01:29.759> this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you look at a weightlifting shoe this

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.950 
you look at a weightlifting shoe this
heel<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.380> only<00:01:31.680> raised<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.610> solid

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
heel is not only raised but it's solid

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
heel is not only raised but it's solid
this<00:01:33.960> allows<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.560> strands<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.979> energy<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.490> go

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this allows the strands of energy to go

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.120 
this allows the strands of energy to go
down<00:01:35.880> through<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> ground<00:01:36.390> without<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
down through the ground without this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.640 
down through the ground without this
shifting<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.750> last<00:01:39.750> thing<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> do

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
shifting down last thing we want to do

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.340 
shifting down last thing we want to do
is<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.890> saved<00:01:41.670> myself<00:01:41.850> 190<00:01:42.750> kilos<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.229> my

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is have saved myself 190 kilos on my

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.960 
is have saved myself 190 kilos on my
shoulders<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.860> mr.<00:01:44.130> chef<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
shoulders and mr. chef because this is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
shoulders and mr. chef because this is
going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> transfer<00:01:45.659> through<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.020> body<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> my

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
going to transfer through my body and my

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.499 
going to transfer through my body and my
body<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:47.009> shift<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.520> therefore<00:01:48.270> could

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
body will shift and therefore could

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.950 
body will shift and therefore could
cause<00:01:48.720> an<00:01:48.899> injury<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:51.060> next<00:01:51.390> thing<00:01:51.570> we're

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
cause an injury the next thing we're

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
cause an injury the next thing we're
going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> look<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.850> transfer<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> energy

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
going to look at is transfer of energy

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.460 
going to look at is transfer of energy
through<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.479> heal<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.840> well<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.200> we're<00:01:55.350> not

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
through this heal as well so we're not

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
through this heal as well so we're not
dumping<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.280> producing<00:01:56.909> force<00:01:57.329> I'm

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
dumping or I'm producing force I'm

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
dumping or I'm producing force I'm
trying<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> move<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.920> barbell<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.579> force

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
trying to move this barbell this force

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.070 
trying to move this barbell this force
comes<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> weightlifting

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
comes down and to the weightlifting

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.070 
comes down and to the weightlifting
and<00:02:02.260> this<00:02:02.800> is<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.010> an<00:02:03.880> efficient<00:02:04.510> transfer<00:02:04.930> of

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
and this is a an efficient transfer of

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.310 
and this is a an efficient transfer of
energy<00:02:05.320> down<00:02:05.770> through<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.910> shoe<00:02:07.150> so<00:02:07.930> this<00:02:07.960> is

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
energy down through the shoe so this is

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.749 
energy down through the shoe so this is
very<00:02:08.530> important<00:02:09.040> in<00:02:09.190> terms<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.550> energy

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
very important in terms of energy

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.050 
very important in terms of energy
transfer<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:11.560> Ray<00:02:11.740> steel<00:02:12.190> obviously<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.910> is

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
transfer the Ray steel obviously this is

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.900 
transfer the Ray steel obviously this is
a<00:02:13.090> big<00:02:13.300> thing<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:15.220> gives<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.610> body<00:02:15.760> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
a big thing it gives the body a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.610 
a big thing it gives the body a
mechanism<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.750> allow<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.960> need<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.410> draw

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
mechanism to allow the need to draw

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.370 
mechanism to allow the need to draw
forward<00:02:18.040> into<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.670> bit<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.910> position<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.050> this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
forward into a bit of position so this

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.430 
forward into a bit of position so this
allows<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.220> hip<00:02:21.460> or<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.420> pelvis<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.200> draw

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
allows the hip or the pelvis to draw

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.190 
allows the hip or the pelvis to draw
close<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.130> terms<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.520> ankle<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:25.900> turn

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
close in terms of ankle so what in turn

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.560 
close in terms of ankle so what in turn
will<00:02:26.410> happen<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.460> torso<00:02:27.880> angle<00:02:28.300> will

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
will happen is the torso angle will

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.900 
will happen is the torso angle will
become<00:02:28.990> slightly<00:02:29.260> higher<00:02:29.710> and<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.670> will

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
become slightly higher and this will

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.390 
become slightly higher and this will
draw<00:02:31.120> my<00:02:31.450> center<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> gravity<00:02:32.200> closer<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.220> my

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
draw my center of gravity closer to my

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.640 
draw my center of gravity closer to my
line<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.670> gravity<00:02:34.000> which<00:02:34.750> will<00:02:34.930> then<00:02:35.140> create

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
line of gravity which will then create

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.560 
line of gravity which will then create
more<00:02:35.860> stability<00:02:36.070> now<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.330> really

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
more stability now this is really

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.090 
more stability now this is really
important<00:02:38.110> when<00:02:38.260> we're<00:02:38.410> holding<00:02:38.650> an<00:02:38.740> overhead

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
important when we're holding an overhead

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.070 
important when we're holding an overhead
position<00:02:39.280> because<00:02:39.880> if<00:02:40.030> my<00:02:40.209> torso<00:02:40.450> angle<00:02:40.900> is

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
position because if my torso angle is

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.699 
position because if my torso angle is
fought<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:42.670> shoulder<00:02:43.360> cannot<00:02:44.110> hold<00:02:44.410> an

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
fought my shoulder cannot hold an

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.530 
fought my shoulder cannot hold an
extremely<00:02:45.280> rotated<00:02:45.820> position<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.390> therefore

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
extremely rotated position and therefore

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.410 
extremely rotated position and therefore
if<00:02:46.810> my<00:02:46.990> torso<00:02:47.470> drops<00:02:47.920> forward<00:02:48.670> because<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.209> my

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
if my torso drops forward because of my

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.160 
if my torso drops forward because of my
ankle<00:02:49.690> mobility<00:02:50.430> equals<00:02:51.430> my<00:02:51.580> shoulder<00:02:52.150> has<00:02:52.750> to

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
ankle mobility equals my shoulder has to

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.650 
ankle mobility equals my shoulder has to
drop<00:02:53.500> out<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.800> an<00:02:54.130> external<00:02:54.970> rotation<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
drop out of an external rotation to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.780 
drop out of an external rotation to
internal<00:02:56.320> rotation<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.980> push<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.340> back<00:02:57.550> and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
internal rotation to push it back and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.390 
internal rotation to push it back and
therefore<00:02:58.690> because<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.740> what's<00:03:00.040> happening

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
therefore because of what's happening

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.900 
therefore because of what's happening
down<00:03:00.610> here<00:03:00.780> creates<00:03:01.780> instability<00:03:02.200> up<00:03:02.709> here<00:03:03.070> so

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
down here creates instability up here so

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.970 
down here creates instability up here so
we<00:03:04.060> can<00:03:04.090> address<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.870> by<00:03:05.200> having<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.740> raised

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
we can address that by having a raised

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.390 
we can address that by having a raised
heel<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:07.660> very<00:03:08.019> important<00:03:08.650> another<00:03:09.010> one<00:03:09.250> is

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
heel I'm very important another one is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.830 
heel I'm very important another one is
strapping<00:03:09.880> yourself<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.360> because<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.810> don't

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
strapping yourself in because we don't

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.660 
strapping yourself in because we don't
want<00:03:11.140> any<00:03:11.260> shifting<00:03:11.709> within<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.070> shoe<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.489> a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
want any shifting within the shoe so a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.360 
want any shifting within the shoe so a
double<00:03:13.060> strap<00:03:13.510> lace<00:03:14.200> system<00:03:14.440> nice<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.160> tight

double strap lace system nice and tight

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.300 
double strap lace system nice and tight
equals<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.120> really<00:03:16.390> good<00:03:16.540> quality<00:03:16.750> shoe<00:03:17.320> I've

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
equals a really good quality shoe I've

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.920 
equals a really good quality shoe I've
put<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.640> number<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:19.060> people<00:03:19.390> into<00:03:19.600> their<00:03:19.720> shoes
