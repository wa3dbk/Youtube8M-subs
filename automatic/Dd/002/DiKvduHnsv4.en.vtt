Todd memorial and I thought it'd be
pretty<00:01:36.509> powerful<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.560> actually

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
pretty powerful if he was actually

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.499 
pretty powerful if he was actually
holding<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> crowbar<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.060> there's<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> little

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
holding the crowbar and there's a little

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
holding the crowbar and there's a little

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
you're going to do something have it

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.580 
you're going to do something have it
like<00:05:07.790> be<00:05:07.970> placed<00:05:08.270> on<00:05:08.540> one<00:05:08.750> of<00:05:08.780> these<00:05:08.930> then<00:05:09.440> have

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
like be placed on one of these then have

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.680 
like be placed on one of these then have
to<00:05:09.680> be<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:09.920> color<00:05:10.160> just<00:05:10.610> this<00:05:11.030> sort<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.510> size

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
to be that color just this sort of size

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.360 
to be that color just this sort of size
because<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.050> can't<00:05:12.260> have<00:05:12.350> you<00:05:12.530> bring<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:13.160> big

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
because I can't have you bring this big

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.520 
because I can't have you bring this big
thing<00:05:13.640> so<00:05:13.670> if<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:14.810> are<00:05:14.960> bringing<00:05:15.260> something

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
thing so if you are bringing something

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.980 
thing so if you are bringing something
you're<00:05:16.010> risking<00:05:16.970> yourself<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.540> me<00:05:17.660> saying<00:05:17.870> no

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
you're risking yourself of me saying no

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.870 
you're risking yourself of me saying no
because<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.740> might<00:05:18.890> be<00:05:19.010> too<00:05:19.160> big<00:05:19.340> or<00:05:19.490> not<00:05:19.550> might

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
because it might be too big or not might

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.790 
because it might be too big or not might
not<00:05:20.030> fit<00:05:20.240> in<00:05:20.360> but<00:05:20.630> if<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.320> want<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:21.650> think

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
not fit in but if you want to I think

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.080 
not fit in but if you want to I think
that'd<00:05:22.040> be<00:05:22.130> awesome<00:05:22.250> because<00:05:22.730> I<00:05:22.760> have<00:05:22.940> some

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
that'd be awesome because I have some

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.880 
that'd be awesome because I have some
friends<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.390> are<00:05:23.480> bringing<00:05:23.720> stuff<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.410> it's
