a<00:01:35.620> lot<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.830> people<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.460> decided<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:37.030> specs<00:01:37.360> a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
a lot of people have decided the specs a

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.120 
a lot of people have decided the specs a
quite<00:01:37.900> important<00:01:38.380> turning<00:01:38.740> point<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.010> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
quite important turning point of the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.010 
quite important turning point of the
console<00:01:39.550> war<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.330> PlayStation<00:01:40.810> 4

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.990 
console war and the PlayStation 4
admittedly<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.710> slightly<00:01:42.070> powerful<00:01:42.730> than<00:01:42.880> the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
admittedly is slightly powerful than the

admittedly is slightly powerful than the
xbox<00:01:43.390> one<00:01:43.570> now<00:01:44.440> let's<00:01:44.650> jump<00:01:44.890> into<00:01:45.040> this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
xbox one now let's jump into this

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.710 
xbox one now let's jump into this
immediately<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.940> have<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.150> look<00:01:46.390> at<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.570> both

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
immediately and have a look at the both

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.660 
immediately and have a look at the both
of<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.020> new<00:01:47.140> console<00:01:47.590> specs<00:01:47.800> now<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.280> specs

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
of the new console specs now the specs

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.950 
of the new console specs now the specs
are<00:01:48.820> quite<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.000> turning<00:01:49.450> point<00:01:49.480> for<00:01:49.750> some

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
are quite a turning point for some

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.630 
are quite a turning point for some
people<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.470> lot<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.890> people<00:01:50.980> feel<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.520> they're

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
people a lot of people feel so they're

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.490 
people a lot of people feel so they're
really<00:01:51.880> important<00:01:52.300> so<00:01:52.510> do<00:01:52.659> i<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:52.870> let's<00:01:53.320> go

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
really important so do i so let's go

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.980 
really important so do i so let's go
through<00:01:53.740> each<00:01:54.010> of<00:01:54.070> them<00:01:54.400> one<00:01:54.670> by<00:01:54.970> one<00:01:55.000> now<00:01:55.780> both

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
through each of them one by one now both

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.080 
through each of them one by one now both
consoles<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:56.440> opted<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.950> use<00:01:56.980> a<00:01:57.159> blu-ray<00:01:57.790> /

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
consoles have opted to use a blu-ray /

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.660 
consoles have opted to use a blu-ray /
DVD<00:01:58.630> optical<00:01:58.960> drive<00:01:59.620> so<00:01:59.860> they<00:01:59.980> break<00:02:00.220> even<00:02:00.610> on

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
DVD optical drive so they break even on

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.160 
DVD optical drive so they break even on
that<00:02:00.850> one<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.510> reason<00:02:01.750> they're<00:02:01.870> both<00:02:02.020> using

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
that one the reason they're both using

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.590 
that one the reason they're both using
blu-ray<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.890> because<00:02:03.340> blurry<00:02:03.970> has<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> much

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
blu-ray is because blurry has a much

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600 
blu-ray is because blurry has a much
higher<00:02:04.630> disparate<00:02:05.620> capacity<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.310> therefore

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
higher disparate capacity so therefore

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.950 
higher disparate capacity so therefore
we<00:02:06.729> won't<00:02:06.940> have<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.240> use<00:02:07.270> two<00:02:07.510> discs<00:02:07.840> ever

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
we won't have to use two discs ever

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.660 
we won't have to use two discs ever
again<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:08.500> for<00:02:09.039> example<00:02:09.129> if<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.519> play

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
again so for example if you play

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.790 
again so for example if you play
battlefield<00:02:10.090> 3<00:02:10.269> on<00:02:10.360> xbox<00:02:10.479> 360<00:02:11.140> like<00:02:11.349> me<00:02:11.590> you'll

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
battlefield 3 on xbox 360 like me you'll

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.259 
battlefield 3 on xbox 360 like me you'll
know<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:12.220> have<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.580> use<00:02:12.700> two<00:02:12.730> discs<00:02:13.180> to

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
know that we have to use two discs to

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.369 
know that we have to use two discs to
switch<00:02:13.480> between<00:02:13.629> single<00:02:14.170> player<00:02:14.349> and

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
switch between single player and

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.349 
switch between single player and
multiplayer<00:02:14.499> so<00:02:15.370> that's<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.700> real<00:02:15.879> pain<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
multiplayer so that's a real pain in the

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.080 
multiplayer so that's a real pain in the
arse<00:02:16.599> now<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.349> cpu<00:02:17.859> for<00:02:18.040> both<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.340> xbox<00:02:18.849> one

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
arse now the cpu for both the xbox one

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.590 
arse now the cpu for both the xbox one
and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.080 
and
the<00:02:19.690> ps4<00:02:20.080> are<00:02:20.560> both<00:02:20.920> eight<00:02:21.190> core<00:02:21.580> cpus<00:02:22.060> and

the ps4 are both eight core cpus and

the ps4 are both eight core cpus and

they're both manufactured by AMD now the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.340 
they're both manufactured by AMD now the
reason<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.090> PlayStation<00:02:25.600> 4<00:02:25.810> wins<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.260> this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
reason the PlayStation 4 wins in this

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.080 
reason the PlayStation 4 wins in this
category<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.920> because<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.310> has<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.490> faster

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
category is because it has a faster

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.870 
category is because it has a faster
clock<00:02:28.360> speed<00:02:28.690> than<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.170> Xbox<00:02:29.770> one<00:02:30.010> although<00:02:30.850> I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
GPUs when the change comes again we

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.200 
GPUs when the change comes again we
start<00:03:26.830> talking<00:03:26.980> about<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.400> specifications

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
start talking about the specifications

start talking about the specifications
of<00:03:28.330> this<00:03:28.540> now<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.200> x<00:03:29.440> plus<00:03:29.590> one<00:03:29.770> is<00:03:29.890> using<00:03:30.180> 853

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
of this now the x plus one is using 853

megahertz with 768 shaders whereas the
PlayStation<00:03:34.780> 4<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.050> believed<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.470> be<00:03:35.590> around

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
PlayStation 4 is believed to be around

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.440

1.2 gigahertz with 1152 shaders now what

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.000 
1.2 gigahertz with 1152 shaders now what
this<00:03:40.600> means<00:03:40.780> again<00:03:41.080> is<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.470> PlayStation

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
this means again is that the PlayStation

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.740 
this means again is that the PlayStation
4<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.340> slightly<00:03:42.670> faster<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.240> slightly<00:03:43.540> better

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
4 is slightly faster is slightly better

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.390 
4 is slightly faster is slightly better
than<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.140> xbox<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:44.740> in<00:03:44.890> terms<00:03:45.070> of<00:03:45.220> hardware

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
than the xbox one in terms of hardware

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.940 
than the xbox one in terms of hardware
then<00:03:46.180> when<00:03:46.300> we<00:03:46.390> talk<00:03:46.540> about<00:03:46.570> peak<00:03:47.020> GPU<00:03:47.530> shading

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
then when we talk about peak GPU shading

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.730 
then when we talk about peak GPU shading
the<00:03:48.070> xbox<00:03:48.430> one<00:03:48.610> comes<00:03:48.910> in<00:03:49.090> at<00:03:49.240> 1.31<00:03:50.020> teraflops

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
the xbox one comes in at 1.31 teraflops

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.070 
the xbox one comes in at 1.31 teraflops
or<00:03:51.160> as<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.310> PlayStation<00:03:51.700> 4<00:03:51.880> comes<00:03:52.120> in<00:03:52.270> at<00:03:52.360> 1.84

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
or as a PlayStation 4 comes in at 1.84

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.530 
or as a PlayStation 4 comes in at 1.84
teraflops<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.130> slightly<00:03:54.910> faster<00:03:55.210> again

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
teraflops so slightly faster again

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.600 
teraflops so slightly faster again
another<00:03:56.410> difference<00:03:56.860> comes<00:03:57.130> when<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.430> talk

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
another difference comes when we talk

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.580 
another difference comes when we talk
about<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.910> power<00:03:58.150> supply<00:03:58.660> unit<00:03:59.170> now<00:03:59.530> the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
about the power supply unit now the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.440 
about the power supply unit now the
PlayStation<00:04:00.220> 4<00:04:00.400> has<00:04:00.520> an<00:04:00.670> internal<00:04:01.180> power

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
PlayStation 4 has an internal power

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.850 
PlayStation 4 has an internal power
supply<00:04:01.660> unit<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.200> what<00:04:02.350> this<00:04:02.470> means<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.800> that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
supply unit so what this means is that

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.410 
supply unit so what this means is that
we're<00:04:03.100> not<00:04:03.130> going<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.520> have<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.670> power<00:04:04.000> brick<00:04:04.240> on

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
we're not going to have a power brick on

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.390 
we're not going to have a power brick on
the<00:04:04.510> PlayStation<00:04:05.020> 4<00:04:05.230> which<00:04:05.740> seems<00:04:06.010> strange

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
the PlayStation 4 which seems strange

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.910 
the PlayStation 4 which seems strange
considering<00:04:06.820> its<00:04:07.120> sole<00:04:07.450> small<00:04:07.960> but<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.590> xbox

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
considering its sole small but the xbox

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.620 
considering its sole small but the xbox
one<00:04:09.070> does<00:04:09.400> have<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:09.670> power<00:04:09.910> supply<00:04:10.090> unit<00:04:10.510> its

one does have a power supply unit its

one does have a power supply unit its
external<00:04:11.080> it's<00:04:11.350> another<00:04:11.620> power<00:04:11.950> brick<00:04:12.250> it's<00:04:12.700> a

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
external it's another power brick it's a

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.700 
external it's another power brick it's a
little<00:04:12.970> bit<00:04:13.150> smaller<00:04:13.390> than<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.750> xbox<00:04:14.140> 360's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710

little bit smaller than the xbox 360's
power<00:04:14.890> brick<00:04:15.040> but<00:04:15.490> it's<00:04:15.610> really<00:04:15.940> confusing

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
power brick but it's really confusing

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.660 
power brick but it's really confusing
considering<00:04:17.200> its<00:04:17.410> size<00:04:17.710> so<00:04:18.250> again

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
considering its size so again

considering its size so again
PlayStation<00:04:19.420> 4<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.810> leap<00:04:20.109> ahead<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.470> the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
though this is right so you can't

actually remove the hard drive on the

Xbox one although it's

Xbox one although it's
500<00:04:33.380> gigabytes<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:33.979> probably<00:04:34.190> won't<00:04:34.430> end

now the reason I've decided that this

now the reason I've decided that this
category<00:04:41.090> breaks<00:04:41.360> even<00:04:41.599> is<00:04:41.870> because<00:04:42.139> on<00:04:42.259> the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
category breaks even is because on the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.960 
category breaks even is because on the
Xbox<00:04:42.770> one<00:04:42.949> it's<00:04:43.190> been<00:04:43.340> confirmed<00:04:43.669> that<00:04:43.819> you

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
Xbox one it's been confirmed that you

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.969 
Xbox one it's been confirmed that you
can<00:04:44.240> add<00:04:44.509> external<00:04:44.990> storage<00:04:45.319> so<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.620> can<00:04:45.830> make

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
can add external storage so I can make

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.629 
can add external storage so I can make
my<00:04:46.220> 500<00:04:46.789> gigabytes<00:04:47.319> 1.5<00:04:48.319> terabytes<00:04:48.949> whereas

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
my 500 gigabytes 1.5 terabytes whereas

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.010 
my 500 gigabytes 1.5 terabytes whereas
on<00:04:49.759> the<00:04:49.819> PlayStation<00:04:50.300> 4<00:04:50.479> although<00:04:50.750> we<00:04:50.870> can

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
on the PlayStation 4 although we can

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.540 
on the PlayStation 4 although we can
remove<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.500> hard<00:04:51.680> drive<00:04:51.740> we<00:04:52.370> haven't

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
remove the hard drive we haven't

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.070 
remove the hard drive we haven't
actually<00:04:52.669> been<00:04:52.880> told<00:04:53.120> if<00:04:53.240> we<00:04:53.360> can<00:04:53.509> add<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.930> it

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
actually been told if we can add to it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.779 
actually been told if we can add to it
yet<00:04:54.289> so<00:04:54.860> that's<00:04:54.949> why<00:04:55.160> i<00:04:55.190> believe<00:04:55.370> they<00:04:55.580> break

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
yet so that's why i believe they break

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.430 
yet so that's why i believe they break
even<00:04:56.180> although<00:04:56.389> we<00:04:56.539> actually<00:04:56.870> cannot<00:04:57.050> remove

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
even although we actually cannot remove

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.870 
even although we actually cannot remove
the<00:04:57.650> hard<00:04:57.800> drive<00:04:57.860> from<00:04:58.069> the<00:04:58.220> xbox<00:04:58.520> one<00:04:58.639> we<00:04:58.789> can

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
the hard drive from the xbox one we can

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.640 
the hard drive from the xbox one we can
add<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.449> and<00:04:59.569> although<00:04:59.690> we<00:04:59.840> can<00:05:00.139> remove<00:05:00.440> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
add to it and although we can remove the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.320 
add to it and although we can remove the
hard<00:05:00.800> drive<00:05:00.860> on<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.220> playstation<00:05:01.789> 4<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.150> has<00:05:02.300> a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
hard drive on the playstation 4 it has a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.270 
hard drive on the playstation 4 it has a
big<00:05:02.539> confirmed<00:05:02.990> yet<00:05:03.169> if<00:05:03.289> we<00:05:03.470> can<00:05:03.710> add<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:04.130> it

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
big confirmed yet if we can add to it

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.310 
big confirmed yet if we can add to it
now<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:04.849> cloud<00:05:05.120> storage<00:05:05.449> on<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:05.720> xbox<00:05:06.110> one

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
now the cloud storage on the xbox one

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.290 
now the cloud storage on the xbox one
and<00:05:06.349> playstation<00:05:06.620> 4<00:05:07.310> is<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.460> debatable<00:05:07.880> thing

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
and playstation 4 is a debatable thing

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.390 
and playstation 4 is a debatable thing
now<00:05:08.599> i'd<00:05:09.080> say<00:05:09.470> they<00:05:09.620> break<00:05:09.889> even<00:05:10.250> here

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
now i'd say they break even here

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.070 
now i'd say they break even here
although<00:05:10.669> i<00:05:10.699> do<00:05:10.820> believe<00:05:11.210> potentially<00:05:11.930> the

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
although i do believe potentially the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.110 
although i do believe potentially the
xbox<00:05:12.500> one<00:05:12.680> could<00:05:12.860> win<00:05:13.070> this<00:05:13.250> category<00:05:13.729> due<00:05:13.970> to

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
xbox one could win this category due to

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.210 
xbox one could win this category due to
the<00:05:14.210> size<00:05:14.509> of<00:05:14.690> it<00:05:14.810> now<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.380> xbox<00:05:15.770> one<00:05:15.919> is<00:05:16.039> most

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
the size of it now the xbox one is most

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.010 
the size of it now the xbox one is most
likely<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.580> give<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:16.880> more<00:05:17.240> amounts<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.870> cloud

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
likely to give you more amounts of cloud

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.050 
likely to give you more amounts of cloud
stores<00:05:18.320> in<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.500> playstation<00:05:18.979> 4<00:05:19.160> due<00:05:19.759> to<00:05:19.910> their

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
stores in the playstation 4 due to their

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.140 
stores in the playstation 4 due to their
superior<00:05:20.660> sort<00:05:20.930> of<00:05:21.160> 300,000<00:05:22.160> servers<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:22.729> the

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
superior sort of 300,000 servers and the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.719 
superior sort of 300,000 servers and the
fact<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.419> just<00:05:23.690> in<00:05:23.810> general<00:05:24.020> cloud<00:05:24.470> like<00:05:25.340> the

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
fact that just in general cloud like the

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.070 
fact that just in general cloud like the
clouding<00:05:26.120> general<00:05:26.449> supposed<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.810> be<00:05:26.870> just

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
clouding general supposed to be just

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.469 
clouding general supposed to be just
more<00:05:27.289> significant<00:05:28.070> on<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.400> Xbox<00:05:28.789> month<00:05:29.000> but

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
more significant on the Xbox month but

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.059 
more significant on the Xbox month but
for<00:05:29.659> this<00:05:29.750> time<00:05:29.990> I'll<00:05:30.199> say<00:05:30.380> they<00:05:30.500> break<00:05:30.740> even

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
for this time I'll say they break even

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.620 
for this time I'll say they break even
hopefully<00:05:31.490> we<00:05:31.610> hear<00:05:31.819> some<00:05:32.000> news<00:05:32.180> about<00:05:32.210> how

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
hopefully we hear some news about how

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.879 
hopefully we hear some news about how
much<00:05:32.780> cloud<00:05:33.020> storage<00:05:33.319> we're<00:05:33.560> going<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.800> be

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
much cloud storage we're going to be

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.800 
much cloud storage we're going to be
receiving<00:05:34.520> now<00:05:34.970> let's<00:05:35.180> move<00:05:35.360> along<00:05:35.509> to<00:05:35.630> the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
receiving now let's move along to the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.719 
receiving now let's move along to the
final<00:05:36.139> points<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.620> video<00:05:36.860> now<00:05:37.099> the<00:05:37.159> USBs

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
final points of the video now the USBs

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.790 
final points of the video now the USBs
on<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.090> xbox<00:05:38.449> one<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:38.659> playstation<00:05:38.810> 4<00:05:39.440> break

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
on the xbox one and playstation 4 break

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.399 
on the xbox one and playstation 4 break
even<00:05:40.280> they're<00:05:40.699> both<00:05:40.849> using<00:05:41.060> USB<00:05:41.570> 3.0<00:05:42.020> which<00:05:42.259> is

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
even they're both using USB 3.0 which is

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.980 
even they're both using USB 3.0 which is
a<00:05:42.440> high<00:05:42.680> speed<00:05:43.039> version<00:05:43.250> of<00:05:43.490> USB<00:05:43.880> 2.0<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.720> they

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
a high speed version of USB 2.0 and they

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.499 
a high speed version of USB 2.0 and they
both<00:05:45.169> have<00:05:45.380> three<00:05:45.680> ports<00:05:46.130> now<00:05:46.699> web<00:05:46.940> connection

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
both have three ports now web connection

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.450 
both have three ports now web connection
i<00:05:47.659> believe<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.050> xbox<00:05:48.409> one<00:05:48.590> slightly<00:05:49.009> heads

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
i believe the xbox one slightly heads

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.010 
i believe the xbox one slightly heads
the<00:05:49.639> playstation<00:05:50.210> 4<00:05:50.389> in<00:05:50.479> terms<00:05:50.690> of<00:05:50.810> web

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
the playstation 4 in terms of web

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.899 
the playstation 4 in terms of web
connection<00:05:51.500> they're<00:05:51.979> both<00:05:52.130> using<00:05:52.340> gigabit

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
connection they're both using gigabit

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.939 
connection they're both using gigabit
ethernet<00:05:53.000> so<00:05:53.539> if<00:05:53.870> you're<00:05:54.080> really<00:05:54.380> rich<00:05:54.680> you

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
ethernet so if you're really rich you

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.499 
ethernet so if you're really rich you
live<00:05:55.099> somewhere<00:05:55.370> in<00:05:55.610> America<00:05:55.969> where<00:05:56.150> Google

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
live somewhere in America where Google

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.420 
live somewhere in America where Google
Fiber<00:05:56.780> is<00:05:57.020> about<00:05:57.259> you're<00:05:57.949> really<00:05:58.280> lucky

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
Fiber is about you're really lucky

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.350 
Fiber is about you're really lucky
because<00:05:58.610> you're<00:05:58.849> going<00:05:58.969> to<00:05:59.030> achieve<00:05:59.210> the

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
because you're going to achieve the

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.120 
because you're going to achieve the
highest<00:05:59.570> speeds<00:06:00.139> now<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.560> reason<00:06:00.710> i<00:06:00.889> believe

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
highest speeds now the reason i believe

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.580 
highest speeds now the reason i believe
the<00:06:01.280> xbox<00:06:01.699> one<00:06:01.880> slightly<00:06:02.270> heads<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.900> ps4<00:06:03.199> on

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
the xbox one slightly heads the ps4 on

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.409 
the xbox one slightly heads the ps4 on
this<00:06:03.740> bit<00:06:03.979> is<00:06:04.130> down<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:04.729> bridge<00:06:04.880> dual<00:06:05.180> band

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
this bit is down to bridge dual band

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.749 
this bit is down to bridge dual band
Wi-Fi<00:06:05.690> technology<00:06:06.169> so<00:06:07.099> dual<00:06:07.340> band<00:06:07.550> Wi-Fi

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.790 
Wi-Fi technology so dual band Wi-Fi
technology<00:06:08.150> allows<00:06:08.810> us<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:09.169> get<00:06:09.620> rid<00:06:09.770> of

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
technology allows us to get rid of

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.589 
technology allows us to get rid of
interference<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:10.610> achieve<00:06:10.909> the<00:06:11.120> best<00:06:11.300> kind

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
interference and achieve the best kind

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.120 
interference and achieve the best kind
of<00:06:11.630> Wi-Fi<00:06:12.020> signal<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:12.560> we<00:06:12.680> can<00:06:12.770> get<00:06:12.889> the<00:06:12.979> best

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
of Wi-Fi signal so we can get the best

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.040 
of Wi-Fi signal so we can get the best
quality<00:06:13.310> out<00:06:13.639> of<00:06:13.759> them<00:06:13.909> so<00:06:14.060> in<00:06:14.570> example<00:06:14.659> what

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
quality out of them so in example what

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.110 
quality out of them so in example what
this<00:06:15.169> would<00:06:15.320> be<00:06:15.500> that<00:06:16.009> all<00:06:16.219> of<00:06:16.370> our<00:06:16.460> phones<00:06:16.789> and

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
this would be that all of our phones and

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.270 
this would be that all of our phones and
you<00:06:17.210> know<00:06:17.330> all<00:06:17.509> of<00:06:17.539> our<00:06:17.750> consoles<00:06:18.560> and<00:06:18.770> our<00:06:18.860> you

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
you know all of our consoles and our you

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.920 
you know all of our consoles and our you
know<00:06:19.310> our<00:06:19.430> pc<00:06:19.909> and<00:06:20.060> everything<00:06:20.330> they<00:06:20.419> all<00:06:20.659> run

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
know our pc and everything they all run

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.070 
know our pc and everything they all run
on<00:06:20.960> 2.4<00:06:21.740> gigahertz<00:06:21.909> Wi-Fi<00:06:22.909> ban<00:06:23.150> so<00:06:23.750> by

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
on 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi ban so by

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.959 
on 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi ban so by
switching<00:06:24.380> to<00:06:24.530> 5<00:06:24.889> gigahertz<00:06:25.310> you<00:06:25.610> ignore<00:06:25.940> a

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:25.969 
switching to 5 gigahertz you ignore a

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.520 
switching to 5 gigahertz you ignore a
lot<00:06:26.060> of<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.300> interference<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.110> you<00:06:27.229> get<00:06:27.409> the

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
lot of the interference and you get the

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.439 
lot of the interference and you get the
best<00:06:27.830> signal<00:06:28.310> about<00:06:28.580> so<00:06:29.120> that's<00:06:29.180> why<00:06:29.419> i

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
best signal about so that's why i

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:30.999 
best signal about so that's why i
believe<00:06:29.630> the<00:06:29.840> xbox<00:06:30.169> one's<00:06:30.320> a<00:06:30.440> little<00:06:30.710> bit

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
believe the xbox one's a little bit

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.770 
believe the xbox one's a little bit
ahead<00:06:31.099> there<00:06:31.490> now<00:06:32.120> when<00:06:32.270> we<00:06:32.300> start<00:06:32.630> talking

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
ahead there now when we start talking

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.110 
ahead there now when we start talking
about<00:06:33.080> connection<00:06:33.770> the<00:06:34.219> xbox<00:06:34.610> one<00:06:34.849> doesn't

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
about connection the xbox one doesn't

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.670 
about connection the xbox one doesn't
have<00:06:35.150> bluetooth<00:06:35.419> but<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:35.930> playstation<00:06:36.469> does

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
have bluetooth but the playstation does

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.469 
have bluetooth but the playstation does
but<00:06:36.919> the<00:06:37.009> xbox<00:06:37.370> has<00:06:37.520> Wi-Fi<00:06:37.909> direct<00:06:38.150> and<00:06:38.419> the

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
but the xbox has Wi-Fi direct and the

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.659 
but the xbox has Wi-Fi direct and the
playstation<00:06:38.990> dozen<00:06:39.469> now<00:06:39.949> they<00:06:40.099> basically

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
playstation dozen now they basically

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.490 
playstation dozen now they basically
just<00:06:40.789> break<00:06:41.210> even<00:06:41.389> in<00:06:41.659> both<00:06:41.839> of<00:06:42.020> these<00:06:42.110> parts

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
just break even in both of these parts

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.439 
just break even in both of these parts
because<00:06:42.800> these<00:06:43.339> are<00:06:43.490> both<00:06:43.639> equally<00:06:44.210> good

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
because these are both equally good

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.360 
because these are both equally good

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
the console and Bluetooth is also a way

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.730 
the console and Bluetooth is also a way
of<00:06:53.360> doing<00:06:53.600> that<00:06:53.750> now<00:06:54.290> it's<00:06:54.440> believed<00:06:54.710> that

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
of doing that now it's believed that

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.890 
of doing that now it's believed that
Wi-Fi<00:06:55.250> direct<00:06:55.550> is<00:06:55.790> slightly<00:06:56.120> faster<00:06:56.420> and<00:06:56.780> a

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
Wi-Fi direct is slightly faster and a

Wi-Fi direct is slightly faster and a
bit<00:06:57.110> more<00:06:57.260> responsive<00:06:57.800> than<00:06:57.830> bluetooth<00:06:58.370> but

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
bit more responsive than bluetooth but

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.670 
bit more responsive than bluetooth but
you<00:06:59.000> probably<00:06:59.240> won't<00:06:59.450> notice<00:06:59.810> it<00:07:00.170> in<00:07:00.290> fact<00:07:00.500> we

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
you probably won't notice it in fact we

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.470 
you probably won't notice it in fact we
don't<00:07:00.830> really<00:07:01.130> notice<00:07:01.310> any<00:07:01.610> lag<00:07:01.880> time<00:07:02.150> on<00:07:02.300> any

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
don't really notice any lag time on any

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.540 
don't really notice any lag time on any
of<00:07:02.570> our<00:07:02.660> consoles<00:07:03.080> now<00:07:03.290> as<00:07:03.410> it<00:07:03.530> is<00:07:03.650> so<00:07:04.220> that<00:07:04.370> yet

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
of our consoles now as it is so that yet

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
console and finally we have to talk

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.750 
console and finally we have to talk
about<00:07:08.150> game<00:07:08.630> DVR<00:07:09.170> now<00:07:09.530> game<00:07:09.740> DVR<00:07:10.130> is<00:07:10.340> basically

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
about game DVR now game DVR is basically

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.100 
about game DVR now game DVR is basically
just<00:07:10.790> recording<00:07:11.420> and<00:07:11.540> sharing<00:07:11.570> your<00:07:11.960> content

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
just recording and sharing your content

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.930 
just recording and sharing your content
of<00:07:12.590> which<00:07:13.040> both<00:07:13.220> the<00:07:13.250> xbox<00:07:13.730> one<00:07:13.910> and

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
of which both the xbox one and

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.300 
of which both the xbox one and
playstation<00:07:14.120> has<00:07:14.900> so<00:07:15.620> they<00:07:15.740> break<00:07:15.950> even<00:07:16.220> in

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
playstation has so they break even in

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.220 
playstation has so they break even in
this<00:07:16.430> category<00:07:16.730> apparently<00:07:17.510> the<00:07:17.660> Xbox<00:07:18.050> one

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230 
this category apparently the Xbox one

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.170 
this category apparently the Xbox one
has<00:07:18.260> slightly<00:07:18.830> less<00:07:19.130> recording<00:07:19.790> time<00:07:19.970> the

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
has slightly less recording time the

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.180 
has slightly less recording time the
PlayStation<00:07:20.690> 4<00:07:20.900> however<00:07:21.500> in<00:07:21.650> all<00:07:21.770> honesty<00:07:22.160> I

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
PlayStation 4 however in all honesty I

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.890 
PlayStation 4 however in all honesty I
don't<00:07:22.460> see<00:07:22.670> many<00:07:22.820> people<00:07:23.210> using<00:07:23.600> this<00:07:23.690> feature

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
don't see many people using this feature

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.590 
don't see many people using this feature
therefore<00:07:24.590> they<00:07:25.250> break<00:07:25.490> just<00:07:25.760> about<00:07:26.000> even<00:07:26.300> in

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
therefore they break just about even in

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.510 
therefore they break just about even in
this<00:07:26.780> category<00:07:27.140> so<00:07:27.680> that's<00:07:27.860> it<00:07:28.070> for<00:07:28.100> the<00:07:28.280> first

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
this category so that's it for the first

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.940 
this category so that's it for the first
part<00:07:28.730> of<00:07:28.850> this<00:07:28.970> xbox<00:07:29.330> want<00:07:29.690> us<00:07:29.870> playstation<00:07:30.740> 4

the<00:07:33.440> PlayStation<00:07:34.010> 4<00:07:34.190> wins<00:07:34.550> now<00:07:34.850> in<00:07:35.030> some<00:07:35.210> cases

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.510 
the PlayStation 4 wins now in some cases

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.720 
the PlayStation 4 wins now in some cases
is<00:07:35.780> quite<00:07:36.020> significant<00:07:36.620> in<00:07:36.740> some<00:07:36.770> cases<00:07:37.130> it's

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
is quite significant in some cases it's
