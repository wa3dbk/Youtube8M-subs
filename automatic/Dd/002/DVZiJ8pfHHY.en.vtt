00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hi, I'm Cala EscudÃ©, dietitian 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.420
 Feeding nutritionist and I'm going to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.700
 talk about nutrigenomics is defined 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.280
 nutrigenomics as the relationship that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.830
 exists between the bioactive components 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.160
 of the diet and its response in the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.170
 metabolism modulated by genetics 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.960
 within the nutrigenomics we find 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.449
 the so-called unique sciences that are the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.700
 transcriptomics the metabolomics and the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.980
 proteomic termination or more 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.110
 means set of iu taking in 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.629
 mind that we are talking about genetics 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.579
 transcriptomics is defined as the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 set of genes related to the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.129
 DNA transcript a clear example 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.730
 of this would be the relationship between 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.690
 vitamin d and calcium once it's a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.149
 Once vitamin D is absorbed 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.070
 a series of mechanisms of 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.100
 transcription that causes calcium 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.559
 is absorbed in the kidney in bone and in 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.170
 the small intestine a clear example of 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.100
 the metabolomics would be the relationship between 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.290
 glucose and diabetes 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.150
 glucose is necessary in our 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.360
 body because they perform various functions 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.640
 important among them and will give energy to 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.549
 our brain but when we accumulate 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 a lot of glucose in our body 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.020
 causes a series of reactions 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.119
 genetics and forms some metabolites that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.810
 can cause resistance to 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.899
 insulin also at the level of the hepatocyte 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.119
 that is, the liver cell causes 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.030
 that this accumulation of glucose is 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.130
 turn fat into a clear example to the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.229
 proteomics would be any consumption of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.030
 foods rich in amino acids this 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.400
 would cause a protein synthesis in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.130
 our body 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.530
 aging is causing some 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.800
 transformations in our body that 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.320
 are damaging our system decreases the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.290
 Metabolic rate decreases capacity 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.490
 Functional function of the lung decreases 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.710
 reaction capacity and endless 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.679
 actions that finally end in 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.380
 death the principles of streller 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.200
 characterize aging as 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.820
 progressive endogenous and deleterious 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.310
 progressive means that it is produced 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.610
 for a series of causes that have gone 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.340
 arising throughout our life 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.070
 endogenous means that it is a factor 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.530
 simply genetic in this case it 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.720
 is referring to maximum longevity 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.140
 of a species in the case of 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.770
 people are genetically designed 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.880
 to live 100 or 125 years without the 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.670
 environmental factor influencing 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.130
 unlike the average longevity or 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.800
 life expectancy in which yes that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.430
 influences the environmental factor as per 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.550
 sedentary the snuff example the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.710
 fatty foods and so one 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.690
 clear example to distinguish between 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.830
 maximum longevity in average longevity 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.840
 it is for example that an elephant will not live 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.710
 at most three years as you can 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.680
 make a hamster but you will live 85 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.040
 example and change a hamster will not live 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.280
 maximum 85 but it will live 3 but 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.430
 both can die a year this is the 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.800
 difference between maximum longevity and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.100
 Average longevity under normal conditions 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.630
 the mitochondria are organelles that 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.760
 They are found in all our cells 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.750
 and they are responsible for the production of 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.270
 Energy 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.000
 for this production of energy they consume 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.920
 the oxygen that we breathe in 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.410
 this energy production what happens 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.800
 is that you can escape certain 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.320
 molecules that by their composition can 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.540
 damage to the cells these molecules are 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.430
 the so-called oxygen free radicals 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.010
 of which surely you have heard 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.010
 speak your radicals are related 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.450
 free with aging is likely 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.150
 that have to do with longevity 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.030
 maximum of each species with the speed 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.430
 of aging or what with the changes 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.780
 related to age the first 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.420
 defense that puts in our organism 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.430
 in front of these free radicals are the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.220
 own cell structures that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.590
 they have our organism as second 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.919
 defense barrier are the antioxidants 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.620
 in endogenous an antioxidant is defined 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.600
 as a molecule that delays or prevents the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 cellular damage that can cause these 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.669
 free radicals 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.190
 we have many many antioxidants 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.130
 endogenous in our body that help 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.860
 maintain a cellular homeostasis in the 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.870
 constant body there are many 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.199
 food with antioxidant capacity that 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.720
 we can consume if a if a compound 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.740
 antioxidant neutralizes some radicals 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.720
 free and thus slows aging 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.010
 also by feeding 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.620
 we can slow down that aging 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.600
 of our body a clear example of 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.389
 antioxidant nutrients is the vitamin 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.919
 c present in citrus fruits 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:09.419
 Vitamins are also antioxidants 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.669
 aye and minerals like zinc the 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.590
 selenium and copper more food 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.130
 antioxidants that we consume in our 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.460
 diet are fruits vegetables the bread the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.860
 potatoes legumes cocoa oil 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.840
 of olive and the nuts and the 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.240
 Nutrigenetics not only has a role in 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.330
 the aging delay but that 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.550
 by neutralizing these free radicals 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.770
 we will be healthier and we can prevent 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.930
 certain diseases like cancer 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.300
 and have a lot sporting performance 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.949
 higher nutrigenetics not only 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.670
 works at the delay level of 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.250
 aging 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.590
 by neutralizing these free radicals 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.650
 we are healthier and we can prevent 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.840
 diseases like cancer also we 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.740
 help in our our performance 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.210
 sports other than nutrigenetics 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.300
 study the formation of components 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.490
 bioactive to improve our health the 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.550
 nutrigenomics along with nutrigenetics and 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.010
 epigenetics are the future of some 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.290
 diseases that can be prevented or 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.410
 even eliminate thanks to the 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.410
 feeding
