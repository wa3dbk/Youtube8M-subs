best<00:02:21.940> design<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.989> drew<00:02:23.260> be<00:02:23.379> part<00:02:23.680> back<00:02:23.860> here

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
best design this drew be part back here

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.040 
best design this drew be part back here
just<00:02:24.310> doesn't<00:02:24.550> look<00:02:24.640> very<00:02:24.700> good<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.810> what<00:02:26.019> I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
just doesn't look very good so what I

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.960 
just doesn't look very good so what I
would<00:02:26.230> suggest<00:02:26.530> oh<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:27.400> also<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.760> heads

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
would suggest oh and also the heads

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.220 
would suggest oh and also the heads
pretty<00:02:28.300> limited<00:02:28.750> even<00:02:28.989> though<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
pretty limited even though the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.050 
pretty limited even though the
articulation<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.099> still<00:02:30.370> there<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:30.790> pretty

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
articulation is still there it's pretty

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.470 
articulation is still there it's pretty
limited

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
limited

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.449 
limited
so<00:02:31.930> sculpt<00:02:32.230> wise<00:02:32.379> it's<00:02:32.590> okay<00:02:32.890> but<00:02:33.129> it's<00:02:33.280> not

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
so sculpt wise it's okay but it's not

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.070 
so sculpt wise it's okay but it's not
the<00:02:33.580> best<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:33.940> what<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.239> suggest<00:02:34.450> and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the best so what I would suggest and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.250 
the best so what I would suggest and
what<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> think<00:02:35.860> most<00:02:35.950> people<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.459> gonna<00:02:36.640> do<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
what I think most people are gonna do is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.100 
what I think most people are gonna do is
not<00:02:38.260> use<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.769> head<00:02:39.069> or<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.910> cloak<00:02:40.180> because

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
not use this head or the cloak because

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.790 
not use this head or the cloak because
the<00:02:41.230> figure<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.830> way<00:02:42.280> better<00:02:42.640> without<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.800> you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
the figure is way better without it you

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.500 
the figure is way better without it you
should<00:02:44.980> probably<00:02:45.010> put<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.910> second<00:02:46.330> head

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
should probably put on the second head

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.620 
should probably put on the second head
though<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.750> wouldn't<00:02:47.019> leave<00:02:47.290> them<00:02:47.470> headless<00:02:48.630> so

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
though I wouldn't leave them headless so

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.470 
though I wouldn't leave them headless so
that<00:02:49.870> head<00:02:50.049> just<00:02:50.230> pops<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.299> want

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
that head just pops on and what I want

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.580 
that head just pops on and what I want
to<00:02:52.540> do<00:02:52.599> now<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:52.959> go<00:02:53.230> through<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
to do now is just go through the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.680 
to do now is just go through the
articulation<00:02:54.280> really<00:02:54.519> quick<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.269> head<00:02:55.480> is

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
articulation really quick so the head is

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.070 
articulation really quick so the head is
on<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.260> disc<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.519> neck<00:02:57.819> disc<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.390> rotates<00:02:58.900> up

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
on a disc a neck disc so it rotates up

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.979 
on a disc a neck disc so it rotates up
and<00:02:59.170> down<00:02:59.440> or<00:02:59.890> hinges<00:03:00.640> pivots<00:03:01.120> whatever<00:03:01.390> then

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
and down or hinges pivots whatever then

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.110 
and down or hinges pivots whatever then
the<00:03:02.140> head<00:03:02.319> can<00:03:02.500> swivel<00:03:02.739> around<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.280> there<00:03:03.549> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
the head can swivel around on there the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.140 
the head can swivel around on there the
shoulders<00:03:04.540> have<00:03:04.750> ball<00:03:05.110> hinges<00:03:05.910> no<00:03:06.910> bicep

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
shoulders have ball hinges no bicep

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.759 
shoulders have ball hinges no bicep
swivel<00:03:07.690> built<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.079> but<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.410> do<00:03:08.560> get<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
swivel built in but you do get the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.370 
swivel built in but you do get the
swivel<00:03:09.250> here<00:03:09.519> in<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.760> elbow<00:03:10.150> which<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.959> hinged

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
swivel here in the elbow which is hinged

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.979 
swivel here in the elbow which is hinged
then<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.069> wrist<00:03:12.310> has<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.579> swivel<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.720> hinge

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
then the wrist has a swivel and a hinge

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.350 
then the wrist has a swivel and a hinge
as<00:03:14.319> well<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.519> hinges<00:03:15.790> are<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> little<00:03:16.150> tight<00:03:16.329> on

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
as well the hinges are a little tight on

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.589 
as well the hinges are a little tight on
his<00:03:16.599> wrist<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.049> they<00:03:17.200> do<00:03:17.380> work<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.599> torso

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
his wrist but they do work the torso

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.720 
his wrist but they do work the torso
hinge<00:03:20.019> or<00:03:20.440> articulation<00:03:21.190> it's<00:03:21.340> not<00:03:21.459> an<00:03:21.549> ab

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
hinge or articulation it's not an ab

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.220 
hinge or articulation it's not an ab
crunch<00:03:22.030> it's<00:03:22.239> like<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> really<00:03:22.900> really<00:03:23.079> good

new Marvel Legends hips for the most

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.259 
new Marvel Legends hips for the most
part<00:03:35.139> it's<00:03:35.709> effectively<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.340> ball<00:03:36.639> hinge<00:03:36.940> but

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829
