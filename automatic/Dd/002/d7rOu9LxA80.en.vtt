00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
mount there's quite a few cons of this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.389 
mount there's quite a few cons of this
mount<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.730> unstoppable<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.100> can't

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
mount it is unstoppable so you can't

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.029 
mount it is unstoppable so you can't
stop<00:00:57.210> moving<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.750> always<00:00:57.960> moves<00:00:58.289> forward<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
stop moving it always moves forward you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.029 
stop moving it always moves forward you
just<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> turn<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.320> it's<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.710> cool

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
just have to turn it it's really cool

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.990 
just have to turn it it's really cool
and<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.140> yeah<00:01:04.140> another<00:01:04.920> thing<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> has

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and all but yeah another thing is it has

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
and all but yeah another thing is it has
three<00:01:06.450> charges<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
three charges so if you want to use it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
three charges so if you want to use it
again<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.330> kill<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.439> monster

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
again you have to kill this monster

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270 
again you have to kill this monster
again<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> mount<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.100> that's<00:01:14.100> how

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
again to get the mount and that's how

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039 
again to get the mount and that's how
you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.720> good<00:01:15.960> if

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you can use it so it's really good if

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.350 
you can use it so it's really good if
you<00:01:16.140> want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> level<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:17.520> fast<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.210> me

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you want to level really fast and me

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.039 
you want to level really fast and me
from<00:01:18.600> place<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> place<00:01:19.259> while<00:01:19.830> leveling<00:01:20.130> from

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
from place to place while leveling from

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.130 
from place to place while leveling from
89<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.080> 90<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> that's<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.689> good<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> yeah

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
89 to 90 so that's really good so yeah

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.249 
89 to 90 so that's really good so yeah
it's<00:01:28.140> very<00:01:28.290> fast<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.420> at<00:01:30.420> last<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:31.140> like

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it's very fast and at last I think like

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.540 
it's very fast and at last I think like
20<00:01:31.560> seconds<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:31.979> 30<00:01:32.130> seconds<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.670> something

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
20 seconds or 30 seconds or something

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.920 
20 seconds or 30 seconds or something
just<00:01:35.550> use<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.120> three<00:01:36.300> times<00:01:36.330> when<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> want<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
just use it three times when you want to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920 
just use it three times when you want to
meet<00:01:37.080> really<00:01:37.590> fast<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.310> kill<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.640> again<00:01:38.940> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
meet really fast then kill it again and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.880 
meet really fast then kill it again and
it<00:01:40.080> helps<00:01:40.350> oh<00:01:40.530> yeah

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it helps oh yeah

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.680 
it helps oh yeah
so<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.730> kill<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.210> base

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
so what you have to do is kill this base

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.920 
so what you have to do is kill this base
called<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.290> ping<00:01:43.560> song<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:45.570> easy<00:01:45.750> just
