the<00:00:00.210> Flyers<00:00:00.599> doing<00:00:01.199> that<00:00:01.410> shut<00:00:02.070> down<00:00:02.100> the

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
the Flyers doing that shut down the

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.740 
the Flyers doing that shut down the
team's<00:00:02.820> offense<00:00:03.360> tonight<00:00:04.730> well<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.240> thought

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
team's offense tonight well I thought

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.789 
team's offense tonight well I thought
they<00:00:06.870> did<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> really<00:00:07.200> good<00:00:07.379> job<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
they did a really good job in the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.720 
they did a really good job in the
neutral<00:00:08.099> zone<00:00:08.250> they<00:00:09.000> play<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> lock<00:00:09.599> style<00:00:10.730> they

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
neutral zone they play a lock style they

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.890 
neutral zone they play a lock style they
defended<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> red<00:00:12.420> line<00:00:12.630> well<00:00:14.630> you<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
defended the red line well you have to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.310 
defended the red line well you have to
give<00:00:16.020> them<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.500> credit<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:17.070> that

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
give them a little credit for that

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.140 
give them a little credit for that
but<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.369> think<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.760> did<00:00:20.939> it

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
but I just don't think we did it

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.730 
but I just don't think we did it
getting<00:00:21.779> through<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.289> had<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> lot<00:00:22.619> of

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
getting through it we had a lot of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
getting through it we had a lot of
turnovers<00:00:23.220> there<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.730> don't<00:00:23.910> think<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.240> skated

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
turnovers there I don't think we skated

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
turnovers there I don't think we skated
to<00:00:25.500> make<00:00:25.680> them<00:00:25.859> move<00:00:26.070> off<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.060> red

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
to make them move off of that the red

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.080 
to make them move off of that the red
line<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> biggest<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
line and that was the biggest the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.519 
line and that was the biggest the
biggest<00:00:30.330> problem<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.869> had<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.199> getting

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
biggest problem we had was getting

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.170 
biggest problem we had was getting
through<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:31.949> give<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.460> some<00:00:32.669> credit<00:00:32.790> they

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
through there give them some credit they

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.479 
through there give them some credit they
they<00:00:33.450> were<00:00:33.510> very<00:00:33.600> disciplined<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
they were very disciplined there but I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.709 
they were very disciplined there but I
don't<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.880> did<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.239> enough<00:00:36.300> job<00:00:36.480> in

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
don't think we did a good enough job in

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.240 
don't think we did a good enough job in
trying<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> chip<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> puck<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.040> behind

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
trying to chip the puck get in behind

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.639 
trying to chip the puck get in behind
them<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.790> allow<00:00:39.690> ourselves<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.140> forecheck

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
them and allow ourselves to forecheck

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.040 
them and allow ourselves to forecheck
John<00:00:41.370> how<00:00:41.520> much<00:00:41.670> did<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> bother<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.390> car<00:00:42.719> solo

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
brave guy John good sustained pressure

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.219 
brave guy John good sustained pressure
from<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> Flyers<00:01:23.310> net<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> first

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
from the Flyers net the first

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.959 
from the Flyers net the first
and<00:01:24.439> it<00:01:24.560> wasn't<00:01:25.039> when<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.460> spoke<00:01:25.640> about<00:01:25.850> in

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
and it wasn't when you spoke about in

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.609 
and it wasn't when you spoke about in
the<00:01:26.000> first<00:01:26.180> answer<00:01:26.600> they<00:01:27.110> kept<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.500> from

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
the first answer they kept that from

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.039 
the first answer they kept that from
happening<00:01:27.860> as<00:01:28.460> much<00:01:28.640> as<00:01:29.479> far<00:01:29.750> as<00:01:29.780> getting

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
happening as much as far as getting

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.330 
happening as much as far as getting
through<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.469> neutral<00:01:30.619> zone<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:30.979> don't<00:01:31.219> think

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
through the neutral zone I don't think

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.679 
through the neutral zone I don't think
we<00:01:31.430> spend<00:01:31.640> enough<00:01:31.850> time<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.119> their<00:01:32.390> end<00:01:32.539> zone

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
we spend enough time in their end zone

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.649 
we spend enough time in their end zone
because<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.110> couldn't<00:01:33.320> get<00:01:33.500> through<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:34.659> get

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
because we couldn't get through the get

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.510 
because we couldn't get through the get
through<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.960> neutral<00:01:36.110> zone<00:01:36.409> on<00:01:36.619> them<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.009> and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
through the neutral zone on them and and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.700 
through the neutral zone on them and and
again<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:37.880> combination<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.420> both<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:39.619> had

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
again it's a combination of both we had

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.590 
again it's a combination of both we had
a<00:01:39.740> lot<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.009> tournament<00:01:40.700> they<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:41.000> thought<00:01:41.420> they

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
a lot of tournament they I thought they

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.749 
a lot of tournament they I thought they
were<00:01:41.960> very<00:01:42.200> disciplined<00:01:42.740> there<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.549> just

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
were very disciplined there and we just

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.880 
were very disciplined there and we just
couldn't<00:01:44.000> get<00:01:44.149> through<00:01:44.360> i<00:01:44.630> they<00:01:45.380> beat<00:01:45.619> us<00:01:45.740> to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
couldn't get through i they beat us to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.480 
couldn't get through i they beat us to
pucks

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
pucks

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.580 
pucks
when<00:01:46.670> they<00:01:46.819> pressured<00:01:47.329> they<00:01:48.170> sustained

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
when they pressured they sustained

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.050 
when they pressured they sustained
therefore<00:01:49.009> check<00:01:49.250> when<00:01:49.429> we<00:01:49.460> pressured<00:01:49.909> we

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
therefore check when we pressured we

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.459 
therefore check when we pressured we
were<00:01:50.119> late<00:01:50.390> when<00:01:50.600> we<00:01:50.659> had<00:01:50.780> opportunities<00:01:51.439> to

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
were late when we had opportunities to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.020 
were late when we had opportunities to
pressure<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.189> we<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:52.490> didn't<00:01:52.670> get<00:01:52.759> there

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
pressure and we just didn't get there
