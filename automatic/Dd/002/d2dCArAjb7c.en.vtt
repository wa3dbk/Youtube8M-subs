 video is to show them more than anything that does not 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.599
 everything related to the world of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.260

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.840
 find explanation 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.670
 to what we see 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.380
 for what we hear 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.380
 but moment 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.510
 the vast majority of gamers know 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.080
 call of duty undoubtedly one of the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.690
 most profitable sagas in these times 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.420
 but that hides beyond and beyond 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.100
 those epic moments of shots between 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.430
 comrades 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.949
 here a test of psychophonies 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.839
 found in modern warfare 3 in the 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.250
 that you hear the voice of a girl who 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:04.210
 Clam phrases like there is dad not you 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.409
 get close to the road or sara no 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.090
 you go far away 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.880
 you do not believe me in the cemetery in the 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.000
 Sanctuary cemetery just enters 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.530
 any plot of grass you do not believe me 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.530
 here a test 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.090
 peridis 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.890
 luigi mansion has not played this 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.470
 juezo in which the green plumber 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.540
 have to go into the darkest 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.510
 and terrible mansions full of 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.629
 ghosts looking for his brother to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.030
 simple view a nice story not so 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.459
 maybe this video makes you think what 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.069
 the opposite is that the video makes you 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.709
 reconsider and think that maybe a luigi 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.720
 the work and the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.440
 dread he felt inside this mansion 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.410
 it led to the same clichÃ© suicide or 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.599
 hysterical the last opinion have it 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.660
 the means to me is pretty clear 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.360
 but the reality is that we do not know if in 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.290
 truth Luigi's mustache was able to 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.670
 hang from your own vacuum cleaner or not the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.670
 video I leave 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.910

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.480
 welcome to one of the most adventures 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.210
 Epics in space Super Mario Galaxy 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.400
 2 and that the best companion than the 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.130
 jumping mario to not give so many 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.220

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.200
 of the world 5 is about the volcanic level 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.540
 but here the most fearsome are not the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.700
 flames of fire but the three 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.950
 Specters that watch you in all the 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.740
 game and the truth is that it gives you very 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.340
 bad looking to know that everyone is watching and 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.650
 each of your movements the worst is 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.990
 that nobody gives you even a clue 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.910
 who are one of the theories that the 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.250
 people have given refers to who they are 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.650

 Japanese that inhabit the forests 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.310
 because of its appearance here the video 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.050
 this time we land until the 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.479

 super mario land 3d where we find 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.009
 a spooky surprise at the end of the 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.059
 level and is that who does not get the 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:01.009
 spiky skin feeling like they are watching us 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:03.949

 eastern ex preferred and by much such 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:06.519

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:09.479
 I've witnessed in person and it's really 

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:14.469
