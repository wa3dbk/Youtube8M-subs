months<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> think<00:01:38.189> actually<00:01:38.430> two<00:01:39.090> u17

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.390 
months is when I think actually two u17
is<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:39.960> rolling<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:41.130> my

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
is going to be rolling out that's my

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
is going to be rolling out that's my
prediction<00:01:41.670> cuz<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.320> about<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
prediction cuz if you think about it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
prediction cuz if you think about it
that'll<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.040> six<00:01:44.670> months<00:01:44.880> time<00:01:45.299> from

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that'll be about six months time from

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.420 
that'll be about six months time from
when<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:45.899> actually<00:01:46.049> release<00:01:46.590> title<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.310> day

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
will ever get back on track with the pc

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.250 
will ever get back on track with the pc
ones<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.060> mean<00:02:25.240> there's<00:02:25.570> no<00:02:25.720> way<00:02:25.840> we<00:02:25.990> could<00:02:26.110> ever

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
ones I mean there's no way we could ever

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.080 
ones I mean there's no way we could ever
catch<00:02:26.530> up<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.920> mean<00:02:27.100> we<00:02:27.220> could<00:02:27.370> maybe<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.940> to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
catch up I mean we could maybe get to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.430 
catch up I mean we could maybe get to
the<00:02:28.210> point<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.510> where<00:02:28.600> we're<00:02:28.840> not<00:02:28.960> far<00:02:29.290> behind

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
the point to where we're not far behind

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.680 
the point to where we're not far behind
if<00:02:29.920> they<00:02:30.220> keep<00:02:30.400> adding<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:30.760> additions<00:02:31.420> than

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
if they keep adding more additions than

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.740 
if they keep adding more additions than
the<00:02:31.780> pc<00:02:32.140> got<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.590> there<00:02:32.860> actual<00:02:33.130> updates<00:02:34.120> but

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the pc got in there actual updates but

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.690 
the pc got in there actual updates but
the<00:02:34.930> thing<00:02:35.110> about<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.860> really<00:02:36.430> don't

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
the thing about it is is I really don't

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.010 
the thing about it is is I really don't
think<00:02:36.790> we're<00:02:37.030> ever<00:02:37.150> going<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.420> catch<00:02:37.600> up<00:02:37.840> to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020

heads<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.890> we<00:03:14.890> already<00:03:15.160> have<00:03:15.340> all<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.670> type

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
heads and we already have all that type

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.030 
heads and we already have all that type
of<00:03:15.880> stuff<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.660> based<00:03:16.900> off<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.140> information

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
of stuff so based off that information

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.040 
of stuff so based off that information
I'm<00:03:18.340> pretty<00:03:18.760> sure<00:03:18.970> we'd<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.270> getting<00:03:19.390> all<00:03:19.810> that

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
I'm pretty sure we'd be getting all that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.410 
I'm pretty sure we'd be getting all that
stuff<00:03:20.320> plus<00:03:20.739> more<00:03:21.130> from<00:03:21.430> future<00:03:21.760> updates<00:03:22.209> in

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
stuff plus more from future updates in

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.229 
stuff plus more from future updates in
the<00:03:22.840> next<00:03:23.110> update<00:03:23.230> which<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.070> 17<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.060> by

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
the next update which is to you 17 so by

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.850 
the next update which is to you 17 so by
all<00:03:25.450> means<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.989> think<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.530> we're<00:03:26.620> going<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.770> be

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
all means I think that we're going to be

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.610 
all means I think that we're going to be
getting<00:03:26.950> witches<00:03:27.489> bats<00:03:27.880> wither<00:03:28.780> skeletons<00:03:29.410> so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
getting witches bats wither skeletons so

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.080 
getting witches bats wither skeletons so
that<00:03:29.770> we<00:03:29.860> can<00:03:30.100> obviously<00:03:30.430> make<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.880> wither

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
that we can obviously make the wither

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.449 
that we can obviously make the wither
boss<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.720> then<00:03:32.200> also<00:03:32.560> we're<00:03:33.160> going<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.340> be

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
boss and then also we're going to be

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.630 
boss and then also we're going to be
getting<00:03:33.730> beacons<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:34.810> as<00:03:35.110> far<00:03:35.440> as<00:03:35.500> coal<00:03:36.280> blocks

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
getting beacons so as far as coal blocks

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.100 
getting beacons so as far as coal blocks
and<00:03:36.850> stuff<00:03:37.000> like<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.180> they<00:03:37.540> did<00:03:37.780> come<00:03:37.989> in

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
and stuff like that they did come in

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.560 
and stuff like that they did come in
future<00:03:38.260> updates<00:03:38.560> but<00:03:39.400> maybe<00:03:40.000> they'll<00:03:40.239> bring

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
future updates but maybe they'll bring

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.180 
future updates but maybe they'll bring
them<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:40.930> i<00:03:41.050> don't<00:03:41.110> know<00:03:41.380> but<00:03:41.590> i<00:03:41.650> can't<00:03:41.950> say<00:03:42.130> for

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.860 
them in i don't know but i can't say for
sure<00:03:42.370> about<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.090> everything<00:03:43.480> else<00:03:43.660> I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
sure about that but everything else I

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.840 
sure about that but everything else I
would<00:03:44.320> definitely<00:03:44.530> say<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:45.160> going<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.520> be<00:03:45.670> in

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
would definitely say is going to be in

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.300 
would definitely say is going to be in
the<00:03:45.970> next<00:03:46.120> update<00:03:46.380> moving<00:03:47.380> on<00:03:47.530> death<00:03:47.860> wants<00:03:48.220> to

pretty much answered this question in
the<00:03:58.300> last<00:03:58.540> tweet<00:03:58.840> exactly<00:03:59.800> you're<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.130> going

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250

to be able to make the wither unless you
have<00:04:02.110> wither<00:04:02.350> skeletons<00:04:02.980> because<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.700> kill

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910

the<00:04:05.530> heads<00:04:05.770> in<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.430> course<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.270> token

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
the heads in of course that is a token

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.440 
the heads in of course that is a token
drop<00:04:08.530> or<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:09.190> know<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> rare<00:04:09.790> drop<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:10.269> that's

poor will ever be added and if so how do

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.689 
poor will ever be added and if so how do
you<00:04:28.990> think<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:29.349> would<00:04:29.499> work<00:04:29.639> personally<00:04:30.639> I

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
you think it would work personally I

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.909 
you think it would work personally I
don't<00:04:31.090> know<00:04:31.330> if<00:04:31.629> it<00:04:31.870> would<00:04:31.960> ever<00:04:32.020> be<00:04:32.409> added

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
don't know if it would ever be added

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.369 
don't know if it would ever be added
I've<00:04:33.490> never<00:04:33.729> really<00:04:34.060> heard<00:04:34.180> 4j<00:04:34.689> studios<00:04:35.110> or

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
I've never really heard 4j studios or

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.800 
I've never really heard 4j studios or
mojang<00:04:35.860> talk<00:04:36.219> about<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.789> but<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.539> my<00:04:37.659> opinion

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
mojang talk about that but in my opinion

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.450 
mojang talk about that but in my opinion
I<00:04:38.139> think<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.469> would<00:04:38.560> be<00:04:38.590> something<00:04:38.979> really

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
I think it would be something really

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.950 
I think it would be something really
really<00:04:39.580> cool<00:04:39.729> i<00:04:39.939> mean<00:04:40.210> there's<00:04:40.449> tons<00:04:40.810> of

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
really cool i mean there's tons of

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
the console and stuff like that and i

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.149 
the console and stuff like that and i
think<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.050> would<00:04:47.169> definitely<00:04:47.409> bring<00:04:47.770> another

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
think it would definitely bring another

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.920 
think it would definitely bring another
feature<00:04:48.490> minecraft<00:04:49.150> keep<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:49.599> interesting

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
feature minecraft keep it interesting

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.659 
feature minecraft keep it interesting
and<00:04:50.379> personally<00:04:50.800> i<00:04:50.830> would<00:04:51.159> definitely<00:04:51.400> buy<00:04:51.639> a

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
and personally i would definitely buy a

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.480 
and personally i would definitely buy a
copy<00:04:51.969> as<00:04:52.240> far<00:04:52.449> as<00:04:52.569> how<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:53.259> would<00:04:53.409> work<00:04:53.439> I<00:04:53.979> don't

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
copy as far as how it would work I don't

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.589 
copy as far as how it would work I don't
really<00:04:54.639> know<00:04:54.849> I<00:04:54.879> guess<00:04:54.999> it<00:04:55.300> would<00:04:55.419> work<00:04:55.539> just

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
really know I guess it would work just

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.149 
really know I guess it would work just
like<00:04:55.930> any<00:04:56.139> other<00:04:56.199> Kinect<00:04:56.740> game<00:04:56.919> you<00:04:57.069> would

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
like any other Kinect game you would

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.589 
like any other Kinect game you would
stand<00:04:57.370> in<00:04:57.550> front<00:04:57.669> of<00:04:57.789> your<00:04:57.909> connects<00:04:58.210> probably

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
stand in front of your connects probably

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.629 
stand in front of your connects probably
swing<00:04:59.229> your<00:04:59.409> arm<00:04:59.620> back<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.069> forth<00:05:00.279> to<00:05:00.430> mine

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
swing your arm back and forth to mine

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.129 
swing your arm back and forth to mine
some<00:05:00.909> blocks<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.479> all<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:01.659> kind<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.900> school

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
some blocks and all that kind of school

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.200 
some blocks and all that kind of school
stuff<00:05:02.379> and<00:05:02.620> swing<00:05:03.370> your<00:05:03.400> arm<00:05:03.699> probably<00:05:04.090> to

stuff and swing your arm probably to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.209

in<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.430> cave<00:05:06.639> but<00:05:07.240> definitely<00:05:08.110> think<00:05:08.379> that<00:05:08.439> that

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
in a cave but definitely think that that

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.290 
in a cave but definitely think that that
would<00:05:08.710> be<00:05:08.770> something<00:05:08.889> really<00:05:09.550> cool<00:05:09.759> that<00:05:10.000> they

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
would be something really cool that they

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.450 
would be something really cool that they
could<00:05:10.539> implement<00:05:10.930> in<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.319> future<00:05:11.680> as<00:05:11.860> far<00:05:12.340> as

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460

horses<00:05:22.240> like<00:05:22.599> I<00:05:22.719> said<00:05:22.930> before<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.289> already

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
horses like I said before I already

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.019

to<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.629> previous<00:05:26.080> update<00:05:26.499> the<00:05:26.710> tu14<00:05:27.279> update

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
to the previous update the tu14 update

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.100 
to the previous update the tu14 update

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
and they really have me thinking that

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.140 
and they really have me thinking that

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
and of course I got let down especially

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.450 
and of course I got let down especially
considering<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.229> took<00:05:32.439> eight<00:05:32.860> months<00:05:32.919> to

to the console versions unfortunately at

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.079

least as far as xbox 360 and ps3 now for

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:27.300 
least as far as xbox 360 and ps3 now for
these<00:06:25.210> new<00:06:25.509> gen<00:06:25.779> consoles<00:06:26.379> hopefully<00:06:27.099> we'll

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
these new gen consoles hopefully we'll

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.189 
these new gen consoles hopefully we'll
see<00:06:27.339> things<00:06:27.849> such<00:06:28.089> as<00:06:28.120> that<00:06:28.419> as<00:06:28.629> well<00:06:29.050> as

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
see things such as that as well as

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.110 
see things such as that as well as
servers<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:29.949> all<00:06:30.460> that<00:06:30.669> kind<00:06:30.849> of<00:06:30.909> good<00:06:30.969> stuff

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
servers and all that kind of good stuff

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.360 
servers and all that kind of good stuff
because<00:06:31.870> that's<00:06:32.319> what<00:06:32.500> I'm<00:06:32.589> hoping<00:06:32.770> for<00:06:32.949> if

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
because that's what I'm hoping for if

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.999 
because that's what I'm hoping for if
not<00:06:33.399> i<00:06:33.909> mean<00:06:34.120> just<00:06:34.599> world<00:06:34.899> size<00:06:35.229> and<00:06:35.680> bigger

render<00:06:36.519> distance<00:06:36.699> doesn't<00:06:37.300> really<00:06:37.449> do<00:06:37.659> it<00:06:37.779> for

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
render distance doesn't really do it for

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.659 
render distance doesn't really do it for
I<00:06:38.169> mean<00:06:38.439> the<00:06:38.919> colors<00:06:39.219> are<00:06:39.280> a<00:06:39.370> little<00:06:39.430> bit
