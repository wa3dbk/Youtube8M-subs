the shampoo thing there is you know a

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.760 
the shampoo thing there is you know a
tendency<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.150> have<00:05:55.270> separation<00:05:55.870> so<00:05:56.560> in<00:05:56.680> the

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
tendency to have separation so in the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.839 
tendency to have separation so in the
middle<00:05:57.009> of<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.130> brush<00:05:57.370> sometimes<00:05:57.580> the

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
middle of the brush sometimes the

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.459 
middle of the brush sometimes the
bristle<00:05:58.180> would<00:05:58.360> actually<00:05:58.750> separate<00:05:59.259> together

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
bristle would actually separate together

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.200 
bristle would actually separate together
which<00:05:59.949> means<00:06:00.190> that<00:06:00.400> when<00:06:00.580> you're<00:06:00.699> painting<00:06:00.940> is

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
which means that when you're painting is

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.420 
which means that when you're painting is
not<00:06:01.389> that<00:06:01.599> good<00:06:01.870> but<00:06:02.289> those<00:06:02.530> brushes<00:06:03.190> that

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
not that good but those brushes that

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.749 
not that good but those brushes that
were<00:06:04.060> had<00:06:04.719> a<00:06:04.750> tendency<00:06:05.199> to<00:06:05.530> do<00:06:05.710> that<00:06:05.949> now<00:06:06.460> since

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
were had a tendency to do that now since

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.640 
were had a tendency to do that now since
I<00:06:06.909> started<00:06:07.150> using<00:06:07.300> this<00:06:07.780> they<00:06:07.990> stopped<00:06:08.289> doing

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
I started using this they stopped doing

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.779 
I started using this they stopped doing
it<00:06:08.740> they<00:06:08.860> still<00:06:09.070> keep<00:06:09.280> they're<00:06:09.490> you<00:06:09.759> know
