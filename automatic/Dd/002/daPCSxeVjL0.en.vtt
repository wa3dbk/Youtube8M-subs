00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.289 
DotA 2 is actually it works for every
single<00:01:46.049> level<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.979> works<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.399> level<00:01:47.700> 6<00:01:47.970> creeps

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
single level it works on level 6 creeps

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.980 
single level it works on level 6 creeps
as<00:01:48.450> well<00:01:48.659> I'm<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.350> sure<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:51.000> bug<00:01:51.689> or

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
as well I'm not sure if this is a bug or

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
as well I'm not sure if this is a bug or
this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.500> an<00:01:52.619> issue<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.340> fix<00:01:53.729> however

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this is an issue they will fix however

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
this is an issue they will fix however
it's<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> big<00:01:55.350> problem<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> is

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it's not a big problem even if it is

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.670 
it's not a big problem even if it is
just<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.909> level<00:01:57.180> 5<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.479> lower<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.439> still

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
just on level 5 or lower we can still

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
just on level 5 or lower we can still
make<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> work<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.719> is

the dyers that side and on the Sentinel

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310 
the dyers that side and on the Sentinel
it's<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.180> side<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.930> want<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.170> cut

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
it's on this side then you want to cut
several<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> trees<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.489> later<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.970> help

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
several of the trees here later to help

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.780 
several of the trees here later to help
stack<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.470> soon<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> hold<00:02:11.340> these<00:02:11.489> creeps

away<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.420> want<00:02:12.599> frostbite<00:02:13.170> them<00:02:13.410> here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
away you want frostbite them here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
away you want frostbite them here
and<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:15.090> want<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.420> pop<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:16.020> clarity

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and then you want to pop your clarity

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.960 
and then you want to pop your clarity
potion<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> first<00:02:17.250> wave<00:02:17.460> then<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.819> want

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
potion on the first wave then you want

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
potion on the first wave then you want
to<00:02:18.030> wait<00:02:18.150> until<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.510> 54<00:02:19.050> second<00:02:19.410> mark<00:02:19.590> and

to wait until the 54 second mark and
then<00:02:20.100> pull<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.459> creep<00:02:20.670> wave<00:02:20.850> now<00:02:21.360> usually<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
then pull the creep wave now usually you

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.430 
then pull the creep wave now usually you
want<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> pull<00:02:22.319> this<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.520> pull<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.940> and

double stack in and later clear this as
you<00:02:27.270> guys<00:02:27.390> will<00:02:27.569> see<00:02:27.600> however<00:02:28.530> through

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you guys will see however through

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.460 
you guys will see however through
experience<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.550> realized<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
experience I realized that if there is a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.500 
experience I realized that if there is a
sidecar<00:02:32.190> camp<00:02:32.490> or<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.150> camp<00:02:33.360> with

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
sidecar camp or if it's a camp with

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.230 
sidecar camp or if it's a camp with
arranged<00:02:34.020> unit<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:35.459> don't<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.820> enough<00:02:35.940> time

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
arranged unit you don't have enough time

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.410 
arranged unit you don't have enough time
to<00:02:36.300> hit<00:02:36.660> 54<00:02:37.230> seconds<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:37.830> pull<00:02:38.040> away<00:02:38.420> instead

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
to hit 54 seconds then pull away instead

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.540 
to hit 54 seconds then pull away instead
you<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.410> pull<00:02:40.770> straight<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.250> it

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
you have to just pull straight and it

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.949 
you have to just pull straight and it
doesn't<00:02:41.820> really<00:02:41.910> matter<00:02:42.090> stacking<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.780> is

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
doesn't really matter stacking this is

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.590 
doesn't really matter stacking this is
just<00:02:43.230> somewhat<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.160> bonus<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.330> kind<00:02:45.569> of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
just somewhat of a bonus and it kind of

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.500 
just somewhat of a bonus and it kind of
depends<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.200> luck<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.650> response<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:48.180> you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
depends on the luck of response but you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.560 
depends on the luck of response but you
guys<00:02:48.630> will<00:02:48.840> generally<00:02:49.350> see<00:02:49.620> how<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.100> works<00:02:50.280> out

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
guys will generally see how it works out

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.600 
guys will generally see how it works out
you<00:02:51.570> pull<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.920> freeze<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.519> you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
you pull it and then you freeze and you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.660 
you pull it and then you freeze and you
attack<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.900> as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.380> guys<00:02:55.500> see<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.340> just

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
attack so as you guys see here I'm just

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.759 
attack so as you guys see here I'm just
attacking<00:02:57.060> attacking<00:02:57.390> attacking<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.590> then<00:02:58.709> I

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
attacking attacking attacking and then I

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.130 
attacking attacking attacking and then I
freeze<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> new<00:02:59.280> creep<00:02:59.580> right<00:03:00.480> here<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.930> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
freeze a new creep right here and you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.110 
freeze a new creep right here and you
can<00:03:01.260> freeze<00:03:01.590> an<00:03:01.769> attack<00:03:02.100> here<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.550> these

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
can freeze an attack here and these

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850 
can freeze an attack here and these
groups<00:03:03.450> won't<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> crowd<00:03:04.260> because<00:03:04.620> you

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
groups won't get a crowd because you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.610 
groups won't get a crowd because you
have<00:03:05.100> pulled<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.700> away<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.510> all<00:03:07.140> during<00:03:07.440> all
