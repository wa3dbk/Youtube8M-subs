 Bomb slide! We are going to Lisbon today. 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.640
 And we are going to do a lot of great things there ... 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.420
 Yes! But what? You'll see that later. 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.460
 We are going to make a lot of people happy because ... 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.780
 ... we will hand out candy on the flight! 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.780
 Yummy! 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 Fancy a tasty candy? Thank you. 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.740
 Thank you. Please have a good flight. 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.080
 I just feel like a stewardess. Mrs? Nice candy? 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.920
 Thank you. - Please! 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.680
 And I am Noor from Queen or Jet Lags, and we are in ... 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 Lisbon! Yes! We have just arrived. And we are going to make a very nice trip ... 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.620
 and we take you along ... Let's go! 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.720
 We are going to spread "feel good" so we are going to give a lot of compliments to ... 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.880
 â€¦everybody. In portuguese! 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.640
 You are really nice, Pedro. Thank you! We get a ticket. Yaay ... 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.160
 Look at this is our booklet with give-away compliments in Portuguese ... 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.440
 So of course I'm not going to say it hard because otherwise the man will know what I'm going to say ... 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.300
 But thanks for the nice taxi ride because he is very sweet and he laughs all the time. 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.300
 He is very nice. - Yes. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.280
 That was amazing! - Nice, have a nice vacation. 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 And it was a 5-star ride ... 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 And you are 5-star customers ... 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 Just wait for our host! 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.960
 Yaaay! I'm curious. Me too ... ... because we get a tour of the house. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.700
 She is already practicing her Portuguese ... 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.300
 ... for the next compliment she will give to this nice gentleman. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.300
 Well, only if he's nice, right ... 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.560
 Well here is wine with cheese! - Yummy! This square is around here, right? 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.000
 Yes, it is right here at the door, so we can see that image. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.960
 You're welcome, it was a pleasure and we hope to see you again soon, OK? 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 The sun! I am completely happy! 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.080
 How far are you walking? Is it here? 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.880
 15 minutes, 20 minutes ... 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.440
 Straight ahead? 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.020
 "Thank you, without you we would have been lost hopelessly!" 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.240
 I hope so! Lots of fun! 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.500
 We are at a whole tourist attraction. People take pictures of themselves here. 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.060
 And we are going to ask if we can take the photos of them. 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.200
 That seemed very cool to us, didn't it? Yes! OK, let's go! 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700
 OK ... 1, 2, 3 ... 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.780
 We help you. 1, 2, ah he looks really nice ... 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.580
 Thank you! Aaahh, thanks! Have a nice day! 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.060
 I think these are very sweet pictures. 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
 It is really nice to help people. 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.600
 If you don't come here for fish you can always come here for the men ... right? 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880
 We ate very well, so we are going to thank the cook. 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.460
 Nicely cooked, it was delicious! 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.320
 Well these tiles can be found everywhere here in Lisbon ... 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.100
 I just say: it is typical Lisbonian. 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.100
 It is also very healthy what we are going to eat now ... 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.600
 Is it tasty? 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.100
 Oh yes, very tasty! 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.000
 Look how beautiful here. - And made a few people happy again! 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.640
 We have again spread our Dutch friendliness here in recent days. 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.740
 Yes, but unfortunately our task in Lisbon is over. Transavia! Thanks! Bye!
