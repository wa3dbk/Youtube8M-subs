good way of them getting rid of that and

good way of them getting rid of that and
stopping<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.150> from<00:02:42.180> happening

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
stopping it from happening

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.559 
stopping it from happening
the<00:02:43.200> main<00:02:43.440> herbal<00:02:43.860> use<00:02:44.060> which<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.239> would<00:02:45.390> never

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
the main herbal use which I would never

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.960 
the main herbal use which I would never
do<00:02:45.810> actually<00:02:46.349> because<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:47.099> quite<00:02:47.880> an

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
do actually because it's quite an

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.510 
do actually because it's quite an
aggressive<00:02:48.090> thing<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.720> do<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.140> dangerous<00:02:50.130> is

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
aggressive thing to do and dangerous is

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.600 
aggressive thing to do and dangerous is
to<00:02:51.239> reduce<00:02:51.810> high<00:02:52.080> blood<00:02:52.380> pressure<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.190> reason

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
to reduce high blood pressure the reason

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.250 
to reduce high blood pressure the reason
it's<00:02:53.790> not<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.970> good<00:02:54.120> idea<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.510> use<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.020> reduce

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
it's not a good idea to use it to reduce

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.550 
it's not a good idea to use it to reduce
high<00:02:55.470> blood<00:02:55.500> pressure<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:57.180> will<00:02:57.810> do

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
high blood pressure is that it will do

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800 
high blood pressure is that it will do
so<00:02:58.860> by<00:02:59.069> damaging<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> heart<00:02:59.819> muscle<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.450> also

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
so by damaging the heart muscle is also

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.140 
so by damaging the heart muscle is also
partly<00:03:01.140> useful<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.800> smaller<00:03:02.040> doses<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.700> as<00:03:03.060> an

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
partly useful in smaller doses and as an

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
partly useful in smaller doses and as an
anti<00:03:03.420> epileptic<00:03:03.569> but<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.319> general<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:05.250> should

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
anti epileptic but in general you should

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.030 
anti epileptic but in general you should
steer<00:03:05.670> clear<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:06.090> eating<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.690> weight<00:03:07.620> spread

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
steer clear of eating it weight spread

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400 
steer clear of eating it weight spread
obviously<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.550> parasite<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:09.330> trees<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:10.019> was

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
obviously is a parasite on trees I was

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.830 
obviously is a parasite on trees I was
hoping<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.769> find<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.340> real<00:03:11.610> living<00:03:12.330> plant<00:03:12.660> but

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
hoping to find a real living plant but

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
hoping to find a real living plant but
mistletoe<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.380> could<00:03:13.530> show<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.709> a

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
mistletoe that I could show you a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.500 
mistletoe that I could show you a
picture<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.220> because<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:14.910> are<00:03:15.030> quite<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.450> few

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
picture of because there are quite a few

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.640 
picture of because there are quite a few
out<00:03:15.780> here<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:16.769> buried<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:19.440> quite

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
out here you get buried it's quite

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.170 
out here you get buried it's quite
sticky<00:03:21.500> squash<00:03:22.519> what<00:03:23.519> happens<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.060> gets

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
sticky squash what happens is it gets

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.850 
sticky squash what happens is it gets
stuck<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.690> tree<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.200> then<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> will<00:03:25.680> grow

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
stuck to the tree and then it will grow

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.180 
stuck to the tree and then it will grow
roots<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.489> parasites<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.450> tree<00:03:28.190> it's

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
roots and parasites like the tree it's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.580 
roots and parasites like the tree it's
in<00:03:29.310> Loren<00:03:29.610> fascia<00:03:29.870> which<00:03:30.870> basically<00:03:31.260> just

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
in Loren fascia which basically just

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.080 
in Loren fascia which basically just
consists<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.040> mistletoes<00:03:32.549> there<00:03:33.030> are

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
consists of mistletoes there are

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.970 
consists of mistletoes there are
ancestors<00:03:33.600> which<00:03:33.959> one<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.590> which<00:03:34.769> still

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
ancestors which one of which still

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.500 
ancestors which one of which still
survives<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.340> Australia<00:03:35.790> were<00:03:36.180> actually

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
survives in Australia were actually

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.059 
survives in Australia were actually
trees<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.110> obviously<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.590> died<00:03:37.769> off<00:03:37.950> in

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
trees so obviously it's died off in

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.650 
trees so obviously it's died off in
spite<00:03:38.280> being<00:03:38.489> dicot<00:03:38.850> it's<00:03:39.000> actually<00:03:39.329> got

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
spite being dicot it's actually got

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.759 
spite being dicot it's actually got
parallel<00:03:40.200> venation

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
parallel venation

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.460 
parallel venation
so<00:03:41.489> there's<00:03:41.850> another<00:03:42.060> example<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:43.290> why<00:03:43.620> that

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
so there's another example of why that

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.330 
so there's another example of why that
classification<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.829> not<00:03:46.859> really<00:03:47.220> very

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
classification is not really very

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.910 
classification is not really very
reliable<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.390> used<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.959> tree<00:03:49.200> roots<00:03:49.680> used

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
reliable it used to be a tree roots used

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.009 
reliable it used to be a tree roots used
to<00:03:50.010> invade<00:03:50.280> other<00:03:50.549> trees<00:03:50.970> eventually<00:03:51.870> it

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
to invade other trees eventually it

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.800 
to invade other trees eventually it
evolved<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.440> become<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.709> shrub<00:03:53.070> growing

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
evolved to become a shrub growing

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.210 
evolved to become a shrub growing
halfway<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> tree<00:03:55.200> came<00:03:55.590> parasitic

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
halfway up a tree came parasitic

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.500 
halfway up a tree came parasitic
although<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.489> was<00:03:56.579> already<00:03:56.760> parasitic<00:03:57.420> on

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
although it was already parasitic on

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.449 
although it was already parasitic on
other<00:03:57.720> trees<00:03:57.900> although<00:03:58.140> although<00:03:58.799> it's<00:03:58.980> paler

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
other trees although although it's paler

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.800 
other trees although although it's paler
because<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.910> doesn't<00:04:00.120> rely<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.510> much<00:04:00.540> on

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
because it doesn't rely so much on

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.660 
because it doesn't rely so much on
chlorophyll<00:04:01.320> as<00:04:01.530> some<00:04:02.040> other<00:04:02.160> plants<00:04:02.459> doing

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
chlorophyll as some other plants doing

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.509 
chlorophyll as some other plants doing
because<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:03.000> parasitic<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.930> does<00:04:04.079> actually

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
because it's parasitic it does actually

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.410 
because it's parasitic it does actually
photosynthesize<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.700> some<00:04:05.850> extent<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.269> it's

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
photosynthesize to some extent so it's

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.360 
photosynthesize to some extent so it's
not<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.540> total<00:04:06.750> parasite<00:04:07.380> oh<00:04:07.500> yeah<00:04:08.100> that's

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
not a total parasite oh yeah that's

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.220 
not a total parasite oh yeah that's
mistletoe<00:04:08.820> for<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.720> by<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:09.989> way<00:04:10.140> the
