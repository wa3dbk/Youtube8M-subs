00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
exactly this topic the paper took a look

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.259 
exactly this topic the paper took a look
at<00:00:20.820> 47<00:00:21.720> commonly<00:00:22.470> classified<00:00:23.269> powerhouse

we<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.070> define<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.669> healthy<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.360> in

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
we have to define what healthy is in

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.680 
we have to define what healthy is in
this<00:00:34.260> context<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.760> study<00:00:35.969> they

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
this context so in this study they

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.139 
this context so in this study they
defined<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.230> healthy<00:00:37.680> food<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.520> highly

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
defined a healthy food as a highly

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
defined a healthy food as a highly
nutrient-dense<00:00:39.690> food<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.739> nutrient

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
nutrient-dense food so what is nutrient

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.660 
nutrient-dense food so what is nutrient
density

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
density

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.639 
density
well<00:00:42.270> nutrient<00:00:43.050> density<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
well nutrient density is the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.959 
well nutrient density is the
