00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.639
 downtown in downtown kyoto 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.139
 because I was preparing the island of sumatra 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 I wanted to start filming some 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 sequences and I'm going to take you with 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.539
 I'm going to serve things 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
 interesting on my way 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.189
 I also planned to go see 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 the exposure of a friend in a 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.340
 he has a cafe actually it's a shop 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.109
 of antiques that also makes coffee at the same time 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.510
 time it's a place I love and at 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.270
 dairy products are often exhibited in 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.579
 this moment we had on the species of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.159
 doll a little fancy 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 finally with the white wolves and all that 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.909
 is a great owl and these days 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.909
 today so I should go see 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.699
 I do not know if I can film 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.769
 so we'll see and then we'll eat at 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.719
 restaurant with friends but that I do not think 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.010
 that I have the film is so it's unfair 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.010
 here we go 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.350
 mid-october japan it's a while 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 magnificent 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 if you go by Catholic from 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.170
 look for a place that comes out a little bit of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.590
 ordinary 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.550
 so I advise you this coffee which is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.550
 an antique shop and a cafe 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.590

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.280
 spyder because actually the coffee was 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.360
 really really filled so it's a 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.830

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.600
