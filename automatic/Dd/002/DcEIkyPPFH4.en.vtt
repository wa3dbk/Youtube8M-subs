I'd<00:03:31.500> been<00:03:31.770> able<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.100> see<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.880> he<00:03:32.970> was<00:03:33.090> doing

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
I'd been able to see that he was doing

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.790 
I'd been able to see that he was doing
something<00:03:33.660> weird<00:03:33.870> with<00:03:34.020> his<00:03:34.140> shoulder<00:03:34.500> strap

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
something weird with his shoulder strap

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.140 
something weird with his shoulder strap
so<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.040> thought<00:03:35.310> he<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.490> just<00:03:35.670> doing<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.000> with

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
so I thought he was just doing it with

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.830 
so I thought he was just doing it with
his<00:03:36.270> fingers

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
his fingers

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.050 
his fingers
you<00:03:37.320> know<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:38.160> never<00:03:38.340> heard<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.670> any<00:03:38.820> bead

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
you know I we never heard of any bead

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.640 
you know I we never heard of any bead
benders<00:03:39.420> back<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.810> those<00:03:39.990> days<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.530> know<00:03:40.560> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
benders back in those days you know and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.170 
benders back in those days you know and
his<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.070> think<00:03:41.100> he<00:03:41.340> was<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.610> only<00:03:41.730> one<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:41.940> had

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
his I think he was the only one that had

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.990 
his I think he was the only one that had
one<00:03:42.390> by<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:42.780> point<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:44.400> course<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.880> know

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
one by that point and of course you know

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.300 
one by that point and of course you know
they<00:03:45.150> became<00:03:45.420> very<00:03:45.630> very<00:03:46.200> popular<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
they became very very popular as a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.330 
they became very very popular as a
result<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:49.290> manufacturers<00:03:50.040> came

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
result and you know manufacturers came

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.800 
result and you know manufacturers came
out<00:03:50.520> with<00:03:50.640> their<00:03:50.760> own<00:03:50.820> versions<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.480> them<00:03:51.660> and

out with their own versions of them and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.190 
out with their own versions of them and
so<00:03:51.960> on<00:03:51.990> but<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.820> was<00:03:53.820> living<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.660> dark<00:03:54.960> in

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.970 
the UK and I just could hear the records
and<00:03:57.270> I<00:03:57.330> just<00:03:57.570> thought<00:03:57.720> well<00:03:58.320> I'm<00:03:58.440> hearing<00:03:58.830> him

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980

and I just thought well I'm hearing him
do<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.490> I<00:03:59.520> know<00:03:59.640> it's<00:03:59.880> possible<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.660> was

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
do it so I know it's possible so I was

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.810 
do it so I know it's possible so I was
just<00:04:01.020> finding<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.470> way<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:01.980> kind<00:04:02.670> of

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
just finding a way to do it kind of

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.730 
just finding a way to do it kind of
without<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:04.140> know<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:05.480> got<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.600> meet<00:04:06.780> him<00:04:06.990> too<00:04:07.260> a

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
without you know I got to meet him too a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.210 
without you know I got to meet him too a
couple<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.700> years<00:04:08.880> later<00:04:09.120> by<00:04:09.450> which<00:04:09.630> time<00:04:09.870> I

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
couple of years later by which time I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.650 
couple of years later by which time I
managed<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.250> get<00:04:11.520> most<00:04:11.820> of<00:04:12.030> what<00:04:12.210> he<00:04:12.360> had<00:04:12.450> done

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
managed to get most of what he had done

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.450 
managed to get most of what he had done
I<00:04:12.960> mean<00:04:13.200> some<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.740> just<00:04:13.770> baffled<00:04:14.340> me

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
I mean some of it just baffled me

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.980 
I mean some of it just baffled me
particularly<00:04:15.030> things<00:04:15.270> where<00:04:15.480> he's<00:04:15.600> playing<00:04:15.870> a

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
particularly things where he's playing a

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.440 
particularly things where he's playing a
full<00:04:16.590> chord<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.280> still<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.880> know<00:04:18.000> bending

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
full chord and still you know bending

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.300 
full chord and still you know bending
the<00:04:18.540> note<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.989> thought<00:04:19.590> somebody<00:04:19.890> must<00:04:20.220> be

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
the note I thought somebody must be

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.620 
the note I thought somebody must be
standing<00:04:20.760> there<00:04:21.000> with<00:04:21.060> him<00:04:21.360> in<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.570> studio

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
standing there with him in the studio

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.600 
standing there with him in the studio
and<00:04:22.110> just<00:04:22.170> said<00:04:22.440> when<00:04:22.920> he<00:04:22.980> gives<00:04:23.160> nods<00:04:23.460> his

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
and just said when he gives nods his

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.210 
and just said when he gives nods his
head<00:04:23.670> okay<00:04:24.420> then<00:04:24.660> now<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:24.960> know<00:04:25.230> push<00:04:26.010> behind

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
head okay then now you know push behind

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.750 
head okay then now you know push behind
the<00:04:26.460> nut<00:04:26.670> but<00:04:27.530> anyway<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:29.130> bead<00:04:29.310> bender<00:04:29.610> was

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
the nut but anyway the bead bender was

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.590 
the nut but anyway the bead bender was
what<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.930> try<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.230> think<00:04:32.120> those<00:04:33.120> are<00:04:33.330> those<00:04:33.540> are

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
what to try to think those are those are

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.020 
what to try to think those are those are
probably<00:04:33.930> my<00:04:34.200> main<00:04:34.380> early<00:04:35.280> influences<00:04:35.910> I

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
probably my main early influences I

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.670 
probably my main early influences I
picked<00:04:36.270> up<00:04:36.390> an<00:04:36.570> awful<00:04:36.870> lot<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.020> other<00:04:37.230> other

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
to play the lick and then it and then I

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.710 
to play the lick and then it and then I
really<00:05:05.220> feel<00:05:05.430> creative<00:05:05.700> at<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.180> point<00:05:06.450> and<00:05:06.660> I

really feel creative at that point and I

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.230 
really feel creative at that point and I
turned<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:07.590> around<00:05:07.770> I'll<00:05:08.160> invert<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:08.760> find

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
turned it around I'll invert it and find

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.220 
turned it around I'll invert it and find
different<00:05:09.630> shapes<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.140> different

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
different shapes and different

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.490 
different shapes and different
applications<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:11.250> know
