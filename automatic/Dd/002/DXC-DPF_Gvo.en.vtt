looks like it would be a beer color

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.930 
looks like it would be a beer color
again<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.890> course<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.370> little<00:02:11.580> more<00:02:11.700> orange

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
again of course a little more orange

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.650 
again of course a little more orange
than<00:02:12.150> what<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> beer<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.440> but

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
than what a beer would be but

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.360 
than what a beer would be but
let's<00:02:15.660> give<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.960> try<00:02:16.620> now<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.250> we've

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
let's give this a try now that we've

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.620 
let's give this a try now that we've
seen<00:02:17.670> what<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:17.910> looks<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> glass

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
seen what it looks like in the glass

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.449 
seen what it looks like in the glass
let's<00:02:18.930> give<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.230> try<00:02:19.440> find<00:02:20.190> out<00:02:20.250> what<00:02:20.370> it's

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
let's give this a try find out what it's

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.510 
let's give this a try find out what it's
like<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.120> Duff<00:02:21.480> energy<00:02:22.230> drink<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:23.370> give

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
like the Duff energy drink just give

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:34.930 
like the Duff energy drink just give
this<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> try

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.920 

supposed<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.000> make<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> lot<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.390> noises<00:02:36.630> right

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
supposed to make a lot of noises right

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.670 
supposed to make a lot of noises right
now<00:02:37.190> very<00:02:38.190> interesting<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:39.510> uh<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.989> has<00:02:40.290> more

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
now very interesting it uh it has more

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.199 
now very interesting it uh it has more
just<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.220> Orange<00:02:41.910> Crush<00:02:42.239> flavor<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:45.060> why

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
just a Orange Crush flavor to it but why

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.990 
just a Orange Crush flavor to it but why
I'm<00:02:45.390> making<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.959> much<00:02:46.140> noise<00:02:46.610> --is<00:02:47.610> with<00:02:47.850> my

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
I'm making so much noise --is with my

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.810 
I'm making so much noise --is with my
mouth<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.470> seems<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.400> clings

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
mouth is it it seems like it clings

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.590 
mouth is it it seems like it clings
itself<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.720> inside<00:02:52.290> roof<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.890> my<00:02:53.040> mouth<00:02:53.250> as

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
itself to the inside roof of my mouth as

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.420 
itself to the inside roof of my mouth as
I'm<00:02:54.600> drinking<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.440> can<00:02:55.890> obviously<00:02:56.130> taste

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
I'm drinking it I can obviously taste

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.150 
I'm drinking it I can obviously taste
the<00:02:56.580> orange<00:02:56.940> but<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.660> lingers<00:02:58.290> around<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:59.010> my

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
the orange but it lingers around in my

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
the orange but it lingers around in my
mouth<00:02:59.900> perhaps<00:03:00.900> those<00:03:01.200> are<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
mouth perhaps those are the that the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.050 
mouth perhaps those are the that the
energy<00:03:04.170> ingredients<00:03:04.950> perhaps<00:03:05.310> or<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.880> could

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
energy ingredients perhaps or it could

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.590 
energy ingredients perhaps or it could
also<00:03:06.239> be<00:03:06.480> again<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.610> pantothenic<00:03:08.610> acid<00:03:08.640> I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
also be again the pantothenic acid I

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.190 
also be again the pantothenic acid I
have<00:03:10.080> no<00:03:10.320> idea<00:03:10.680> what<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.959> pretty

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
have no idea what that is it is pretty

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.070 
have no idea what that is it is pretty
good<00:03:13.350> though<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.769> an<00:03:14.430> energy<00:03:14.910> drink<00:03:15.150> class<00:03:15.690> I

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
good though of an energy drink class I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.150 
good though of an energy drink class I
would<00:03:16.230> say<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.800> better<00:03:16.920> ones

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
would say it's one of the better ones

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.380 
would say it's one of the better ones
because<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.550> just<00:03:17.640> tastes<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:17.970> an<00:03:18.120> orange

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
because it just tastes like an orange

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.110 
because it just tastes like an orange
soda<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.140> am<00:03:20.100> still<00:03:20.340> curious<00:03:20.489> though<00:03:20.730> why<00:03:20.940> it's

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
soda I am still curious though why it's

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.080 
soda I am still curious though why it's
clinging<00:03:21.870> itself<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.100> inside<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.670> spots

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
clinging itself to the inside of spots

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.750 
clinging itself to the inside of spots
mouths<00:03:24.799> anyways<00:03:25.799> though<00:03:25.980> if<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.489> want<00:03:26.700> to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
mouths anyways though if you do want to
