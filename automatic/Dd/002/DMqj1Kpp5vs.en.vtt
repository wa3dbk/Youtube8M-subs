00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
how I do pin removal I use a pin punch

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.560 
how I do pin removal I use a pin punch
now<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.660> told<00:00:19.140> somebody<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.769> a<00:00:20.150> discussion<00:00:21.150> one

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
now I told somebody on a discussion one

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.040 
now I told somebody on a discussion one
time<00:00:21.839> that<00:00:22.259> to<00:00:22.980> use<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> pin<00:00:23.460> punch<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
time that to use a pin punch and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.269 
time that to use a pin punch and
somebody<00:00:25.050> else<00:00:25.259> piped<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.740> said<00:00:26.009> and<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.249> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
somebody else piped in said and use a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.509 
somebody else piped in said and use a
screwdriver<00:00:26.660> it's<00:00:27.660> cheaper<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.289> agree<00:00:29.249> it<00:00:29.369> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
screwdriver it's cheaper I agree it is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.150 
screwdriver it's cheaper I agree it is
cheaper<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.029> easier<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.449> get

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
cheaper it's easier to get

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.100 
cheaper it's easier to get
however<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.369> pin<00:00:33.000> punch<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.600> bought<00:00:33.810> at

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
however this pin punch can be bought at

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.300 
however this pin punch can be bought at
any<00:00:35.210> hardware<00:00:36.210> store<00:00:36.590> it's<00:00:37.590> five<00:00:37.830> bucks<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
any hardware store it's five bucks a

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.830 
any hardware store it's five bucks a
little<00:00:38.520> expensive<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.830> there's<00:00:41.840> there's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
little expensive but there's there's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.780 
little expensive but there's there's
there's<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.650> lot<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.890> reasons<00:00:44.190> why<00:00:44.310> I<00:00:44.340> use<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
there's a lot of reasons why I use it

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.750 
there's a lot of reasons why I use it
one<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:46.560> tip<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.950> flat<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:49.460> when<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> use<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
one the tip is flat so when you use a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.740 
one the tip is flat so when you use a
screwdriver

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
screwdriver

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.510 
screwdriver
whether<00:00:52.470> it's<00:00:52.710> flat<00:00:52.950> head<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.460> star<00:00:53.940> point

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
whether it's flat head or star point

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.280 
whether it's flat head or star point
when<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> put<00:00:56.790> it<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> pin<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.720> tends<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
when you put it on the pin it tends to

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.730 
when you put it on the pin it tends to
slip<00:00:58.650> more<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.750> that's<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.200> point

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
slip more and that's because the point

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.149 
slip more and that's because the point
is<00:01:01.950> either<00:01:02.310> pointing<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.060> uneven<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
is either pointing or it's uneven so I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.870 
is either pointing or it's uneven so I
decided<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> pin<00:01:06.450> punch<00:01:10.039> there<00:01:11.039> when

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
decided to get a pin punch there when

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.349 
decided to get a pin punch there when
you're<00:01:12.060> removing<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.630> pin<00:01:12.869> there's<00:01:13.109> some<00:01:14.359> the

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
you're removing a pin there's some the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.380 
you're removing a pin there's some the
the<00:01:15.390> pros<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.170> obvious<00:01:16.649> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.729> two<00:01:18.149> pieces

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the pros are obvious you have two pieces

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.209 
the pros are obvious you have two pieces
it's<00:01:18.840> easier<00:01:19.109> to<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.499> here<00:01:19.829> and<00:01:19.950> paint

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
it's easier to get in here and paint

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.090 
it's easier to get in here and paint
things<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> pros<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.600> obvious<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.829> cons

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
things and the pros are obvious the cons

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.910 
things and the pros are obvious the cons
however<00:01:26.539> sometimes<00:01:27.539> no<00:01:28.170> matter<00:01:28.350> how<00:01:28.530> careful

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
however sometimes no matter how careful

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 
however sometimes no matter how careful
you<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.759> piece<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:30.810> break<00:01:31.049> away<00:01:31.259> from

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
you are a piece will break away from

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.160 
you are a piece will break away from
where<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:32.490> pushing<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> pin<00:01:33.149> out<00:01:33.359> I've

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
where you're pushing the pin out I've

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
where you're pushing the pin out I've
had<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.619> happen<00:01:34.859> even<00:01:35.249> though<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> pay<00:01:35.850> close

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
had this happen even though I pay close

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.709 
had this happen even though I pay close
attention<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.960> which<00:01:37.439> way<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.770> pin<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> going

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
attention to which way the pin is going

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.950 
attention to which way the pin is going
on<00:01:39.719> that<00:01:40.439> note<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.490> pin<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.969> designed<00:01:42.539> with<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
on that note the pin is designed with a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.980 
on that note the pin is designed with a
knurled<00:01:43.380> edge<00:01:43.679> I<00:01:44.069> will<00:01:44.759> show<00:01:45.569> you<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.869> I'm

knurled edge I will show you what I'm

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.230 
knurled edge I will show you what I'm
talking<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.469> one<00:01:47.100> end<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.459> the<00:01:47.549> pin<00:01:47.819> has<00:01:48.749> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
talking about one end of the pin has a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.319 
talking about one end of the pin has a
hex<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.450> o<00:01:51.509> parent<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
hex on o parent see you like this one it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.520 
hex on o parent see you like this one it
has<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:54.600> an<00:01:55.609> anchor<00:01:56.609> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> rough<00:01:57.959> edge<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
has a an anchor this is a rough edge to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.580 
has a an anchor this is a rough edge to
keep<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.889> secured<00:01:59.310> into<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> toy<00:02:00.439> what<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
keep it secured into the toy what you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
keep it secured into the toy what you
want<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.840> push<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.049> pin<00:02:04.850> away<00:02:05.850> from<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
want to do is push the pin away from the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
want to do is push the pin away from the
knurled<00:02:06.569> edge<00:02:06.749> so<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.439> knurled<00:02:07.740> edge<00:02:07.859> is<00:02:08.039> on

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
knurled edge so the knurled edge is on

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.680 
knurled edge so the knurled edge is on
this<00:02:08.369> side<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.789> want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.090> push<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.509> pin

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
this side you want to push the pin

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.030 
this side you want to push the pin
through<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:11.450> okay<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:13.019> you<00:02:13.500> push<00:02:13.739> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
through this side okay if you push you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.610 
through this side okay if you push you
can<00:02:14.280> push<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.790> through<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.060> other<00:02:15.180> way

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
can push it through the other way

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.080 
can push it through the other way
but<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.950> lot<00:02:18.130> harder<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.640> takes<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.910> lot

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
but it's a lot harder it takes a lot

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.620 
but it's a lot harder it takes a lot
longer<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.280> tools<00:02:21.520> you'll<00:02:21.760> need<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.480> do

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
longer to do the tools you'll need to do

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.510 
longer to do the tools you'll need to do
it<00:02:22.750> my<00:02:22.930> way<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.040> principles<00:02:27.430> are

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
it my way and it's the principles are

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.770 
it my way and it's the principles are
the<00:02:27.580> same<00:02:27.790> even<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.240> use<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> screwdriver

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the same even if you use a screwdriver

sometimes<00:04:48.999> I<00:04:49.149> do<00:04:49.209> have<00:04:49.509> to<00:04:49.659> use<00:04:49.809> a<00:04:49.839> hole<00:04:50.110> which

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:50.769 
sometimes I do have to use a hole which

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.919 
sometimes I do have to use a hole which
is<00:04:50.919> over<00:04:51.219> here<00:04:51.249> where<00:04:51.909> you<00:04:51.999> can't<00:04:52.269> see<00:04:52.539> it<00:04:52.689> on

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:52.929 
is over here where you can't see it on

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:57.469 
is over here where you can't see it on
my<00:04:53.139> desk<00:04:54.569> so<00:04:55.569> I'll<00:04:56.289> show<00:04:56.499> you<00:04:56.529> my<00:04:56.709> technique<00:04:57.159> I

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
my desk so I'll show you my technique I

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.029 
my desk so I'll show you my technique I
take<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:58.599> piece<00:04:58.809> I<00:04:58.989> place<00:04:59.229> it<00:04:59.409> over<00:04:59.649> my<00:04:59.769> hole

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
take the piece I place it over my hole

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.409 
take the piece I place it over my hole
and<00:05:01.469> I<00:05:02.469> make<00:05:02.679> sure<00:05:02.709> it's<00:05:03.669> even<00:05:04.059> on<00:05:04.149> both<00:05:04.360> sides

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
and I make sure it's even on both sides

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.809 
and I make sure it's even on both sides
I<00:05:05.139> don't<00:05:05.769> want<00:05:05.949> it<00:05:06.039> to<00:05:06.189> do<00:05:06.339> one<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.699> these

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
I don't want it to do one of these

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.929 
I don't want it to do one of these
numbers<00:05:07.300> when<00:05:07.509> I'm<00:05:07.689> punching<00:05:08.199> it<00:05:08.309> so<00:05:09.309> I<00:05:09.339> make

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:09.939 
numbers when I'm punching it so I make

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.379 
numbers when I'm punching it so I make
sure<00:05:09.969> there's<00:05:10.449> a<00:05:10.539> it's<00:05:11.409> not<00:05:11.619> going<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.860> do<00:05:12.039> that

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
sure there's a it's not going to do that

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.679 
sure there's a it's not going to do that
so<00:05:13.389> then<00:05:13.569> I<00:05:13.599> take<00:05:13.869> my<00:05:14.080> pin<00:05:14.289> punch<00:05:15.149> alright<00:05:16.149> for

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689
