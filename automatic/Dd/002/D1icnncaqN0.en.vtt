00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
let's do that and i basically did it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.310 
let's do that and i basically did it
exactly<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.179> way<00:00:30.269> he<00:00:30.300> wanted<00:00:30.810> he<00:00:30.929> wanted<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
exactly the way he wanted he wanted the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340 
exactly the way he wanted he wanted the
colours<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.919> be<00:00:32.130> silver<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:34.110> metal

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
colours to be silver for all the metal

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.050 
colours to be silver for all the metal
parts<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:34.829> were<00:00:34.980> normally<00:00:35.130> blue<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.910> then

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
parts which were normally blue and then

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.430 
parts which were normally blue and then
we're<00:00:36.180> gonna<00:00:36.270> turn<00:00:36.540> all<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.900> other<00:00:37.050> parts

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we're gonna turn all the other parts

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.380 
we're gonna turn all the other parts
black<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> looked<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:39.030> under

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
black so it looked kind of like an under

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.410 
black so it looked kind of like an under
suit<00:00:40.379> type<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.100> thing<00:00:41.489> kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.090> because

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
suit type of thing kind of because

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
suit type of thing kind of because
causes<00:00:42.840> obviously<00:00:43.260> isn't<00:00:43.469> wearing<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> suit

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
causes obviously isn't wearing a suit

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
causes obviously isn't wearing a suit
but<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.879> were<00:00:44.969> tweaking<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.449> for<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.719> design

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
but we were tweaking it for this design

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
but we were tweaking it for this design
and<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.530> made<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:46.859> like<00:00:46.920> he<00:00:47.340> had

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and then we made it look like he had

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.759 
and then we made it look like he had
pants<00:00:48.149> by<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> dark<00:00:49.199> grey<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> then

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
pants by going with a dark grey and then

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.209 
pants by going with a dark grey and then
the<00:00:49.949> gold<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> X<00:00:50.730> logos<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.629> his<00:00:52.440> shins

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the gold for the X logos on his shins

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.840 
the gold for the X logos on his shins
and<00:00:53.609> then<00:00:53.820> he<00:00:53.879> still<00:00:54.149> has<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> silver<00:00:55.079> feet<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
and then he still has the silver feet so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
and then he still has the silver feet so
really<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> did<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.420> modify<00:00:58.289> some<00:00:58.500> joints

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
really all I did was modify some joints

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.779 
really all I did was modify some joints
and<00:00:58.980> things<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and things like that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
and things like that
Irie<00:01:00.210> sculpted<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> chest<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.170> bit

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
Irie sculpted the chest a little bit

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.319 
Irie sculpted the chest a little bit
because<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> wanted<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.519> fuller<00:01:02.730> chest<00:01:03.120> from

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
because you wanted the fuller chest from

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
because you wanted the fuller chest from
the<00:01:03.449> open<00:01:03.870> opening<00:01:04.350> chest<00:01:04.650> rather<00:01:04.920> than<00:01:05.160> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the open opening chest rather than the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
the open opening chest rather than the
closed<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.730> so<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.940> had<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> rescale<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
closed one so I had to rescale up the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.360 
closed one so I had to rescale up the
side<00:01:06.960> pieces<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> sculpted<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.010> center

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
side pieces and I sculpted the center

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.850 
side pieces and I sculpted the center
part<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> little<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.440> then<00:01:10.440> I<00:01:10.470> repainted

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
part a little bit and then I repainted

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.249 
part a little bit and then I repainted
all<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.579> black<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.900> all<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
all of it black and then I get all the

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.069 
all of it black and then I get all the
silver<00:01:13.650> parts<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.729> shiny<00:01:15.630> silver

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
silver parts to be a really shiny silver

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.140 
silver parts to be a really shiny silver
hopefully<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.829> actually<00:01:17.640> shows<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
hopefully that it actually shows up as a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
hopefully that it actually shows up as a
shiny<00:01:18.450> silver<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.990> camera<00:01:19.409> sometimes

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
shiny silver on camera sometimes

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
shiny silver on camera sometimes
metallics<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> strange<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.210> doing

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
metallics have a strange way of doing

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
metallics have a strange way of doing
things<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:23.009> super<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.640> looks<00:01:23.820> like

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
things but it's super it looks like

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.510 
things but it's super it looks like
metal<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.920> pretty<00:01:26.189> pleased

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
metal actually so I was pretty pleased

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.469 
metal actually so I was pretty pleased
with<00:01:26.610> how<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.790> turned<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.420> we

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
with how that turned out and then we

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.819 
with how that turned out and then we
have<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.899> it<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.259> satin<00:01:28.619> for

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
have kind of like it just a satin for

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.410 
have kind of like it just a satin for
the<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> gray<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> black<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.360> then

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
the for the gray in the black and then
the<00:01:30.479> gold<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> also<00:01:31.140> super<00:01:31.530> metallic<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.460> for

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000

the gold is also super metallic and for
the<00:01:33.119> head<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:33.540> obviously<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.020> needed<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the head because obviously we needed a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.030

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
out just the way he wanted it so it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
anime style Colossus and of course he

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.750 
anime style Colossus and of course he
still<00:02:12.030> has<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.950> interchangeable

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
still has all of the interchangeable

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.089 
still has all of the interchangeable
hands<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> Guyver<00:02:15.840> had<00:02:16.260> originally

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
hands that the Guyver had originally

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.759 
hands that the Guyver had originally
that's<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.489> even<00:02:17.670> all<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.910> them<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:19.080> there's

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
that's not even all of them so there's

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.910 
that's not even all of them so there's
some<00:02:19.980> posing<00:02:20.340> varieties

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
some posing varieties

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.250 
some posing varieties
there<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.340> we<00:02:21.940> made<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.810> spikes

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
there and we made it so that the spikes

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.190 
there and we made it so that the spikes
still<00:02:23.830> work<00:02:24.099> in<00:02:24.400> his<00:02:24.910> arms<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.690> if<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.959> want<00:02:26.140> to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
still work in his arms so if we want to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.140 
still work in his arms so if we want to
put<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.440> spikes<00:02:26.709> on<00:02:26.920> there<00:02:27.160> we<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.910> do<00:02:28.030> that

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
put the spikes on there we can do that

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.030 
put the spikes on there we can do that
the<00:02:28.330> big<00:02:28.510> ones<00:02:28.690> or<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> small<00:02:29.380> ones<00:02:29.620> they're

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the big ones or the small ones they're

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.339 
the big ones or the small ones they're
all<00:02:30.069> still<00:02:30.550> there<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.569> basically<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
all still there so it's basically the

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.110 
all still there so it's basically the
same<00:02:32.530> exact<00:02:32.890> articulation<00:02:33.550> same<00:02:33.790> exact

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
same exact articulation same exact

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.720 
same exact articulation same exact
sculpt<00:02:34.510> other<00:02:34.810> than<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.170> chest<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.709> then<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
sculpt other than the chest and then the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.490 
sculpt other than the chest and then the
head<00:02:36.910> otherwise<00:02:37.569> it's<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.959> same<00:02:38.140> as<00:02:38.290> Guyver

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
head otherwise it's the same as Guyver

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.660 
head otherwise it's the same as Guyver
so<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.980> don't<00:02:39.160> have<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.310> go<00:02:39.400> through<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.670 
so I don't have to go through the
