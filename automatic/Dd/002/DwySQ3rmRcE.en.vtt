00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
the microcontroller and driven by a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.670 
the microcontroller and driven by a
MOSFET<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:36.250> basic<00:00:37.250> function<00:00:37.910> of<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:38.210> is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
MOSFET the basic function of this is

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
that for a street light which needs to

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.600 
that for a street light which needs to

be used most optimally for example say

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.810 
be used most optimally for example say
after<00:00:49.969> about<00:00:50.149> say<00:00:50.390> 11<00:00:50.690> o'clock<00:00:50.750> in<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.140> night

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
after about say 11 o'clock in the night

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.119 
after about say 11 o'clock in the night
when<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.940> traffic<00:00:53.149> is<00:00:53.420> not<00:00:53.629> very<00:00:53.899> high<00:00:54.200> the

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
when the traffic is not very high the

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.590 
when the traffic is not very high the
intensity<00:00:55.579> can<00:00:56.539> progressively<00:00:57.230> get<00:00:57.920> reduced

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
intensity can progressively get reduced

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.740 
intensity can progressively get reduced
so<00:00:59.600> as<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.870> save<00:01:00.079> energy<00:01:01.270> in<00:01:02.270> order<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.570> see

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
so as to save energy in order to see

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.930 
so as to save energy in order to see
that<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.410> not<00:01:03.649> practicable<00:01:04.220> for<00:01:04.369> us<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.820> up

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
that it's not practicable for us to up

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.219 
that it's not practicable for us to up
use<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.930> for<00:01:06.610> 24<00:01:07.610> hours<00:01:07.759> like<00:01:08.270> for<00:01:08.420> example<00:01:08.479> in

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
use it for 24 hours like for example in

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.500 
use it for 24 hours like for example in
the<00:01:09.350> evening<00:01:09.650> six<00:01:09.890> o'clock<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:11.030> will<00:01:11.240> switch

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
the evening six o'clock it will switch

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.109 
the evening six o'clock it will switch
on<00:01:11.659> with<00:01:11.810> full<00:01:12.020> intensity<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.700> I<00:01:13.820> would<00:01:13.939> learn

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
on with full intensity and I would learn

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.859 
on with full intensity and I would learn
a<00:01:14.180> clock<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:15.890> will<00:01:16.010> go<00:01:16.189> on<00:01:16.340> reducing<00:01:16.630> at<00:01:17.630> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
a clock it will go on reducing at the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.310 
a clock it will go on reducing at the
rate<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:17.990> 10%<00:01:18.320> intensity<00:01:19.189> down<00:01:20.090> till<00:01:20.420> 6

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
rate of 10% intensity down till 6

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.550 
rate of 10% intensity down till 6
o'clock<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.860> from<00:01:22.520> 6<00:01:22.729> o'clock<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.659> evening<00:01:24.110> 6

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
o'clock and from 6 o'clock to evening 6

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.070 
o'clock and from 6 o'clock to evening 6
o'clock<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:25.130> will<00:01:25.310> remain<00:01:25.580> off<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:26.900> is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
o'clock it will remain off so this is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.370 
o'clock it will remain off so this is
what<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.650> project<00:01:28.340> but<00:01:29.060> for<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.420> purpose

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
what is the project but for the purpose

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.630 
what is the project but for the purpose
of<00:01:31.630> seeing<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:32.869> we<00:01:33.290> have<00:01:33.470> reduced<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.100> time<00:01:34.310> to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
of seeing it we have reduced the time to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.420 
of seeing it we have reduced the time to
what<00:01:35.210> couple<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.600> seconds<00:01:36.020> instead<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.590> couple

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
what couple of seconds instead of couple

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.520 
what couple of seconds instead of couple
of<00:01:37.460> hours<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.900> you'll<00:01:39.020> see<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.290> function

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
of hours so you'll see this function

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.020 
of hours so you'll see this function
once<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.159> operate<00:01:40.579> this<00:01:41.650> we<00:01:42.650> find<00:01:42.829> this<00:01:43.130> LED<00:01:43.850> is

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
once we operate this we find this LED is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.030 
once we operate this we find this LED is
now<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.450> full<00:01:44.689> intensity<00:01:45.170> flowing<00:01:45.710> at<00:01:45.829> full

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
now with full intensity flowing at full

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.819 
now with full intensity flowing at full
intensity<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:48.020> see<00:01:48.200> progressively

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
intensity and you can see progressively

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.179 
intensity and you can see progressively
the<00:01:49.100> intensity<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.759> falling<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.189> everyone

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
the intensity is falling and everyone

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.700 
the intensity is falling and everyone

and<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.399> evening<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:01.850> will<00:02:01.969> switch<00:02:02.149> on

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
and in the evening it will switch on

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.170 
and in the evening it will switch on
again<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:02.570> example<00:02:03.200> now<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.070> is<00:02:04.280> going<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.060> be

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
again for example now it is going to be

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.749 
again for example now it is going to be
morning<00:02:05.689> or<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:05.930> morning<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.439> is<00:02:06.560> off<00:02:06.759> now
