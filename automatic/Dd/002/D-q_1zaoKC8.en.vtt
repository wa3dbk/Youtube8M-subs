again I got new skates this year on
these<00:00:13.620> are<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.240> power<00:00:15.240> X<00:00:16.190> velocity<00:00:18.080> they're

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
these are the power X velocity they're

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
these are the power X velocity they're
kind<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:20.369> between<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.240> power<00:00:22.170> x<00:00:22.740> 40<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> 50

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
kind of in between the power x 40 and 50

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.099 
kind of in between the power x 40 and 50
there<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.600> different<00:00:25.380> features<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.730> i

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
there are some different features but i

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.620 
there are some different features but i
really<00:00:28.109> recommend<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.710> skate<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.510> used<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
really recommend this skate I used to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.650 
really recommend this skate I used to
have<00:00:30.900> used<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.529> power<00:00:32.130> 12<00:00:32.669> these<00:00:33.090> are<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
have used a power 12 these are kind of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.100 
have used a power 12 these are kind of
like<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:35.450> crappy<00:00:36.450> skate<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.020> know

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
like the really crappy skate you know

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.040 
like the really crappy skate you know
nothing<00:00:37.590> special<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:39.210> baseline<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
nothing special just really baseline and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.130 
nothing special just really baseline and
then<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.290> picked<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:41.070> these<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:42.050> three<00:00:43.050> hundred

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
then I picked up these for three hundred

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
then I picked up these for three hundred
dollars<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.489> I'll<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:45.149> over<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> couple

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
dollars so I'll just go over a couple

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.049 
dollars so I'll just go over a couple
things<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:47.039> outside<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.879> see

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
things here on the outside you can see

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.110 
things here on the outside you can see
they<00:00:48.239> still<00:00:48.480> got<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> X<00:00:49.350> rib<00:00:49.860> pattern<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.820> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
they still got the X rib pattern all in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200 
they still got the X rib pattern all in
here<00:00:51.440> that's<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.890> better<00:00:53.219> stride

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
here that's just for better stride

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.080 
here that's just for better stride
rigidity<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.739> snaps<00:00:56.219> back<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
rigidity you know it snaps back for a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.349 
rigidity you know it snaps back for a
better<00:00:57.420> energy<00:00:57.690> transferred<00:00:59.059> as<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> gotta

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
better energy transferred as you gotta

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.050 
better energy transferred as you gotta
see<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.230> says<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:04.379> can't<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
see on here it says you can't see that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
see on here it says you can't see that
don't<00:01:06.060> thinking<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.510> oh<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.680> red

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
don't thinking is oh that little red

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.060 
don't thinking is oh that little red
line<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.869> hydrophobic<00:01:10.619> liner

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
line there just as a hydrophobic liner

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.840 
line there just as a hydrophobic liner
it's<00:01:12.030> unlike<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.010> man-made<00:01:14.010> material<00:01:14.610> liner

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's unlike the man-made material liner

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.230 
it's unlike the man-made material liner
this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> cloth<00:01:16.439> liner<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.850> doesn't<00:01:18.150> make

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
this is the cloth liner it doesn't make

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.580 
this is the cloth liner it doesn't make
too<00:01:18.509> much<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.930> difference<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.470> you're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
too much of a difference if you're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.580 
too much of a difference if you're
wearing<00:01:19.770> socks<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.350> thing

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
wearing socks so that that's one thing

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
wearing socks so that that's one thing
that<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:24.299> good

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that I really like is a really good

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.679 
that I really like is a really good
moisture<00:01:24.990> management<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:27.420> here

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
moisture management you go down here

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.670 
moisture management you go down here
this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.140> what<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.159> about<00:01:29.189> Bauer<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.830 
guys light speed too I really like the
state<00:01:34.170> runner<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:35.400> energy<00:01:36.000> transfer<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
state runner just energy transfer and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.530 
state runner just energy transfer and
then<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.680> way<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> feels<00:01:38.310> feels<00:01:39.119> better

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

allium<00:01:55.590> footbed<00:01:56.159> over<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.299> whole

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
allium footbed over here this whole

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.620 
allium footbed over here this whole
thing<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.159> has<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.399> bauer<00:02:00.030> logo

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
thing and then it has this bauer logo

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.039 
thing and then it has this bauer logo
over<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.979> see<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:04.020> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
over here which you can see so what that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.660 
over here which you can see so what that
gives<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> better<00:02:05.790> energy<00:02:06.060> transfer

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
gives you is a better energy transfer

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.699 
gives you is a better energy transfer
and<00:02:07.759> then<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:09.229> also<00:02:10.030> creates<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.150> stiffer<00:02:12.140> foot

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
and then it also creates a stiffer foot

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.490 
and then it also creates a stiffer foot
died<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.310> think<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.340> feels<00:02:16.700> more<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.540> you

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
died I think so it feels more on you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.650 
died I think so it feels more on you
feel<00:02:18.770> more<00:02:19.069> on<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.400> ice<00:02:19.580> i<00:02:19.760> guess<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.180> kill

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
feel more on the ice i guess like kill

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.820 
feel more on the ice i guess like kill
the<00:02:20.810> ice<00:02:21.489> but<00:02:22.720> no<00:02:23.720> one<00:02:23.840> likes<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:26.830> scooter

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the ice but no one likes that scooter

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.750 
the ice but no one likes that scooter

like the older nike bauer just had like
foam<00:03:07.190> inside<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.120> kind<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.510> hurts<00:03:08.720> when

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
foam inside and it kind of hurts when

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.770 
foam inside and it kind of hurts when
you<00:03:08.989> get<00:03:09.170> hit<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:10.400> same<00:03:10.610> toe<00:03:10.910> cap<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.450> speed

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
you get hit the same toe cap the speed

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.099 
you get hit the same toe cap the speed
rapto<00:03:12.290> captures<00:03:12.859> more<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.870> anatomical<00:03:14.870> fit

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
rapto captures more of a anatomical fit

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.280 
rapto captures more of a anatomical fit
around<00:03:15.620> your<00:03:15.829> toes<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.880> shape<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.450> them<00:03:17.630> it

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
around your toes the shape of them it

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.289 
around your toes the shape of them it
just<00:03:18.560> gives<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.220> little<00:03:19.430> bit<00:03:19.609> more<00:03:19.820> snap

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
just gives you a little bit more snap

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.319 
just gives you a little bit more snap
when<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.890> when<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:21.920> blast<00:03:22.850> off<00:03:23.150> accelerate

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
when you when you blast off accelerate

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.240 
when you when you blast off accelerate
yeah<00:03:26.329> that's<00:03:26.570> pretty<00:03:26.840> much<00:03:26.989> about<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.650> like

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
yeah that's pretty much about it I like

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.890 
yeah that's pretty much about it I like
the<00:03:30.519> support<00:03:31.519> bar<00:03:31.730> at<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:31.880> back<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:32.810> a

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
the support bar at the back it's a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.410 
the support bar at the back it's a
really<00:03:33.290> nice<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.769> stiff<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:35.269> that's

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
really nice and stiff I think that's

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.550 
really nice and stiff I think that's
really<00:03:35.660> good<00:03:35.840> because<00:03:35.870> when<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.260> stride

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
really good because when you stride

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.370 
really good because when you stride
forward<00:03:36.859> that's<00:03:37.549> going<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.820> go<00:03:38.570> back<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:38.810> push

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
forward that's going to go back and push

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.319 
forward that's going to go back and push
you<00:03:39.530> forward<00:03:39.799> so<00:03:40.489> that's<00:03:40.790> going<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.060> give<00:03:41.209> you

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
you forward so that's going to give you

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.140 
you forward so that's going to give you
more<00:03:41.630> energy<00:03:41.660> transfer<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.859> your<00:03:42.980> feet<00:03:43.220> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
more energy transfer to your feet the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.900 
more energy transfer to your feet the
boots<00:03:44.420> really<00:03:44.840> stiff<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.519> has<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.670> really

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
boots really stiff and it has a really

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.720 
boots really stiff and it has a really
good<00:03:47.180> feel<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.690> unlike<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.859> bower<00:03:49.280> i<00:03:49.430> think

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
good feel to it unlike the bower i think

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.390 
good feel to it unlike the bower i think
the<00:03:49.940> nike<00:03:50.480> bauer<00:03:50.680> Becky<00:03:51.680> Bowers<00:03:51.829> are<00:03:52.160> actually

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400
