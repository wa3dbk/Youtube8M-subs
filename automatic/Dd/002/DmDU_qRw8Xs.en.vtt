00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
know I can't say for sure but what I can

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.030 
know I can't say for sure but what I can
say<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.450> they<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.930> weapon<00:02:31.290> DLC<00:02:31.680> in

this downloadable content pack and that

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.220 
this downloadable content pack and that
is<00:02:34.380> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.709> an<00:02:34.890> SMG<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:36.090> peacemaker<00:02:36.690> SMG

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
is going to be an SMG the peacemaker SMG

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.560 
is going to be an SMG the peacemaker SMG
now<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.830> SMG<00:02:38.430> picture<00:02:38.850> does<00:02:39.060> appear<00:02:39.360> right

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
now the SMG picture does appear right

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.300 
now the SMG picture does appear right
below<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.200> zombies<00:02:40.620> pictures<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.070> some

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
below the zombies pictures so some

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
below the zombies pictures so some
people<00:02:41.580> are<00:02:41.850> speculating<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.660> perhaps<00:02:42.780> it's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
people are speculating that perhaps it's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
people are speculating that perhaps it's
only<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.800> zombies<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:44.940> doesn't<00:02:45.239> make

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
only in zombies but that doesn't make

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.600 
only in zombies but that doesn't make
much<00:02:45.480> sense<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.840> me<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.050> believe<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> SMG

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
much sense to me I believe that the SMG

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.610 
much sense to me I believe that the SMG
will<00:02:48.090> be<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.270> multiplayer<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.170> believe<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.590> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
will be a multiplayer I believe but I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.540 
will be a multiplayer I believe but I
could<00:02:49.860> be<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:49.980> hundred<00:02:50.070> percent<00:02:50.250> wrong

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
could be a hundred percent wrong

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.490 
could be a hundred percent wrong
