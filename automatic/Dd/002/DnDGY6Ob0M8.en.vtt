00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.179
 so i'm driving now no i pascal 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.710
 bronislaw without sleep is here where 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.630
 I had hired him once 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.769
 here the danger and two 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.310
 everything else had gotten in the distance 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.519
 run the time with me learned to catch 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.450
 also with 08 on as well as the two and is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.489
 now at 25 and now earns proud 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.090
 3300 per day as I said at some 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.950
 I read 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.120
 up to 7000 which of course we do not 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:55.410
 bad but otherwise a garage in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:58.460
 Buy Glasgow garages and earn 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.460
 through your money 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.860
 I 'll put it in your place at the beginning 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:15.020
 if you already have your own truck 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.780
 got into an extra workshop 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.030
 invest 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.940
 Of course you can order so long 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.940
 drive as you want until you have the necessary 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.159
 Have change and then the garage 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.159
 including truck and driver to buy 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.990
 and then pays what I here 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.200
 I now have nine drivers 10 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 Overall , we are earning a good one 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.380
 total 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 and that's why I can do it now 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.420
 Of course, such a blow 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.469
 at the beginning a daf bought the 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:59.819
 cheapest I have without synonymous without 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.819
 any extras 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:10.479
 For now, everyone has to go through third 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.479
 Great it was not 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.129
 So I do not know such 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.129
 exits 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:29.730
 they are always two lanes at least and 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.360
 as the colleague in front of me do that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.360
 it also drives the other trucks 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.990
 more or less in their in their own 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.990
 circle 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.219
 otherwise I have to see new here 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.090
 I have that the cars on highways 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.090
 overtake 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.530
 I did not think that was bad either 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.260
 I can not do that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:19.959
 so we are now in the sea ​​city 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:19.959
 Luxembourg arrived immediately 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.880
 before I ask to the left I drive 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.319
 first to the right around me 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.319
 to look at the question mark 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.330
 although one
