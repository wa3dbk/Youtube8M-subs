my opinion you know the groups were a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.900 
my opinion you know the groups were a
little<00:00:35.390> they<00:00:36.390> weren't<00:00:36.840> exactly<00:00:37.079> even<00:00:37.910> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
little they weren't exactly even the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.959 
little they weren't exactly even the
second<00:00:39.390> group<00:00:39.570> Kiwi<00:00:40.290> cocky<00:00:40.710> qxe<00:00:41.280> Phoenix<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
silver was a little stronger than my

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.770 
silver was a little stronger than my
card<00:00:43.559> Ruby<00:00:43.980> Huck<00:00:44.219> myself<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> murder<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.719> do

you<00:00:45.870> think<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.230> groups<00:00:46.469> were<00:00:46.800> they

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you think about the groups were they

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
you think about the groups were they
even<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.789> maybe<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.840> had<00:00:48.930> swapped<00:00:49.200> one

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
even I think maybe if we had swapped one

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.630 
even I think maybe if we had swapped one
person<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.190> made<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> little

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
person that would have made it a little

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
person that would have made it a little
better<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.590> sure

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
better but I'm not I'm not really sure

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
better but I'm not I'm not really sure
there<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> good<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> fix<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.480> kind

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
there was a good way to fix it just kind

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.760 
there was a good way to fix it just kind
of<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> groups<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> have
