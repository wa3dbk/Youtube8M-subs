technique long term I've got a few basic
tips<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.140> main<00:01:13.289> one<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.009> as<00:01:14.520> long<00:01:14.670> as

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
tips the main one really is as long as

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.130 
tips the main one really is as long as
you<00:01:14.910> can<00:01:15.090> create<00:01:15.330> movement<00:01:15.750> naturally

running<00:01:16.410> can<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.649> easy<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.190> if<00:01:17.250> running<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.550> too

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
running can be easy so if running is too

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
running can be easy so if running is too
hard<00:01:17.940> at<00:01:18.179> this<00:01:18.300> point<00:01:18.539> in<00:01:18.660> time<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.350> probably

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
hard at this point in time it's probably

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.719 
hard at this point in time it's probably
some<00:01:19.740> change<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.069> can<00:01:20.280> make<00:01:20.399> to<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
some change you can make to make it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.400 
some change you can make to make it
easier<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> other<00:01:21.149> ones<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.259> just

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
easier the other ones as well it's just

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.570 
easier the other ones as well it's just
make<00:01:22.560> sure<00:01:22.709> that<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:23.009> you're<00:01:23.160> running<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
make sure that when you're running that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
make sure that when you're running that
you<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.149> relaxed<00:01:24.539> as<00:01:24.630> possible<00:01:24.660> because

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you just relaxed as possible because

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
you just relaxed as possible because
most<00:01:25.679> people<00:01:25.950> make<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.130> biggest<00:01:26.490> area<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
most people make the biggest area of

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.100 
most people make the biggest area of
tensing<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.660> getting<00:01:27.899> tired

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
tensing up and getting tired

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.139 
tensing up and getting tired
straightaway<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:29.190> say<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> main<00:01:29.940> one<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
straightaway I would say the main one is

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.150 
straightaway I would say the main one is
was<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.660> remember<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> ring<00:01:31.649> doesn't<00:01:31.830> have<00:01:32.039> to

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
was to remember it ring doesn't have to

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.219 
was to remember it ring doesn't have to
cause<00:01:32.369> injury<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.509> long<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.990> can

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
cause injury so as long as you can

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.660 
cause injury so as long as you can
understand<00:01:34.679> maybe<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.399> things<00:01:35.429> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
understand maybe some of the things that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.100 
understand maybe some of the things that
could<00:01:35.819> be<00:01:35.880> causing<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.420> onset<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.750> injuries

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
could be causing the onset of injuries

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.900 
could be causing the onset of injuries
it's<00:01:37.590> easy<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.099> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.250> proactive<00:01:38.459> and

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
it's easy for you to be proactive and

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.240 
it's easy for you to be proactive and
then<00:01:39.270> stop<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:39.720> most<00:01:40.020> importantly<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.979> enjoy

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
then stop it most importantly just enjoy

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.089 
then stop it most importantly just enjoy
your<00:01:41.429> running<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.940> yeah<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.080> keep<00:01:43.679> enjoying

being<00:01:54.600> aware<00:01:54.690> about<00:01:55.050> our<00:01:55.350> glad<00:01:55.770> wrap<00:01:55.950> around

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
being aware about our glad wrap around

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.210 
being aware about our glad wrap around
our<00:01:56.310> tissue<00:01:56.550> our<00:01:57.000> our<00:01:57.240> our<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.930> points<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
our tissue our our our to the points and

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.660 
our tissue our our our to the points and
then<00:01:59.850> knowing<00:02:00.450> how<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.870> fight<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.160> doing

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
then knowing how to fight that so doing

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.610 
then knowing how to fight that so doing
that<00:02:02.790> firstly<00:02:03.300> from<00:02:03.540> an<00:02:03.780> injury<00:02:04.260> prevention

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
that firstly from an injury prevention

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.280 
that firstly from an injury prevention
perspective<00:02:05.400> so<00:02:05.790> you're<00:02:05.970> keeping<00:02:06.180> needles<00:02:07.020> at

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
perspective so you're keeping needles at

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
perspective so you're keeping needles at
bay<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.850> good<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
bay and then as you get good at that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.300 
bay and then as you get good at that
actually<00:02:09.810> using<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.530> optimize<00:02:10.650> your

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
actually using that to optimize your

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.820 
actually using that to optimize your
technique<00:02:11.880> as<00:02:12.090> well<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.570> then<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:12.990> guess<00:02:13.320> it's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
technique as well and then I guess it's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
technique as well and then I guess it's
using<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.580> those<00:02:14.700> things<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.180> put<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.480> all

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
using all of those things to put it all

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.260 
using all of those things to put it all
together<00:02:15.810> because<00:02:16.350> core<00:02:16.890> strength<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.610> going

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
together because core strength is going

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.450 
together because core strength is going
to<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.080> important<00:02:19.680> as<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:20.100> muscle

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
to be just as important as your muscle

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.190 
to be just as important as your muscle
release<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.330> be<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.660> important

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
release it's going to be just important

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.930 
release it's going to be just important
as<00:02:22.290> your<00:02:22.770> technique<00:02:23.160> they're<00:02:23.370> actually<00:02:23.700> all

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
as your technique they're actually all

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.540 
as your technique they're actually all
just<00:02:24.600> completely<00:02:25.140> interlinked<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.340> as

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
just completely interlinked so as

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.400 
just completely interlinked so as
runners<00:02:27.120> we've<00:02:27.300> got<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.600> start<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.990> think<00:02:28.020> of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
runners we've got to start to think of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.370 
runners we've got to start to think of
it's<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.150> running<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:30.990> thinking

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
it's not just running it's it's thinking

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.260 
it's not just running it's it's thinking
about<00:02:31.470> those<00:02:31.830> three<00:02:32.130> components<00:02:32.340> at<00:02:32.820> at<00:02:33.120> all

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
about those three components at at all

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.570 
about those three components at at all
times<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.080> that's<00:02:34.200> where<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:35.010> achievements

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
times and that's where your achievements

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.880 
times and that's where your achievements
are<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.850> come<00:02:36.030> your<00:02:36.420> PBS<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.740> that's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
are going to come your PBS and that's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.800 
are going to come your PBS and that's
where<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> be<00:02:38.340> running<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.820> 95<00:02:39.420> 90

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
where you going to be running the 95 90

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.690 
where you going to be running the 95 90
