00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:10.999
 Hello everyone, Dmitry, and today we are 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.980
 let's talk about the diameter of the piston diameter 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:17.750
 pistons on a four-stroke engine 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.210
 it could be the 139 engine 152 157 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.710
 we are talking about four engine ports 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.289
 very often they call me to either when 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.890
 buys from us a piston or a piston 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.740
 or 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.270
 Well , somewhere bought and now I do not know what 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.789
 him to do such questions here 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.370
 whether a claim that is, here I bought 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:44.000
 the piston you have there or somewhere else 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.390
 place and here it is to me some kind of curve i 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.140
 I ask what the curve is so out alone 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.050
 give me a reason 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.190
 here it is on top of me very dangles well 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:02.480
 Here if you take here it is on top hanging out 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.799
 and the bottom flow here so he sits 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.700
 ok so i measure it and that's not there 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.740
 I roll it measured down 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.150
 50 millimeters of how that's written as 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.509
 on top of it for some reason forty nine with 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.220
 half here it does not mean defective 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.979
 Do you pitch me this here I am somewhere 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.780
 bought now want to buy from you but the thing is 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.470
 tom that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.890
 what porsche should he have here 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.930
 in diameter, the difference is due to the fact 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.909
 what's on a four-stroke engine when 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.640
 clean fuel is used 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.259
 the fuel is connected firstly with 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.719
 the process of burning different fuels 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.640
 diameters and with the cooling process 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.890
 piston 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.380
 then the first moment is like me 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.890
 spoke gasoline products on the engine 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.710
 gasoline mixed with oil has dry 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.909
 carter as they say here and so 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.090
 cooling 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.789
 went going evenly or heating goes 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.010
 evenly, that is, as on top there 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.950
 bottom top of course a little stronger 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.940
 heats up than the bottom but it is not 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.460
 well cooled below 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.470
 so the piston diameter is push pull 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.580
 engines 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.620
 ok what's on top 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.630
 same there is there is a difference she is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.780
 there 1 2 weave not even imperceptible to 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.700
 non-professional discreetly calipers 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.140
 four stroke engine firstly 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.000
 promotion time or 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.380
 and massaging of fuel that is 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.320
 passing it through the carburetor through 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.020
 the fuel diffuser does not mix with oil 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.410
 so its combustion temperature is higher 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.200
 this is secondarily the fuel in the cylinder 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.870
 the four-stroke center burns longer it's 2 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.880
 because if we take 2 cylinder cards 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.290
 we remember that he has us full of holes in the middle 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.500
 then when the piston came to the dead center 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.500
 flash and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.280
 there is a lowering of the pistons only duties 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.790
 sank down there by 24 millimeters like 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.730
 the rule is to open the outlet window and all 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.880
 gases fly away and filled with fresh 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.340
 a mixture which also cools the piston 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.050
 therefore the piston maintains an equal diameter 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.209
 what's below what's top four-stroke 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.130
 engine when and keep her fuel 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.620
 burned by the flash goes 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.120
 lowering then the mixture burned went 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.310
 the mixture goes down the piston burns 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.830
 goes down here we have no he doesn't 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.250
 blowing windows nothing i have time 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.030
 burning the mixture goes much longer 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.970
 so the temperature and the temperature itself 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.650
 the gases themselves and the temperature of the cylinder 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.910
 piston head temperature 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.760
 much higher and the gases only go to 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.620
 second tact namely why sharpen on 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.320
 the fourth stroke when the piston back 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.410
 goes down goes up and goes up 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.970
 opens the exhaust valve therefore 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.330
 piston head for 4 engine there always 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.180
 has a temperature difference and with a skirt like 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.810
 at least 100 degrees and maybe even 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.959
 and at the time of 150 flash 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.160
 so he needs such a difference 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.850
 in diameters 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.300
 so that the top diameter is smaller and the bottom 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.240
 diameter was 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.789
 standard thermal gap because 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.860
 Pistons made all arable 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.960
 make of aluminum which go 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.780
 on scooters 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.340
 thats or less has linear 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.009
 extension i mean it is the same 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.870
 expanding but not in all places 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:52.090
 all places it has the same temperature 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:56.099
 that is why their top is less than 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.210
 down so if you bought a piston 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:09.580
 stuck her top hat or bought 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:11.979
 piston is not a video is such a thing 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.759
 normal when heated 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:19.389
 this gap will go away yes will normally decrease 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:23.379
 and you have a piston and jam and not no 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.319
 will pull the strip when overheated 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.719
 cylinder that's basically all i 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.030
 I wanted to tell you about the difference 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.810
 the diameter of the bottom and the diameter of the skirt 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.370
 four stroke scooter 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.729
 any of any volume that is the beginning here 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.300
 50s there endlessly tower always 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.380
 go with a narrowed narrowed the bottom in order 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.289
 To compensate 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.500
 temperature difference between the bottom and the skirt 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.840
 vs said earlier 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.219
 now you know it now you will 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.779
 less nervous when you get what 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:03.900
 what they expected not to know about
