alright man this plastic bum ski is a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.200 
alright man this plastic bum ski is a
really<00:00:28.680> cool<00:00:28.830> stock<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.699> those<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> who

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
really cool stock for those of you who

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.020 
really cool stock for those of you who
don't<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> bump<00:00:31.320> fire<00:00:31.529> stock

that's<00:00:33.030> how<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.300> achieving<00:00:33.420> such<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> fast

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that's how I'm achieving such a fast

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.830 
that's how I'm achieving such a fast
rate<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> fire<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.910> stock<00:00:36.149> moves<00:00:36.420> back<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
rate of fire the stock moves back and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740 
rate of fire the stock moves back and
forth<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.700> it's<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:39.149> basically<00:00:39.450> achieve

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
forth and it's you basically achieve

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.400 
forth and it's you basically achieve
bump<00:00:40.050> firing<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.790> aim<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> gun

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
bump firing in that you can aim the gun

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
bump firing in that you can aim the gun
