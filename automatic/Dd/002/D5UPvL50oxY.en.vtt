recovers<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.540> conventional<00:01:41.050> alley<00:01:41.260> spacing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
recovers the conventional alley spacing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.450 
recovers the conventional alley spacing

what happened to the plant that almost

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.290 
what happened to the plant that almost
disappeared<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:48.280> was<00:01:48.460> transformed<00:01:49.120> into

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
disappeared it was transformed into

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.590 
disappeared it was transformed into
cover<00:01:49.660> crop

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.300 

it<00:01:56.600> also<00:01:56.750> makes<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.320> soil<00:01:57.590> temperature<00:01:58.100> lower

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
it also makes the soil temperature lower

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.490 
it also makes the soil temperature lower
around<00:01:58.700> 10<00:01:59.180> degrees<00:01:59.510> Celsius<00:01:59.780> last<00:02:00.260> an

around 10 degrees Celsius last an
uncovered<00:02:00.890> soil

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.280 

therefore<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.150> cover<00:02:05.390> crop<00:02:05.720> reduces

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
therefore the cover crop reduces

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.930 
therefore the cover crop reduces
temperature<00:02:06.800> variation<00:02:07.430> at<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.670> soil

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.150 
temperature variation at the soil
surface<00:02:08.180> which<00:02:09.080> results<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.710> healthier

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160

after some weeks this mulching starts a

after some weeks this mulching starts a

decomposing process and slowly becomes

decomposing process and slowly becomes
