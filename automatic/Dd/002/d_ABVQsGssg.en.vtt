00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
environment for them to do that was

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.329 
environment for them to do that was
really<00:00:50.540> important<00:00:51.110> in<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.890> development<00:00:52.010> of

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
really important in the development of

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.369 
really important in the development of
being<00:00:52.519> writer<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:52.940> use<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.989> other<00:00:54.140> goal

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
being writer I use this the other goal

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.229 
being writer I use this the other goal
of<00:00:54.530> being<00:00:54.710> writer<00:00:54.979> is<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.519> develop<00:00:55.879> students

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
of being writer is to develop students

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.880 
of being writer is to develop students
social<00:00:56.479> skills<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.290> we<00:00:57.409> think<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:57.829> is

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
social skills and we think this is

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.710 
social skills and we think this is
inextricably<00:00:58.339> linked<00:00:58.970> and<00:00:59.059> very<00:00:59.300> important

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
inextricably linked and very important

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.079 
inextricably linked and very important
part<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.079> being<00:01:00.559> rare<00:01:00.800> okay

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
part of being rare okay

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.359 
part of being rare okay
writing<00:01:03.050> is<00:01:03.140> such<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.320> personal<00:01:03.769> act<00:01:04.009> there

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
writing is such a personal act there

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.060 
writing is such a personal act there
learning<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:05.119> lot<00:01:05.750> about<00:01:05.810> each<00:01:06.200> other<00:01:06.410> as<00:01:06.679> they

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
learning a lot about each other as they

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.919 
learning a lot about each other as they
read<00:01:07.340> each<00:01:07.369> other's<00:01:07.729> writing<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.539> we<00:01:08.660> need<00:01:08.810> to

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
read each other's writing and we need to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.200 
read each other's writing and we need to
develop<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.440> level<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.950> trust<00:01:10.250> for<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.700> kind

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
develop a level of trust for that kind

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.600 
develop a level of trust for that kind
of<00:01:11.300> conferring<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.929> happen<00:01:12.289> in<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.100> classroom

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
of conferring to happen in the classroom

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.639 
of conferring to happen in the classroom
so<00:01:14.240> towards<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.780> end<00:01:14.929> we're<00:01:15.140> teaching<00:01:15.350> very

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
so towards that end we're teaching very

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.499 
so towards that end we're teaching very
specific<00:01:16.130> skills<00:01:16.399> simple<00:01:17.090> things<00:01:17.270> like

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
specific skills simple things like

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.840 
specific skills simple things like
listening<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.170> one<00:01:18.440> another<00:01:18.700> giving<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
listening to one another giving and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.600 
listening to one another giving and
receiving<00:01:19.880> feedback<00:01:20.860> confirming<00:01:21.860> ideas<00:01:22.310> that

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
receiving feedback confirming ideas that

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.120 
receiving feedback confirming ideas that
they<00:01:22.729> understood<00:01:23.179> what<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.420> other<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.780> saying

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
they understood what the other is saying

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.620 
they understood what the other is saying
justifying<00:01:25.130> their<00:01:25.310> opinions<00:01:25.729> all<00:01:26.450> these

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
justifying their opinions all these

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.389 
justifying their opinions all these
things<00:01:26.899> built<00:01:27.200> on<00:01:27.530> each<00:01:27.710> other<00:01:28.009> really

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
things built on each other really

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.100 
things built on each other really
changed<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.850> environment<00:01:28.970> in<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.630> community

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
changed the environment in the community

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.899 
changed the environment in the community
for<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.679> quality<00:01:31.069> of<00:01:31.100> writing<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.550> take<00:01:31.729> place

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
for the quality of writing to take place

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.580 
for the quality of writing to take place
I<00:01:32.090> have<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.210> question<00:01:32.569> for<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.929> what<00:01:33.229> did<00:01:33.380> your

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
I have a question for you what did your

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.660 
I have a question for you what did your
partner<00:01:34.039> do<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:35.210> show<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:36.110> that<00:01:36.520> he<00:01:37.520> was

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
partner do to show you that that he was

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.050 
partner do to show you that that he was
listening<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.570> he<00:01:41.200> didn't<00:01:42.200> turn<00:01:42.790> in<00:01:43.790> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
listening to you he didn't turn in the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.230 
listening to you he didn't turn in the
classrooms<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:44.869> have<00:01:45.259> visited<00:01:45.439> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
classrooms that I have visited and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.389 
classrooms that I have visited and
collaboratively<00:01:47.240> taught<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:48.070> with<00:01:49.070> some<00:01:49.280> of

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
collaboratively taught in with some of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.920 
collaboratively taught in with some of
the<00:01:49.490> teachers<00:01:49.640> implementing<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:50.689> in<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
the teachers implementing and in the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.649 
the teachers implementing and in the
writing<00:01:51.229> samples<00:01:51.649> which<00:01:51.799> I've<00:01:52.009> seen<00:01:52.659> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
writing samples which I've seen the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.230 
writing samples which I've seen the
thing<00:01:53.869> which<00:01:54.079> strikes<00:01:54.469> me<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.460> students

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
thing which strikes me is that students

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.490 
thing which strikes me is that students
are<00:01:56.469> developing<00:01:57.469> their<00:01:58.009> own<00:01:58.040> voice<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.500> also

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
are developing their own voice and also

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.130 
are developing their own voice and also
that<00:02:00.829> students<00:02:01.520> see<00:02:02.329> themselves<00:02:02.600> as

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
that students see themselves as

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.550 
that students see themselves as
competent<00:02:03.829> writers<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.049> students<00:02:06.049> who

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
competent writers and students who

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.460 
competent writers and students who
perhaps<00:02:07.549> have<00:02:08.090> not<00:02:08.299> seen<00:02:08.660> themselves<00:02:08.869> in<00:02:09.350> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
perhaps have not seen themselves in the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.710 
perhaps have not seen themselves in the
