00:01:15.702 --> 00:01:16.664
 We came to this match very timorously 

00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:17.056
 the ball fell out of our hands 

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.064
 nothing came out. We had some assumptions there 

00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:21.279
 but we did not do anything 

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:23.177
 it's hard for me to say anything hot now 

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:27.586
 through our stupid, simple errors practically in the 15th minute 

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:28.917
 the match has already ended for us 

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:30.246
 match for sure to analyze 

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:35.363
 at home we will try to threaten the team in Kielce 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.070
 I also think that there is defense and a longer attack game and, above all, fewer mistakes 

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:45.470
 I think that it decided about the result in this match 

00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:47.780
 today practically everything has run out and in attack and defense 

00:01:47.784 --> 00:01:53.440
 Kielce brought fast counterattacks and our goalkeepers had a shooting range 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.920
 because the number of throws was amazing in today's match 

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:03.780
 it will be tough but we can create a more even show on your hall 

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:11.680
 it was not a difficult match, but because we did a good job in defense 

00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:16.220
 and it may have seemed easy - but there were some difficulties 

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:25.660
 good fight with Kwidzyn, but we have a great form. It was a really good meeting 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.190
 after 15 minutes the match was already put together 

00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:37.790
 then we continued the good game and deserved to win 

00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:53.340
 Of course I'm very happy. Thank you to the players for concentration in the game for 60 minutes 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.260
 I had no such difficulty because I had a free Sunday 

00:02:57.255 --> 00:03:01.390
 today we have rotated all of these forces 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.400
 everyone plays more or less equally, so nobody has the right to be very tired 

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:11.190
 we know how it is after the match, tomorrow we know - we run, possibly massages 

00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:13.590
 and everyone will be regenerated already 

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:18.530
 an extremely difficult meeting. As we know, Vive dominates the Polish top league 

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:28.440
 we came here to fight, because Kwidzyn has that he never lets go of the game even if we are in a lost position 

00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:31.010
 difficult. Failed to. The result is what it is. 

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:33.670
 today, we were able to afford it 

00:03:33.773 --> 00:03:35.270
 for more we did not make it 

00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:40.240
 more than a month ago I was injured in a league match against Piotrkowianin 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.480
 I broke my metacarpal bone in my left hand 

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:47.150
 now I am undergoing a rehabilitation process, the bone is slowly growing 

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:50.790
 in about two weeks, maybe I will start normal workouts
