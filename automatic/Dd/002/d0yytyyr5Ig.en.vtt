00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
and because of this it tends to have

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.809 
and because of this it tends to have

the<00:02:10.330> first<00:02:10.509> thing<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.720> I'm<00:02:10.869> going<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.080> cover

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
the first thing that I'm going to cover

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.199

is that in order to do most of the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.520 
is that in order to do most of the
tricks<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.540> I'm<00:02:13.690> going<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.080> displaying

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
tricks that I'm going to be displaying

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.559 
tricks that I'm going to be displaying
here<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:15.520> need<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.940> clear<00:02:16.300> file

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
here you will need to have a clear file

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.920 
here you will need to have a clear file
in<00:02:17.050> order<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.160> get<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> clear<00:02:18.640> file<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.780> will

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
in order to get a clear file you will

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.110 
in order to get a clear file you will
need<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.380> defeat<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.250> first<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.730> second

I<00:02:24.700> will<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.120> trying<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.390> do<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.600> tutorial<00:02:25.840> that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
I will be trying to do a tutorial that

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.350 
I will be trying to do a tutorial that
will<00:02:26.739> assist<00:02:27.280> people<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.910> getting<00:02:28.180> their

first<00:02:28.540> clear<00:02:28.870> file<00:02:29.110> but<00:02:30.069> for<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:30.340> I'll<00:02:30.520> be

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
first clear file but for now I'll be

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.030 
first clear file but for now I'll be
focusing<00:02:31.300> on<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.989> anypercent<00:02:32.380> route<00:02:32.770> as<00:02:32.920> it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
focusing on the anypercent route as it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.220 
focusing on the anypercent route as it
is<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.090> order<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.390> do<00:02:34.600> most<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.019> tricks

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
is so in order to do most of the tricks

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.140 
is so in order to do most of the tricks
in<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.500> route<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.739> will<00:02:36.100> require<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.819> cleared

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
in this route you will require a cleared

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.660 
in this route you will require a cleared
file<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:38.500> will<00:02:38.709> give<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.950> access<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.550> the

you can start a new game now the naming
conventions<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.080> want<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.410> cover<00:03:45.620> here<00:03:45.800> in

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
conventions that I want to cover here in

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.920 
conventions that I want to cover here in
particular<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.580> if<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:47.209> press<00:03:47.600> Start

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
particular is if you just press Start

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.479 
particular is if you just press Start
it'll<00:03:48.140> just<00:03:48.170> assign<00:03:48.590> your<00:03:48.739> name<00:03:48.860> as<00:03:49.010> Alucard

it'll just assign your name as Alucard
so<00:03:50.060> there's<00:03:50.239> no<00:03:50.390> need<00:03:50.569> to<00:03:50.600> actually<00:03:50.840> input

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
so there's no need to actually input

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.210 
so there's no need to actually input
things<00:03:51.800> that<00:03:52.130> are<00:03:52.600> different<00:03:53.600> or<00:03:53.750> odd<00:03:54.069> pay<00:03:55.069> no

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
things that are different or odd pay no

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.100 
things that are different or odd pay no
attention<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:56.000> buttons<00:03:56.390> missing<00:03:56.599> letters

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
attention to the buttons missing letters

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.990 
attention to the buttons missing letters
that's<00:03:57.319> just<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.769> function<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.489> emulator<00:03:58.910> I

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
