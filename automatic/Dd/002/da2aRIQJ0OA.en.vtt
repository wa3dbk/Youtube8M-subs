00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.610
 the turnaround time with solaris 10 years it always starts with a bit of 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.009
 gymnastics fig 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.009
 you say 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.589
 braun 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.859
 jls 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.519
 then do not wait long to understand that this 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.659
 can change 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.449
 this time the choir decided to tackle the biggest stars 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.250
 international rocket 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.280
 we wrote that any future high school a match sheet of his men a 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 detainee who will surprise 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 there was something that I had hurt his opponents and 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.090
 registro 6% 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.640
 and not the reverse 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 this week I did it because we now have 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.120
 this year it's home 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.760
 three of his opponents 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.680
 expectations were everywhere in europe we're waiting to see if it's going to be 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 so destocked knows also on page 6 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.140
 a key 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.910
 facing the most original crisis 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.780
 besides, I think it happened 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 I did not know anything 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.120
 for an hour and a half that said this August 22 to revisit those of 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.180
 the work is the fourth since quite short 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.200
 ultimately 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.760
 lucasarts doubt the building site this letter 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.270
 maybe more daring 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.090
 more daring because I think the writing job that represented 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.020
 still not a year of work 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 it's very elaborate as well at the level of two skips 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.500
 yesterday we must know that we added a string quartet 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.350
 so it's quite the same that the string quartet was very 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.450
 important and then always remains obviously the three-voice writing 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.900
 sometimes obviously quite daring transpositions for example of two 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.760
 singers like robbie williams is glad that pauline sofia who are 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.460
 initially very mean that it was not written in terms of the voices of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.200
 women 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.889
 and so his quest for a very interesting transcription work 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.510
 advertising the best that the original the question is not there this tuesday 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.860
 entourage nicolas sony is not part of the seven minutes besnehard 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.840
 who seeks to be as faithful as possible to the artists of the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.089
 legend groups 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:15.109
 Nevertheless, the temptation will be great to compare the titles that will be 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.529
 played all the more complicated as it is the big standards its form 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:19.759
 current 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.599
 and that everyone knows everyone knows in everybody's going 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.729
 have the final versions in the ear and then he'll see what we have 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.269
 done so I think this sacred especially here is very interesting to discover 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.619
 surf rediscover debt of the great myths 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.779
 we are on another scale with the night 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.430
 other sounds of excellent musicians thirty-five girls who 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.429
 will happen with even passed in front of an audience conquered to the advanced 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.459
 it does not risk his style in action times it's harder 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.699
 first saturday night in malmedy 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.329
 before leaving on the roads to invite themselves into the public debate I am 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:53.739
 sad
