let's<00:05:30.910> power<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.300> up<00:05:31.450> and<00:05:31.660> run<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.780> mid<00:05:32.020> test

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.730 

we'll<00:05:40.970> just<00:05:41.150> check<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.420> make<00:05:41.540> sure<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:42.110> CPU

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
we'll just check to make sure the CPU

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.440 
we'll just check to make sure the CPU
and<00:05:42.920> memory<00:05:43.070> have<00:05:43.430> been<00:05:43.640> detected<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.300> are

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
and memory have been detected and are

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.720 
and memory have been detected and are
running<00:05:44.780> at<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:44.900> correct<00:05:45.290> speeds<00:05:45.730> otherwise

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
running at the correct speeds otherwise

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.210 
running at the correct speeds otherwise
that's<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.570> it's<00:05:47.840> that<00:05:48.050> easy<00:05:48.230> thanks<00:05:49.070> for

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
that's it it's that easy thanks for

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:57.670 
that's it it's that easy thanks for
watching

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.770 

you
