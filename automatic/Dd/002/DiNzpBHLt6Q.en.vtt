00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.400
 fat because of the two sofas filtered and 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:16.720
 we may be accident is worth what 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:21.130
 commented it has leaked from phase 2 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.140
 although it has not yet been confirmed by 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.369
 naughty dog ​​or because they are the same or that 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:31.300
 this may not be true but in the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:34.150
 news that there is what filtered nolan 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.770
 north one of the dubbing actors of 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:42.820
 uncharted 4 in a conference at the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.020
 meters with 2015 and also if you want 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.670
 see it the moment when in which what 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.059
 comment and all that you have below in the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.559
 description the link to link the video 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.320
 and the exact moment he says it 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.910
 because the competition lasts one hour a 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.000
 hour and ten minutes or something like that 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.010
 do on the hour and 66 or something like that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.030
 you will have it down in the description says 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.460
 textually by itself 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 or whatever the last thing I know is that 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.979
 naughty dog ​​is doing phase 2 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.549
 but my character has had a death 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.549
 early 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.950
 we do not know who who can be 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.369
 obviously it's not me because I'm not 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.720
 interpreted by this gentleman what agreement 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.750
 the actor right now who played 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.240
 but let's who is 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 nothing else I have not said anything else this is what 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 that has been leaked have not had no 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
 said nothing naughty dog ​​nor are they and why 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.910
 let's make a joke of this man go 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.890
 let's put the eye to you by saying 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.840
 this is a joke or maybe if the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.820
 have this 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.340
 are already developing from leaves two 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.579
 because he said it a very very way 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 Natural or is it another actor and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.170
 you can do it in a way that does not 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.200
 we create 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.030
 that has been wrong and that as 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 are developing the two be it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.330
 most normal in the world for him because he 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.460
 have already had to cast their hours of 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.320
 I work there 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.320
 we do not know and one thing 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.900
 of the last thing that is being done of the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.540
 pastures all this said to a question 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.580
 of those who were there to assume before the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.250
 doorman who did not get burned that the subway 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.350
 with only for reporters I do not have 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.620
 no idea but come on I think so 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.050
 and a question that was asked 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.380
 that would be an out and what he is doing 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.710
 right now or what will he do after 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.970
 uncharted 4 surely and answered this 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.730
 you do not know anything else I do not know if it's true 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.950
 what it says is worth 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.400
 what is true that says it now 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.260
 that is confirmed is not not 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.069
 I want to make it very clear it can be a 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.569
 rumor simply that this gentleman 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.569
 have told me or we are 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.420
 no no land rovers tours won 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.810
 let's spend a joke on these people 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.819
 it can be likewise if you know 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.459
 something else and I have already uploaded this video that 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.810
 it is very possible that I will put in the in the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.170
 fake title or joke or something so that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.720
 know that the new ones who watch the video 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.520
 or those that no longer 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.110
 they have seen it but want to know if it is 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.000
 correct or not instead of making another point 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.360
 live on plan, yes they have confirmed 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.060
 instead of putting that straight with the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.140
 title that if somehow I will put 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.710
 that yes or good or I will not put anything yes yes 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.660
 yes it is not if it does not deny it if 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.240
 denies I'll put that is a lie or what 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.860
 be so that you know more or less what 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.150
 as it is going, this one has to do another 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.780
 video because it will be a team to make 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.740
 these videos if it's true or not was 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.130
 lie 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.690
 does not make much good sense because this 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.270
 it's the only thing we know about leaves two 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.280
 filtering may by accident by 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.410
 nolan north the actor to give an actor 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.940
 dubbing of uncharted 4 I do not know who 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.200
 interprets in 34 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.959
 nor that of the sofas, maybe it's a 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.870
 new character or not maybe it has 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.390
 worked with that of base cups or one that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.030
 it is possible that because it is that I do not know it says 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.530
 literally for the last thing I know that 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.169
 is that in activity that is doing 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.240
 sofas 2 but me but my character has 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.900
 had a premature death 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:41.880
 and the developer Naughty Dog and 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.069
 sony have said nothing and the video with the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.259
 hour and minute and the exact second what 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.250
 you have in the description I hope there 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.860

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.810
 served this is already trending topic in the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.090
 first moment this has come out 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.340
 is in the news we need is in the mouth 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.500
 of all and normal I hope that we the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.819
 please shit if it's true I want you 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.560
