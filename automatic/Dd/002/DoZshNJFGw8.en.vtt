handle over the back wheels lock and the
front<00:05:02.110> wheels<00:05:02.289> unlock<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.820> you<00:05:03.880> can<00:05:04.030> see<00:05:04.210> it's

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
front wheels unlock so you can see it's

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.149 
front wheels unlock so you can see it's
pretty<00:05:05.320> ingenious<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.610> fact<00:05:06.930> turn<00:05:07.930> around

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
pretty ingenious to the fact turn around

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.230 
pretty ingenious to the fact turn around
and<00:05:09.159> again<00:05:09.370> we're<00:05:09.490> steering<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:09.880> front<00:05:10.090> so

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
and again we're steering the front so

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.610 
and again we're steering the front so
very<00:05:10.510> very<00:05:10.570> unique<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.139> there's<00:05:11.289> no<00:05:11.409> need<00:05:11.590> to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
very very unique so there's no need to

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.980 
very very unique so there's no need to
bend<00:05:11.919> down<00:05:12.030> lock<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.210> unlock<00:05:13.240> wheels<00:05:13.659> as<00:05:13.900> you

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
bend down lock and unlock wheels as you

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.649 
bend down lock and unlock wheels as you
change<00:05:14.199> direction<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:15.360> it's<00:05:16.360> obviously

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
change direction and it's obviously

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.210 
change direction and it's obviously
always<00:05:16.810> easier<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.500> steer<00:05:17.770> when<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.039> still

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
always easier to steer when you still

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.620 
always easier to steer when you still
invite<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.639> front<00:05:18.909> wheels<00:05:19.180> rather<00:05:19.389> than<00:05:19.539> the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
invite the front wheels rather than the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.879 
invite the front wheels rather than the
back<00:05:19.780> wheels<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:21.280> very<00:05:21.550> very<00:05:21.639> unique<00:05:22.060> and

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
back wheels so very very unique and

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.339
