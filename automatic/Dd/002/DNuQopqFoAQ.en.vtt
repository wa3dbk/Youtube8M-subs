Manhunter

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.890 
Manhunter
as<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.519> see<00:02:14.700> I'm<00:02:14.849> not<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.660> too

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
as you can see I'm not not too

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.600 
as you can see I'm not not too
well-versed<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.500> their<00:02:16.650> names<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.069> stuff<00:02:17.280> um

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
well-versed in their names and stuff um

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.500 
well-versed in their names and stuff um
but<00:02:18.390> yeah<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.620> think<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.340> cartoon<00:02:20.790> show<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.239> it

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
but yeah I think this cartoon show is it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.449 
but yeah I think this cartoon show is it
really<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.900> one<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> best<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:23.340> they

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
really is one of the best that that they

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.880 
really is one of the best that that they
could<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.390> teen<00:02:24.810> titans<00:02:25.319> type<00:02:25.620> of

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
could do for like a teen titans type of

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.790 
could do for like a teen titans type of
cartoon<00:02:26.879> series<00:02:27.209> i<00:02:27.510> think<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.019> not<00:02:28.200> easy<00:02:28.470> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
cartoon series i think it's not easy to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.190 
cartoon series i think it's not easy to
do<00:02:29.069> one<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.030> these<00:02:30.209> types<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.629> shows<00:02:30.840> where<00:02:31.110> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
do one of these types of shows where you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.400 
do one of these types of shows where you
take<00:02:31.440> sort<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.269> not<00:02:33.269> really<00:02:33.540> your<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:34.049> list

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
take sort of like not really your a list

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.380 
take sort of like not really your a list
of<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.220> know<00:02:35.310> compo<00:02:35.700> characters<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.330> you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
of you know compo characters and you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.699 
of you know compo characters and you
make<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.720> into<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.989> really<00:02:37.319> really<00:02:37.470> good

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
make it into a really really good

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.070 
make it into a really really good
cartoon<00:02:38.190> show<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.640> still<00:02:39.330> think<00:02:39.360> though<00:02:39.840> they'd

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
cartoon show I still think though they'd

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.710 
cartoon show I still think though they'd
probably<00:02:40.379> be<00:02:40.680> better<00:02:40.920> off<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.790> doing<00:02:41.940> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
probably be better off just doing a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.229 
probably be better off just doing a
justice<00:02:43.620> league<00:02:43.709> cartoon<00:02:44.129> instead<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.090> this

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
justice league cartoon instead of this

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.370 
justice league cartoon instead of this
use<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.110> same<00:02:46.380> artwork<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.930> just<00:02:48.930> have<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.200> be

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
use the same artwork and just have it be

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.949 
use the same artwork and just have it be
a<00:02:49.530> justice<00:02:50.040> league<00:02:50.099> cartoon<00:02:50.630> but<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.780> thing

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
a justice league cartoon but the thing

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.569 
a justice league cartoon but the thing
is<00:02:51.989> i<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.500> because<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.799> recently<00:02:53.280> you

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
is i think is because they recently you

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.910 
is i think is because they recently you
know<00:02:53.610> they<00:02:54.239> had<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.019> four<00:02:55.260> year<00:02:55.590> running

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
know they had the the four year running

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.559 
know they had the the four year running
justice<00:02:56.430> league<00:02:56.610> which<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> great<00:02:57.120> cartoon

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
justice league which is a great cartoon

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.720 
justice league which is a great cartoon
series<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.590> animations<00:02:59.099> little<00:02:59.310> data<00:02:59.489> by

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
series the animations little data by

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.280 
series the animations little data by
today's<00:03:00.060> standards<00:03:00.480> especially<00:03:00.660> compared<00:03:01.230> to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
today's standards especially compared to

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.500 
today's standards especially compared to
this<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:02.700> i<00:03:02.730> still<00:03:03.000> think<00:03:03.060> they<00:03:03.299> probably

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
this but i still think they probably

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.180 
this but i still think they probably
better<00:03:03.810> off<00:03:03.870> going<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.470> route<00:03:04.680> which<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.040> why

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
better off going that route which is why

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.910 
better off going that route which is why
I'm<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.579> usually<00:03:05.879> too<00:03:06.750> into<00:03:07.230> these<00:03:07.440> types<00:03:07.769> of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
I'm not usually too into these types of

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.229 
I'm not usually too into these types of
cartoons<00:03:08.370> where<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.640> have<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.209> know

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
cartoons where you have like you know

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.569 
cartoons where you have like you know
the<00:03:09.780> sidekicks<00:03:10.440> are<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.920> know<00:03:11.040> running<00:03:11.489> the

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
the sidekicks are you know running the

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.699 
the sidekicks are you know running the
show<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.090> have<00:03:12.150> Rob<00:03:12.450> instead<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.260> Batman

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
show so you have Rob instead of Batman

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.100 
show so you have Rob instead of Batman
and<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:13.980> have<00:03:14.129> Superboy<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.510> Superman

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and you have Superboy and so Superman

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.190 
and you have Superboy and so Superman
and<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.129> on<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.489> forth<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.780> still<00:03:19.170> I

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
and and so on and so forth but still I

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.870 
and and so on and so forth but still I
think<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.709> show<00:03:19.889> is<00:03:19.920> done<00:03:20.489> very<00:03:20.790> well

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
think that the show is done very well

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.059 
think that the show is done very well
and<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.630> really<00:03:21.840> goes<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.139> show<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.769> think

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
and it really goes to show that I think

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.460 
and it really goes to show that I think
Marvel<00:03:23.519> has<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.670> long<00:03:24.060> way<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.420> go<00:03:24.720> when<00:03:25.380> it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
Marvel has a long way to go when it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.280 
Marvel has a long way to go when it
comes<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.920> doing<00:03:26.069> cartoon<00:03:26.579> series<00:03:27.049> right<00:03:28.049> now

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
comes to doing cartoon series right now

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.890 
comes to doing cartoon series right now
because<00:03:28.739> compared<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.849> justice<00:03:30.450> league<00:03:30.630> and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
because compared to justice league and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.849 
because compared to justice league and
compared<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:32.670> know<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:33.030> cartoon<00:03:33.510> series

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
compared to you know this cartoon series

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.220 
compared to you know this cartoon series
Marvel<00:03:34.859> really<00:03:35.250> their<00:03:35.549> art<00:03:35.849> is<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.510> totally

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
Marvel really their art is just totally

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.539 
Marvel really their art is just totally
garbage<00:03:37.650> their<00:03:37.859> effects<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.459> everything

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
garbage their effects and everything

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.210 
garbage their effects and everything
it's<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:39.569> in<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> even<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.650> writing<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.099> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
it's just in the even the writing of the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.849 
it's just in the even the writing of the
episodes<00:03:41.579> too<00:03:41.819> in<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> story<00:03:43.079> arcs<00:03:43.440> or<00:03:43.620> just

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
episodes too in the story arcs or just

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.589 
episodes too in the story arcs or just
it's<00:03:44.069> really<00:03:44.190> hard<00:03:44.669> for<00:03:44.730> them<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:44.940> compete<00:03:45.359> um

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
it's really hard for them to compete um

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.259 
it's really hard for them to compete um
I<00:03:46.079> think<00:03:46.919> probably<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.700> best<00:03:48.000> thing<00:03:48.120> about
