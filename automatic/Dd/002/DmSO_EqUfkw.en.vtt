00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Oh, they grab me, it's in class 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 welcome in book lovers we are 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.280
 in my intellectual chair a while ago 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.170
 that did not present here and as you can see 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.090
 in the background there is a book book and that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.710
 I'm going to give today and it's nothing more 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 and nothing less than john gray me copies in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 English because sometimes I like to read in 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 English and part of the no exit here in 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.490
 Mexico but the advantages of having it in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.290
 English is that look what it says here I am 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.200
 it will be true it will be true that the copy 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.930
 is signed by jean green because it is not 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 I can believe if it's signed by the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.050
 beijing author 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.000
 that is but good enough let's talk 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.250
 of the book the font and not this time 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.410
 about jason a girl of 16 years old if not 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.590
 I'm wrong that you have cancer in 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.590
 lungs 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.530
 good yes the setting is something 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.260
 depressing but the story is very 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.360
 father was a support group that was 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.920
 they join many people with cancer people 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.680
 who has lost his eyes people who have 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.479
 lost his testicles and people who have 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.340
 lost different parts of the body the 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.740
 point of this support group is because 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.720
 You know how to support and help yourself during 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.270
 path that you already know to have cancer 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.909
 terminal- eventually there is your court 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.650
 where augustus waters is called a 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.810
 shade that they like as well as that a 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.280
 little bit more than as we saw it is very 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.080
 interesting the relationship that comes out of 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.830
 them because she has lung cancer 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.170
 and he had had cancer before 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.090
 as we already know it is terminal then that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.120
 fulfill your dream of going to visit a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.160
 writer and I do not know what and things like that well 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.500
 parents and emotional that people's life 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.540
 that I was with this book so I did not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 you say I did not warn you he's very father 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.300
 because it goes way beyond a relationship 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.670
 normal from 18 to 26 years with a guy 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.490
 because there is the death factor within 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.040
 there more deeply than the factor 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.960
 death inside I do not know today's twilight 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.480
 then it happens because the vulturi 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.400
 come you get is a little deeper 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.560
 that and that 's why he's father and 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.479
 I recommend it to the photo and I was not 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.050
 dress and a car macaroni of 10 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.310
 because he is very father and has many 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.880
 feelings involved that if you are 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.050
 a sensitive person something is going to touch you 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.940
 thankfully football have this time 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 It's already in Spanish so you can 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.709

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.709
