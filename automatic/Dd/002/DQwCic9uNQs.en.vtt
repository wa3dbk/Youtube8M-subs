00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.220 
gonna be playing on a server where it's
pistols<00:00:15.670> only<00:00:15.790> and<00:00:16.209> it<00:00:16.330> is<00:00:16.449> actually<00:00:16.689> still<00:00:17.199> a

pistols only and it is actually still a
ranked<00:00:17.680> match<00:00:17.859> so<00:00:18.189> it<00:00:18.310> should<00:00:18.460> be<00:00:18.490> pretty

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
ranked match so it should be pretty

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.150 
ranked match so it should be pretty
interesting<00:00:18.880> I<00:00:19.600> decided<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.740> do<00:00:20.890> this<00:00:20.980> because

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
interesting I decided to do this because

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.770 
interesting I decided to do this because
I<00:00:21.340> wanted<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.640> unlock<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:21.940> lot<00:00:22.060> of<00:00:22.210> pistols<00:00:22.600> and

I wanted to unlock a lot of pistols and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.960 
I wanted to unlock a lot of pistols and
the<00:00:22.930> only<00:00:23.230> way<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.440> do<00:00:23.920> it<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.280> to<00:00:24.520> actually<00:00:24.670> get

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
the only way to do it is to actually get

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.970 
the only way to do it is to actually get
pistol<00:00:25.390> kills<00:00:25.600> so<00:00:25.900> I<00:00:26.170> figured<00:00:26.710> what<00:00:26.949> better

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
pistol kills so I figured what better

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.189 
pistol kills so I figured what better
way<00:00:27.400> to<00:00:27.430> get<00:00:27.820> pistol<00:00:28.150> kills<00:00:28.360> than<00:00:28.600> to<00:00:28.779> go<00:00:28.930> on<00:00:29.170> a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
way to get pistol kills than to go on a

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.800 
way to get pistol kills than to go on a
server<00:00:29.500> that's<00:00:29.770> just<00:00:30.250> pistols<00:00:30.699> and<00:00:30.940> there's<00:00:31.750> a

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
really interesting that you can actually

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.800 
really interesting that you can actually
go<00:01:52.479> out<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.840> search<00:01:53.439> for<00:01:54.659> pistols<00:01:55.659> only

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
go out and search for pistols only

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.679 
go out and search for pistols only
gameplay<00:01:56.470> servers<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:57.880> come<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.570> here

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
gameplay servers and then come in here

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.929 
gameplay servers and then come in here
with<00:01:58.840> only<00:01:59.049> a<00:01:59.170> pistol<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.829> then<00:01:59.979> level<00:02:00.850> up

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
with only a pistol and then level up

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.010 
with only a pistol and then level up
your<00:02:01.030> pistols<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.390> way<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.810> have<00:02:01.930> to

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
your pistols that way so you have to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.109 
your pistols that way so you have to
actually<00:02:02.320> go<00:02:02.470> out<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.649> your<00:02:02.799> way<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.950> do<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.000> the

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
actually go out of your way to do it the

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.319 
actually go out of your way to do it the
hard<00:02:04.299> way<00:02:04.360> because<00:02:05.280> there<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> hard<00:02:07.060> and

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
hard way because there is a hard and

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.449 
hard way because there is a hard and
easy<00:02:07.990> way<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.319> level<00:02:08.799> up<00:02:08.920> pistols<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
easy way to level up pistols and the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.519 
easy way to level up pistols and the
hard<00:02:09.670> way<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.239> go<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.809> actually<00:02:11.290> play

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:11.529 
hard way is to go in and actually play

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:12.679 
hard way is to go in and actually play
against<00:02:11.799> people<00:02:12.069> with<00:02:12.099> assault<00:02:12.549> rifles

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
against people with assault rifles

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.830 
against people with assault rifles
things<00:02:13.689> like<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.109> where

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
things like that where

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.300 
things like that where
you<00:02:15.840> otherwise<00:02:16.170> wouldn't<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.739> able<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.040> level

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
you otherwise wouldn't be able to level

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.520 
you otherwise wouldn't be able to level
up<00:02:17.340> pistols<00:02:17.549> because<00:02:17.909> everybody's<00:02:18.360> just

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
up pistols because everybody's just

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.160 
up pistols because everybody's just
destroying<00:02:19.530> your<00:02:19.860> face<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.840> not

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
destroying your face and it's just not

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.619 
destroying your face and it's just not
possible<00:02:22.409> so<00:02:22.799> this<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.099> my<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.420> this

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
possible so this is my that this is this

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.740 
possible so this is my that this is this
is<00:02:24.689> my<00:02:24.959> fix<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.530> get<00:02:25.680> around<00:02:26.150> wanting<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.510> not

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
is my fix to get around wanting and not

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.539 
is my fix to get around wanting and not
wanting<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> level<00:02:28.530> up<00:02:28.590> pistols<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.220> really

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
wanting to level up pistols and I really

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.979 
wanting to level up pistols and I really
didn't<00:02:29.879> want<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.150> level<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> pistols<00:02:30.810> for<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
didn't want a level of pistols for the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.569 
didn't want a level of pistols for the
longest<00:02:31.230> time<00:02:31.319> but<00:02:31.560> when<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> found<00:02:32.129> out<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.519> I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
couldn't see levelling up pistols any

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.180 
couldn't see levelling up pistols any
other<00:02:54.599> way<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.810> mean<00:02:55.019> they're<00:02:55.170> obviously<00:02:55.799> you

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
other way I mean they're obviously you

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.479 
other way I mean they're obviously you
could<00:02:56.400> go<00:02:56.609> into<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:57.739> regular<00:02:58.739> lobby<00:02:59.159> and<00:02:59.400> then

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
could go into a regular lobby and then

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.280 
could go into a regular lobby and then
have<00:02:59.700> pistols<00:03:00.359> leveled<00:03:00.599> up<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.870> way<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:01.200> if

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
have pistols leveled up that way but if

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.770 
have pistols leveled up that way but if
you<00:03:01.379> do<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.829> way<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:02.310> think<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.389> somewhat

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you do it that way I think it's somewhat

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.440 
you do it that way I think it's somewhat
like<00:03:03.989> 500<00:03:04.769> 600<00:03:05.220> plus<00:03:05.609> kills<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.299> to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
like 500 600 plus kills that you have to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.949 
like 500 600 plus kills that you have to
get<00:03:07.280> just<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.430> level<00:03:08.819> up<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.209> get<00:03:09.629> all<00:03:09.659> the
