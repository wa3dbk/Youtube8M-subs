00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
battle the buses are a bit disappointing

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.039 
battle the buses are a bit disappointing
as<00:02:35.530> they<00:02:35.950> tend<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.310> look<00:02:36.579> quite<00:02:36.790> similar<00:02:37.049> but

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
as they tend to look quite similar but

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.110 
as they tend to look quite similar but
I've<00:02:38.170> only<00:02:38.260> seen<00:02:38.680> three<00:02:39.310> out<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.519> five<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.090> far

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
I've only seen three out of five so far

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.569 
I've only seen three out of five so far
so<00:02:40.629> maybe<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.989> gets<00:02:41.109> better<00:02:41.379> Titan<00:02:42.280> attacks

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
so maybe it gets better Titan attacks
