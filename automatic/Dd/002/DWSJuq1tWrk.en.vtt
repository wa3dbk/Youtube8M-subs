 in the opposite way the insolence of man is touched 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.870
 to change the function 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.750
 they just have to go 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750
 feel the skin below the river

 first stopping the top right speakers 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.270
 chivas resisted 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.140
 that is, blur 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 from now on it can be reactivated always commented 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
 of prize 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 first you need to stop

 the alarm function 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.710
 Various alarm functions one month 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.290
 alarmed 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.350
 wins 3 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.120
 and the alarming

 It can 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.599
 avoid 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.329
 pressing 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.819
 slightly 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.519
 the sensor 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.719
 lower right 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.719

 it can be dictated 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.179
 in the same way 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.229

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.539
 sometimes they are even more sounded 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.619
 The time 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.619
 this can be 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.619
 with the upper left sensor 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.539
 a superior right 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.829
 you can go theater 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.829

 they change 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.199
 this sensor 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.199
 more with less

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.079
 they have not even registered 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.079
 there are many functions 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.499
 movies reviewing 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.359
 with this sensor 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.359
 and modify 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.609
 with rain sensors 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.609
 rights 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.139
 this sensor also works 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.149
 journalist urges hours 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.650

 can not be seen on stage 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.699
 then to activate this journalist turned off 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.400
 you just have to go 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.629
