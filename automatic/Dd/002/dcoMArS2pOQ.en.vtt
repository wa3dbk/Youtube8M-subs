behind<00:00:13.309> that<00:00:13.580> name<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:14.419> concept<00:00:14.719> is

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
behind that name the concept is

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.840 
behind that name the concept is
basically<00:00:15.320> since<00:00:15.740> we<00:00:15.889> were<00:00:16.250> from<00:00:16.460> boone<00:00:16.700> north

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
basically since we were from boone north

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.429 
basically since we were from boone north
carolina<00:00:16.970> we're<00:00:17.840> up<00:00:18.050> in<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.199> more

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439

mountainous<00:00:18.920> regions<00:00:19.310> we're<00:00:19.699> trying<00:00:19.880> to<00:00:19.939> go

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
mountainous regions we're trying to go

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.060 
mountainous regions we're trying to go
back<00:00:20.119> to<00:00:20.269> the<00:00:20.300> homestead<00:00:20.599> concept<00:00:21.529> where

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
back to the homestead concept where

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.609 
back to the homestead concept where
smaller<00:00:22.670> living<00:00:22.939> space<00:00:23.300> is<00:00:23.330> easier<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.349> work

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
smaller living space is easier to work

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.890 
smaller living space is easier to work
with<00:00:24.679> adaptable<00:00:25.460> modular<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.539> where<00:00:26.630> you<00:00:26.750> can

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
with adaptable modular to where you can

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.259 
with adaptable modular to where you can
add<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.289> subtract<00:00:27.710> what<00:00:28.039> you<00:00:28.189> need<00:00:28.369> not<00:00:28.880> over

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
space which in a sense we call a flex

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.370 
space which in a sense we call a flex
space<00:00:55.760> which<00:00:56.360> is<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.570> kitchen<00:00:56.960> which<00:00:57.140> can<00:00:57.290> be

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
space which is a kitchen which can be

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.810 
space which is a kitchen which can be
closed<00:00:57.650> off<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:57.890> turned<00:00:58.190> into<00:00:58.310> a<00:00:58.400> dining<00:00:58.670> room

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
closed off and turned into a dining room

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.250 
closed off and turned into a dining room
which<00:00:59.090> then<00:00:59.270> can<00:00:59.390> be<00:00:59.420> changed<00:00:59.840> into<00:00:59.960> a<00:01:00.080> living

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
which then can be changed into a living

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.560 
which then can be changed into a living
room<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.220> it's<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.550> very<00:01:01.580> adaptable<00:01:02.240> space

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
room so it's a very adaptable space

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.600 
room so it's a very adaptable space
we're<00:01:02.750> also<00:01:03.040> experimenting<00:01:04.040> with<00:01:04.070> changing

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
we're also experimenting with changing

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.190 
we're also experimenting with changing
the<00:01:04.699> sizes<00:01:05.059> of<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> bedrooms<00:01:05.659> if<00:01:05.929> you<00:01:06.049> need<00:01:06.170> a

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
the sizes of the bedrooms if you need a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.990 
the sizes of the bedrooms if you need a
master<00:01:06.500> or<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.950> smaller<00:01:07.369> bedroom<00:01:07.820> you'll<00:01:07.939> be

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
master or a smaller bedroom you'll be

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.580 
master or a smaller bedroom you'll be
able<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.210> native<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.539> walls<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.929> little<00:01:09.170> bit<00:01:09.259> so

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
able to native the walls a little bit so

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.109 
able to native the walls a little bit so
they're<00:01:09.770> basically<00:01:10.009> all<00:01:10.340> large<00:01:10.640> movable

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
they're basically all large movable

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.240 
they're basically all large movable
walls<00:01:11.299> inside<00:01:11.719> and<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.770> concept<00:01:13.100> we're

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
walls inside and that is a concept we're

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.410 
walls inside and that is a concept we're
working<00:01:13.579> with<00:01:13.670> we<00:01:13.789> don't<00:01:13.939> have<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.179> yet<00:01:14.299> but

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
working with we don't have it yet but

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.459 
working with we don't have it yet but
that<00:01:14.479> is<00:01:14.659> something<00:01:14.750> yet<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.140> we'd<00:01:15.229> like<00:01:15.350> to

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
that is something yet that we'd like to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.169 
that is something yet that we'd like to
do<00:01:15.560> because<00:01:15.710> it's<00:01:15.979> flexible<00:01:16.759> as<00:01:16.850> we<00:01:16.939> can<00:01:17.090> make

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
do because it's flexible as we can make

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:18.760 
do because it's flexible as we can make
the<00:01:17.299> space<00:01:17.450> as<00:01:17.659> possible<00:01:17.719> now<00:01:18.409> tell<00:01:18.590> me<00:01:18.619> about

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
the space as possible now tell me about

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.109 
the space as possible now tell me about
the<00:01:18.920> outside<00:01:19.249> appearance<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.789> a<00:01:19.820> giant

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
the outside appearance is that a giant

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.910 
the outside appearance is that a giant
skylight<00:01:20.749> on<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:20.990> top<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.350> flat<00:01:21.530> roof<00:01:21.710> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
skylight on the top of the flat roof and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.590 
skylight on the top of the flat roof and
actually<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:22.429> a<00:01:22.549> solar<00:01:22.820> thermal<00:01:23.060> skylight

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
actually it's a solar thermal skylight

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.080 
actually it's a solar thermal skylight
okay<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:23.990> did<00:01:24.200> x<00:01:24.439> is<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.679> daylight<00:01:25.399> so<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.939> brings

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
okay I did x is a daylight so it brings

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.940

actually go to DC or where the new
location<00:02:30.080> will<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:31.340> break<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.670> into<00:02:31.820> three

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
location will be we break it into three

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.000 
location will be we break it into three
modules<00:02:32.750> here<00:02:33.200> which<00:02:33.350> are<00:02:33.440> 18<00:02:33.770> wheeler

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
modules here which are 18 wheeler

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.979 
modules here which are 18 wheeler
modules<00:02:34.430> seven<00:02:35.209> modules<00:02:35.330> here<00:02:35.690> which<00:02:35.870> are

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
pulled behind a pickup trucks so we're

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.190 
pulled behind a pickup trucks so we're
have<00:02:37.670> ten<00:02:38.000> different<00:02:38.150> modules<00:02:38.690> ten<00:02:38.989> different

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
have ten different modules ten different

water built right into the camera and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920 
water built right into the camera and
what<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.730> seems<00:03:13.970> pretty<00:03:14.390> pricey<00:03:14.750> for

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
what is this seems pretty pricey for
