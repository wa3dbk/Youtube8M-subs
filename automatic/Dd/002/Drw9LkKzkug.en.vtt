00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.749
 I currently have two active drawings in 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.029

 screen and video will take the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.730
 second draw is from a copy of the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.830
 sea ​​of ​​tranquility that is one of my 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.480
 last translations published be 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.640

 if you click on the link you can see the 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.940
 video 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.980
 and now let's leave this video form 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.080
 part of the initiative sponsors a channel 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 that emerged in the beginning in the blogosphere 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.710
 and sweet sabag has attracted the community 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.660
 of book tube if you want to know a little 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 more I leave you down your video but good 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.560
 basically consists of one more channel 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 or less known because it's not that mine 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.850
 be the panacea sponsor one more channel 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.040
 small that is starting and you give 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.380
 advice and help him with things like 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.960
 edit the content 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.330
 the design making collaborations with him 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.980
 and ultimately help him grow is a 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.390
 initiative that I found super pretty 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.980
 when I saw that he had been put in motion 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.140
 because yes that the beginnings are very 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.480
 hard and very difficult and that is very easy 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 feeling discouraged and that costs a lot 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.350
 grow and reach the public and that the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 people see your videos and get to do 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.500
 good videos so I wanted to point 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.390
 this initiative to contribute a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.790
 little bit each of the sponsors we are going to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 choose between 1 and 2 channels me in my case 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.290
 I will choose to 2 and the only requirement is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.820
 that has less than 300 subscribers 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 sponsors for their part will have to have 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 a minimum of one thousand subscribers and good if 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 you want in godparents and see all the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.690
 details you have below the sweet video 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.150
 where she tells everything apart from 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.870
 general requirement of less than 300 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.430
 subscribers 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.260
 each one of the sponsors we can put 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.120
 our own requirements so the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.370
 First of the fears will be comment 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.260
 in that post saying you want that 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.240
 father your channel and above all and what more 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.010
 I'm interested because you want that stage of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.170
 come I would like to know why you want 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.180
 may it be me who sponsors your channel on 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 second requirement is to be constant not 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.720
 I ask for two or three videos per week 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 basically because I'm nobody to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.560
 ask for a quantity of videos but yes that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 I will consider only those 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.700
 channels that upload at least three videos 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.250
 a month basically because if this is 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 try to help channels grow and the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.270
 book to be in question is not constant 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.130
 Well, you understand me, and well, those are 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.690
 the important requirements when it arrives 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 to your comment I will go through 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.040
 our channel will watch your two or three 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.050
 last videos and based on that I'll see 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.120
 what seems to me I will judge as your 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.610
 content your originality 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.860
 likes that you have the topics that you treat 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.750
 in your videos the way of speaking the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.100
 focus of the videos that is not doing 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.780
 lack of image quality 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.510
 spectacular a spectacular sound 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.460
 because my videos are not like this we are going to be 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.520
 sincere but I would like to see a 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.780
 content then different original and that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.280
 I think it's worth it 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.650
 something that I will also value, although not 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.450
 will be an important requirement if the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.130
 future in question I usually leave 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.110
 comments or not as I say is not a 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.760
 important requirement but if I by 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.590
 example I'm between two channels that I 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.420
 they like it equally and that I can not 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.160
 decide between them and it turns out that one 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.989
 usually comment and another not 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.360
 I will surely choose the one I mentioned 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.130
 basically because it would be a way of 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.470
 thank you as I say it is not a 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.630
 important requirement I choose between 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.370
 that I like but in the end I say 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.900
 so you have it in mind too and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.610
 well this has been everything I think has 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.900
 everything is clear, you have a term until 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.239
 on April 20 to sign up as 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.680
 possible sponsored and finally if you have 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.640
 some doubt then leave me also in 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.080

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.910
 remember that you can subscribe to 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.590
