00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.560
 The second phase of the cast lead operation began. 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.240
 now there is a battle in the gas 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.750

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.730

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.270
 into several parts 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.010
 Israeli tanks completely shut down

 the Israelites met in the center

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.610
 an hour almost half a thousand people among whom 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190
 80 children 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.730
 see the whole world should see them 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.060
 going on here 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.210
 by this point the Israeli conflict 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.820
 one dead 29 wounded soldiers and 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.320
 officers to receive wounded without much 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.969
 noise 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.159
 was prepared in advance 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.710
 largest hospital 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.940
 in the south of the country the campaign is underway 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.860
 successfully we know that dozens of militants 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 Hamas were killed by our troops 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 hand sculpting use peaceful 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.150
 residents as a human shield, we know that they 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.430
 launch rockets from densely populated 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.950
 areas 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.899
 we take this into account and do everything to 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.610
 avoid casualties among the local population 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.979
 Tyumen judging by the fact that the war will not 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.869
 the hard slow of the israelis 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.520
 openly warned the minister 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.190
 defense 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.060
 Well, so that not all ended successfully 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.100
 we will strengthen the military presence 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.660
 our goal is to force Hamas to stop 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.600
 military action against Israel 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.729
 its citizens and bring peace to the south 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.039
 part of the country is taxable so the word war 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.799
 first heard from the mouth 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.420
 israeli defense minister 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.319
 conservative security official one of 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.350
 success factors 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.209
 German companies 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.439
 hut considers free access 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.169
 any information about the course of hostilities 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.469
 from now on shooting combat units 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.249
 equate crime for 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.709
 which is a foreign journalist 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.379
 exiled from the country and israeli 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.169
 be behind bars 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.789
 now the war in Israel is removed 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.309
 a distance of two three kilometers but even this 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.179
 distance is not safe 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.939
 a few hours ago Kassam hit the city 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.099
 great of all as a result of shelling 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.209
 today killed 3 Israelis 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.119
 god alone knows when this will end 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.239
 the wolf of lamar will sow cows on the border with 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:50.850
 gas 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.610
 his farm next to 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.320
 by sector 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.040
 war never make me leave 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.360
 from here says wolves 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.140
 Qasam never had a kibbutz with us 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.689
 understood summer flight 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.809
 but just in case farmers always carries 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.699
 with a bulletproof vest and hard hat 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.599
 Lamar served mercenaries in 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.799
 French Foreign Legion 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.659
 what is war knows us actually by 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.529
 parties any war once 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.809
 ends speaks veteran army 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:16.370
 leaves 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.290
 and problems 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.119
 remain 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.769
 and even beating KAMAZ I will still be 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.499
 style sectors in helmets 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:23.769

 Andrei Tsapliyenko Sergei Dubinin SdR from 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 Inter TV channel details 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.979
 and now Andrei Tsapliyenko is 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.480
 in direct contact with the studio 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.819
 Andrei is suspended or 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.730
 offensive what is happening now on 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.059
 border with the gas sector 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.189
 good evening to this moment we know 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.409
 that 150 are participating in the operation 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.510
 Israeli tanks 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.650
 and at least fifteen hundred israeli 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.019
 soldiers and officers 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.949
 Uncle Rain is clearly visible in the afternoon now 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.269
 probably not that right side 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.790
 abolished the village of beit lahyah on the left and the camp 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.819
 Jebelia refugees taboos that populated 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.029
 the area lives about 150 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.029
 thousand alovert cues active combat 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.739
 the action is now happening there 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.540
 I wonder what the Israeli army is up to 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.569
 the end held the intrigue of this war for example 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.379
 even a press statement was told about 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.039
 the fact that combat missions is destruction 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.289
 hamas firing points aim to prevent 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.669
 rocket attacks of israeli 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.109
 territories but in fact what 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.269
 happening now is complete destruction 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.449
 hamas both political and 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.180
 military structures at the same time and inside dozens 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.300
 civilians like us today 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.169
 it became known that 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.310
 artillery shell hit the school 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.590
 to the shelter for 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.530
 and now Palestinian shelling is under way 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.419
 the territory of the gas sector shelling and RPTs 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.650
 systems 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.930
 I wonder what the most 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.770
 belligerent rhetoric sounds from 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.550
 the mouth of the Russian-speaking part of the Israelis 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.690
 for example immediately after the start of combat 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.460
 action leaders 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.210
 news service one of 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.030
 Russian-language channels stated that we 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.419
 must at all costs force 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.630
 Palestinians abandon 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.910
 support hamas quote we must 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.639
 the sailors are starving we must leave them 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.639
 no fuel electricity 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:07.439
 thanks from the combat zone was 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.439
 Our correspondent Andrei Tsybin 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.780
 The European Commission will allocate 3 million euros for 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.349
 assisting the population of the sector 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.840
 gas money will go to the products of the tent and 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.349
 medications meanwhile safety advice 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:20.430
 UN 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.449
 I could not take a resolution on the situation 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.770
 Middle East peak agreement
