screen we did not flinch watching this

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.720 
screen we did not flinch watching this
film<00:00:18.439> we<00:00:18.560> went<00:00:18.769> through<00:00:18.949> about<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:19.220> box<00:00:19.519> of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
film we went through about a box of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.109 
film we went through about a box of
tissues<00:00:20.119> between<00:00:20.329> us<00:00:20.720> but<00:00:21.970> everything<00:00:22.970> that

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
tissues between us but everything that

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.159 
tissues between us but everything that
we<00:00:23.300> saw<00:00:23.569> on<00:00:23.900> film<00:00:24.890> we<00:00:25.819> had<00:00:25.999> experienced<00:00:26.659> so

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
we saw on film we had experienced so

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.189 
we saw on film we had experienced so
frequently<00:00:27.919> during<00:00:28.669> that<00:00:28.849> decade<00:00:29.089> that<00:00:29.810> it

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
frequently during that decade that it

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.979 
frequently during that decade that it
wasn't<00:00:30.470> startling<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.550> us<00:00:31.759> but<00:00:32.300> actually

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
wasn't startling to us but actually

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.890 
wasn't startling to us but actually
that's<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.410> compliment<00:00:33.920> because<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.390> fact<00:00:35.660> is

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
that's a compliment because the fact is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.890 
that's a compliment because the fact is
that<00:00:35.930> they<00:00:36.380> did<00:00:36.740> get<00:00:37.340> it<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:37.700> it's<00:00:38.480> just

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
that they did get it and it's just

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.070 
that they did get it and it's just
because<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.500> our<00:00:39.940> overexposure<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:41.690> we

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
because of our overexposure that we

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.290 
because of our overexposure that we
didn't<00:00:42.380> react<00:00:42.770> perhaps<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.550> way<00:00:43.700> that<00:00:44.120> they

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
didn't react perhaps the way that they

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.600 
didn't react perhaps the way that they
thought<00:00:44.480> that<00:00:44.750> we<00:00:44.900> might<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.440> wasn't<00:00:45.890> scary<00:00:46.370> to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
thought that we might it wasn't scary to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.360 
thought that we might it wasn't scary to
us<00:00:46.790> but<00:00:47.120> it's<00:00:47.420> going<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.720> terrify<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.890> rest<00:00:49.130> of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
us but it's going to terrify the rest of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.350 
us but it's going to terrify the rest of
the<00:00:49.550> world<00:00:50.950> what<00:00:51.950> made<00:00:52.130> you<00:00:52.250> decide<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.880> tell

the story to the world the true story is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.319 
the story to the world the true story is
the<00:00:55.070> most<00:00:55.280> frightening<00:00:55.490> movie<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.210> could

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
the most frightening movie you could

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.810 
the most frightening movie you could
ever<00:00:56.450> tell<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.960> James<00:00:57.860> was<00:00:58.130> amazing<00:00:58.700> his

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
ever tell and James was amazing his

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.130 
ever tell and James was amazing his
James<00:00:59.000> really<00:00:59.210> wanted<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.540> stick<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.960> what

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
James really wanted to stick to what

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.990 
James really wanted to stick to what
happened<00:01:00.560> in<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:00.739> house<00:01:00.950> and<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.610> parents

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
happened in that house and the parents

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.119 
happened in that house and the parents
had<00:01:02.120> documented<00:01:02.780> all<00:01:02.960> these<00:01:03.170> events<00:01:03.440> over<00:01:03.950> all

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
had documented all these events over all

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.380 
had documented all these events over all
the<00:01:04.280> years<00:01:04.549> of<00:01:04.729> everything<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.299> had

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
the years of everything that had

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.029 
the years of everything that had
happened<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.560> hardest<00:01:06.859> part<00:01:07.009> was

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
happened and so the hardest part was

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.609 
happened and so the hardest part was
really<00:01:07.219> distilling<00:01:07.880> it<00:01:07.969> down<00:01:07.999> into<00:01:08.689> one<00:01:09.229> movie

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
really distilling it down into one movie

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.349 
really distilling it down into one movie
and<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:10.189> think<00:01:10.369> James<00:01:10.579> did<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.789> great<00:01:10.969> job<00:01:11.179> with

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
and I think James did a great job with

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.059 
and I think James did a great job with
that<00:01:11.390> but<00:01:11.659> it<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.929> truly<00:01:12.439> frightening<00:01:12.679> story

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
that but it is a truly frightening story

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.450
