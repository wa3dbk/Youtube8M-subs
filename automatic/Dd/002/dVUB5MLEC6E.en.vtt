00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.460
 Speak, I'm real Paula, and then I 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.289
 I'll show you one more map of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.829
 series of best places to stay says 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.900
 in the team 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.970
 meeting the requests of the subscribers today 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.490
 I will show four placements in the 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.349
 map operation total white being two 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.179
 for the North American team and two for 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.800
 the Russian team when it came to finish let 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.350
 your suggestion and do not forget to enjoy 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.519
 our fan page facebook.com barra paulo 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.170
 royal a beauty 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.120
 my friends, because I've been seeing this 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.860
 map is very dear among the suits and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.420
 a good amount of them usually 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.039
 position on some points that they 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.780
 think they are protected but in the 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.789
 truth are making life easier for 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.859
 ships that really position themselves in 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.629
 points that provide good coverage and 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.859
 protection above the average of others 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.809
 map locations 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.420
 these are the points I'll show you 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.590
 now let's start with the team of 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.969
 United States that you are going to 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.969
 position in this area here 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.860
 noticed that the field of vision is 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.960
 absurdly complete is so great a throw 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.640
 and you're not staying on top of that hill 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.710
 tried to hide on one side 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.539
 when you go to pay because there 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.369
 Can you cover where you have it? 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.630
 And the risk of you taking a shot 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.630
 by the side decreases considerably 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200
 near the river 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.150
 the second positioning point is this 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.150
 on here 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.180
 here the field of vision is still very large 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.650
 and usually serves more to hit the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.660
 enemies in the region between the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.070
 flags charlie and delta and bravo is 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.110
 Of course, if you move from one 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.120
 discreet way you can cover the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.770
 flags but as it has a sniper that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.420
 like to stay in the area of that triangle 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.920
 I just told you so much 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.660
 probably will not work on 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.810
 locate your targets from here where you 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.810
 it is 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.900
 the government speaks well 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.219
 good passing by the Russian team the first 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.219
 positioning point is this one 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.650
 the field of vision is quite complete equal in 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.720
 North American side then the ideal is 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.640
 you always stay down and look for 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.000
 protect yourself using the relief of this 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.000
 area 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.860
 already the second positioning point is 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.440
 very simple but incredible as it may seem 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.970
 I managed to kill a lot of people here I 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.970
 I'll share this with you guys. 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.450
 the visual field here is very good too 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.520
 especially the enemies have in the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.630
 area between the foxtrot flags already 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.630
 alpha ii echo 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.810
 jackman thing updated 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.059
 it was hard 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.370
 now comes the moment of the greatest doubt of the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.590
 suits this map how do you 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.630
 fight when the blizzard starts 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.670
 Yes, because if you do not know at the time of 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.260
 blizzard can not see anything through the lens 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.090
 the river at the time unless you 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.520
 you are using an infrared lens or 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.740
 good thermal in this situation I see three 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.660
 The first options are you get an 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.490
 snow that is agile puts your friend 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.290
 special and plays in the middle of the snowstorm 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.700
 to hunt down enemies or defend the 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.020
 team objective and today I will 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.180
 adding that for me the best 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:20.460
 books to make this berto combat 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:24.450
 currently the m40 to 5 and 98 to civil 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.340
 the magnum is 96 to 1 and cs5 when 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.770
 they consider it lousy in the progressive I 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.540
 always look for the second option to enter 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.800
 in some armor and is fighting with 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.800
 he's until now just pass 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.930
 that the third option that is 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.450
 change the class to use another type of album 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.950
 rifle machine gun is important 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.660
 remember that the snowstorm lasts a few 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.730
 minutes and after that the weather is 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.680
 less aggressive and the visibility of the map 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.550
 back to match at start of match 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.140
 works 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.910
 Good people, I hope this video is 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.590
 useful for you when countering this 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.750
 map and that these positions are 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.860
 advantage over those of the company 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.600
 enemies of beauty 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.970
 If you can apply it on I like sharing 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.660
 video soon back a strong hug 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.660
 and see you there
