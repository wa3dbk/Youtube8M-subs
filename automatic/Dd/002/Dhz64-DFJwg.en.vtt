00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.840

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.400
add sugar onto it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.640
and mix a little in this way

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.640
and mix them nicely

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.800

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.560
we place the cooker into medium fire

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.080
and cook until it becomes honeycombed

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.640
as you see our dessert became honeycombed

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.720

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.120
and we will divide to bowls

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.920
