 employees of an integration project 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.569

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.909

 on top so these people are working 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.180
 with us for an average of 12 months and 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.740
 then they are redirected to the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.600

 in a transport company so I 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.830
 know what a coach is and I know 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.710
 also that it is extremely rare in 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.050
 France that owners or 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.760

 formerly of France they are the ones who are 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.560
 the origin of this collection absolutely 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.090
 so we are 240 members at 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.580
 old coach of France including a 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.620
 twenty comes on the Saturday worked 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.540
 volunteering to restore the 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.220
 coaches with the employees of 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.870
 mobile insertion site ex it is 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.760
 What this schoolmates with plans 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.500
 period we were working Bones 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.630
 so vintage plans there are more 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.210
 Bones are we made photos and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.140
 reconstructed exactly the same the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.140
 vehicle as it was before 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.090
 you see it from me these coaches a 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.700
 part have already been restored michel 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.530
 cullers you are the founding president 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.560
 of old coaches of France how many 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.250
 all because here we have here already more than 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.080
 35 vehicles waiting for renovation on 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.700
 double that number is waiting for us in 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.440
 all the France of many 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.730
 owners challenges to save 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.310
 their last vehicle they have them 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.110
 same often wanted to renovate and have 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.610
 never had the time or the means and 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.050
 before it goes to scrap and 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.819
 before generations change too 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.890
 because generations succeed one another 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.440
 we are challenged a lot for us 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.840
 entrust the vehicles that these elders 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.410
 coaches often want to see 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.030
 preserve 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.470
 this is a twelfth life that you 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.760
 lends them a second life if they 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.190
 sleep millions of kilometers 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.450
 carried millions of passengers from 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.910
 memories full of the head 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.459
 it's really our past to us all 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.410
 since all of us are we 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.090
 have been to school or college in 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.220
 holidays in summer camps in 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.650
 these vehicles there which represents a 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.440
 fantastic heritage and that we have 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.090
 decided we to revamp because 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.350
 that nobody for the moment apart 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.290
 some private collectors 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.110
 the sound was concerned why is it still 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.269
 for now at the shelter of the general public 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.040
 eyes of the general public 1 we have 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.930
 need visibility you are there 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.340
 today you help us by name 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.230
 speaking of us in these terms 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.880
 since we are trying 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.890
 to acquire the building that does not 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.390
 does not belong to us yet 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.610
 will then ask to create 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.810
 various activities here on the site 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.030
 since we have eight thousand meters 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
 squares available there will be a local 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.810
 exhibition for his coaches puts in 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.030
 before well before that there will be local 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.690
 to store the vehicles waiting for 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.310
 renovation of the workshops of the premises on 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.600
 may also store 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.130
 collection vehicles is to say if 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.350
 you have a vintage car 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.209
 or any vehicle whatever it is the little 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.829
 town and in a few weeks or in 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.530
 a few months let's say the store at 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.780
 we at the brigade and guarding etc 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.019
 it was important to you that these 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.720
 coaches is also restored by 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.260
 people looking for work by this building site 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.090
 insertion 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.470
 the integration project is important 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.820
 capital for us because we 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.460
 inscribe we should really in 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.760
 a social view of preserving activity 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.650
 heritage is good 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.360
 restore coaches it's really 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.550
 to expose is good but the social side 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.200
 worry about it from the start and we 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.490
 have today in a construction site 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.410
