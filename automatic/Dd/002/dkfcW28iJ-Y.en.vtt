00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
so now we're here in a profile view and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.910 
so now we're here in a profile view and
usually<00:03:33.850> without<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.780> wave<00:03:34.959> on<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.650> or<00:03:35.800> the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
usually without the wave on it or the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.640 
usually without the wave on it or the
modification<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.910> would<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.810> take<00:03:38.500> my

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
modification on it I would just take my

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.949 
modification on it I would just take my
necks<00:03:38.830> out<00:03:38.950> like<00:03:39.130> this<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.550> then<00:03:39.790> use<00:03:40.660> middle

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
necks out like this and then use middle

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.390 
necks out like this and then use middle
finger<00:03:41.200> deployment<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:42.700> flick<00:03:42.880> it<00:03:42.910> open<00:03:44.400> but

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
finger deployment to flick it open but

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.479 
finger deployment to flick it open but
now<00:03:45.550> with<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.090> modification<00:03:47.050> on<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.340> put

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.690 
it in your pocket back it up over here
when<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.760> pull<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.060> out<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:54.190> might<00:03:54.370> take<00:03:54.550> me<00:03:54.640> a

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
when you pull it out it might take me a

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.070 
when you pull it out it might take me a
couple<00:03:54.760> tries<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.269> get<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.480> right<00:03:55.720> since<00:03:55.989> I
