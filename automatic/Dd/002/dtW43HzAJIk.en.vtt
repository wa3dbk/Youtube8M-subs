00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.430
 hello I'm here with a new review 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.500
 and in this video I will be talking about 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.929
 attack of the titans and I will review two 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.300
 tomos in this video that is the tome 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.409
 number 5 and volume number 6 out there to the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.179
 date on which I am uploading this 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.890
 video I'm a little behind in terms of 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.989
 the reviews so that's why I'm 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.819
 making these two volumes that you already have 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.589
 time they left but good until the 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:30.409
 date 6 is the last one that has come out on 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.970
 7 is delayed a little in this month of May 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.770
 Well, I'm going to be talking about these two 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.940
 tomes of which the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.440
 true 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.510
 from now on I say it I did not find any 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.970
 error in these two sleeves simply 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.950
 I'm going to talk about its quality and maybe 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.380
 a little history to mention 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.720
 something so if you found a 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.250
 error in either of the two volumes already 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.230
 you know there's degenerated down in the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.150
 comments or if not then send it 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.130
 directly to panini remember that what 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.950
 What we are looking for is to help them improve 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.540
 a little bit in these situations even though 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.130
 I repeat I did not find any and I 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.079
 it seems that attack of the titans is a 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.239
 manga that are taking care of the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.950
 more care that comes out and that we get 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.380
 and I like that a lot since this manga 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.229
 pretty and I'll start with the tome 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.090
 number 5 here is the cover the spine and 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.219
 the back cover everything pretty well in 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.590
 this tome I repeat no error the 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.030
 equal content everything is fine the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.700
 leaf remains the same as they had 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.679
 been using in the as before and in 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.509
 other panini sleeves and printing 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.429
 also pretty good no problems 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.860
 in print at least in my tome I 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.229
 not notice any problems printing the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.969
 dark tones look pretty good and 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.679
 good if a change that there was simply 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.630
 for those who would like to know 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.789
 it was in the thickness of the pasta I remember 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.220
 that in the review of volume number 4 I said 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.610
 that it seemed to me that the pastas had a 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.829
 thickness greater than previous volumes and good 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.259
 yes it was and already in this volume number 5 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.569
 they go back to what is the thickness 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.149
 normal we say not so thick that 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.920
 they use is quite flexible that this 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.509
 good affects for nothing in the manga 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.789
 I repeat simply I say it in case to 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.979
 someone gets interested and because in 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.360
 the tome number 6 there is a change and 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.399
 good if you are following this manga and 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.829
 it had seemed a bit boring 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.810
 the previous tone I recommend you in 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.580
 serious that you follow this volume number 5 if it is 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.350
 that these dates do not buy yet 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.970
 because about half of it is 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.760
 when it gets pretty good 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.040
 I like this story a lot 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.640
 manga and from the middle of this 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.430
 I take a number 5 starts the best 'and goes 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.730
 to last several volumes so seriously 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.080
 It's pretty cool and I recommend that 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.510
 that if they have not bought this volume what 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.190
 buy because it gets pretty good at 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.360
 this attack of the Titans as number 5 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.640
 I will give you a rating of 4 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.560
 stars and average pretty good no 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.150
 problem and now we're going to move on to 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.510
 I take number 6 there are no 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.670
 problem here there was a change in quality 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.920
 as for the thickness of the pastes as 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.140
 I already said volume number 5 are 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.150
 delgaditas in this volume number 6 and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.860
 they use what are the most 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.260
 thick we were seeing in wampis 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.330
 already in other sleeves that also used and 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.240
 also what I liked the most was that there was 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.120
 a sheet change to a smoother sheet 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.440
 for me this type of sheet I like more and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.360
 it looks like the sheet they used in the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.520
 I take number 1 that I liked a lot 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.770
 the printing also no problem the 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.870
 print looks pretty good in this 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.240
 I take at least I was taken I do not have 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.420
 no complaint in both volumes what is 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.620
 the translation is pretty good too 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.540
 I repeat at least I did not find any 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.700
 mistake or it will be that I got really excited 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.770
 reading them and that's why I did not find anything and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.510
 good if this volume number 6 is loaded 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.510
 of action and a lot of things 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.940
 interesting that in one sitting you read it 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.010
 leaves you wanting more leave with desire 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.860
 already have volume number 7 in both 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.010
 tomos we have here an extra that is 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.630
 a false advance of the following volume 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.430
 well the only situation here is that 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.090
 this advance seems to be that it came out 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.890
 printed a little faint but nothing the other 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.640
 mold the truth as is the false advance 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.250
 I do not care and here's the advance 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.500
 real tone number 7 printed pretty 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.900
 well there is no problem 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.770
 also volume number 5 brings here a 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.080
 false advance and here is the real breakthrough 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.370
 of tone number 6 so good then 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.890
 this volume number 6 I really liked the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.209
 quality they used I repeat this sheet that 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.180
 it was changed I like it a lot simply 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.790
 by personal question sincerely in 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.570
 this time that I have not done so many 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.720
 reviews 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.580
 and without buying so much manga the truth already 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.710
 It gives me a little bit of the same leaf that brings 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.840
 because definitely what matters is 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.000
 read the manga and enjoy the story and 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.230
 well yes it's well printed that's what 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.480
 that it does matter if it is well printed 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.300
 but I think I'll keep wanting 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.430
 quite that they use this sheet I hope that 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.220
 in the next volume I still put it 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.200
 I really like this sheet so attack 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.630
 of the titans I take number 6 I'm going to 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.930
 give 5 stars because for me this 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.300
 quality that they used in this manga 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.760
 it's worth the 69 completely worth 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.400
 we do not remember if in some video or in 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.110
 somewhere I said that if I could go back to 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.420
 review the as number one also 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.610
 released five stars because that 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.160
 quality I liked quite only that 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.400
 I had some rare standards there 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.020
 at that time but I repeat then this 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.210
 quality I quite like this quality 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.490
 I feel that it is completely worth 69 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.950
 weights and more when it comes with zero 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.230
 errors that according to me this manga comes 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.850
 with zero errors so it puts only the 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.009
 highest rating and I think it's the 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.439
 first time I read a manga 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.360
 I give this rating so because 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.159
 pretty good the work that panini did 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.900
 in that volume number 6 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.240
 also this volume number 5 but good the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.699
 rating here if I base my taste 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.369
 for the quality of the sheet is simply 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.839
 that is why you will say that you think 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:49.210
 to you maybe you give this one 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:52.149
 three stars or I do not know how to say 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.680
 something and well this was the attack review 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:55.270
 of the Titans as number 5 and as 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.399
 number six I hope it was your 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.379
 please remember anything leave it 

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.759
