was an early release in the line so he

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.090 
was an early release in the line so he

doesn't quite have the sophisticated
body<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:45.150> uh<00:02:46.430> later<00:02:47.430> releases<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.269> he's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
body that uh later releases have he's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.290

also really big he's incredibly large
and<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:55.590> keep<00:02:55.920> him<00:02:56.190> looking<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.970> ox
