a loss is really disappointing usually
because<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.369> feels<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.789> you've<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:29.970> spent

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
like why isn't planetside 2 you can die

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.130 
like why isn't planetside 2 you can die
over<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.059> over<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.450> over<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.719> over<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.020> over

over and over and over and over and over
again<00:00:43.379> without<00:00:44.070> making<00:00:44.520> any<00:00:44.670> progress<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
again without making any progress and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450 
again without making any progress and
for<00:00:45.539> most<00:00:45.719> people<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.070> low<00:00:47.250> low

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460

for most people that's a really low low
as<00:00:47.610> well<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.480> makes<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.840> want<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> log<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.559> for

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
as well it makes you want to log out for
a<00:00:49.800> while<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.010> hopefully<00:00:50.760> you'll<00:00:51.120> come<00:00:51.149> back

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
really good to go on a long frantic kill

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
really good to go on a long frantic kill
streak<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.960> feels<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.320> good<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and blow it up knowing that you just did

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
and blow it up knowing that you just did
something<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.729> important<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.450> change<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
something very important to change the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.830 
something very important to change the
fight<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.520> least<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:12.000> opinion<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.540> game

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
fight so at least in my opinion a game

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
fight so at least in my opinion a game
like<00:01:12.990> planetside<00:01:13.439> 2<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.799> both<00:01:14.010> high<00:01:14.280> highs

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
like planetside 2 has both high highs

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.690 
like planetside 2 has both high highs
and<00:01:14.610> low<00:01:15.600> lows<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:16.979> imagine<00:01:17.100> from

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and low lows and as you can imagine from

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.490 
and low lows and as you can imagine from
a<00:01:17.820> game<00:01:17.970> developer<00:01:18.450> standpoint<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.320> good

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
a game developer standpoint it's a good

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
a game developer standpoint it's a good
idea<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.830> try<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.189> minimize<00:01:20.460> these<00:01:20.909> lows<00:01:21.180> as

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
idea to try to minimize these lows as

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.539 
idea to try to minimize these lows as
much<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.080> possible<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:23.189> where<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
much as possible and that's where the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
much as possible and that's where the
concept<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:24.060> making<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> loss<00:01:24.780> feel<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> win

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
concept of making a loss feel like a win

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.520 
concept of making a loss feel like a win
comes<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.549> play<00:01:26.930> titanfall<00:01:27.930> felt<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.500> a

comes into play titanfall felt like a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.620 
comes into play titanfall felt like a
pretty<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.920> example<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.790> your<00:01:30.360> team

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
pretty good example of this if your team

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
pretty good example of this if your team
ended<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.079> losing<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> match<00:01:31.740> you'd<00:01:32.340> still

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
ended up losing the match you'd still

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
ended up losing the match you'd still
get<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> chance<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.299> redeem<00:01:33.450> yourself<00:01:34.049> by

frustrating loss if you want a much
simpler<00:01:56.850> example<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.439> way

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
simpler example just think back way way

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.319 
simpler example just think back way way
back<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> Tony<00:01:59.610> Hawk<00:01:59.759> games<00:02:00.090> were

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
pretty big on PlayStation and whatnot if

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.490 
pretty big on PlayStation and whatnot if
you<00:02:02.880> completely<00:02:03.210> bombed<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:03.780> run<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.350> could

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you completely bombed or run you could

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
you completely bombed or run you could
just<00:02:04.770> restart<00:02:05.399> instantly<00:02:06.180> no<00:02:06.479> length<00:02:06.689> the

for<00:02:09.330> quitting<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.319> pause<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.739> game<00:02:10.770> you

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099

and this is kind of a bigger deal than

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.080 
and this is kind of a bigger deal than
you<00:02:14.550> might<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:15.360> waiting<00:02:15.980> sucks

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
you might think because waiting sucks

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
you might think because waiting sucks
when<00:02:18.090> you're<00:02:18.240> waiting<00:02:18.540> you're<00:02:18.690> not<00:02:18.870> playing

enjoying the game which should be the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.490 
enjoying the game which should be the
core<00:02:22.740> experience<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.459> most<00:02:23.640> people<00:02:24.090> in

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
competitive matches it's a little bit

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.740 
competitive matches it's a little bit

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
technically playing the game if you

it's<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.440> exactly<00:03:22.620> an<00:03:23.100> engaging<00:03:23.549> experience

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
to respawn some idea is probably better

way toward mitigating the punishment of

way toward mitigating the punishment of
death<00:04:04.320> but<00:04:05.100> you'd<00:04:05.250> also<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.700> buff

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
death but you'd also have to buff

death but you'd also have to buff
vehicles<00:04:06.570> or<00:04:06.930> lower<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.320> amount<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.739> damage

basically make up for the increase in
infantry<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.140> field<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:14.100> would<00:04:14.220> also<00:04:14.340> be

infantry on the field it would also be

turning<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.080> wrong<00:05:03.289> corner<00:05:03.970> but<00:05:04.970> maybe<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
turning the wrong corner but maybe the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.430 
turning the wrong corner but maybe the

change doesn't need to come from the
gameplay<00:05:06.770> itself<00:05:07.039> maybe<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.669> could<00:05:08.000> just<00:05:08.330> come

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
gameplay itself maybe it could just come

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.540

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
from the reward system if you look at

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.309 
from the reward system if you look at
the<00:05:10.610> death<00:05:10.789> screen<00:05:11.090> for<00:05:11.300> example<00:05:11.360> it's<00:05:11.870> shiny

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
the death screen for example it's shiny

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.290 
the death screen for example it's shiny
it's<00:05:12.680> attractive<00:05:13.220> but<00:05:13.789> I<00:05:13.819> know<00:05:13.940> that<00:05:14.210> it

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
it's attractive but I know that it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.909 
it's attractive but I know that it
personally<00:05:14.900> doesn't<00:05:15.110> make<00:05:15.319> me<00:05:15.470> feel<00:05:15.680> any

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919

extra<00:05:42.319> experience<00:05:42.620> on<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:42.979> low<00:05:43.130> end<00:05:43.310> or<00:05:43.490> maybe

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
extra experience on the low end or maybe

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.360 
extra experience on the low end or maybe
a<00:05:44.150> tier<00:05:44.479> 1<00:05:44.509> implant<00:05:45.139> on<00:05:45.289> the<00:05:45.319> high<00:05:45.560> end<00:05:45.590> and

a tier 1 implant on the high end and
basically<00:05:46.849> something<00:05:47.210> that<00:05:47.419> takes<00:05:47.599> your<00:05:47.750> mind

off of the frustration of getting rekt

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.610 
off of the frustration of getting rekt
and<00:05:49.969> actually<00:05:50.810> gives<00:05:50.990> you<00:05:51.110> something<00:05:51.349> you

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
and actually gives you something you

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.140 
and actually gives you something you
might<00:05:51.740> be<00:05:51.800> able<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.099> use<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.849> make<00:05:52.969> some

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
might be able to use to make some

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.089 
might be able to use to make some
progress<00:05:53.360> with<00:05:53.750> your<00:05:53.870> character<00:05:54.319> at<00:05:54.560> the

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
progress with your character at the

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.680 
progress with your character at the
lower<00:05:55.250> ranks<00:05:55.610> this<00:05:55.699> would<00:05:55.849> be<00:05:55.969> more<00:05:56.150> impactful

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
lower ranks this would be more impactful

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.540 
lower ranks this would be more impactful
to<00:05:56.750> your<00:05:57.020> characters<00:05:57.319> development<00:05:57.889> and<00:05:58.069> at

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
to your characters development and at

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.830 
to your characters development and at
the<00:05:58.639> higher<00:05:58.849> ranks<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.389> would<00:05:59.509> just<00:05:59.719> be

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
the higher ranks it would just be

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.420 
the higher ranks it would just be
something<00:05:59.990> neat<00:06:00.380> that<00:06:00.680> happened<00:06:01.069> every<00:06:01.250> once

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430

who<00:06:16.069> are<00:06:16.159> out<00:06:16.340> popped<00:06:16.610> at<00:06:16.759> a<00:06:16.789> base<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.750> redeploy

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
who are out popped at a base to redeploy

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.080 
who are out popped at a base to redeploy
to<00:06:18.319> the<00:06:18.409> next<00:06:18.620> one<00:06:18.770> in<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:18.979> lattice<00:06:19.310> and<00:06:19.520> set

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
to the next one in the lattice and set

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.420 
to the next one in the lattice and set
up<00:06:20.180> a<00:06:20.240> defense<00:06:20.599> maybe<00:06:21.560> if<00:06:21.919> you're<00:06:22.130> extremely

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
up a defense maybe if you're extremely

up a defense maybe if you're extremely
out<00:06:22.849> popped<00:06:23.120> there<00:06:23.690> is<00:06:23.810> a<00:06:23.840> console<00:06:24.349> or<00:06:24.529> a

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
out popped there is a console or a

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
teleporter in the spawn room that will

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.730 
teleporter in the spawn room that will
let<00:06:26.150> you<00:06:26.270> instantly<00:06:26.750> redeploy<00:06:27.259> to<00:06:27.409> the<00:06:27.440> next

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
base in the lattice or maybe it's a

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.790 
base in the lattice or maybe it's a
little<00:06:29.719> bit<00:06:29.960> more<00:06:30.050> intuitive<00:06:30.289> than<00:06:30.650> that

little bit more intuitive than that

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.040 
little bit more intuitive than that
maybe<00:06:31.039> the<00:06:31.250> emission<00:06:31.550> system<00:06:31.940> notices<00:06:32.479> that

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
maybe the emission system notices that

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.269 
maybe the emission system notices that
you're<00:06:33.199> out<00:06:33.349> popped<00:06:33.620> and<00:06:33.830> then<00:06:33.919> instantly

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
you're out popped and then instantly

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.120 
you're out popped and then instantly
sets<00:06:34.699> your<00:06:34.880> mission<00:06:35.270> to<00:06:35.899> use<00:06:36.199> that<00:06:36.440> console<00:06:36.919> or

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
sets your mission to use that console or

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.830 
sets your mission to use that console or
to<00:06:37.250> use<00:06:37.460> that<00:06:37.639> teleporter<00:06:38.210> and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
to use that teleporter and

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.260 
to use that teleporter and

question<00:06:41.660> to<00:06:41.870> you<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:42.080> what<00:06:42.860> creates<00:06:43.280> your

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
lows not just in planetside 2 but any

game you want and what do you think it
could<00:06:48.110> make<00:06:48.290> those<00:06:48.500> lows<00:06:48.800> better<00:06:49.310> and<00:06:49.610> also<00:06:50.330> do

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
could make those lows better and also do

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.330 
could make those lows better and also do
so<00:06:50.780> without<00:06:51.110> directly<00:06:51.560> harming<00:06:52.070> someone
