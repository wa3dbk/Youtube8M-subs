00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:09.780
 disassembly of the lens ka-50 14 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.000
 disassembly may be necessary for 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 various goals let's say I understand 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.600
 when the lens of the shooting gallery Islands stozhku well 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 this is the main purpose of disassembly 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.939
 some other things let's say these 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.260
 lenses often focusing system 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:34.260
 getting loose and people in different ways 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.200
 try to eliminate these elevators so I 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.390
 decided to record a video how to make out 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.149
 elect to play the lens you need 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.250
 unleash 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.960
 two cogs of the floor fixing 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.079
 contacts 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.079
 first thing 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.320
 Next you need to focus the lens on 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.850
 close focusing distance and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.060
 make contact inside the lens 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:19.110
 so as not to interfere now need to pick up 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:25.620
 for the stub and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.060
 Pirivet extract sandrov just izhitsa 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.250
 Next you need to take a toothpick or 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.760
 some other subject which is not allowed 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.979
 scratch plastics and this bookmark 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.330
 decorative with a switch to tear off 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:48.610
 she stuck a fairy 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:52.680
 on sticky you stayed here possible 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 The situation when he will remain here and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
 Next you need to unleash this screw 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.630
 remove and you choose a metal disk 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:18.040
 sata now focus lens on 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:20.170
 infinity and take off the other part in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.070
 principle is enough to 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.620
 dissolve and lens bet but if 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.150
 objectively analyze only some goals 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:38.040
 In principle, this can be done about 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:45.280
 represented by a screwdriver convolution love 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 The lens here is a retainer who does not 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.420
 fix the latch that connects 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.790
 lens blocks along with the retainer of this 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.270
 I do not have because the last disassembly is not 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.920
 began to set to record video and 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.010
 here here is the same pixa 3 over 100 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.170
 also no he needs to be neat he 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.370
 fastened with lacquer it needs to be flat 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.450
 screwdriver gently peeking 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:13.540
 look get everything out now 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:20.880
 let the blockade two clamps removed post 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.880
 screwdriver a little more find that gap and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.489
 Well bought for blocks now lens 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.790
 maximally dismantled in principle be 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.160
 more and doctors pick well this is probably 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.760
 already do not need to consider and actually 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.709
 not to climb because you teach the codes if the dust 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.280
 can that not be damaged can also be 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.560
 to harm 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.420
 switch diaphragm detail 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.150
 manifested 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.540
 sensor that the diaphragm closes and in 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.340
 the lens 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.709
 direction ever climb him on 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.840
 1 person online I climbed and after 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.440
 this his camera began to show 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.299
 diaphragm error 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.880
 Well, in principle , so here it is considered 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:20.250
 disassembly-assembly completely in reverse 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:20.250
 ok, go to the website below the video 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.760
 there are links to my site 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.229
 I'm talking about this lens if I write something 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.539
 I will add links in the video description 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.900
 but if I write some articles in 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.340
 they will be described in more detail as 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.300
 solve some specific problems 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.160
 which are associated with this lens 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.130
 video link can go to my 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.130
 site and hard i write about the lens
