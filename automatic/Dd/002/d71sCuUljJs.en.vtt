00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
fell away in terms of form and then we

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.870 
fell away in terms of form and then we
had<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:24.019> difficult<00:00:25.250> experience<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.400> being

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
had the difficult experience of being

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.259 
had the difficult experience of being
knocked<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.500> pretty<00:00:29.099> cruel<00:00:29.699> fashion<00:00:30.150> in

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
knocked out in a pretty cruel fashion in

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:40.360 
knocked out in a pretty cruel fashion in
the<00:00:30.330> playoffs

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.070 

we've<00:00:41.370> made<00:00:41.520> more<00:00:41.940> monitor<00:00:42.420> additions<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
we've made more monitor additions that

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.040 
we've made more monitor additions that
have<00:00:43.350> brought<00:00:43.820> different<00:00:44.820> qualities<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
have brought different qualities to the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.030 
have brought different qualities to the
squad<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.410> year<00:00:46.560> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.740> we've<00:00:46.950> probably

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
squad this year I think we've probably

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040 
squad this year I think we've probably
got<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.630> got<00:00:48.840> more

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
got more what we have got more

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.530 
got more what we have got more
experience<00:00:49.410> we've<00:00:50.070> got<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.060> likes<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.330> Dean

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
experience we've got the likes of Dean

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.600 
experience we've got the likes of Dean
Hammond<00:00:51.900> in<00:00:52.080> and<00:00:52.380> obviously<00:00:52.680> kev<00:00:53.100> phillips<00:00:53.460> as

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Hammond in and obviously kev phillips as

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.660 
Hammond in and obviously kev phillips as
well<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.180> those<00:00:54.900> those<00:00:55.739> sorts<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.250> players<00:00:56.550> i

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
well and those those sorts of players i

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.410 
well and those those sorts of players i
think<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.470> added<00:00:58.489> very<00:00:59.489> much<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> mix<00:01:00.150> i

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
think have added very much to the mix i

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
think have added very much to the mix i
think<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> chemistry<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.320> better<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think the chemistry is better and the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.040 
think the chemistry is better and the
balance<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> squad<00:01:03.150> is<00:01:03.270> probably<00:01:03.660> better

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
balance of the squad is probably better

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.380 
balance of the squad is probably better
this<00:01:04.290> year<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> players<00:01:06.090> who

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this year and the players who

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.130 
this year and the players who
experienced<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.410> they<00:01:07.440> did<00:01:07.740> last<00:01:07.979> year<00:01:08.130> i

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
experienced what they did last year i

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.830 
experienced what they did last year i
think<00:01:10.280> one<00:01:11.280> should<00:01:11.940> be<00:01:11.970> enjoying<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> season

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
think one should be enjoying the season

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.290 
think one should be enjoying the season
did<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.040> about<00:01:14.250> yourself<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
did you have to think about yourself and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.120 
did you have to think about yourself and
whether<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.720> were<00:01:15.840> ready<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:17.009> at

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
whether you were ready to go again at

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
whether you were ready to go again at
this<00:01:17.220> club<00:01:17.490> yeah<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> always<00:01:18.300> did<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.780> always<00:01:19.110> do

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
this club yeah I always did I always do

this club yeah I always did I always do
every<00:01:19.350> year<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.830> exactly<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
every year do exactly the same thing you

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.570 
every year do exactly the same thing you
have<00:01:20.910> to<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.600> honest<00:01:21.899> enough<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.740> decide

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
have to be honest enough to to decide

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120 
have to be honest enough to to decide
where<00:01:24.390> you're<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.750> yourself<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> how<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
where you're at yourself and how you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.380 
where you're at yourself and how you
want<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.430> move<00:01:26.580> forward<00:01:26.910> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.240> that's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
want to move forward I think that's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.280 
want to move forward I think that's
normal

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
normal

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350

reflective process of people goes I

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.060

think<00:01:30.780> ultimately<00:01:30.899> for<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> manager<00:01:32.040> like

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
think ultimately for a manager like

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.180 
think ultimately for a manager like
myself<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.210> know<00:01:33.330> an<00:01:33.840> English<00:01:34.200> manager<00:01:34.649> the

myself you know an English manager the
best<00:01:35.460> chance<00:01:35.850> you've<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.450> managing<00:01:36.869> in

the<00:01:37.080> Premier<00:01:37.649> League<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.039> take<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.610> sign<00:01:38.910> up

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
the Premier League is to take a sign up

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.270 
the Premier League is to take a sign up
the<00:01:40.330> club<00:01:40.570> should<00:01:40.720> move<00:01:40.870> forward

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the club should move forward

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.680 
the club should move forward
significantly<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.550> there's<00:01:43.180> an<00:01:43.270> awful<00:01:43.660> lot

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
significantly and there's an awful lot

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.630 
significantly and there's an awful lot
of<00:01:43.900> progress<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.350> terms<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.950> the

of progress in terms of the

club is better suited to deal with
whatever<00:01:50.830> comes<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.460> future<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.030> have

whatever comes in the future so we have

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.000 
whatever comes in the future so we have
owners<00:01:52.720> who<00:01:52.930> have<00:01:53.470> been<00:01:53.650> very<00:01:53.800> supportive

with me people always want to know how
many<00:01:57.730> times<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.120> talk<00:01:58.300> to<00:01:58.420> them<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:58.690> we<00:01:58.810> don't

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
many times I talk to them and we don't

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.540 
many times I talk to them and we don't

it's<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.170> bit<00:02:50.349> yeah<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.370> am<00:02:51.670> Bertie's<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.840> have

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
it's a bit yeah I am Bertie's you have

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.449 
it's a bit yeah I am Bertie's you have
to<00:02:53.080> be<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> bit<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> masochist<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.099> think<00:02:54.280> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
to be a bit of a masochist I think to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.280 
to be a bit of a masochist I think to
enjoy<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.150> management<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.750> probably<00:02:56.080> brings

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
enjoy and management it probably brings

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.229 
enjoy and management it probably brings
the<00:02:56.380> worst<00:02:56.560> out<00:02:56.860> in<00:02:56.890> there<00:02:57.160> as<00:02:57.220> well<00:02:57.400> but

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
the worst out in there as well but

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.670 
the worst out in there as well but
that's<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.810> part<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.110> parcel<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.500> it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
that's just a part and parcel of it

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.240 
that's just a part and parcel of it
ultimately<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.989> think<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.290> driving<00:03:02.560> force<00:03:02.980> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
ultimately I think the driving force is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.370 
ultimately I think the driving force is
to<00:03:04.090> try<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.390> achieve<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.750> success<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.140> we

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
to try and achieve the success that we

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.650 
to try and achieve the success that we
set<00:03:05.770> out<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.489> get<00:03:06.610> promotion<00:03:06.940> I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.800 

think<00:03:10.660> he<00:03:10.720> almost<00:03:11.019> cracked<00:03:11.290> smile<00:03:11.560> there
