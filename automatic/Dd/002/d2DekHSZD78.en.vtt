howling abyss only option as I was

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.120 
howling abyss only option as I was

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
decent options here and I do think that

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.330 
decent options here and I do think that
rat<00:05:09.600> has<00:05:09.840> done<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.050> great<00:05:10.350> job<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:10.590> making<00:05:10.980> most
