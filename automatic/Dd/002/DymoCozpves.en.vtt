00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.340
 Hello everyone today, I will make this video 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.070
 we asked to make a video how to remove 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.750
 After painting there is rubbish 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.970
 Such awesome option for 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.129
 experiment and more precisely for indicative 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:41.650
 video we all painted the car racks and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:44.890
 as you can see here these freaks have all become 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.559
 sides of cancer up let's say 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:52.010
 imagine that this is garbage 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.090
 let small chaotic but trash like us 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.260
 we will fight him 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.550
 Now I will continue to show everything 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.820
 working principle there even with large 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.070
 trash can which are bigger all the same 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:10.729
 it's about saying simple everyone is available without 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.140
 any extra equipment that 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.520
 too much without any extra 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.160
 equipment 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.880
 hands and skills and nothing more 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.630
 we need for this we need 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 need block 2000 abrasive but here 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:32.990
 but not visible here you can see the block above 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.400
 Vodichki accordingly you can play 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:43.220
 you 600 pshikat and start the whole thing 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.830
 overwrite if you have smudges then you need to take 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.780
 block the harder subject than in the general 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.450
 principle is tougher than better than 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.159
 would in principle we need a piece of wood 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.710
 inside the thigh she is such people you slept about 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.930
 school here sandpaper rubbed 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.189
 than quickly therefore it is better to take to he 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.259
 plastic such rubber cleaning will not go 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.019
 as if for such things but they will go but 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:16.010
 for such garbage but for smudges not and 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:17.989
 lock the whole thing is all I clobbered 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.329
 all the comfort will not show on video 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.770
 show only part of the video turned out 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:30.160
 short informative and helpful later 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.750
 several people asked to insert a link 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.940
 in the description where I polish them completely cars 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.940
 dark colored under the sandpaper 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.190
 it is also possible for such things to use 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.220
 there are three for 2 thousand but the ghost is worth 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.190
 not cheap immediately tell you 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.800
 therefore, I will show with available tools how 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:00.040
 do everything now 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.380
 wipe i will dry show on here 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.120
 dotiraem 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.510
 there you can see now show now this 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.760
 half i will erase well here leave 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.850
 could be seen on holiday until what time 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.910
 on twitter this effect gives 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.070
 painting freak ugly stand up 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:24.130
 we didnâ€™t even paint a bush 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:28.090
 small 0 4 0 04 it is a pancake disaster 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.570
 In general, many advise you this is not 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.570
 topic already 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.930
 but now it dries and 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.980
 I'll show you how and what you can see 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.110
 here there are no pimples here they are 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.770
 these glimpses need it now 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.910
 vyshkurivat as if all that's visible to the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.220
 box office pimples 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.459
 Imagine that this is garbage they flute 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.680
 and whether you tower all this 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:05.010
 homogeneous state everything and we will 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.080
 polishing the process of taking it off all 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.910
 everything is very simple by the way in the description 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.640
 reference insert how to remove flowed from 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.550
 I have a video for some reason be married 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.230
 he is simply old nobody sees him as 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:25.790
 very useful video 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.790
 but take the polishing paste 3m number 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:41.950
 number 1 the cap is not scratched with these 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.820
 there wrote plastic earned 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.270
 yellow circle 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.270
 you eat 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.030
 they 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.310
 and 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:33.910
 Well, somehow it all turns out myself 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.910
 goal below dude 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.610
 in such a simple way you can of course 

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:49.459
 turn again 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.459
 the second number and the third number of the mouth 

00:05:50.239 --> 00:06:00.019
 execute these doom pimples 7 only 

00:05:54.989 --> 00:06:02.989
 Here so gets out in a pharmacy 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:08.219
 but the light rushed to tell you what the principle 

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:14.659
 here you can put and so do not doter 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:17.579
 somewhere here he is now rubbing erase it and 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:21.179
 here and such a state of driving here 

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:23.429
 a good example is that we have it 

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:24.289
 some scream was right who 

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:28.979
 painting 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:33.719
 but in general, I think the essence of nothing 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:36.199
 there is no difficulty in this just this fresh 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:39.529
 painted to passed somewhere around 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:45.240
 how many 12 hours after painting 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:46.679
 same around polished easily but have 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.339
 because with fresh milk you can 

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:53.779
 nakosyachit very much if there is no experience 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:56.490
 I do not want to hope I will explain everything in detail 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:59.339
 I put another reference in the description is not exactly 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.649
 forget to watch everybody good luck everybody 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:05.899
