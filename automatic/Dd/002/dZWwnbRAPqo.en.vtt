00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.800
 you want to learn how to make this elegant 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.800
 bridal bouquet we will show you 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.530
 etc 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.420
 Hi, I'm Tatiana, I like flowers 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.060
 and in this video I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.919
 this beautiful and elegant bouquet of coves 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.220
 for girlfriend you've seen at the beginning of 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:25.980
 video for it we're going to need 10 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.559
 Calas stems are pretty and elegant 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.279
 flower that is also very recurrent in the 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.279
 bridal bouquets 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.130
 to wrap our pretty bouquet 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.130
 to use 5 stems of aspidistra 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.060
 and we will also use a few 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.610
 leaves of vegetables 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.090
 once we have the elaborate bouquet 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.860
 we will give it to the raffia and we will 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.100
 finish decorating it with this pretty 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.610
 loop we start to start doing the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.370
 bouquet what we have to do is place 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 our stems of coves to different 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 heights 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.210
 as always when we work with flowers 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.939
 He explained so cylindrical ye be warned 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 they are going to turn , nothing happens, it's about going 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.130
 giving it shape that then already 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.130
 we will perfect 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.670
 and little by little calculating 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.799
 we are placing them and I have everything 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.079
 placed to my liking we have put them 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.360
 as I was telling you a little about staggered 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.340
 so they do not cover each other and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 Now what you have to do is put the sheets of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.220
 aspidistra for it we are going to grab with 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.080
 firmness but at the same time with care because 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.270
 are delicate stems what we have 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.679
 assembled and we're going to put the sheet of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.679
 aspidistra here behind 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.979
 carefully 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.890
 we put it over the top 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.940
 the scales and then we take two others and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.510
 we put them ahead 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.510
 here 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.310
 here 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.600
 and the other one on the other side 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.290
 so that they hug the stems of 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.760
 coves 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.550
 A) Yes 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.490
 and this is taking shape 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.290
 I in this example I'm going to use 3 if 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.840
 you make the order to I like the flowers 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.540
 you are going to receive 5 this then it is to your 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.330
 taste ok you can put the 5 or leave it 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.180
 with 3 I particularly like how 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.319
 it has stayed that way and now it's time to place the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.450
 leaves of yards 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.549
 to put the cock what I have done 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.540
 has been to separate it into 3 piles that 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.909
 are the ones that we are going to use 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.810
 and what we have to do is this 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.290
 we match 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.930
 we make a circle and the first of them 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.060
 we will place it here in the part 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.620
 front being careful not to cover the cove 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.910
 smaller that we have here just 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.370
 ahead so 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.600
 then we will finish perfecting it 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.420
 all 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.800
 the second one is going to go on a side what 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.500
 same we match 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.770
 we make 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.980
 our little circle and we put it in this 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.980
 channel 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.560
 i 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.590
 as I told you from the beginning 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.450
 now we are giving the structure to 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.460
 bouquet then we will finish placing 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.720
 each of the stems on the site 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.060
 perfect 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.850
 and we repeat the same operation with 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.170
 our third bunch of dicks and what 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:42.050
 we take it to the other side 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.050
 and now we only have to perfect 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.110
 I have already placed each one of the flowers 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.569
 exactly as I wanted and what I have 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.670
 fact is with the raffia secure and 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.239
 secure the bouquet well now simply 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.640
 we have to cut what we have left of the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.370
 raffia 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.040
 and cut the stems in this case we have 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.410
 to keep in mind that it's going to be a bouquet 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.780
 Long girlfriend is saying the girlfriend is going to 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.610
 carry like this and he's going to take it 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.910
 then we can not rush at the time of 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.910
 cut 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.650
 more or less 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.650
 let's match here 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.419
 my father 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.050
 and now that we have it ready we 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.820
 is to place the loop to finish 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.730
 decorate the pretty bouquet what we're going to 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.870
 use is this loop for it what 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.290
 unscrew moss 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.660
 and at one end we doubled it 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.660
 half and that's what we're going to 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.090
 use to make a first knot 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.560
 and cover the area where we have placed the 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.560
 raffia that we are not interested to see 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:08.180
 we tie a knot and press it hard 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.180
 just above the line 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.330
 and once we've done that the only thing 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.770
 What we have left is to turn around 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.770
 same the longest lateral 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:24.590
 and he is little and in this way we are going 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.240
 Covering the stems 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.250
 there are those who like to be covered 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.410
 whole who likes to be only 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.410
 caught a little bit that to your liking 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.050
 turning and squeeze so that it is 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.050
 consistent 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.929
 I will particularly let you 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:46.699
 see a bit of the stems because to me 

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.699
 I like it but that to your liking 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:55.719
 how are we going to fix that as I said with 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.419
 the pins we have to put them 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:01.150
 so with careful and upward think 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.889
 that if we put them that way it's easy for us 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.889
 we click because they are going to come out on the other 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.779
 side and better if we take advantage of some of 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.190
 the thickest stems and we leave it 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.770
 stuck 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.510
 we set one down another in the middle 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.940
 time for example on the top 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.150
 and so we make sure not going to 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.150
 move 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.630
 and we already have our bridal bouquet 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.510
 elaborated a nice and elegant bouquet of 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.750
 long girlfriend to wear leaning on the 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.790
 coves arm now up to you 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.380
 do what you know what do you do 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.170
 you make the order I like flowers 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.330
 you will receive everything you need to 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.810
 elaborate this bouquet and as always 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.300
 we say 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.980
 animaos do it and leave us a 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.390
 Comment on what you think 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.880
 the bouquet on the technique that we have 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:53.410
 used what you want us 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.410
 we see in the next video 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.270
