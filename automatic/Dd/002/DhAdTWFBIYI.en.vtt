give it our all and hopefully will come
out<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.560> top<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.189> being<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> big<00:01:42.060> draws<00:01:42.329> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
out on top and being the big draws in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
out on top and being the big draws in
the<00:01:42.659> division<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> lot<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> teams<00:01:43.890> only

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the division for a lot of teams only

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
the division for a lot of teams only
again<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> take<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.180> bit

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
again that's going to take a little bit

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
again that's going to take a little bit
of<00:01:45.420> getting<00:01:45.570> used<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.049> man<00:01:46.259> yeah<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.070> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
of getting used to as man yeah but I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
of getting used to as man yeah but I
think<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.570> embrace<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> really

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
think I think you go embrace that really

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.210 
think I think you go embrace that really
and<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:51.409> we<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.439> where<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.890> and

and you know we are where we are and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
and you know we are where we are and
that's<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> way<00:01:53.820> isn't<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.509> people<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that's the way isn't if people think of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
that's the way isn't if people think of
this<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.649> favor<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.189> all<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> big<00:01:56.640> game<00:01:56.880> of
