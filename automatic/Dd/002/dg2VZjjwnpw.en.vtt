it's not rounded on each side or this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
it's not rounded on each side or this
doesn't<00:01:07.500> read<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.340> until<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> gets<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
doesn't read as much until it gets to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
doesn't read as much until it gets to
the<00:01:09.570> actual<00:01:09.869> corner<00:01:10.260> doesn't<00:01:10.530> start<00:01:10.860> like

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
