 by the way in this top everything can everything 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.600
 contradict but do not look for logic 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.590
 in irrationality it's just ours 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.469
 thoughts fifth place she that 5 opens 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.750
 adder all yes yes I hurt randy orton yes

 visit the main event wrestling 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.579
 renewed randy orton face deserves 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.370
 victories in essence he still has 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.409
 there is a rematch after 30 but restlmania 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.540
 as soon as he starts talking about everything 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.520
 immediately switch the arrows and as if 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.229
 forget about everything when winning the roll 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.060

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.729
 see the orton race for the main title 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.700
 he will definitely show the next company 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.100
 great match at wrestling fourth 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.470
 place in fourth place is 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.840
 Dolph Ziegler in the first half of the past 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.119
 he didnâ€™t stand out among the others 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.140
 but then it became different he thrice 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.439
 won the intercontinental title 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.810
 champion and raised the prestige of this trophy 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.820
 in our opinion, it is Sieber who should 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.430
 win this type of tarnish giving away 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.860
 many years this company he is a special push 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.960
 never got over so long ago 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.909
 the plot is left fired this week 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.590
 he came back thanks to the wall of truth and 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.149
 death downey got an opportunity 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.890
 participate in the royal rumble match 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.320
 winning a non-title match of cores 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.540
 continental champion hit to board 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.430
 his victory as a rumble match 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.439
 and in the main event, breaking can be very 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.759
 raise the ratings that david vily in 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.150
 last time and try to do 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.110
 that's why he should and keep 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.630
 top over the other 29 springs 3 place 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.910
 our top 3 reveals itself they 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.870
 balanced superstar in insults and not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.670
 Dean Embrose 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.860
 even though it is something about ram 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 it's hard not to call him joubert and he 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.300
 always top rivals but he can't 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.640
 defeat them he still 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.020
 won a single match on ppv with 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.970
 the moment of the collapse of the account 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.070
 exactly roll the rumble match is for 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.170
 him a great opportunity to interrupt his 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.270
 shear defeats on ppv and win 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.550
 main title of the company on the main show 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.490
 of the year there were also many rumors about 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.959
 hiltern 1 and because of its frequent lesions 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.940
 but all this is just a rumor 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.040
 if he dug out the rumble will be the last 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.840
 in the ring of ati square she will win 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.910
 rollins then we will be on wrestling 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.690
 expect one of the best and unpredictable 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.490
 match on the show second place over whom 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.740
 put in first and second place we 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.930
 thought for a long time but still decided 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.940
 what exactly novels Raines should take 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.459
 second place in our top yes he has 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.840
 right now finally push but it is still far 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.850
 not the face of the company 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.950
 Wrestler, he is a little more than five 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.440
 years a relative of marriage since childhood 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.780
 that's why the legend gets the jackpot 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.910
 understandably this contributes to this 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.250
 Head of the company Vins McMen in order to 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.080
 the future he had a hay substitute but 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.820
 thanks to his acting skills and 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.190
 charisma he can't win yet 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.440
 roll slave match that's why he's on 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.810
 second place because he has a lot of chances 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.880
 but again they are not looking from the other 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.250
 side of his victory in the royal rumble match 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.380
 and subsequent battles with marriage to tyr 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.660
 can bring a lot of profit but due 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.850
 so that according to many sources 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.160
 now and lessner face most likely match 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.560
 not therefore the gift of in su still not 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.920
 win that's why he got into this 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.959
 there is first place first 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.850
 American dragon settled down 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.400
 back to the performance literally 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.470
 a couple of weeks ago daniel brian exactly 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.510
 he has the opportunity to win the royal 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.730
 rumble match and become main again 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.500
 headlining times breaking at last 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.120
 smog gave me brian defeated kane in 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.110
 match without disqualification 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.210
 it may mean that he is alone in 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.260
 the main contenders for victory i would even 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.150
 said the principal 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.430
 most likely in the end it will remain exactly 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.160
 with flight and legends as in the past year 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.350
 be defeated puddles next year 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.570
