00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 to be able to enjoy yours 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.710
 bicycle as long as possible in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.330
 this time we will talk about 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.580
 Maintenance of wear parts 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 I will show you a couple of steps that you should 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.910
 Carry out after each tour in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 bicycle so you can enjoy 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.089
 she and also to what parts should you 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.699
 pay attention and which ones should 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.590
 change regularly after a tour in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.449
 bicycle you should clean it with a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.369
 hose or with a bucket with water since 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.920
 the dirt is not dry yet and it is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.539
 easier to remove avoided at all costs 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.609
 to high-pressure cleaners because 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.130
 it is harmful to the bearings the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.780
 fork and shock absorbers if not 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760
 we have no choice but to use this type 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 of cleaner be very careful not to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.079
 apply it in any case in meetings and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 the bearings once the bicycle 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.720
 be clean you must take care of the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.540
 chain 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.700
 every time you clean the bike or you 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.980
 wet because of terrains or conditions 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.400
 wet weather is at risk 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.870
 to rust for it after each use if the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.870
 chain gets wet you have to treat it 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.950
 for this it is best to use a cloth 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.630
 to hold the chain and turn the connecting rod 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.670
 backward 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.780
 in this way we dry and clean the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.420
 chain at the same time 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.580
 if it is very muddy you can also 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.340
 clean the part guide rollers 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.700
 down 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.900
 below and above with the cloth 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.570
 it looks perfect 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.830
 You can also clean the cassette 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.490
 introducing the cloth through space 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.330
 in between and pull back 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.330
 slightly 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.230
 once done we can take a drop 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.750
 of oil to finish is important 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.170
 throw it on the inside and not on the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.170
 Exterior 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.490
 and turn several times so that the oil 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.490
 is well distributed 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.740
 finally 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.810
 cleaned the oil that over with a 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.810
 rag so that it does not reach the rim 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.680
 besides the chain you should also 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.440
 clean the running surfaces of 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.200
 the fork and the shock absorber if there 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.570
 Dry dirt or some powder coged 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.610
 a clean, dry cloth and clean 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:37.360
 together here on the piston and the same here 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.360
 in the fork 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.230
 if still dry dirt remains 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.450
 use a sponge and water better because 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.760
 if we can not leave scratches 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.069
 In addition to the advice we have seen 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.200
 You should also check the screws 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.150
 after several tours and on the other hand 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.950
 There are also other wear parts in 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.830
 the bicycles that we should not lose 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.000
 seen on one hand the brake pads 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.209
 front and rear the chain and the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 tire profile 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.530
 You should check the thickness of the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.209
 brake pads regularly for 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.519
 it does not need to disassemble is the 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.590
 wheel most of the time is enough 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.450
 inspect the brakes from behind to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.670
 can see how much pill is still left 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.739
 at the latest if a pill is in 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.599
 this state is when the thickness 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.540
 is below one millimeter is the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.920
 time to change it change the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.870
 brake pads it becomes quite 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.700
 quick for it we just have to 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.700
 disassemble the front wheel a moment 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.519
 so that with a screwdriver we loose 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.519
 the brake pinion 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.950
 then we remove the plug from 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.940
 security and we open the screws that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.940
 fix the pills 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.290
 we remove the screws 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.250
 and we take back the pills and 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.250
 the tweezers 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.979
 do you ensure that the new pads 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.959
 stay clean and have no fat and 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.790
 clean the brake discs beforehand 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.630
 brake cleaner 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.910
 and then adjust the clamps and 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.620
 put them back from the back in the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.460
 cover 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.620
 make him feel 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.620
 and we re-tighten the screws 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.460
 and place the safety pin 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.370
 as explained by ftc 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.819
 finally we re-assemble the wheel 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.819
 lead 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.340
 so you know when you should change the 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.330
 chain there are the so-called calibers of 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.070
 wear these are here inside 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.479
 when they fall completely the chain will 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.260
 will have unhooked and will have to 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.690
 change it 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.660
 when this happens the dishes of the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.520
 chain and cassette wear out before 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.410
 that's why it's better to change the chain 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.080
 before for the plates and the cassette 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.600
 last us longer to finish a 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.310
 small advice on tires already 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.080
 which is seen when they are worn or 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.780
 they have cuts in that case better 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.310
 change them to avoid breakdowns and here 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.040
 we conclude with the maintenance of 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.750
 wear parts in the last part os 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.630
 I will show you how you can optimize 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.400
 correctly your bicycle by 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.710
 example how to find the position 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.720
 correct of the saddle make the bicycle 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.090
 more ergonomic and optimize the handlebar 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.360
 on which depends that we enjoy leaving in 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.360
 bike
