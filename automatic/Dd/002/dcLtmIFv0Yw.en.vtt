see here how the water chestnuts have

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.090 
see here how the water chestnuts have
already<00:03:24.760> started<00:03:25.120> multiplying<00:03:25.600> in<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.860> root

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
already started multiplying in the root

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.480 
already started multiplying in the root
zone<00:03:27.130> each<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.480> roots<00:03:28.780> sends<00:03:29.740> out<00:03:29.920> this

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
zone each of the roots sends out this

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.060 
zone each of the roots sends out this
little<00:03:31.030> thin<00:03:31.870> thing<00:03:32.170> like<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.680> where<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
little thin thing like this where the

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.550 
little thin thing like this where the
water<00:03:33.250> chestnuts<00:03:33.760> develop<00:03:34.330> from<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.380> we're

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
water chestnuts develop from so we're

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.160 
water chestnuts develop from so we're
going<00:03:35.740> to<00:03:35.860> divide<00:03:36.490> them<00:03:36.910> up<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.090> little<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:38.020> we

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
going to divide them up a little so we

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.449 
going to divide them up a little so we
can<00:03:38.200> spread<00:03:38.740> them<00:03:39.010> out

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.190
