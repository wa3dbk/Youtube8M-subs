00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.120 
drive at 7200 RPM and on the right hand
side<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> 500<00:00:19.020> gig<00:00:19.140> hard<00:00:19.170> drive<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:20.100> is

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
side I have a 500 gig hard drive that is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220

currently<00:00:20.609> running<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.119> macbook<00:00:21.480> pro<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
currently running my macbook pro that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800 
currently running my macbook pro that
runs<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.619> 5400<00:00:23.609> rpm<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.210> wanted<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> take<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
runs a 5400 rpm I wanted to take a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.710 
runs a 5400 rpm I wanted to take a
comparison<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> two<00:00:26.599> what<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
comparison and see the two what the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.439 
comparison and see the two what the
response<00:00:28.080> times<00:00:28.320> would<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.619> between<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.070> two

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
response times would be between the two

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.860 
response times would be between the two
for<00:00:30.449> startups<00:00:31.130> running<00:00:32.130> apps<00:00:32.420> any<00:00:33.420> type<00:00:33.840> of

for startups running apps any type of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.290 
for startups running apps any type of
heat<00:00:34.530> issues<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.700> might<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.090> an

heat issues that they might have an
overall<00:00:38.210> results<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> take<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:40.920> at

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
overall results so if you take a look at

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280 
overall results so if you take a look at
these<00:00:41.190> two<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> look<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> left

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
these two if you look over on the left

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.860 
these two if you look over on the left
hand<00:00:43.469> side<00:00:44.149> they<00:00:45.149> definitely<00:00:45.629> show<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
hand side they definitely show that the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
hand side they definitely show that the
320gb<00:00:48.870> hard<00:00:49.140> drive<00:00:49.350> 7200<00:00:50.070> rpm<00:00:50.700> s<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.059> a

320gb hard drive 7200 rpm s have a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.189 
320gb hard drive 7200 rpm s have a
better<00:00:51.690> overall<00:00:52.350> score<00:00:53.090> than<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.480> 500<00:00:55.079> gig

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
better overall score than the 500 gig

hard drive at 5400 rpm s 135 to 131 now
realistically<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:01.859> big<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
realistically it's not too big of a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.770 
realistically it's not too big of a
difference<00:01:02.690> not<00:01:03.690> too<00:01:03.989> bad<00:01:04.260> i<00:01:04.850> just<00:01:05.850> copied<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
difference not too bad i just copied the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.700 
difference not too bad i just copied the
5400<00:01:07.409> RPM<00:01:08.100> hard<00:01:08.310> drive<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.240> same<00:01:09.710> desktop

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
5400 RPM hard drive up the same desktop

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
5400 RPM hard drive up the same desktop
and<00:01:10.950> everything<00:01:11.220> over<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.750> as

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and everything over to it so as

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.039 
and everything over to it so as
everything<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.860> same<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:15.990> i

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
everything is the same on it so but i

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.450 
everything is the same on it so but i
just<00:01:16.259> wanted<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.619> sure<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> comparison

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
just wanted to make sure the comparison

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.480 
just wanted to make sure the comparison
was<00:01:17.610> equal<00:01:18.710> one<00:01:19.710> thing<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.979> wanted<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> show<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
was equal one thing I wanted to show you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.560 
was equal one thing I wanted to show you
was<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> disk<00:01:21.090> test<00:01:21.470> 57<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.340> RPM<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
was the disk test 57 for the RPM for the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
was the disk test 57 for the RPM for the
720<00:01:26.270> 7200<00:01:27.270> RPM<00:01:27.630> compared<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> 52<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.000> 5400

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I went ahead and started up my macbook

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.880 
I went ahead and started up my macbook
pro<00:01:47.189> from<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.299> cold<00:01:49.290> boot<00:01:50.270> all<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.570> way<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.890> when

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.590 
pro from a cold boot all the way to when
it<00:01:53.159> came<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.549> asking<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.299> login

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it came up asking for my login

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.280 
it came up asking for my login
credentials<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> 7200<00:01:56.670> RPM<00:01:57.290> hard

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.289 
credentials and when the 7200 RPM hard
drive<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.710> took<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.490> minute<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.909> seven

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
drive it took a one minute in seven

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.469 
drive it took a one minute in seven
seconds<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> 5400<00:02:02.250> RPM<00:02:02.850> drive<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
seconds and with the 5400 RPM drive it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.749 
seconds and with the 5400 RPM drive it
took<00:02:03.659> 1<00:02:03.930> minute<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.229> 12<00:02:04.439> seconds<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> five

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
took 1 minute and 12 seconds so a five

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.789 
took 1 minute and 12 seconds so a five
second<00:02:06.180> difference<00:02:06.270> right<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.719> not<00:02:07.530> too

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
second difference right there not too

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.729 
second difference right there not too
bad<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.720> next<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> found<00:02:10.619> very

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
bad at all this next one I found very

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.500 
bad at all this next one I found very
very<00:02:11.310> interesting<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.150> don't<00:02:12.360> know

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
very interesting and I don't know

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.050 
very interesting and I don't know
oh I<00:02:13.140> tried<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.129> few<00:02:14.159> times<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.819> got<00:02:14.939> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
oh I tried it a few times and got the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.470 
oh I tried it a few times and got the
same<00:02:15.239> results<00:02:15.860> has<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.159> is<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.489> movie<00:02:17.939> since

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
same results has to do is I movie since

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600 
same results has to do is I movie since
I<00:02:18.689> movies<00:02:19.049> what<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.290> used<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.769> compress<00:02:20.220> all<00:02:20.459> my

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
I movies what I used to compress all my

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.220 
I movies what I used to compress all my
movies<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.299> get<00:02:21.390> everything<00:02:21.689> out<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> YouTube

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
movies and get everything out to YouTube

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.210 
movies and get everything out to YouTube
I<00:02:22.500> decided<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.489> try<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.790> out<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.920> see<00:02:25.920> how<00:02:25.950> long

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
I decided to try it out on see how long

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.250 
I decided to try it out on see how long
it<00:02:26.370> took<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.549> open<00:02:26.879> up<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> app<00:02:27.239> under<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
it took to open up the app under the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.869 
it took to open up the app under the
same<00:02:28.470> conditions<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.159> everything<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.760> ran<00:02:30.060> my

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
same conditions and everything I ran my

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.680 
same conditions and everything I ran my
7200<00:02:32.879> RPM<00:02:33.209> drive<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:34.610> open<00:02:35.610> iMovie<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.540> took

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
7200 RPM drive I open iMovie and it took

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.619 
7200 RPM drive I open iMovie and it took
11<00:02:36.840> point<00:02:37.290> 6<00:02:37.379> seconds<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> open<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
11 point 6 seconds for it to open on the

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.470 
11 point 6 seconds for it to open on the
5400<00:02:40.379> RPM<00:02:40.950> drive<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:42.209> took<00:02:42.769> 6.8<00:02:43.769> seconds<00:02:44.480> now

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
5400 RPM drive it took 6.8 seconds now

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.440 
5400 RPM drive it took 6.8 seconds now
i'm<00:02:45.989> not<00:02:46.260> sure<00:02:46.530> why<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.819> five-second

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
i'm not sure why the five-second

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.449 
i'm not sure why the five-second
difference<00:02:48.720> my<00:02:49.230> guess<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.920> maybe

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
difference my guess is that maybe

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.190 
difference my guess is that maybe
because<00:02:50.819> i<00:02:50.849> have<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:52.079> more<00:02:53.010> space<00:02:53.430> available

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
because i have a more space available

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.140 
because i have a more space available
that<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.799> could<00:02:56.159> have<00:02:56.310> been<00:02:56.430> something<00:02:56.909> to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that it could have been something to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.830 
that it could have been something to
that<00:02:57.299> effect<00:02:57.629> i<00:02:57.810> Mun<00:02:58.049> for<00:02:58.319> sure<00:02:58.819> but<00:02:59.819> I<00:03:00.180> thought

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
that effect i Mun for sure but I thought

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.619 
that effect i Mun for sure but I thought
that<00:03:00.959> was<00:03:01.079> kind<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.349> interesting<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.629> haven't

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
that was kind of interesting I haven't

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.110 
that was kind of interesting I haven't
tried<00:03:03.690> compression<00:03:04.290> rates<00:03:04.470> yet<00:03:04.709> on

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
tried compression rates yet on

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.339 
tried compression rates yet on
compressing<00:03:06.120> videos<00:03:06.599> or<00:03:06.900> anything<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
compressing videos or anything like that

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.259 
compressing videos or anything like that
and<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:08.069> will<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.400> something<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.150> future

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
and that will be something in the future

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.349 
and that will be something in the future
I'll<00:03:09.629> be<00:03:09.780> checking<00:03:09.989> out<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.970> did<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> comparison

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
I'll be checking out I did a comparison

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.150 
I'll be checking out I did a comparison
on<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:14.220> hard<00:03:14.730> drive<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:16.260> cpu<00:03:16.799> for<00:03:17.099> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
on the hard drive and the cpu for the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.009 
on the hard drive and the cpu for the
heat<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.699> to<00:03:18.329> see<00:03:18.510> what<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.750> difference

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
heat and to see what the difference

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.860 
heat and to see what the difference
between<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.379> the<00:03:19.440> heat<00:03:19.650> would<00:03:19.769> be<00:03:20.540> like<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.660> said

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
between in the heat would be like I said

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.869 
between in the heat would be like I said
same<00:03:22.139> conditions<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.739> ran<00:03:22.949> it<00:03:23.069> for<00:03:23.220> an<00:03:23.310> hour<00:03:23.459> and

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
same conditions I ran it for an hour and

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.059 
same conditions I ran it for an hour and
I<00:03:24.000> checked<00:03:24.299> both<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.720> them<00:03:24.870> once<00:03:25.799> they<00:03:25.919> had

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
I checked both of them once they had

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.819 
I checked both of them once they had
been<00:03:26.190> running<00:03:26.459> for<00:03:26.579> an<00:03:26.699> hour<00:03:26.849> and<00:03:27.169> the<00:03:28.169> hard

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
been running for an hour and the hard

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.050 
been running for an hour and the hard
drive<00:03:29.099> was<00:03:29.609> at<00:03:29.790> 33<00:03:30.449> degrees<00:03:30.480> Celsius<00:03:31.819> with<00:03:32.819> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
drive was at 33 degrees Celsius with the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.199 
drive was at 33 degrees Celsius with the
7200<00:03:33.810> RPM<00:03:34.199> drive<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:34.859> with<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.069> 5400<00:03:35.699> RPM

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
7200 RPM drive but with the 5400 RPM

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.800 
7200 RPM drive but with the 5400 RPM
drive<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:37.290> was<00:03:37.500> only<00:03:37.650> at<00:03:37.889> 30<00:03:38.220> degrees<00:03:38.669> the<00:03:39.209> cpu

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.390 
drive it was only at 30 degrees the cpu
for<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.530> 70-200<00:03:41.280> was<00:03:41.489> at<00:03:41.930> 63<00:03:42.930> degrees<00:03:43.400> celsius

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
while the 5400 cpu ran at 59 degrees so

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.020 
while the 5400 cpu ran at 59 degrees so
there's<00:03:49.049> about<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.579> 44<00:03:50.579> degree<00:03:50.879> difference

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
there's about a 44 degree difference

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.129 
there's about a 44 degree difference
between<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.660> two<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.079> be

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
between the two and that's to be

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.140 
between the two and that's to be
expected<00:03:55.230> especially<00:03:55.919> running<00:03:56.669> something

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
expected especially running something

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.159 
expected especially running something
that's<00:03:57.329> not<00:03:57.510> going<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.720> be<00:03:57.750> running<00:03:57.930> as<00:03:58.139> fast

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
that's not going to be running as fast

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.399 
that's not going to be running as fast
as<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.829> 70-200<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.669> 54<00:04:00.209> runs<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.900> little<00:04:01.109> slower

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
as the 70-200 to 54 runs a little slower

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.099 
as the 70-200 to 54 runs a little slower

though<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.470> think<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:08.069> I'm<00:04:08.609> going<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:08.970> stick

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
though I think that I'm going to stick

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.899 
though I think that I'm going to stick
with<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.510> 5400<00:04:10.229> 500<00:04:11.159> gig<00:04:11.310> hard<00:04:11.340> drive<00:04:11.609> in

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
with the 5400 500 gig hard drive in

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.250 
with the 5400 500 gig hard drive in
there<00:04:12.409> for<00:04:13.409> me<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.889> don't<00:04:14.729> do<00:04:14.879> too<00:04:15.209> much<00:04:15.419> besides

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
there for me I don't do too much besides

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.379 
there for me I don't do too much besides
browsing<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:17.159> little<00:04:17.699> bit<00:04:17.789> of<00:04:17.880> compressing

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
browsing a little bit of compressing

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.969 
browsing a little bit of compressing
here<00:04:18.599> and<00:04:18.750> therefore<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.260> movies<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.859> stuff
