00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.700
 hi that as they are welcome to another do not forget before torean of stupor 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.269
 eads of milk we are going to go with very doubtful muvim is that if in this new 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.379
 mbi script tutorials I will teach composing effects a photograph 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.279
 what we started we chopped 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.320
 What I have left 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.779
 we give you a click here in this area 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.609
 we import about 4 pictures 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.359
 in this one this job 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.900
 I had made a video of the tutorial about how to put transitions in 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.559
 half of each photograph 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.880
 and in that I do not envy in tutorials I will teach how to put an effect 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.780
 eye 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.650
 a movement there was something that alan that a photograph move we selected the 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.820
 second photograph 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.220
 after that we give you a click here anime and sims 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.450
 as they realize that they are more 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.220
 transitions that you notice explained in a video a previous tutorial 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.709
 Now what I'm going to see you teach is 

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:03.019
 how to put a movement or how to make this image move 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.680
 or that has a minimum movement 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.420
 for that we are going to select 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.780
 any of those who are up here here where I did an in sun 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.230
 we were a click here we found more and as well as three herald groups in their min 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.120
 if we put the cursor over each one 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.770
 starts to make them were not photography starts to have a movement 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.120
 this is the way how to give our photography 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.310
 a small movement 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.950
 click on it 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.370
 and it's going to apply here and it's not photography 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.960
 'I do' want a different chin riot 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.660
 for this photograph he selected it 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.700
 and I choose 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 here 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.600
 others 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.940
 I'm going to use 1 of this group what does it belong to when I add 8 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.200
 I give a click 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 valcke I like 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.280
 but it implies here in this one 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 After that, if he got injured in the first Haitian photograph, I give him a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.899
 click on kuwait 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 this has not been applied to any movement 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.029
 but a week pictures and 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.919
 and how they are told in the moving 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.439
 as if he is being born a sum 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.899
 in a camera 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.050
 of the video to say it 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.050
 that way 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.349
 now after having applied 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.889
 a movement to our photography 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.029
 we want to put a transition in the middle of photography 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.560
 no more we put you on top of this 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.189
 click on top 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.519
 after 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.429
 on top of this 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.429
 now we take a click between 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.980
 and is going to put the transition and also going to move extra bonus photo riama have 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.209
 a movement 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.389
 how they count 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.629
 another thing more than teaching them 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.419
 is about how to put 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.419
 a thought here in photography 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.249
 select what you do with the photo and I give you a click on the purchase in case of 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.889
 what are you 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.759
 we give you a click on game after 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.759
 we click on it in cache 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.719
 this is where you can put a thought 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.289
 you select what is here you start to write 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:35.359
 then if you do not like what you write the selected ones and you give a 'click' 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.619
 secondary and then you give him cacho 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.169
 and it's gone 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.419
 after you've written something andiamo if you liked it you just give it 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.409
 one click 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.409
 even if they were from this box and it stays there 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.900
 you can also apply 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.939
 an animation to the text that you have here for that as you realize 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.779
 when we are here 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.779
 in this frame 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.700
 we can not select and when placing the cursor here they override these which is 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.510
 here where it says effect or sometimes 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.549
 by putting the cursor over 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.759
 they will realize before 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.749
 to our text 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.059
 get 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:17.350
 an animation go a 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.069
 move as you want to call 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.330
 and that's how you can put it in say 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.460
 a thought in some photographs and encourage it 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.169
 if you like some effect in the matter and that over 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:31.659
 now 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.659
 let's give it a click 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.669
 and well I think that 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.569
 this is all 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.259
 if you want to see the whole screen in your project you give a click here I understand 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.120
 then click on prison was a sprint you were a click here 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.069
 and it's going to start 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.290
 your work 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.699
 ma touches 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.699
 how do you realize 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.120
 and after 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.430
 that this project has finished 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.500
 or simply put the cursor over and after issues are said 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.550
 mubi I'm left 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.919
 and they bring you directly here 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.419
 this is all I think and I hope that the stent and script tutorials serve 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.340
 of utility and how to put power together a photograph an effect 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.919
 this is all 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.569
 i the 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.629
 see this I do not make a trillion tutorial take care until the next
