00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
for that let's see where is it let's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.700 
for that let's see where is it let's
check<00:01:07.200> over<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:09.110> let's<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.410> where

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
check over here now let's see where

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.969 
check over here now let's see where
could<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.190> be<00:01:11.330> okay<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this is no ordinary bonus chest because

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.640 
this is no ordinary bonus chest because
what<00:01:16.170> should<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.620> inside<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.780> an<00:01:18.780> iron<00:01:19.080> sword<00:01:19.440> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.040 
what should be inside is an iron sword a
full<00:01:20.160> set<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> chain<00:01:20.759> armor<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.300> a<00:01:21.450> stack<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
full set of chain armor and a stack of

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.650 
full set of chain armor and a stack of
steak<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:23.850> those<00:01:23.970> items<00:01:24.300> did<00:01:24.509> not

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
steak and so if those items did not

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.060 
steak and so if those items did not
appear<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> chest<00:01:25.410> then<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> world<00:01:25.860> might

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
appear in the chest then the world might

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
appear in the chest then the world might
have<00:01:26.190> glitched<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.200> recreate

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
have glitched and you have to recreate

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.650 
have glitched and you have to recreate
the<00:01:28.500> world<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:29.970> put<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.509> the

be above but I'm just I'd put it on easy

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.469 
be above but I'm just I'd put it on easy
just<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.590> safe<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.160> as<00:02:03.030> far<00:02:03.179> as<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.420> know

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
just to be safe and as far as I know

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.900 
just to be safe and as far as I know
this<00:02:03.750> only<00:02:03.990> works<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.380> 1.8<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.190> up<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.610> might

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
this only works on 1.8 and up and might

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.139 
this only works on 1.8 and up and might
work<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.470> 1.7<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:08.100> I'm<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.340> too<00:02:08.490> sure<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.000> all

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
work on 1.7 but I'm not too sure so all

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.840 
work on 1.7 but I'm not too sure so all
I<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.720> works<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.990> 1.8<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.190> just

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
I know is that it works on 1.8 so I just

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.309 
I know is that it works on 1.8 so I just
try<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.760> let's<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.390> once<00:02:16.170> you

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
try it on that and so let's see once you

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.650 
try it on that and so let's see once you
come<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:16.590> you'll<00:02:17.069> realize<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:18.300> once<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
come here you'll realize that once you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.010 
come here you'll realize that once you
come<00:02:18.870> here<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.340> center<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.390> pyramid

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
come here the the center of the pyramid

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.290 
come here the the center of the pyramid
right<00:02:22.350> here<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.430> center<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.910> floor<00:02:24.180> is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
right here the center of the floor is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.270 
right here the center of the floor is
gone<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.870> leads<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.350> water<00:02:25.740> pool<00:02:26.010> down

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
gone and it leads to a water pool down

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280 
gone and it leads to a water pool down
there<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.390> doesn't<00:02:27.630> happen<00:02:27.900> then

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
there so if this doesn't happen then

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.140 
there so if this doesn't happen then
another<00:02:29.040> glitch<00:02:29.370> might<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.700> happened<00:02:30.090> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
another glitch might have happened you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.970 
another glitch might have happened you
just<00:02:30.180> got<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.540> make<00:02:30.660> sure<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.990> these<00:02:31.230> all

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
just got to make sure that these all

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.059 
just got to make sure that these all
happen<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.730> succession<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.750> world<00:02:34.470> or

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
happen in succession in the world or

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.070 
happen in succession in the world or
else<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.700> you'll<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.450> redo<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.780> from

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
else that you'll have to redo it from

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.480 
else that you'll have to redo it from
the<00:02:37.200> start<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.620> think<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:38.010> don't<00:02:38.190> know

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
the start I think I don't know

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.949 
the start I think I don't know
yeah<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> think<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.270> have<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.480> redo<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> from

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
yeah I think you have to redo it from

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.199 
yeah I think you have to redo it from
the<00:02:40.050> start<00:02:40.290> if<00:02:40.380> any<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.680> these<00:02:40.800> mess<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.580> some

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
the start if any of these mess up some

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.710 
the start if any of these mess up some
then<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.380> want<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.830> carefully<00:02:44.510> jump<00:02:45.510> in

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
then you just want to carefully jump in

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.800 
then you just want to carefully jump in
and<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.860> once<00:02:47.099> you're<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.700> you'll<00:02:48.270> notice

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
and so once you're here you'll notice

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.440 
and so once you're here you'll notice
that<00:02:48.959> you're<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.319> this<00:02:49.530> room<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.580> um<00:02:50.790> right

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that you're in this room but um right

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.570 
that you're in this room but um right
here<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.140> just<00:02:52.170> come<00:02:52.500> up<00:02:52.590> here<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.430> what

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
here you just come up here and so what

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.280 
here you just come up here and so what
you'll<00:02:53.760> actually<00:02:53.849> have<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.360> do<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.900> you'll

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
you'll actually have to do is you'll

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
you'll actually have to do is you'll
have<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.590> fight<00:02:55.920> off<00:02:56.099> some<00:02:56.370> monsters<00:02:56.879> and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
have to fight off some monsters and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.390 
have to fight off some monsters and
it'll<00:02:57.299> be<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.530> skeletons<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.920> cave<00:02:59.189> spider

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it'll be a skeletons and a cave spider

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.170 
it'll be a skeletons and a cave spider
and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.789 
and
so<00:03:00.299> what<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.629> actually<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.379> is<00:03:01.560> get

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
so what you actually have to do is get

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.849 
so what you actually have to do is get
nine<00:03:02.159> different<00:03:02.879> items<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.599> all<00:03:04.409> the<00:03:04.590> things

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
nine different items and all the things

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.679 
nine different items and all the things
that<00:03:05.040> you're<00:03:05.189> carrying<00:03:05.519> actually<00:03:06.120> do<00:03:06.299> count

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
that you're carrying actually do count

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.750 
that you're carrying actually do count
so<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:07.859> use<00:03:08.010> those<00:03:08.219> and<00:03:08.489> then<00:03:08.579> you<00:03:08.640> have

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
so you can use those and then you have

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.640 
so you can use those and then you have
to<00:03:08.849> get<00:03:08.969> four<00:03:09.299> other<00:03:09.569> different<00:03:10.049> items<00:03:10.379> so

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to get four other different items so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.670 
to get four other different items so
let's<00:03:10.920> see<00:03:11.189> I<00:03:11.400> think<00:03:11.939> I<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.689> one<00:03:13.409> two

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
let's see I think I have that one two

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.500 
let's see I think I have that one two
three<00:03:14.250> four<00:03:15.000> five<00:03:15.750> six<00:03:16.560> seven<00:03:17.159> eight<00:03:17.730> nine<00:03:17.790> so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
three four five six seven eight nine so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.030 
three four five six seven eight nine so
once<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.079> nine<00:03:19.349> different<00:03:19.530> items<00:03:19.950> and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
once you have nine different items and

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.959 
once you have nine different items and
that's<00:03:20.159> because<00:03:20.549> right<00:03:20.579> here<00:03:21.409> let's<00:03:22.409> see<00:03:22.969> they

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:23.969 
that's because right here let's see they

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.110 
that's because right here let's see they
just<00:03:24.209> take<00:03:24.510> these<00:03:24.750> off<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.790> put<00:03:26.790> these<00:03:26.909> right

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
just take these off and put these right

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.449 
just take these off and put these right
here<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.650> actually<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.189> weighted

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
here this is actually a weighted

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.520 
here this is actually a weighted
pressure<00:03:29.939> plate<00:03:30.299> as<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.689> see<00:03:30.900> once

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
pressure plate as you can see once

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.670 
pressure plate as you can see once
you've<00:03:32.060> fended<00:03:33.060> them<00:03:33.209> all<00:03:33.389> off<00:03:33.629> you'll<00:03:34.200> notice

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
you've fended them all off you'll notice

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.039 
you've fended them all off you'll notice
this<00:03:35.010> right<00:03:35.250> here<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.239> video<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:36.750> kind<00:03:36.900> of

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
this right here and the video is kind of

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.539 
this right here and the video is kind of
freezing<00:03:37.409> all<00:03:37.500> right<00:03:37.620> there<00:03:37.799> we<00:03:37.889> go<00:03:37.950> yeah

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
freezing all right there we go yeah

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.039 
freezing all right there we go yeah
you'll<00:03:38.760> notice<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.180> oh<00:03:39.239> there's<00:03:39.599> this<00:03:39.810> right

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
you'll notice that oh there's this right

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.990 
you'll notice that oh there's this right
here<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.099> I'm<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.519> actually<00:03:41.849> need<00:03:41.970> to

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
here and so I'm you actually need to
