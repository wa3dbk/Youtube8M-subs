 read the association agreement with 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.610
 the European Union is well aware that firstly

 political scientists Kiwi waited even when 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.869
 President Yushchenko many expected that 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.180
 will be the same from europe here 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.400
 today kw many european politicians 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.900
 they say that you have excessive requirements 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.810
 they were not asked 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.209
 but Europe also did not ask Ukraine with 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.980
 young guys who are overvalued 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.100
 the idea of europe is now useless 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.480
 speak in terms of common sense 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.640
 delusion that the Ukrainians will be 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.330
 easier to get permission to work in 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.880
 European Union 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.430
 protesters believe that in the west of them 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.920
 waiting for employers and the eurozone crisis if 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.200
 they promised to touch them we will 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.390
 jobs because the European Union will give 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.390
 us money to upgrade 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.330
 our production as the same European Union 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.340
 they promised to compensate and not need 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.959
 we will simply compensate 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.760
 appreciate still raise will 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.950
 investment is sure to go to us but in 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.230
 Europe has not been told about this yet 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.540
 They said but the contract was in principle and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.760
 on the sly it would certainly be for coffee 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.340
 to Europe there is new technology there 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.930
 Democrats there judicial and if they stop 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.930
 pay pensions wages 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.459
 The main problems of conditional 6 are 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.959
 now the european union is up to colossal 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.530
 Shaya unemployment and much more 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.600
 higher than say in Ukraine or Russia 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.329
 taxes so to speak now in Ukraine in 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.430
 Russia on my lowest which only 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.069
 where there is no such tax close 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.720
 European Union 3 to 4 times exactly 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.280
 higher Ukrainian estimates 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.340
 governments on bringing the country to 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.579
 European regulations need about 165 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.480
 billion euros for Ukraine amount 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.609
 astronomical but serious financial 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.260
 Brussels did not promise any assistance 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.129
 compensation for fish loss 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.409
 in Russia and the CIS countries is the minimum loss 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.420
 six to eight billion dollars 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.379
 export and now let's count on 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.110
 the workplace is only directly 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.299
 and the fall of three hundred and four hundred thousand workers 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.370
 places and for any workplace is 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.190
 the purchasing power of families who 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.349
 should go shop to the bazaar it means 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.989
 the loss of a small business that is it for 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.419
 chain such losses were not 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.639
 total in the 90s even where no discoveries 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.229

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.100
 bards that opponents of integration 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:37.449
 miners miners metallurgists even 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:38.740
 broke the accordion until the Ukrainians advantage 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.010
 have seen europe from the tourist window 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.650

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.270
 the truth about it on euromaidan as we 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.190

 The European Union in an interview with the choice he che 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.479
 stressed that Ukraine can not 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.010
 afford a confrontation with russia 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.380

 Poles themselves as well as Bulgarians and Romanians 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.460
