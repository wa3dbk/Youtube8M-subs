off is in measuring the infrared

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.710 

and<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:31.530> that<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.190> know<00:00:32.640> how<00:00:33.300> big<00:00:33.570> these

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
and with that we can know how big these

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.710 
and with that we can know how big these
asteroids<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> which<00:00:35.220> are

potentially hazardous to the earth so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.550 
potentially hazardous to the earth so
the<00:00:38.250> ones<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.750> orbits<00:00:40.080> close<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
the ones that are in orbits close to the

the ones that are in orbits close to the
Earth's<00:00:40.770> orbit<00:00:41.150> now<00:00:42.150> could<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.750> future

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080

Earth's orbit now could in the future
hit<00:00:43.260> us

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
hit us

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
hit us
in<00:00:45.720> visible<00:00:46.080> light<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.530> object<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.100> small

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
in visible light an object that's small

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.160 
in visible light an object that's small
and<00:00:47.670> shiny<00:00:47.940> reflects<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> same<00:00:48.870> amount<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and shiny reflects the same amount of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
and shiny reflects the same amount of
sunlight<00:00:49.380> as<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:49.980> asteroid<00:00:50.310> that's<00:00:50.610> big<00:00:50.880> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
sunlight as an asteroid that's big and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.180 
sunlight as an asteroid that's big and
dark<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.380> we<00:00:52.500> look<00:00:52.650> with<00:00:52.800> an<00:00:52.890> infrared

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
dark but when we look with an infrared

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
dark but when we look with an infrared
telescope<00:00:53.310> we're<00:00:54.150> seeing<00:00:54.450> heat<00:00:54.750> that's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
telescope we're seeing heat that's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
telescope we're seeing heat that's
emitted<00:00:55.470> from<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:55.950> sides<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> asteroid

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
emitted from more sides of the asteroid

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.030 
emitted from more sides of the asteroid
so<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.630> much<00:00:57.810> better<00:00:57.990> true<00:00:58.530> measurement

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
so we get a much better true measurement

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.550 
so we get a much better true measurement
of<00:00:59.130> the<00:00:59.220> object<00:00:59.580> size<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.900> is<00:01:01.050> important

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
of the object size and this is important

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.080 
of the object size and this is important
because<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.040> allows<00:01:02.070> us<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.550> tell<00:01:02.730> whether<00:01:02.970> or

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
because it allows us to tell whether or

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.340 
because it allows us to tell whether or
not<00:01:03.180> we're<00:01:03.360> dealing<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:03.870> object<00:01:04.199> that's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
not we're dealing with an object that's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.790 
not we're dealing with an object that's
this<00:01:04.530> big<00:01:04.800> or<00:01:05.160> an<00:01:05.280> object<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.000> big

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
this big or an object that's this big
