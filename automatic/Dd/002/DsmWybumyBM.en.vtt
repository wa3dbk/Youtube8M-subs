inside is actually just going to try and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.910 
inside is actually just going to try and
see<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.670> put<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.000> over<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.780> now

see if I can put that over there for now
so<00:01:49.920> inside<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.549> box<00:01:50.880> we're<00:01:51.240> probably<00:01:51.420> might

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so inside this box we're probably might

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.969 
so inside this box we're probably might
have<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> cut<00:01:52.020> another<00:01:52.110> seal<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.799> honest

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
have to cut another seal to be honest

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.530 
have to cut another seal to be honest
with<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.430> sure<00:01:53.549> yet<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.119> they

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
with you but I'm not sure yet but they

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
should just fold open to the sides okay

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.219 
should just fold open to the sides okay
so<00:01:57.479> there<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> astro<00:01:59.340> a30

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229

design so first of all guys are just
going<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.389> cover<00:03:48.569> off<00:03:48.750> where<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.139> cable<00:03:49.530> entry

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
going to cover off where the cable entry

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.800 
going to cover off where the cable entry
goes<00:03:50.099> basically<00:03:50.970> got<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.180> right<00:03:51.419> angled

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
goes basically got this right angled

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.319 
goes basically got this right angled
cable<00:03:52.229> here<00:03:52.379> with<00:03:52.560> extended<00:03:53.099> 3.5<00:03:53.699> jack<00:03:54.000> on<00:03:54.209> it

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
cable here with extended 3.5 jack on it

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.059 
cable here with extended 3.5 jack on it
and<00:03:54.479> essentially<00:03:55.079> what<00:03:55.229> it<00:03:55.349> does<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.919> goes

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
and essentially what it does is it goes

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.490 
and essentially what it does is it goes
into<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.459> back<00:03:56.609> of<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.060> left<00:03:57.269> ear<00:03:57.510> cup<00:03:57.810> so

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
into the back of the left ear cup so

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.930 
into the back of the left ear cup so
then<00:03:58.620> obviously<00:03:58.769> this<00:03:59.099> will<00:03:59.250> go<00:03:59.430> off<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.760> your

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
then obviously this will go off to your

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.879 
then obviously this will go off to your
inline<00:04:00.449> control<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.199> in<00:04:01.290> all<00:04:01.409> golf<00:04:01.650> at<00:04:01.769> your

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
inline control and in all golf at your

inline control and in all golf at your
pc<00:04:02.099> splitter<00:04:02.639> or<00:04:03.269> obviously<00:04:03.569> a<00:04:03.629> single<00:04:04.049> Jack

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
review as you can see a 30s do have

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.580 
review as you can see a 30s do have
speaker<00:04:45.699> tags<00:04:45.909> so<00:04:46.270> these<00:04:46.780> actually<00:04:46.840> do<00:04:47.319> come

speaker tags so these actually do come

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.110 
speaker tags so these actually do come
off<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.889> can't<00:04:48.129> remember<00:04:48.370> how<00:04:48.580> actually<00:04:48.940> get

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
off I can't remember how actually get

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.430 
off I can't remember how actually get
them<00:04:49.270> off<00:04:49.389> now<00:04:49.569> are<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:49.810> push<00:04:50.020> them<00:04:50.139> down<00:04:50.199> in

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
them off now are you push them down in

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.230 
them off now are you push them down in
one<00:04:50.590> corner<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.190> then<00:04:51.610> basically<00:04:51.759> it<00:04:52.000> pops

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
one corner and then basically it pops

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.939 
one corner and then basically it pops
off<00:04:52.419> on<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.810> other<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.530> obviously<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.860> got

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
off on the other so obviously you got

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.680 
off on the other so obviously you got
the<00:04:54.099> Astro<00:04:54.430> branding<00:04:54.879> underneath<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.599> then

the Astro branding underneath and then

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.469 
the Astro branding underneath and then
you<00:04:55.810> can<00:04:55.930> obviously<00:04:56.190> fix<00:04:57.190> different<00:04:58.030> tags<00:04:58.300> on

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479
