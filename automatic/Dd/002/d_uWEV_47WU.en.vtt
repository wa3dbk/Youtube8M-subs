00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
clip and basically no recoil and so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
clip and basically no recoil and so
that's<00:00:58.109> what's<00:00:58.289> special<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.559> those<00:00:58.800> guns

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that's what's special about those guns

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.610 
that's what's special about those guns
but<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.270> mp5<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.170> nothing

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but this one the mp5 there is nothing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
but this one the mp5 there is nothing
that<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.730> stands<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> gun

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that is that stands out from this gun

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600 
that is that stands out from this gun
apart<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> others<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> p<00:01:05.280> m9

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
apart from the others same with the p m9

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219 
apart from the others same with the p m9
I<00:01:05.820> mean<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.270> guess<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> hipfire<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.049> pretty

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
I mean I guess the hipfire is pretty

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
I mean I guess the hipfire is pretty
good<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:08.189> maybe<00:01:08.580> that's<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.060> only

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
good on that or maybe that's the only

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.310 
good on that or maybe that's the only
thing<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.229> know<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
thing you can do with it I don't know I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
thing you can do with it I don't know I

talking<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.159> commentary<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
talking about in this commentary is the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.240 
talking about in this commentary is the
SMD<00:01:18.450> leaks<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> where<00:01:19.409> we're<00:01:19.590> hoping<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> go

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
SMD leaks and where we're hoping to go

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.200 
SMD leaks and where we're hoping to go
with<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.430> channel<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:20.970> i'm<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.150> sure

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
with this channel because i'm not sure

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.960 
with this channel because i'm not sure
if<00:01:21.720> any<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> guys<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:23.189> most<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> guys<00:01:23.729> just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
if any of you guys or most you guys just

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.219 
if any of you guys or most you guys just
think<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> channel<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:25.080> we're

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
think this is the channel where we're

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
think this is the channel where we're
just<00:01:25.439> collaborating<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> dumping<00:01:26.850> random

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
just collaborating on and dumping random

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.719 
just collaborating on and dumping random
videos<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.720> feel<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.729> at

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
videos on when we feel like it now at

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609 
videos on when we feel like it now at
this<00:01:29.939> moment<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.509> may<00:01:30.900> seem<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
this moment it may seem like that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.300 
this moment it may seem like that
because<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.220> someone<00:01:32.700> accurate<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:34.380> myself

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
because it's someone accurate but myself

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
because it's someone accurate but myself

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
think we can do it if we put enough

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.060 
think we can do it if we put enough
effort<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:45.960> put<00:02:46.170> enough<00:02:46.380> decent<00:02:46.890> tips

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
effort in and we put enough decent tips

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.850 
effort in and we put enough decent tips
and<00:02:47.310> tricks<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.910> enough<00:02:48.720> great<00:02:49.140> content<00:02:49.680> and

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860

strong<00:02:50.400> commentaries<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.210> stuff<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
strong commentaries and stuff like that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.300 
strong commentaries and stuff like that
which<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.870> know<00:02:51.900> we're<00:02:52.170> already<00:02:52.350> doing<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:53.280> just

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
which I know we're already doing we just

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.250 
which I know we're already doing we just
need<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.640> do<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.940> little<00:02:54.180> bit<00:02:54.510> more<00:02:54.900> because

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
need to do it a little bit more because

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.960 
need to do it a little bit more because
we<00:02:55.560> took<00:02:55.800> kind<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.220> break<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.640> week<00:02:56.880> I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
we took kind of a break this week I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
we took kind of a break this week I
think<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.450> first<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.380> probably

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
think this is the first this is probably

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.860 
think this is the first this is probably
the<00:02:58.680> longest<00:02:58.920> break<00:02:59.400> we've<00:02:59.610> taken<00:02:59.940> since<00:03:00.690> we

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the longest break we've taken since we

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.080 
the longest break we've taken since we
started<00:03:01.080> which<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.350> about<00:03:01.560> five<00:03:01.800> days<00:03:02.090> tune

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
started which was about five days tune
