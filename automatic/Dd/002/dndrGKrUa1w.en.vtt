00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.029
 hi to all girls is the 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.549
 baule x and I'm here to talk about a 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.990
 new stein book on the market and that 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.700
 you find at Sephora or shop 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.289
 official but that forever it is 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.879
 what is red so if you 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.379
 ask what is it 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.369
 red level 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.690
 I had my opinion knowing that 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.730
 the only two different colors that 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.280
 feel a lot actually so that's it 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.990
 the red zapa already the first this is 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.230
 lip steyn what i'm talking a lot about 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.570
 on my channel what I love to talk about and 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.700
 those who change mali every day what 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.079
 are the lip steyn so what are I the 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.329
 repeat again reds to 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.899
 long-held lips so who hold 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.550
 all day that actually dries out 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.409
 your lips and that make that if you 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.699
 kiss a surface there is no 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.960
 product transfer so you do not have 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.620
 no color if you kiss your 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.390
 So here I am, I have two colors of 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.399
 and 14 so it's numbers at make 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.129
 up for ever the level equivalent no 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.989
 is that the 2 these rosewoods and that 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.989
 the darkest 14 is called 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.079
 voice of the light roses of the waf lover 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.600
 little swatch we know to you to what 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.310
 color suits you pts on the internet it's 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.380
 not very clear what is true that me 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.880
 I was a little disappointed late the colors is 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.130
 a little darker in truth compared to 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.570
 internet I find so it's true it's 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.570
 see me in person 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.620
 I have two little swatch 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.760
 so that's it then you see you have the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.100
 clearer and the darker so the 2 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.450
 and the 14 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.620
 these are these colors there a wood of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.720
 roses it is a color wood roses 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.450
 so it's a pink color and an old 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.300
 an old rose in celebration that turns to the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.290
 lightly brown words I do not know 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.420
 how to describe its colors but it's 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 I really like it's colors 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.450
 which are similar to my favorite gloss 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.990
 that you all know it's the rimmel 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.460
 venice gloss in colors 336 note that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.780
 for me is a brilliant color because 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.550
 it's a slightly moving color 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.640
 which is close to the color of my 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.080
 lips but more beautiful and five genes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.670
 in this color so there you have 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.970
 so these two versions in quotation marks 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 of color in the red aqua range and 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.200
 so it's 2 and 14 so depending on 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.910
 your training or according to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.430
 the mood we're going to say wanted something a 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.560
 little bit more below more neutral 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.060
 you put there two wanted a little 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 little more intensive there is a sense of self 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 so I put myself a superhero that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.290
 I put bright red you have there 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.850
 14 knowing that it's a pretty range 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.450
 wide of color and you really have 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.959
 spoiled for choice 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.360
 from red rose to orange purple everything 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.640
 that wanted what they are worth as 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.549
 that in time disturbed they are 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.500
 awesome 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.700
 it reminds me a lot of what 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.049
 I liked a lot and I still love 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.120
 but what they do I do not know too much 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.459
 if they still have to be my 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.959
 furniture in 18 hours the 18 hours with 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.910
 both sides because in fact often 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.040
 it's time when they are two 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.540
 parties and that here instead of the balm 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.930
 you have a gloss as is the case 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.959
 right here 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.250
 the gloss was sending lipsheim gold this 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.570
 is not the case with make up for 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.030
 ever 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.070
 the gloss allows you to camp at 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.750
 your lipsheim to stick lip sticks 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.690
 together what we know it can do it 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.440
 and after just and it sticks more 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.440
 of the gloss that's going to make them shine there 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.750
 missed and that will help separate 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.340
 component must be more pleasant and 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.150
 it's not going to make go the said stein 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.950
 which means that when you 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.950
 to kiss someone would be that the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.020
 transparent which part so they are 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.320
 awesome long term let's take you 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.880
 doubt a little super nice thing 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.200
 what does make up forever do is that in 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.190
 their collection when they took out the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.480
 agreements in chile to the elders of 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.360
 acolytes that go with that is to say the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.810
 waterproof lip pencils that go 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.820
 with 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.110
 so it's great if you'd rather have 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.370
 a super-defined thing at the level of 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.630
 outline before putting the leap style 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.000
 you have the pencils that go with 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.260
 so it's just awesome 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.490
 complementarity the full side of the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.650
 range of ranges at make up for ever 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.110
 I'm still used to my 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.160
 supermarket products but who are 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.500
 awesome dishes that are good 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.570
 discoveries 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.130
 I still like to see that the 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.920
 supermarket not seem as good as 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.750
 the big ones we'll say that like that if 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.700

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.190
 looking for better best red to 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.540
 hard and long- lasting lips

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.360

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.290
 relative to the market shares knows who 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.910

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.780
 at make up that's what I learned from 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.510
 red because of red 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.950
 I was there I really wanted his 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.360
 very special colors that 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.640
