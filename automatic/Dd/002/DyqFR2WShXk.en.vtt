00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750 

in<00:00:00.060> my<00:00:01.020> last<00:00:01.199> video<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.740> made<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.129> stand<00:00:02.399> for<00:00:02.610> my

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in my last video I made the stand for my

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.090 
in my last video I made the stand for my
voice<00:00:02.970> over<00:00:03.300> microphone<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.770> could<00:00:04.980> use

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
voice over microphone and I could use

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.130 
voice over microphone and I could use
the<00:00:05.220> microphone<00:00:05.310> now<00:00:05.790> as<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:06.810> it's

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the microphone now as it is but it's

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.930 
the microphone now as it is but it's
still<00:00:07.259> missing<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.799> pop<00:00:08.040> screen<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.519> prevents

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
still missing a pop screen that prevents

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.360 
still missing a pop screen that prevents
pop<00:00:09.300> sounds<00:00:09.750> when<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.530> get<00:00:10.710> too<00:00:10.860> close<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
pop sounds when you get too close to the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.640 
pop sounds when you get too close to the
microphone<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.059> rather<00:00:12.900> than<00:00:13.080> buy<00:00:13.230> one<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
microphone and rather than buy one I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.540 
microphone and rather than buy one I
wanted<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.280> make<00:00:14.549> my<00:00:14.700> own<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.240> here<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.109> is

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
wanted to make my own and here it is

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.460 
wanted to make my own and here it is
it's<00:00:17.550> pretty<00:00:17.789> simple<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.960> clamp<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
it's pretty simple I just can clamp it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.950 
it's pretty simple I just can clamp it
to<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.710> stand<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.600> screen<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.720> pretty

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to the stand a screen is pretty

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.130 
to the stand a screen is pretty
effective<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> let<00:00:24.240> me<00:00:24.359> show<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> made

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
effective so let me show you how I made

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.310 
effective so let me show you how I made
it<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.439> want<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> use<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.970> really<00:00:27.599> thin<00:00:27.900> foam

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it I want to use this really thin foam

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.410 
it I want to use this really thin foam
that<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.490> already<00:00:29.699> tried<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
that I have and I already tried it and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.870 
that I have and I already tried it and
it<00:00:30.720> works<00:00:30.960> quite<00:00:31.380> well<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.430> already

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
it works quite well and I also already

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.330 
it works quite well and I also already
made<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.719> C<00:00:34.050> clamp<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.739> clamps<00:00:35.160> onto

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
made a little C clamp that clamps onto

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.860 
made a little C clamp that clamps onto
the<00:00:35.550> post<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:38.149> next<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.210> make<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> frame

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the post like so next I make the frame

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.770 
the post like so next I make the frame
that<00:00:40.230> goes<00:00:40.469> around<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.980> phone<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.780> drew

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that goes around the phone and just drew

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
that goes around the phone and just drew
it<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> two<00:00:43.680> pieces<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> plywood<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it up on a two pieces of plywood and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
it up on a two pieces of plywood and
screw<00:00:45.239> together<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.870> tiny<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.410> screws

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
screw together with tiny little screws

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.970 
screw together with tiny little screws
and<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> cut<00:00:47.820> both<00:00:48.780> pieces<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and now I cut both pieces out at the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:01.930 
and now I cut both pieces out at the
same<00:00:50.190> time

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.229 

I<00:01:02.620> marked<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:03.710> circle<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.309> foam<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:04.760> cut<00:01:05.119> it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
I marked a circle on the foam and cut it

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.789 
I marked a circle on the foam and cut it
out<00:01:05.360> with<00:01:05.600> about<00:01:05.869> five<00:01:06.170> millimeters<00:01:06.470> of

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
out with about five millimeters of

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.640 
out with about five millimeters of
overhang<00:01:07.369> all<00:01:07.610> around<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:09.200> could<00:01:09.409> also

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
overhang all around and you could also

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.649 
overhang all around and you could also
use<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.159> pair<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.549> scissors<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.210> cut<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.540> out<00:01:11.630> and

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
use a pair of scissors to cut it out and

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.090 
use a pair of scissors to cut it out and
here<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.780> two<00:01:14.930> layers<00:01:15.229> with<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.680> foam<00:01:15.920> in

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
here the two layers with the foam in

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.330 
here the two layers with the foam in
between<00:01:19.780> now<00:01:20.780> with<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.140> basic<00:01:21.680> pop<00:01:22.070> screen

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
between now with the basic pop screen

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.460 
between now with the basic pop screen
done<00:01:22.549> I<00:01:22.759> need<00:01:23.299> some<00:01:23.509> way<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.690> connect<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.440> from

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
done I need some way to connect it from

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.940 
done I need some way to connect it from
here<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.369> clamp<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:27.320> want<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.680> try<00:01:27.890> to

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
here to the clamp and I want to try to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.770 
here to the clamp and I want to try to
use<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.340> piece<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:28.909> wire<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.750> do<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:31.690> put<00:01:32.690> it

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
use a piece of wire to do this I put it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.550 
use a piece of wire to do this I put it
in<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.020> vise<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.409> bend<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.100> loop<00:01:34.369> at<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.670> end

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.050 

then<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.710> drilled<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.159> hole<00:01:40.190> in<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.729> middle<00:01:40.970> of

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
then I drilled a hole in the middle of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.540 
then I drilled a hole in the middle of
both<00:01:41.330> layers<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:44.740> now<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.770> put<00:01:46.069> the<00:01:46.190> loop<00:01:46.340> on

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
both layers and now I put the loop on

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.309 
both layers and now I put the loop on
each<00:01:46.670> layer<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.270> traced<00:01:47.659> around<00:01:47.990> it<00:01:48.170> that

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
each layer and traced around it that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.350 
each layer and traced around it that
gave<00:01:48.860> me<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.159> shape<00:01:49.369> for<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.819> grooves<00:01:50.149> in

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
gave me the shape for the grooves in

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.649 
gave me the shape for the grooves in
which<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.780> loop<00:01:50.929> could<00:01:51.170> fit<00:01:51.350> into<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:52.509> make<00:01:53.509> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
which the loop could fit into I make the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.270 
which the loop could fit into I make the
shape<00:01:53.899> on<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> drill<00:01:54.380> press<00:01:54.649> with<00:01:54.679> a<00:01:54.920> brad

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
shape on the drill press with a brad

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.980 
shape on the drill press with a brad
point<00:01:55.520> drill<00:01:55.880> bit<00:01:56.060> by<00:01:56.330> drilling<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:56.750> lot<00:01:56.869> of

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
point drill bit by drilling a lot of

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.870 
point drill bit by drilling a lot of
holes<00:01:57.289> then<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.920> between<00:01:58.310> all<00:01:58.520> those<00:01:58.700> holes

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
holes then in between all those holes

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.789 
holes then in between all those holes
and<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.110> on<00:02:00.289> until<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:00.979> had<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.280> continuous<00:02:01.909> blue

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.190 

the<00:02:08.550> wire<00:02:08.759> gets<00:02:09.090> sandwiched<00:02:09.569> between<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.170> two

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the wire gets sandwiched between the two

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
the wire gets sandwiched between the two
pieces<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.220> slock<00:02:11.489> there<00:02:11.730> pretty<00:02:12.060> well

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
pieces and the slock there pretty well

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.009 
pieces and the slock there pretty well
it<00:02:13.050> won't<00:02:13.410> come<00:02:13.650> out<00:02:13.680> or<00:02:14.040> move<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.269> next<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.690> have

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
it won't come out or move so next I have

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.900 
it won't come out or move so next I have
to<00:02:16.170> figure<00:02:16.410> out<00:02:16.470> where<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.980> mount<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.400> wire<00:02:17.610> in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
to figure out where to mount the wire in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.119 
to figure out where to mount the wire in
the<00:02:18.120> clamp<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.019> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.410> screen<00:02:19.800> should<00:02:20.099> be

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
the clamp so on the screen should be

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.030 
the clamp so on the screen should be
roughly<00:02:20.670> about<00:02:20.879> here<00:02:21.629> then<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.140> bent<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.800> wire

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
roughly about here then I bent a wire

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.600 
roughly about here then I bent a wire
along<00:02:23.819> here<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.569> here<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.440> sticks<00:02:26.129> into<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
along here and here it sticks into a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.479 
along here and here it sticks into a
clamp<00:02:27.500> bending<00:02:28.500> was<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:29.010> simple<00:02:29.220> this

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
clamp bending was really simple this

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.309 
clamp bending was really simple this
time<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.970> marked<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> wire<00:02:30.750> at<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.049> right

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
time I marked the wire at the right

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.320 
time I marked the wire at the right
position<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.010> cut<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.640> off<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:33.090> few

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
position and cut it off a few

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.699 
position and cut it off a few
centimeters<00:02:33.840> behind<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.349> mark<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:36.620> drilled<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
centimeters behind the mark I drilled a

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.640 
centimeters behind the mark I drilled a
little<00:02:37.830> hole<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.370> clamp<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:40.230> stick

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
little hole on the clamp and I can stick

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.800 
little hole on the clamp and I can stick
the<00:02:40.860> wire<00:02:41.069> into<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:44.000> now<00:02:45.000> where<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.480> made

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
the wire into that and now where I made

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.080 
the wire into that and now where I made
this<00:02:45.989> mark<00:02:46.349> earlier<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.040> gotta<00:02:47.280> bend<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> over

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
this mark earlier I gotta bend it over

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:09.680 
this mark earlier I gotta bend it over
twice<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.750> stick<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.200> back<00:03:07.910> both<00:03:08.910> wire<00:03:09.269> ends

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
twice and stick it back both wire ends

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.199 
twice and stick it back both wire ends
are<00:03:09.810> now<00:03:10.019> locked<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.650> will<00:03:11.190> stay<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.640> place

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
are now locked and will stay in place

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:20.690 
are now locked and will stay in place
I<00:03:17.959> finally<00:03:18.959> smooth<00:03:19.410> over<00:03:19.799> all<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.160> edges<00:03:20.459> with

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
I finally smooth over all the edges with

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.910 
I finally smooth over all the edges with
a<00:03:20.819> flap<00:03:21.120> sander<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:22.019> could<00:03:22.170> also<00:03:22.350> use<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.799> with

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
a flap sander you could also use it with

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.530 
a flap sander you could also use it with
a<00:03:22.950> drill<00:03:23.310> or<00:03:23.519> drill<00:03:23.549> press<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.299> have

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
a drill or drill press but I have

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.309 
a drill or drill press but I have
