00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.620
 very good you all have it well average 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.270
 well we are here to present to 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.160
 new that they learn john legend sestÃ¡k 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.720
 in the video that I did then report a 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.520
 little bit of eating the skills was going to be 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.380
 in this video, let's see it now 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.660
 inside the game and see the skills 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.250
 with movement and such that it would always be 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 much better than in an image so 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 let's go to it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.230
 good and with that highlight of tacna 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 this champion as we can see does not use 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.650
 no kind of mana or energy but 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.330
 what he uses to throw skills 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.100
 we are your own life is to say you are 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.640
 killing all the skills then you 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.620
 You are losing your life then something else 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 highlight is that the less life you have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.680
 is when less life is left for you to die 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 so smaller make champion me 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 you look pretty big the way the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.040
 champion or pretty screen 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 the less life as smaller is 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
 Does your champion have to check if 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.410
 The more life becomes bigger 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.390
 guy ropes what you put him 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.580
 you can stay six loads beruti 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.920
 since collides immense puppets do not occupy 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.720
 now part of the map and we can see how 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.250
 beautiful is getting smaller when 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.330
 People are hitting it much more 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.739
 little 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.320
 now let's explain a little 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.750
 skills that is our skill 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.550
 who throws a double punch and slows down 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.350
 to enemies who in that area 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.690
 we see that it does not have excessive rank but 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.030
 good 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.730
 and we see that it leaves us a bit this is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.260
 our passive as I said in the 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.390
 news of the new champion in our 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.980
 areas a bit then we have this champion 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.060
 has as a double passive in the first 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.340
 place what it does is that every time 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.320
 they use a skill because you jump 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.690
 bit as if it were from your body and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.840
 take it then you cure or here we can 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.760
 see is a bit when you catch it then you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.440
 cures and apart from that has another that is 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.940
 the revived created let's see a little 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.460
 later when we explain the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.140
 new skills 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.510
 the first life we have said when 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.570
 the punch the second is explore your 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.090
 body and we can see klum and what 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.000
 does it cause damage according to the life of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.800
 the maximum life 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.050
 and then we have what is a skill 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.810
 how good it is is a bit difficult 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.030
 because you have to know how to use it and you have to 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.290
 overcome it as we say it is a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.390
 little complex not because in principle 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.190
 you have to charge the character what do you have 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.229
 to jump and you have to aim and to 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.640
 point well then you have to know some 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.650
 certain things I can take to 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.600
 character so face face 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.490
 we are going walking face or what 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.350
 I can carry on my back this does not influence 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.420
 at the same time to use stability ie 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.070
 because I say this because I can carry 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.540
 to the character like that and you can think okay go 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.730
 to jump forward here will jump 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.310
 for behind but I will not see character 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.220
 on your back with what you aim is with the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.810
 that is to say with the pointer then 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.000
 if I point here even if I 'm 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.500
 back the character click we see that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.340
 charge me forward now load now 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.959
 I can jump from here and give to the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.840
 enemies than those who should 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.940
 your study a point a time 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.290
 so good is a bit strange 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.580
 skill but good is pretty easy 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.140
 of learning to simply aim with the 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.030
 pointer and you can do very well because 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.080
 even if you run back then you can use 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.879
 your skill and cork and jump to 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.890
 forward it would not be would be uas and so what 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.560
 I could do and even if I get more party 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.750
 here running not so since you pointed here 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.750
 I do electro a little bit, I'm not going to 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.280
 so much and backwards and our ability 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.319
 last this last one is that jumps three 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.860
 sometimes it was not going like knocking down if we can 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.500
 see what we can see it jumps and the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.720
 move and every time he jumps for 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.950
 say every time a boat comes as 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.510
 where you cause all the damage but you 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.340
 is reducing the damage that causes 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.560
 same now let's see we see that it was the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.939
 champion is quite smaller than at 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.739
 principle that when we have started the 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.959
 video because he's half his life 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.230
 basically and now let's see a little 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.260
 the passive our passive so we can 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.370
 try around here in these ghosts 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.140
 I personally believe this is already a 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.799
 opinion that the character is a bit 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.829
 loose 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.350
 that is, it does not put the good in excess 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.110
 let's see the passive 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.000
 you're going to end this fast one is all 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.830
 this is missing is highly in battles 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.630
 is this ghost good get and shit 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.950
 the problems with red that will make us 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.349
 enough more damage 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.540
 and as you can see it does not stop it's true that 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.099
 the one that the cool where the w to do 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.540
 jungle because it is very short there are no sunsets 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.180
 you can cause quite a few years but it's 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.709
 that pending quite little there is also 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.710
 that equip what's good no I'm not good 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.330
 equipped and such but 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.990
 although I think it will put a small 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.400
 diving at the beginning because if not the idea 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.630
 of the character seems very very 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.630
 interesting and very good but I do not know 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.260
 get kill the red so we can see 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.420
 the passive and I hope not even though I do not 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.790
 mate now when we exploit masters will live 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.340
 our body in a bishop of the 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.520
 balls in four parts you see here one 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:43.020
 two three and four and when you meet 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.700
 zoom and you receive and you are Arab 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.040
 that we are quite small in 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.810
 comparison with the principle 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.240
 and so good this would be all 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.330
 basically what we're going to do for 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.700
 last is not letting me leave that we're going to 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.090
 jump delete an example of which 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.310
 after serving our skill what 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.600
 you're going to try finally is to check if 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.290
 The more life becomes more 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.560
 big the video as it gets smaller 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.560
 interesting here we are going to buy 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.699
 here we can see that it is quite large 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.139
 quite big but good we do not know if 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.060
 it's because he's cured for life like this 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.020
 what we are going to do is demonstrate 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.020
 in front we sell it 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.720
 and good if a tad a tad may 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.050
 have grown a tad we are going to try 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.909
 do it another way 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.670
 it looks a little small we are going to go here 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.510
 to life 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.510
 but here 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.300
 to buy life 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.130
 and good if a tad continues to grow while 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.290
 more lives it seems that there is a 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.340
 little bit bigger so good this 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.550
 I would be everything I hope you liked it 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.020
 Any doubt question or suggestion 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.790
