carrot flowers the first video we did

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.310 
carrot flowers the first video we did
actually<00:00:16.189> only<00:00:16.610> used<00:00:16.910> this<00:00:17.119> one<00:00:17.420> tool<00:00:17.750> which

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
actually only used this one tool which

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.109 
actually only used this one tool which
is<00:00:18.529> a<00:00:18.560> citrus<00:00:18.949> Wester<00:00:19.460> that<00:00:19.640> has<00:00:19.790> a<00:00:19.820> little

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
is a citrus Wester that has a little

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.030 
is a citrus Wester that has a little
blade<00:00:20.390> on<00:00:20.599> the<00:00:20.720> side<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.259> there<00:00:21.710> were<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:21.860> few

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
blade on the side and there were a few

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.920 
blade on the side and there were a few
comments<00:00:22.340> that<00:00:22.730> said<00:00:23.150> that<00:00:23.390> they<00:00:23.599> didn't

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
comments that said that they didn't

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.480 
comments that said that they didn't
think<00:00:23.960> that<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.380> flowers<00:00:24.829> were<00:00:24.860> all<00:00:25.250> that

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
think that the flowers were all that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.280 
think that the flowers were all that
flower<00:00:25.820> light<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:26.720> we're<00:00:26.960> going<00:00:27.079> to<00:00:27.140> revisit

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
flower light so we're going to revisit

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.240 
flower light so we're going to revisit
that<00:00:27.739> technique<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:28.399> also<00:00:28.849> try<00:00:29.270> out<00:00:29.450> this<00:00:29.899> new

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
that technique and also try out this new

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.660 
that technique and also try out this new
garnish<00:00:31.250> knife<00:00:31.509> and<00:00:32.509> also<00:00:32.980> this<00:00:33.980> really<00:00:34.460> cool

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
garnish knife and also this really cool

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.700 
garnish knife and also this really cool
new<00:00:35.450> tool<00:00:35.750> this<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.260> actually<00:00:36.739> a<00:00:36.980> carrot<00:00:37.670> corer

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
new tool this is actually a carrot corer

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.010 
new tool this is actually a carrot corer
so<00:00:39.710> we've<00:00:39.950> used<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.969> canal<00:00:41.390> side<00:00:41.719> of<00:00:41.899> the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
so we've used the canal side of the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.950 
so we've used the canal side of the
zester<00:00:42.469> to<00:00:43.129> make<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.879> grooves<00:00:44.239> for<00:00:44.870> the

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
zester to make the grooves for the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.340 
zester to make the grooves for the
flower<00:00:45.199> shape<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.829> then<00:00:46.809> cut<00:00:47.809> them<00:00:48.019> straight

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
flower shape and then cut them straight

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:57.759 
flower shape and then cut them straight
down<00:00:48.760> as<00:00:50.230> thin<00:00:51.230> as<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.649> can<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:56.170> you<00:00:57.170> get<00:00:57.440> the

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
down as thin as you can and you get the

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.759 
down as thin as you can and you get the
cross<00:00:57.980> section<00:00:58.460> which<00:00:59.089> makes<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.480> flower<00:00:59.769> so

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
cross section which makes the flower so

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.139 
cross section which makes the flower so
we're<00:01:00.920> gonna<00:01:01.039> compare<00:01:01.519> these<00:01:01.699> in<00:01:01.879> just<00:01:02.030> a

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
we're gonna compare these in just a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.290 
we're gonna compare these in just a
second<00:01:02.629> this<00:01:02.809> is<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:02.989> vegetable<00:01:03.649> garnish<00:01:04.460> knife

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
second this is a vegetable garnish knife

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.340 
second this is a vegetable garnish knife
that<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.630> found<00:01:06.050> at<00:01:06.409> sur<00:01:07.340> La<00:01:07.490> Table<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.350> it's

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
that I found at sur La Table and it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.810 
that I found at sur La Table and it's
the<00:01:09.800> same<00:01:10.040> idea<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.530> use<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:13.040> knife<00:01:13.190> to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
the same idea that you use the knife to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.359 
the same idea that you use the knife to
cut<00:01:13.850> down<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:14.780> make<00:01:15.259> grooves<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.100> this

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
cut down and make grooves so this

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.980 
cut down and make grooves so this
actually<00:01:16.790> has<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:16.969> little<00:01:17.390> bit<00:01:17.509> more<00:01:17.719> of<00:01:17.899> a

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
actually has a little bit more of a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.190 
actually has a little bit more of a
flower<00:01:18.290> power<00:01:18.710> look<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.570> it's<00:01:20.570> pretty<00:01:20.780> simple

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
flower power look and it's pretty simple

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.100 
flower power look and it's pretty simple
we<00:01:22.009> take<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:23.000> you'll<00:01:23.180> cut<00:01:23.479> down<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
we take it and you'll cut down on the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.830 
we take it and you'll cut down on the
angle<00:01:24.909> this<00:01:25.909> is<00:01:25.969> a<00:01:26.119> little<00:01:26.450> bit<00:01:26.539> more<00:01:26.689> like

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
angle this is a little bit more like

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.050 
angle this is a little bit more like
whittling<00:01:27.350> you're<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:28.039> boy<00:01:28.250> scout<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.789> you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
whittling you're a boy scout and you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.810 
whittling you're a boy scout and you
whittled<00:01:29.479> spend<00:01:30.380> your<00:01:30.530> days<00:01:30.710> sort<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.399> carving

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
whittled spend your days sort of carving

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.770 
whittled spend your days sort of carving
away<00:01:32.380> at<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.409> piece<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.649> wood<00:01:34.039> so<00:01:34.509> you<00:01:35.509> didn't

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
away at a piece of wood so you didn't

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.529 
away at a piece of wood so you didn't
burn<00:01:35.930> down<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.320> forest<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.060> make<00:01:38.360> these

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
burn down the forest so you make these

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:45.279 
burn down the forest so you make these
channels<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.310> again<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.890> slice<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:44.750> make<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
channels and again you slice to make the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.490 
channels and again you slice to make the
flower<00:01:45.560> blossoms<00:01:46.899> these<00:01:47.899> have<00:01:48.140> sort<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.409> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
flower blossoms these have sort of a

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.980 
flower blossoms these have sort of a
more<00:01:48.740> 70s<00:01:49.280> mod<00:01:50.090> feeling<00:01:50.890> very<00:01:51.890> sort<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.219> peppy

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
more 70s mod feeling very sort of peppy

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
now the norpro carrot curler really

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.880 
now the norpro carrot curler really
couldn't<00:01:58.429> be<00:01:58.549> easier<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:59.299> has<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> blade<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.799> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
couldn't be easier it has a blade on the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.490 
couldn't be easier it has a blade on the
outside<00:02:01.369> that's<00:02:01.850> ridged<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.689> you're<00:02:03.320> going

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
outside that's ridged and you're going

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.429 
outside that's ridged and you're going
to<00:02:03.560> take<00:02:03.740> your<00:02:03.920> peel<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.310> carrot<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.439> you're

to take your peel to carrot and you're
just<00:02:06.530> gonna<00:02:06.649> scrape<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.280> down<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.149> we're<00:02:08.420> again

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
just gonna scrape it down so we're again

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.390 
just gonna scrape it down so we're again
fluting<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.250> sides<00:02:11.860> feathering<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.100> sides

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
fluting the sides feathering the sides

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.380 
fluting the sides feathering the sides
of<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.880> carrot<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:16.000> work<00:02:17.000> your<00:02:17.150> way<00:02:17.210> around

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
of the carrot and work your way around

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.180 
of the carrot and work your way around
they<00:02:17.840> don't<00:02:18.020> have<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> all<00:02:18.440> line<00:02:18.740> up<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.040> can

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
they don't have to all line up you can

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.680 
they don't have to all line up you can
kind<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.519> scrape<00:02:20.360> at<00:02:20.599> it<00:02:21.010> because<00:02:22.010> you'll<00:02:22.220> see

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
kind of scrape at it because you'll see

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.670 
kind of scrape at it because you'll see
the<00:02:23.690> next<00:02:23.989> step

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
the next step
