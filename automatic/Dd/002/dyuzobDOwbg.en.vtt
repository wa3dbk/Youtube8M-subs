00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
about those waves because you were you

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.350 
about those waves because you were you
were<00:01:11.020> saying<00:01:11.050> like<00:01:11.350> 500<00:01:11.950> miles<00:01:12.160> for<00:01:12.790> our<00:01:12.820> US

global audience I mean it just

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.080 
global audience I mean it just
extraordinary<00:01:20.320> strength<00:01:21.130> involved<00:01:21.820> in<00:01:21.940> that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
extraordinary strength involved in that

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.480 
extraordinary strength involved in that
and<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.330> say<00:01:22.660> it<00:01:23.080> comes<00:01:23.350> presumably<00:01:24.310> that

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and you say it comes presumably that

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.460 
and you say it comes presumably that
first<00:01:24.820> one<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.360> strongest<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.050> then<00:01:26.230> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
first one is the strongest and then the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.170 
first one is the strongest and then the
ones<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:26.920> follow<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.550> weaker<00:01:27.910> is<00:01:28.030> that

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
ones that follow a weaker is that

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.540 
ones that follow a weaker is that
correct<00:01:28.450> or<00:01:28.630> not<00:01:28.690> not<00:01:29.140> necessarily<00:01:29.800> if<00:01:30.400> you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
correct or not not necessarily if you

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.030 
correct or not not necessarily if you
remember<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.030> abandoned<00:01:31.540> at<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:32.040> tsunami

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
remember in the abandoned at a tsunami

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.730 
remember in the abandoned at a tsunami
the<00:01:33.460> initial<00:01:34.450> one<00:01:34.630> was<00:01:34.840> bad<00:01:35.080> enough<00:01:35.410> but<00:01:35.590> then

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
the initial one was bad enough but then

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.850 
the initial one was bad enough but then
we<00:01:35.890> had<00:01:36.390> essentially<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.780> wave<00:01:38.080> three<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.680> wave

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
we had essentially a wave three and wave

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.970 
we had essentially a wave three and wave
4<00:01:39.220> which<00:01:39.490> were<00:01:39.640> actually<00:01:40.030> higher<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.960> were<00:01:41.620> so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
4 which were actually higher and were so

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.630 
4 which were actually higher and were so
the<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.970> damage<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.810> ongoing<00:01:44.200> right<00:01:44.890> now<00:01:44.920> but

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
the the damage is ongoing right now but

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640 
the the damage is ongoing right now but
may<00:01:45.760> continue<00:01:46.300> over<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.630> next<00:01:46.720> several<00:01:47.350> hours

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
may continue over the next several hours

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.610 
may continue over the next several hours
because<00:01:48.280> we<00:01:49.210> talk<00:01:49.660> about<00:01:49.810> these<00:01:49.990> waves<00:01:50.350> that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
because we talk about these waves that

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.220 
because we talk about these waves that
come<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.100> each<00:01:51.420> successively<00:01:52.420> producing

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
come in each successively producing

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.440 
come in each successively producing
