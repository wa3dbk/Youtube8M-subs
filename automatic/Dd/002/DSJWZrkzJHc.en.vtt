00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.850
 things literally like some 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:33.709

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.980
 to this game 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 this idea arose from the need to give 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.120
 to the shore talk about things sometimes 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.300

 loss on the sale of games 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.389

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.910

 spread but she did not take a riot 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.030
 that most of its history 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.039
 being thus seen in the next face is 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.250
