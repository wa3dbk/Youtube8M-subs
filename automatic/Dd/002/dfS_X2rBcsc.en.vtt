00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 before the arrival of the incredible CDs or 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.899
 video discs 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.410
 the kid already wore her ribbons 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.549
 be mega drive understands super 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:20.789
 nintendo nintendo 64 anyway the deal was 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.460
 well your tapes and if you just like 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 I was not so tape to play 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 best option was to wake up early in a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.990
 friday get dressed up and go running 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.960
 for the rental company to get the best 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.960
 tapes but one thing that was very scary 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.809
 even were you rent the tape her life 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.329
 spoiled by the operation this is a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 something that at least happened with everything 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.360
 You would come home and run to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.360
 play and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.410
 because this is very complicated, only that 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.470
 of course we had our letter up our sleeve 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.960
 it is undoubtedly to blow the tape was a 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.420
 of the things that most marked this time of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.730
 video game for me always worked 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.640
 cartridge did not work or got there 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.120
 blew the tape and played on time 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.210
 some experts because it has 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.970
 specialist for everything today I do not know what it is 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.970
 this is for some experts the act of 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.790
 you blow on the tape not only worked 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.680
 How I ruined the cartridge I do not know 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.080
 You, but I'll think of the following 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.930
 The cartridge is full of dust I'm going to 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.150
 blowing inside it the dust will come out and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.430
 I can play 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.710
 Let me explain some parts better. 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.320
 of the tape were made of copper 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.680
 then when you blew in there as well 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.290
 the blow also went that unit knows 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.110
 that over time could damage the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.420
 cartridge even up to a few 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.150
 super nintendo would not talk to you 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.150
 blasting because this could damage the 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.200
 cartridge and everything else then my life 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.200
 it was a lie 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.360
 seeing from the scientific side let's say 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.440
 really start only the cartridge can 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.570
 It's just going to be lonely. 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.890
 good unless you are 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.530
 collectors and will always call the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.110
 suffer the tape I'll always blow and 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.239
 will always work even because I 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.670
 never had a case of ruining my 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.530
 tape because she only wanted it for me 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.690
 to know if you have any 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.480
