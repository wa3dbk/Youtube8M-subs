00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
world that we live in is one that's full

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.280 
world that we live in is one that's full
of<00:02:39.650> various<00:02:40.400> races<00:02:41.000> various<00:02:41.780> different<00:02:42.080> types

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
of various races various different types

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.190 
of various races various different types
of<00:02:42.470> people<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:43.280> know<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.940> it's<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.930> kind<00:02:45.110> of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
of people you know so it's it kind of

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.840

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.270 

naturally<00:05:50.509> he's<00:05:50.900> he's<00:05:51.590> gonna<00:05:51.710> lend<00:05:51.979> a<00:05:52.099> hand
