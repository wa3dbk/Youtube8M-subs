 magic especially with the cards we start 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.000

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.980
 with some I like for example for 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:04.480
 this trick will suffice 15 likes and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.060
 others will not be revealed because 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.680
 I can't too high level 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.150
 well let's start immediately then for you I have 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.120
 selected of the different cards ie ci 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 they are king of queens as you see 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:28.270
 of the eight of the ten hour boards 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.640
 actually they are identical cards but 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.300
 indeed, these were scattered in random order 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.280
 two do not coincide do not coincide 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.600
 also coincide if you have seen 2 10 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.620
 as now, however, they are of two colors 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:47.650
 also several 28 and 22 no a queen e 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.210
 two queens obviously don't match 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.740
 because they must match as I have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.570
 said by color then effectively 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.220
 I do n't even know why now 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.340
 they are of two different colors but it will suffice 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.200
 put this first card under give 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.860
 a slight shock to the deck that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.860
 magically it will be everything 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.800
 in the exact order of the generous fats 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:23.780
 red two axes black 10 black 10 red 8 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.780
 black 8 red king black and red and queens 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.420
