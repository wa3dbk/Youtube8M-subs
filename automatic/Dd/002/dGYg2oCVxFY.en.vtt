so<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> three<00:00:09.420> different<00:00:09.750> effects<00:00:10.050> you

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
so here the three different effects you

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.009 
so here the three different effects you
can<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.980> same<00:00:11.250> pattern<00:00:11.840> you<00:00:12.840> can

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
can get with the same pattern you can

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.959 
can get with the same pattern you can
use<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.559> almost<00:00:13.740> any<00:00:14.099> pattern<00:00:14.610> as<00:00:14.759> long

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
use that with almost any pattern as long

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.400 
use that with almost any pattern as long
as<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.570> enough<00:00:16.850> folds<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.270> get<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.260> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
as you have enough folds to get a lot of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.320 
as you have enough folds to get a lot of
definition<00:00:20.990> this<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.529> fold<00:00:22.800> all<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.100> way

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
definition this one you fold all the way

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.450 
definition this one you fold all the way
every<00:00:24.330> page<00:00:25.080> all<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> spine<00:00:26.160> well

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
every page all the way to the spine well

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.589 
every page all the way to the spine well
a<00:00:26.670> couple<00:00:27.090> inches<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> spine<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:30.060> top

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
a couple inches from the spine and top

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.340 
a couple inches from the spine and top
and<00:00:30.869> bottom<00:00:32.270> this<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:35.090> is<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:37.020> flat

and bottom this one is all one flat
surface<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.010> front<00:00:38.420> it's<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.870> ghost

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
surface in front it's kind of a ghost

surface in front it's kind of a ghost
image<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.750> this<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.930> goes<00:00:43.050> halfway<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.010> then

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
image and this one goes halfway and then

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.630 
image and this one goes halfway and then
you<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:47.750> folds<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.910 

this<00:00:53.240> is<00:00:53.450> going<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:53.780> be<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.110> normal<00:00:54.650> way<00:00:54.860> to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
this is going to be the normal way to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.370 
this is going to be the normal way to
fold<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.550> book<00:00:55.730> pattern<00:00:56.150> the<00:00:56.600> first<00:00:56.630> way<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:57.350> I

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
fold a book pattern the first way that I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.980 
fold a book pattern the first way that I
would<00:00:57.620> suggest<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.450> that<00:00:59.450> I've<00:00:59.600> been<00:00:59.780> doing

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
would suggest and that I've been doing

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.470 
would suggest and that I've been doing
so<00:01:00.320> far<00:01:00.590> only<00:01:01.580> recently<00:01:02.420> started

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
so far only recently started

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.270 
so far only recently started
experimenting<00:01:03.260> with<00:01:03.650> different<00:01:03.920> ways<00:01:04.129> to

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
experimenting with different ways to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.840 
experimenting with different ways to
fold<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.879> pattern<00:01:05.330> okay<00:01:06.080> this<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.530> heart<00:01:06.980> I've

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
fold a pattern okay this is a heart I've

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.770 
fold a pattern okay this is a heart I've
already<00:01:08.210> folded<00:01:08.680> part<00:01:09.680> of<00:01:09.800> it<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:11.360> see<00:01:11.600> right

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
already folded part of it you see right

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.330 
already folded part of it you see right
here<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:13.670> normal<00:01:14.630> way<00:01:14.780> is<00:01:15.220> you're<00:01:16.220> going

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
here and this normal way is you're going

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.680 
here and this normal way is you're going
to<00:01:16.430> score<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.390> top<00:01:17.979> where<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.160> want<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.450> top

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
to score the top where you want the top

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.650 
to score the top where you want the top
fold<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.200> be<00:01:21.410> score<00:01:22.400> it<00:01:22.490> nice<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.700> deep<00:01:23.270> so

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
fold to be score it nice and deep so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.650 
fold to be score it nice and deep so
that<00:01:24.410> you<00:01:24.560> get<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:25.070> tick<00:01:25.369> mark<00:01:25.420> showing<00:01:26.420> on

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
that you get a tick mark showing on

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.430 
that you get a tick mark showing on
every<00:01:27.619> page<00:01:28.420> right<00:01:29.420> here<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.070> then<00:01:31.420> mark<00:01:32.440> the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
every page right here and then mark the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.070 
every page right here and then mark the
bottom<00:01:33.890> with<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.310> pencil<00:01:34.780> where<00:01:35.780> you're<00:01:35.930> going

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
bottom with a pencil where you're going

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.700 
bottom with a pencil where you're going
to<00:01:36.140> fold<00:01:36.440> make<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.460> bottom<00:01:37.759> fold<00:01:38.470> okay<00:01:39.470> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
to fold make the bottom fold okay and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.219 
to fold make the bottom fold okay and
then<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:40.369> simply<00:01:41.200> stick<00:01:42.200> your<00:01:42.410> pattern

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
then you simply stick your pattern

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.710 
then you simply stick your pattern
behind<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.790> pace<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.119> are<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.450> going<00:01:47.600> to

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
behind the pace that are you going to

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.880 
behind the pace that are you going to
fold<00:01:48.670> which<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.850> just<00:01:50.180> one<00:01:50.360> hook<00:01:50.570> hook<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:51.680> to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
fold which is just one hook hook it to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.550 
fold which is just one hook hook it to
the<00:01:52.009> top<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:54.350> there's<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.710> new<00:01:55.520> tab<00:01:55.910> right<00:01:56.210> there

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
the top so there's a new tab right there

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.969 
the top so there's a new tab right there
that<00:01:57.560> tab<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.100> going<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.430> be<00:01:58.580> hooked<00:01:59.560> to<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
that tab is going to be hooked to the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.420 
that tab is going to be hooked to the
top<00:02:01.190> of<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.460> book

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.919 

so<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:07.399> line<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.479> stripe<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
so and line it up with the stripe that

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.839 
so and line it up with the stripe that
you're<00:02:10.259> working<00:02:10.440> on

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.309 

hold<00:02:14.849> that

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.699 

it<00:02:18.620> helps<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.950> have<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:20.599> little<00:02:21.140> bit<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.379> nails

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
it helps to have a little bit of nails

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:30.009 
it helps to have a little bit of nails
and<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:24.879> fold<00:02:25.879> it<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:28.540> take<00:02:29.540> mark<00:02:29.810> up

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
and then fold it to that take mark up

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.000 
and then fold it to that take mark up
there<00:02:31.629> practice<00:02:32.629> you'll<00:02:33.200> be<00:02:33.319> able<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.800> hit

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
there practice you'll be able to hit

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.470 
there practice you'll be able to hit
that<00:02:34.250> most<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.849> time<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.880> don't<00:02:38.300> worry

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
that most of the time but I don't worry

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.140 
that most of the time but I don't worry
so<00:02:38.569> much<00:02:38.810> about<00:02:39.200> hitting<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.670> this

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
so much about hitting that this and this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.479 
so much about hitting that this and this
are<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.970> important<00:02:44.500> things<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.680> worry<00:02:45.709> about

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
are the important things to worry about

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.119 
are the important things to worry about
so<00:02:46.730> I'm<00:02:46.849> painting<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.510> stripe<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.860> need<00:02:49.010> the

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
so I'm painting that stripe you need the

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.300 
so I'm painting that stripe you need the
bottom<00:02:49.489> there<00:02:50.799> ironing<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.950> with<00:02:52.130> my

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
bottom there ironing it with my

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.440 
bottom there ironing it with my
fingernail<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.569> then<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:56.030> just<00:02:56.239> keep<00:02:56.390> doing

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
fingernail and then you just keep doing

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.319 
fingernail and then you just keep doing
that<00:02:56.780> with<00:02:56.840> every<00:02:57.500> single<00:02:57.739> fold<00:02:58.190> black<00:02:58.940> and

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
that with every single fold black and

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.819 
that with every single fold black and
white<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.769> mark<00:03:01.069> off<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:03.200> one<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> just

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829
