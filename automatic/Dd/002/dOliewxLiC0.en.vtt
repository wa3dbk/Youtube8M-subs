 preambles upload the intro 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.380
 yes 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.679
 in these times of crisis in which the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.020
 attention grows in different corners of the 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.269
 world the ideas to redirect the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.000
 stress and frustration so that you do not 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.980
 cause harm to third parties multiply 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.650
 places where we can break 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.300
 objects facebook pages or others 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.610
 internet sites what we can 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.710
 deposit the least kind words of 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.019
 our vocabulary and now a line 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.440
 phone dedicated to receiving insults 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.839
 if a phone number where you can 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.600
 call to complain 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.269
 Charge yourself in the mother of whom you want 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.879
 and say what comes out of the fundillo 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.580
 experts consider unhealthy the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.440
 expression of negative feelings 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.780
 rabies can accumulate in our 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.509
 inside until you reach a point of no 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.240
 return in which we can not avoid the 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.670
 outburst of anger usually before the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.820
 less indicated person or in the place 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.159
 less appropriate the insult fulfills a 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.590
 first function that is the one of relief 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.539
 some go further and consider that the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.720
 insult is good for health by 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.850
 how much prevents some types of ulcers 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.220
 people insult to overcome the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.410
 importance that a situation causes them 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.690
 that has gone out of hand 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.180
 finally the slightest insults can 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.490
 serve to make loving reproaches to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.650
 the loved ones in these cases is 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.840
 the use of the diminutives that 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.640
 remove the weight to the curse in this 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.740
 case of the diminutives then between 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.060

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.440
 person and you will say come tango and in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.020
 instead of saying sell them afterwards he says 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.380
 pendan twine that's what they refer 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.950
 with a diminutive instead of telling you here 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.570
 they tell him that he agreed he understands if I am 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.459
 that you understood me, we judge ourselves 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.410
