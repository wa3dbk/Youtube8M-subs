make it look better so I love this and I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.140 
make it look better so I love this and I
think<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.590> such<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.860> cute<00:03:32.250> touch<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.000> this

think it's such a cute touch and this

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.360 
think it's such a cute touch and this
look<00:03:33.420> would<00:03:33.600> also<00:03:33.870> be<00:03:34.170> really<00:03:34.620> adorable<00:03:35.280> if

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
look would also be really adorable if

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.250 
look would also be really adorable if
you<00:03:35.519> curled<00:03:35.880> your<00:03:36.000> hair<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.510> kind<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.080> wish<00:03:37.230> that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
you curled your hair I kind of wish that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.199 
you curled your hair I kind of wish that
I<00:03:37.500> did<00:03:37.860> because<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.459> would<00:03:38.580> just<00:03:38.610> make<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.000> with

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
I did because it would just make it with

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.039 
I did because it would just make it with
even<00:03:39.660> better

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
even better

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.740 
even better
so<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.590> recommend<00:03:41.220> doing<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.519> also<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.540> now

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
so I recommend doing that also and now
