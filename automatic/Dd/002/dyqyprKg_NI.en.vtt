00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the Bellevue snow has this shape

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.190 
the Bellevue snow has this shape
and<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.300> should<00:02:12.450> stay<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> shape

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and it should stay in the shape

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.680 
and it should stay in the shape
otherwise<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.010> will<00:02:14.160> lose<00:02:14.400> its<00:02:14.690> flexibility

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
otherwise it will lose its flexibility

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.440 
otherwise it will lose its flexibility
and<00:02:16.019> after<00:02:16.920> some<00:02:17.160> while<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.330> an

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and after some while like it's an

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.229 
and after some while like it's an
elastic<00:02:18.930> band<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.470> will<00:02:19.709> use<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.819> will<00:02:21.030> lose

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
elastic band it will use it will lose

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.930 
elastic band it will use it will lose
the<00:02:21.510> elasticity<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.519> can<00:02:23.730> throw

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
the elasticity and then you can throw

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.880 
the elasticity and then you can throw
