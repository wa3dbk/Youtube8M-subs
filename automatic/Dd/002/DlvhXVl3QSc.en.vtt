time<00:03:11.799> anybody<00:03:12.160> had<00:03:12.310> done<00:03:12.459> that<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:13.060> part<00:03:13.870> of

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
time anybody had done that a part of

time anybody had done that a part of
your<00:03:14.140> brain<00:03:14.410> which<00:03:14.590> reads<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.250> not<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.549> same

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
your brain which reads is not the same

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.190 
your brain which reads is not the same
as<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.000> part<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.299> your<00:03:16.420> brain<00:03:16.660> which<00:03:16.780> looks<00:03:17.049> at

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
as the part of your brain which looks at

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.569 
as the part of your brain which looks at
pictures<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.890> completely<00:03:18.280> different

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
pictures it's a completely different
