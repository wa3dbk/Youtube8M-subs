00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 good in this video I want to make a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.440
 evaluation to a browser that is called 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.599
 stream you can search within the app 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.880
 store 'on your iphone phone with the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.280
 name of web stream as you see it 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.410
 on screen this application is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.140
 completely free and personally 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.750
 I want to talk to you about this because I do not know 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.320
 how many of you suddenly are 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.269
 tired maybe to use the safari to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.460
 the best I do not know how they want 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.560
 rest a little bit from that browser or 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.530
 even because no google chrome's 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.210
 suddenly you need to try something different 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.219
 this browser has some functions 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.739
 quite interesting besides that its 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.420
 design is completely different to what 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.789
 that we have seen here I already have 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.800
 the open application on this side 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.960
 when I click on the box where 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
 we have that search loupe I can 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.969
 here search for any website that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 I want if you notice me it appears 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.770
 automatically the dotcom here for 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.739
 that once I go to that site 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.860
 if I slide my bottom finger towards 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.150
 up appears this control where 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.820
 I can new 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.290
 here write some other address for 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.740
 any other page that I want 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740
 to visit 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.119
 we give him entry and if I went up 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.070
 again this same section 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.700
 I could right here with the symbol of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.619
 more open another tap or another tab in 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.990
 where I could go to any other 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.380
 site 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.270
 here we have it when we 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.549
 we visit different sections of a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 certain page you can return to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.500
 the previous page with only 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.530
 slide your finger from left to right 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.649
 as you really realize this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.479
 browser feels very fast that is 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.960
 different from all the others that I have 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.970
 tested and if you want to slide or 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.950
 switch between tabs the only thing that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.380
 you have to do is open this same 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.509
 section down here and from this side you can 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.399
 transport you from one side or the other if you 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.209
 you want to delete a tab that is already 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.830
 open 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.450
 drag any of these icons 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.760
 out and will automatically pum 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.890
 you eliminate now if you realize 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.290
 we have two options on this side some 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.140
 scissors and this that you see in the part of 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.970
 down if we take the option of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.040
 down here is here 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.750
 we could save videos save 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.459
 publications and so on nothing else that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.680
 it requires us to create a 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.510
 Free account with them if you want 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.860
 create a free account with them 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.350
 using any of these 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.360
 you can do it but the scissors 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.490
 I want to show you what they do if 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.180
 you want to save a certain 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.000
 section of some page you take the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.940
 scissors you put here this box 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.460
 where you like and then 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.640
 You could share it directly to 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.560
 Twitter facebook send it by a message 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.470
 of text inside your phone or 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.910
 send it maybe by email 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.340
 If I give a click to email 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.770
 electronic that you see there I open the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.470
 application of email in 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.640
 where is this photo included that I just 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.459
 to save from that same application I'm going 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.530
 to cancel I give a click outside to 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.370
 to go back to where I was and that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.709
 way I can again continue browsing 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.520
 to other sections now on the side 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.070
 lower right we have control of 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.900
 the settings of the application you 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.140
 Here you can find all those 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.209
 options that we regularly find in 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.310
 the ordinary browsers here 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.400
 if you do not have an account with them 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.950
 and you can create it yourself you can change 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.260
 the size of the text change the search engine 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.470
 that you currently have here you can 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.910
 delete all browsing data 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.550
 such as cookies or 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.150
 cookies you have help sections 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.250
 Contact us section among other things 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.430
 then I hope you enjoy this 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.250
 application is very entertaining very fast 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.800
 and I hope you're really going to like it 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.360
 a lot just before saying goodbye I want to 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.000
 also show you that with this 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.310
 application you can browse a website 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.049
 by means of two different windows more 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.690
 or less I'll show you how to do it 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.580
 for example in this case I am in 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.350
 the google page then from the side 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.900
 right I do not know if you see this control 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.660
 when I give it a click it allows me 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.669
 divide this same page in two 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.030
 sections up here could be 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:40.229
 looking for the best for books and maybe 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.740
 down here by disks a guess and 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.140
 that way I can navigate this same 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.500
 page in two different ways if I 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.630
 I put my finger in the middle 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 can I do this up or towards 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.380
 down and in that way to be able to facilitate 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.620
 to be able to see the text well then 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.050
 I lower it, I disappear, I disappear 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.840
 this section and I return exactly to 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.790
 where I was then I say goodbye 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.710
