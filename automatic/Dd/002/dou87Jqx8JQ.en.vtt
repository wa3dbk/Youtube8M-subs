00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 July 10, 2011 Chubu International Airport Centrair 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 9:10 Garuda Indonesia Airlines Flight 888 Denpasar (Bali) to A330-300 PK-GBD 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Japan Transocean Air Flight 253 for Naha B737-400 (Back) 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 Bravo-Taxiway (induction route B) → Delta 6 south (induction route D6 south) → SPOT 12 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 The Centrair has been equipped with a docking system from the outset and no marshallers except for open spots 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Lufthansa German Airlines 736 flights from Frankfurt A340-300 D-AJGD 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 There are many small machines such as MD90 at this 12th spot, but A330 seems to not stop very much. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 It came to the 12th because the 27th and 28th spots were occupied by B787 and B747LCF on this day 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.066
 It seems to connect to L2 door instead of L1 because there is only one PBB 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 Lufthansa 736 flight landed just a while ago 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 The A330 and A340 are so-called sister machines developed almost simultaneously
