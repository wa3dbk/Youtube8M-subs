have<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.769> play<00:02:10.950> around<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.549> i'd<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.880> to

have to play around with it i'd like to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
have to play around with it i'd like to
think<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.329> could<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.630> little<00:02:13.049> bit<00:02:13.260> louder

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
think it could be a little bit louder

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.430 
think it could be a little bit louder
than<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.180> i<00:02:15.450> will<00:02:15.810> keep<00:02:15.840> working<00:02:16.170> with

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
than it is but i will keep working with

than it is but i will keep working with
it
