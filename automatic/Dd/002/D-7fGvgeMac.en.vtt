voice actor of the toy soldier sounds so

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.410 
voice actor of the toy soldier sounds so
much<00:03:00.170> like<00:03:00.230> guy<00:03:00.680> from<00:03:01.489> Naruto<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.300> kind

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
much like guy from Naruto that it's kind

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.060 
much like guy from Naruto that it's kind
of<00:03:02.570> distracting<00:03:02.900> but<00:03:03.350> it's<00:03:03.470> definitely<00:03:03.739> not

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
of distracting but it's definitely not

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.560 
of distracting but it's definitely not
guy<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.580> completely<00:03:04.970> different<00:03:05.390> voice

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
guy it's a completely different voice

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.240 
guy it's a completely different voice
actor<00:03:06.050> but<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.560> just<00:03:06.770> thought<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:06.920> was<00:03:07.130> really

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
actor but I just thought that was really

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.530 
actor but I just thought that was really
funny<00:03:07.370> when<00:03:07.700> he<00:03:07.760> came<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.180> he<00:03:08.330> did<00:03:08.510> that

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
funny when he came in and he did that

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.240 
funny when he came in and he did that
kick<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.110> kick<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.470> guy<00:03:09.620> in<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.830> boat<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
kick and kick that guy in the boat I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.190 
kick and kick that guy in the boat I
just<00:03:10.790> couldn't<00:03:11.000> help<00:03:11.239> but<00:03:11.360> think<00:03:11.510> he's<00:03:11.959> gonna

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
just couldn't help but think he's gonna

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.260 
just couldn't help but think he's gonna
say<00:03:12.440> dynamic<00:03:12.980> entry<00:03:13.310> isn't<00:03:13.550> he<00:03:13.730> just<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.180> would

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
say dynamic entry isn't he just it would

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.180

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
soldier as being like anything like of a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.560

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
big like physical threat in the series

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.390 
big like physical threat in the series
but<00:04:52.600> he's<00:04:52.840> definitely<00:04:53.020> going<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.530> be<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> really

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
but he's definitely going to be a really

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400 
but he's definitely going to be a really
important<00:04:54.910> character<00:04:55.270> for<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.480> arc<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.050> it

really<00:05:16.150> really<00:05:16.420> funny<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:17.260> was<00:05:17.410> just<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.650> nice

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
really really funny this was just a nice

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.350 
really really funny this was just a nice
episode<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.520> one<00:05:18.700> piece<00:05:18.850> that<00:05:19.060> had<00:05:19.180> some

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
episode of one piece that had some

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.240 
episode of one piece that had some
really<00:05:19.660> good<00:05:19.810> pacing<00:05:20.230> went<00:05:21.010> through<00:05:21.160> a

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
really good pacing went through a

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.130 
really good pacing went through a
backstory<00:05:21.670> nice<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.270> quick<00:05:22.480> and<00:05:22.720> it

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
backstory nice and quick and it

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.780 
backstory nice and quick and it
definitely<00:05:23.350> painted<00:05:23.890> Rebecca<00:05:24.220> as<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.550> very

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
definitely painted Rebecca as a very

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.760 
definitely painted Rebecca as a very
important<00:05:25.300> character<00:05:25.660> who<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.170> still<00:05:26.440> believe

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
important character who I still believe

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.740 
important character who I still believe
is<00:05:27.010> one<00:05:27.190> of<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.370> best<00:05:27.670> candidates<00:05:28.210> for<00:05:28.330> straw

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
is one of the best candidates for straw

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.900 
is one of the best candidates for straw
hat<00:05:28.960> pirates<00:05:29.200> the<00:05:29.860> only<00:05:30.340> other<00:05:30.370> one<00:05:30.670> at<00:05:30.820> this

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
hat pirates the only other one at this

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.010 
hat pirates the only other one at this
moment<00:05:31.120> I<00:05:31.300> think<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.630> would<00:05:31.720> be<00:05:31.810> another

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
moment I think it would be another

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.540 
moment I think it would be another
really<00:05:32.230> strong<00:05:32.590> candidate<00:05:33.070> would<00:05:33.190> probably

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
really strong candidate would probably

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.640 
really strong candidate would probably
be<00:05:33.670> Bartolomeo<00:05:34.510> but<00:05:35.170> that's<00:05:35.350> just<00:05:35.470> because

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
be Bartolomeo but that's just because

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.440 
be Bartolomeo but that's just because
that<00:05:35.950> guy<00:05:36.100> is<00:05:36.130> just<00:05:36.310> absolutely<00:05:36.670> ridiculous

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
that guy is just absolutely ridiculous

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.150 
that guy is just absolutely ridiculous
and<00:05:37.540> he<00:05:37.660> has<00:05:37.840> just<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:38.110> weird<00:05:38.380> hard-on<00:05:38.830> for<00:05:38.860> the

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
and he has just a weird hard-on for the

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.580 
and he has just a weird hard-on for the
straw<00:05:39.370> hat<00:05:39.580> pirates<00:05:39.790> otherwise<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:41.050> really

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
straw hat pirates otherwise I really

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.290 
straw hat pirates otherwise I really
liked<00:05:41.830> this<00:05:42.010> episode<00:05:42.160> a<00:05:42.550> lot<00:05:42.820> you<00:05:43.060> know<00:05:43.180> they

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
liked this episode a lot you know they

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.820 
liked this episode a lot you know they
could<00:05:43.450> have<00:05:43.540> maybe<00:05:43.750> trimmed<00:05:44.200> up<00:05:44.320> some<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.740> the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
could have maybe trimmed up some of the

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.410 
could have maybe trimmed up some of the
stuff<00:05:45.100> in<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.490> first<00:05:45.820> part<00:05:46.120> of<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.300> episode

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
stuff in the first part of the episode

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.660 
stuff in the first part of the episode
and<00:05:46.900> maybe<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.170> little<00:05:47.230> bit<00:05:47.590> at<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.710> end<00:05:47.830> but

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
and maybe a little bit at the end but

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.790 
and maybe a little bit at the end but
otherwise<00:05:48.970> this<00:05:49.540> was<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.750> great<00:05:50.170> backstory<00:05:50.740> for

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
otherwise this was a great backstory for

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.440 
otherwise this was a great backstory for
Rebecca<00:05:51.400> which<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:51.640> think<00:05:51.820> was<00:05:51.910> handled<00:05:52.270> really

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
Rebecca which I think was handled really

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.420 
Rebecca which I think was handled really
well<00:05:52.600> a<00:05:52.930> damn<00:05:53.170> near<00:05:53.380> perfect<00:05:53.620> episode<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:54.400> I

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
well a damn near perfect episode that I

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.500 
well a damn near perfect episode that I
think<00:05:54.610> you<00:05:54.670> guys<00:05:54.820> should<00:05:54.850> definitely<00:05:55.150> check
