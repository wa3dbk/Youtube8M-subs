00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
two units right there beside the board

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.629 
he takes his Hydra and scoots them to
the<00:04:38.870> other<00:04:39.050> side<00:04:39.289> of<00:04:39.349> that<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:40.129> building

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
the other side of that that building

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.959 
the other side of that that building
because<00:04:41.389> I<00:04:41.479> was<00:04:41.629> shooting<00:04:41.780> at<00:04:42.020> him<00:04:42.110> with<00:04:42.259> Maya

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
because I was shooting at him with Maya

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.490 
because I was shooting at him with Maya
with<00:04:43.969> my<00:04:44.150> archers<00:04:44.780> because<00:04:45.050> they<00:04:45.349> have

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
with my archers because they have

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.260 
with my archers because they have
flaming<00:04:45.889> arrows<00:04:46.159> and<00:04:46.400> so<00:04:46.580> he<00:04:46.849> doesn't<00:04:47.000> get<00:04:47.150> to

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
flaming arrows and so he doesn't get to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.300 
flaming arrows and so he doesn't get to
regenerate<00:04:47.659> rule<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:48.080> didn't<00:04:48.530> do<00:04:48.620> any<00:04:48.740> wood<00:04:48.949> any

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
regenerate rule I didn't do any wood any

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.770 
regenerate rule I didn't do any wood any
wounds<00:04:49.849> but<00:04:49.969> I<00:04:50.030> think<00:04:50.210> he's<00:04:50.300> worried<00:04:50.539> about<00:04:50.599> my

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
wounds but I think he's worried about my

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.219 
wounds but I think he's worried about my
trebuchet<00:04:51.199> and<00:04:51.349> about<00:04:51.469> those<00:04:51.620> those<00:04:52.009> archers

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229

pushes<00:04:54.229> his<00:04:54.349> blackguard<00:04:54.800> forward<00:04:55.099> and<00:04:55.250> still

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
pushes his blackguard forward and still

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.869

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
hanging back with his chariots so I was

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.219 
hanging back with his chariots so I was
I<00:04:59.030> was<00:04:59.120> actually<00:04:59.449> liking<00:04:59.599> what<00:04:59.810> i<00:04:59.870> was<00:05:00.050> seeing

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
looking pretty promising the other side

then chased him down so very

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.510 
then chased him down so very
disappointed<00:06:04.879> in<00:06:05.120> that<00:06:05.150> development<00:06:05.629> and

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
disappointed in that development and

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.170 
disappointed in that development and
anything<00:06:07.520> that<00:06:07.550> would<00:06:07.729> really<00:06:07.849> affect<00:06:07.969> the

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
anything that would really affect the

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.490 
anything that would really affect the
game<00:06:08.389> all<00:06:08.539> that<00:06:08.659> much<00:06:08.810> but<00:06:08.990> it<00:06:09.080> was<00:06:09.169> certainly

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
game all that much but it was certainly

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.350 
game all that much but it was certainly
disappointing<00:06:10.189> i<00:06:10.279> thought<00:06:10.460> i<00:06:10.490> had<00:06:10.639> that<00:06:10.849> the

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
disappointing i thought i had that the

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.939 
disappointing i thought i had that the
the<00:06:11.750> odds<00:06:11.900> on<00:06:12.169> that<00:06:12.199> one<00:06:14.560> so<00:06:15.560> at<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.770> end<00:06:15.800> of

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
the odds on that one so at the end of

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.100 
the odds on that one so at the end of
his<00:06:16.069> turn<00:06:16.279> over<00:06:16.550> on<00:06:16.639> this<00:06:16.729> side<00:06:16.789> I'm<00:06:17.210> still

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
his turn over on this side I'm still

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.369 
his turn over on this side I'm still
locked<00:06:18.289> in<00:06:18.500> combat<00:06:18.740> with<00:06:18.979> two<00:06:19.550> units<00:06:19.939> of<00:06:20.379> Dark

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
locked in combat with two units of Dark

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.170 
locked in combat with two units of Dark
Riders<00:06:21.589> you<00:06:21.919> can<00:06:22.039> kind<00:06:22.400> of<00:06:22.460> tell<00:06:22.639> there's<00:06:22.849> two

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
Riders you can kind of tell there's two

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.869 
Riders you can kind of tell there's two
and<00:06:23.539> then<00:06:23.810> there's<00:06:23.990> one<00:06:24.669> another's<00:06:25.669> three

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:25.879 
and then there's one another's three

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:26.769 
and then there's one another's three
total<00:06:26.210> that's<00:06:26.360> actually<00:06:26.629> two<00:06:26.750> different

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:26.779 
total that's actually two different

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.920 
total that's actually two different
units<00:06:27.289> there<00:06:27.819> so<00:06:28.819> that<00:06:28.849> battle<00:06:29.330> rages<00:06:29.689> on<00:06:29.779> on

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
units there so that battle rages on on

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.480 
units there so that battle rages on on
the<00:06:29.990> left<00:06:30.229> so<00:06:30.439> those<00:06:30.589> fastcap<00:06:31.069> are<00:06:31.219> hanging

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
the left so those fastcap are hanging

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.219 
the left so those fastcap are hanging
out<00:06:31.610> a<00:06:31.849> lot<00:06:32.449> longer<00:06:32.689> than<00:06:32.960> I<00:06:33.050> would<00:06:33.199> have

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
out a lot longer than I would have

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.899 
out a lot longer than I would have
expected<00:06:33.409> them<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.889> with<00:06:34.129> my<00:06:34.219> Pegasus<00:06:34.669> nights

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
expected them to with my Pegasus nights

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:37.959 
expected them to with my Pegasus nights
so

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 
so

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.959 
so
here<00:06:38.149> we<00:06:38.239> go<00:06:38.979> Brett<00:06:39.979> turn<00:06:40.189> to<00:06:40.399> he's<00:06:40.610> got<00:06:40.789> his

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
here we go Brett turn to he's got his

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.439 
here we go Brett turn to he's got his
unit<00:06:41.269> down<00:06:41.689> to<00:06:42.099> eight<00:06:43.099> or<00:06:43.339> nine<00:06:43.489> people<00:06:44.389> in

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
unit down to eight or nine people in

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.659 
unit down to eight or nine people in
that<00:06:44.509> black<00:06:44.749> guard<00:06:44.929> unit<00:06:45.319> there's<00:06:45.559> a<00:06:45.649> one<00:06:46.369> Lord

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
that black guard unit there's a one Lord

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.419 
that black guard unit there's a one Lord
in<00:06:46.789> the<00:06:46.879> rest<00:06:47.089> of<00:06:47.209> black<00:06:47.360> art<00:06:47.949> so<00:06:48.949> I<00:06:48.979> decided<00:06:49.339> to

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:49.429 
in the rest of black art so I decided to

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:52.239 
in the rest of black art so I decided to
take<00:06:49.579> my<00:06:49.819> um<00:06:50.469> well<00:06:51.469> what<00:06:51.679> you<00:06:51.799> see<00:06:51.949> there<00:06:52.129> the

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:52.249 
take my um well what you see there the

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:53.409 
take my um well what you see there the
Grail<00:06:52.429> Knights<00:06:52.610> in<00:06:52.879> that<00:06:52.999> big<00:06:53.179> block<00:06:53.389> of

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
Grail Knights in that big block of

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.529 
Grail Knights in that big block of
knights-errant<00:06:53.929> and<00:06:54.439> I<00:06:55.219> think<00:06:55.549> I<00:06:55.789> know<00:06:56.329> as

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
knights-errant and I think I know as

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.279 
knights-errant and I think I know as
North<00:06:56.749> Lords<00:06:57.229> can<00:06:57.349> be<00:06:57.439> kind<00:06:57.619> of<00:06:57.709> nasty<00:06:57.860> and<00:06:59.289> he

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
North Lords can be kind of nasty and he

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.959 
North Lords can be kind of nasty and he
probably<00:07:00.529> has<00:07:00.739> an<00:07:00.860> assassin<00:07:01.399> in<00:07:01.459> there<00:07:01.669> but

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:01.969 
probably has an assassin in there but

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:04.299 
probably has an assassin in there but
that's<00:07:02.449> a<00:07:02.659> lot<00:07:02.899> of<00:07:02.929> attacks<00:07:03.409> and<00:07:03.649> these<00:07:03.799> black

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:04.309 
that's a lot of attacks and these black

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:05.859 
that's a lot of attacks and these black
nights<00:07:04.610> are<00:07:04.849> tough<00:07:04.879> and<00:07:05.209> a<00:07:05.299> lot<00:07:05.389> of<00:07:05.509> ways<00:07:05.659> with

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:05.869 
nights are tough and a lot of ways with

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:08.739 
nights are tough and a lot of ways with
a<00:07:05.899> fairly<00:07:06.319> easy<00:07:06.469> to<00:07:06.619> kill<00:07:06.860> and<00:07:07.509> even<00:07:08.509> with<00:07:08.629> his

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:08.749 
a fairly easy to kill and even with his

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:10.629 
a fairly easy to kill and even with his
always<00:07:09.079> strike<00:07:09.289> first<00:07:09.559> I<00:07:09.799> mean<00:07:10.009> there's<00:07:10.489> only

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 
always strike first I mean there's only

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.629 
always strike first I mean there's only
a<00:07:10.729> few<00:07:10.879> guys<00:07:11.059> up<00:07:11.269> in<00:07:11.329> the<00:07:11.419> front<00:07:11.629> row<00:07:11.779> so<00:07:12.639> pretty
