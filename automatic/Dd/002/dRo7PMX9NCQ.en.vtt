mix it's too large level scoops of warm
water<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.860> water<00:00:35.040> shouldn't<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.340> too<00:00:35.489> hot<00:00:35.730> it

temperature just adding the two scoops
of<00:00:41.399> warm<00:00:41.760> water<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> stir<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of warm water now I'm going to stir it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.540 
of warm water now I'm going to stir it
up<00:00:43.850> make<00:00:44.850> sure<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> there's<00:00:45.239> no<00:00:45.360> lumps<00:00:45.809> or

anything left of the powder in the mix

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.130 
anything left of the powder in the mix
so<00:00:50.190> remove<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> top<00:00:50.910> cap<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> cake<00:00:51.899> pop

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so remove the top cap of the cake pop

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.729 
so remove the top cap of the cake pop
maker<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.270> scrape<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.539> batter<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.350> top

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
maker and scrape the batter into the top

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
maker and scrape the batter into the top
chamber<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:57.059> sure<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.360> everything<00:00:57.719> in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
chamber make sure you get everything in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.430 
chamber make sure you get everything in
there<00:00:59.210> just<00:01:00.210> scrape<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.449> sides<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:00.960> Bowl<00:01:01.140> make

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there just scrape the sides or Bowl make

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110 
there just scrape the sides or Bowl make
sure<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.370> replace

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
sure it's all in there and then replace

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.810 
sure it's all in there and then replace
the<00:01:03.359> top<00:01:03.510> cap<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:07.280> next<00:01:08.280> we're<00:01:08.369> gonna<00:01:08.460> start

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the top cap and next we're gonna start

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.760 
the top cap and next we're gonna start
to<00:01:08.909> fill<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> mold<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> close-up

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
to fill the mold so this is a close-up

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.330 
to fill the mold so this is a close-up
view<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> batter<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.409> come<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.770> pretty

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
view so the batter will come out pretty

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.950 
view so the batter will come out pretty
quickly<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> turn<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> crank

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
quickly so you have to turn the crank

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440 
quickly so you have to turn the crank
very<00:01:16.320> slowly<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.130> keep<00:01:17.159> control<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
very slowly to keep control of it and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.350 
very slowly to keep control of it and
it's<00:01:18.930> gonna<00:01:19.020> spiral<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.729> try<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> fill

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it's gonna spiral down and try to fill

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's gonna spiral down and try to fill
it<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.750> much<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.350> possibly<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:23.540> then

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it up as much as you possibly can then

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.770 
it up as much as you possibly can then
rotate<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.259> tray<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.890> just<00:01:29.450> keep<00:01:30.450> filling

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
rotate the tray and just keep filling

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.840 
rotate the tray and just keep filling
the<00:01:30.990> mold<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.409> go<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.829> slowly<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.729> can

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the mold so go very slowly so you can

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.760 
the mold so go very slowly so you can
fill<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.240> much<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.110> possible<00:01:34.680> if

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
fill up as much in there as possible if

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.100 
fill up as much in there as possible if
you<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:34.979> fast<00:01:35.250> it'll<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.970> sort<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> make<00:01:36.960> our

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you go fast it'll just sort of make our

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.260 
you go fast it'll just sort of make our
vertical<00:01:37.530> stack<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> won't<00:01:38.549> fill<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
vertical stack and it won't fill the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.859 
vertical stack and it won't fill the
mold<00:01:39.479> nicely<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> keep<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.750> you're<00:01:42.750> gonna

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
mold nicely so keep going you're gonna

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
mold nicely so keep going you're gonna
continue<00:01:43.079> doing<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.680> until<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:44.130> four

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
continue doing this until all four

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.179 
continue doing this until all four
spheres<00:01:45.450> are<00:01:45.869> filled<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:48.439> and<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.680> cake<00:01:49.920> mix

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
spheres are filled up and the cake mix

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.520 
spheres are filled up and the cake mix
is<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> expand<00:01:51.090> over<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:52.020> fact<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
is going to expand over time in fact it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.870 
is going to expand over time in fact it
grows<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> fridge

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
grows when it's in the fridge

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.510 
grows when it's in the fridge
so<00:01:54.479> don't<00:01:55.320> worry<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.100> doesn't<00:01:56.369> completely

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
so don't worry if it doesn't completely

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.109 
so don't worry if it doesn't completely
