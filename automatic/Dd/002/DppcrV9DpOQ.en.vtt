 beauty talk, I play another video on 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.429
 channel to start this new series this 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.730
 year this new project is where I will 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:21.539
 to mount a drone in the case of a quadricopter 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 so I already bought the parts 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.300
 just that most do not think yet come 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.400
 These are the ones I got here. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.690
 showing I'll show you to ask 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.130
 explain to ask each of them of this 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.579
 video is more to say that I go 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.140
 really start this series of videos 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.840
 this step by step project I'm showing 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.750
 how to build how to program the pieces 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.329
 what to buy 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.370
 so I'll show you how fast I 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.600
 I already have 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:02.090
 mut was the parent plate where wii 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 It has all the sensors. It's made for 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.820
 this drones condition application 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.540
 and several more. 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.600
 others 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.189
 she has all the sensors the inputs 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.930
 to put engine oesp everything right 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 along with this account with the mutual and came 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.570
 ftd mec is responsible for converting is the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.659
 code pass the code via usb to the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.650
 board 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.650
 the usb cable and those of ample 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.740
 well I also bought a kit where they came 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.180
 the engine the engine 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:02.789
 esc seat and ai 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:07.229
 the two years I ask is 1,000 kv there 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:14.180
 come the brackets and to sell and the brake 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:19.380
 in the structure of the copy frame also 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.140
 in this piece to hold them in case 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.069
 two came to the right and 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.549
 left 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.600
 depending on where you put the 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.750
 motor 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.880
 you'll have to use the different propeller 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.100
 both times it is good that they have reservation also and 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.190
 the parts here to attach the propeller 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.190
 motor 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.459
 as I explain how with 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.880
 where to put the series in the new engine 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.510
 how to fit the parts assembly 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.780
 All I'm going to explain is how it went. 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.470
 passing the videos well I think it is 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.079
 responsible for the control of engines 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.540
 This is what came here is like me 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.049
 I said a kit but you can buy 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.040
 also separate the motors better is not 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:20.100
 the best but I'm buying more 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:23.489
 advantage to buy this kit and I already bought it 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.019
 22 more kits 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:32.100
 You only need to buy one more. 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.090
 Also the frame has not yet come to 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.090
 I bought 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:44.250
 is a charge warning plate 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.630
 I will explain that it will be to call all the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.000
 skeptics together 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.500
 the battery did not buy control too 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.680
 No, but how late it is then I'm 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.720
 buying little by little and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.940
 is also coming a little bit in 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.660
 A little bit then as it came. 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.920
 I'll do the videos to show you 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.650
 you 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.820
 so people are already enrolled in the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:17.250
 channel of a like share if it is not 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:19.290
 subscriber is still registered and I am also 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.489
 has a design and battery that is in 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.670
 progress 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:29.580
 It's more than half a million, it's like that. 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.340
 take a look there too cool project and 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.500
 other projects will also come 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.610
 quite 10 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.610
