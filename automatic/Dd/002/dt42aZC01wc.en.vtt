00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.600 
ahead and cut this and this is pretty
much<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:20.950> did<00:02:21.069> come<00:02:21.280> out<00:02:21.310> right<00:02:21.670> here<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:23.610> now

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
much what did come out right here so now

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.050 
much what did come out right here so now
this<00:02:24.879> is<00:02:25.060> out<00:02:25.299> what<00:02:25.629> I'll<00:02:25.750> do<00:02:25.989> is<00:02:26.849> I'm<00:02:27.849> going<00:02:28.000> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
this is out what I'll do is I'm going to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.170 
this is out what I'll do is I'm going to
add<00:02:28.209> an<00:02:28.480> edge<00:02:28.769> one<00:02:29.769> here<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.310> edge<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.909> here

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
add an edge one here and edge up here

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.500 
add an edge one here and edge up here
and<00:02:31.390> edge<00:02:31.540> over<00:02:31.780> here<00:02:31.870> I'll<00:02:32.140> weld<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.650> there

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and edge over here I'll weld it on there

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.490 
and edge over here I'll weld it on there
if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.659> don't<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.959> welder<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.319> can

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
if you don't have a welder you can

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.110 
if you don't have a welder you can
probably<00:02:35.709> screw<00:02:36.010> gun<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.459> both<00:02:36.579> sides<00:02:36.640> as

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
probably screw gun it to both sides as

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.550 
probably screw gun it to both sides as
long<00:02:37.299> as<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.569> put<00:02:37.720> weather<00:02:37.930> stripping<00:02:38.349> down

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
long as you put weather stripping down

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.259 
long as you put weather stripping down
and<00:02:38.829> that<00:02:39.459> way<00:02:39.579> you'll<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.879> sealed<00:02:40.209> unit

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
and that way you'll have a sealed unit

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.149 
and that way you'll have a sealed unit
and<00:02:40.690> that's<00:02:40.959> underneath<00:02:41.290> your<00:02:41.500> seat<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:41.980> it's

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
and that's underneath your seat so it's

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.349 
and that's underneath your seat so it's
not<00:02:42.280> really<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.549> big<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> deal<00:02:42.970> you're<00:02:43.180> never

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
not really that big a deal you're never

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.569 
not really that big a deal you're never
going<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.599> see<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:43.900> but<00:02:44.530> here's<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.400> great

wrenches no big deal when you slide this
up<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:00.930> sideways<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.139> little<00:03:02.319> bit<00:03:02.560> it'll<00:03:03.069> pull

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
up and sideways a little bit it'll pull

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.770 
up and sideways a little bit it'll pull
right<00:03:03.459> on<00:03:03.519> out<00:03:03.849> so<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.269> way<00:03:04.389> you<00:03:04.450> don't<00:03:04.540> have

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
right on out so that way you don't have

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.599 
right on out so that way you don't have
to<00:03:04.930> drop<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.500> tank<00:03:05.680> anymore

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
to drop the tank anymore

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.759 
to drop the tank anymore
this<00:03:06.909> one<00:03:07.090> does<00:03:07.209> repairs<00:03:07.569> that<00:03:07.930> if<00:03:08.349> you've

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
already got the tank down because your

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.569 
already got the tank down because your
pumps<00:03:10.629> bad<00:03:10.840> cut<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.829> out<00:03:12.010> i'ma<00:03:12.310> put<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
pumps bad cut this out i'ma put the

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.699 
pumps bad cut this out i'ma put the
diagram<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.239> there<00:03:13.450> measurements<00:03:14.409> what<00:03:14.560> you

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
diagram on there measurements what you

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.339 
diagram on there measurements what you
need<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.920> cut<00:03:15.099> out<00:03:15.129> where<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.609> is<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.199> that<00:03:17.199> way

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
need to cut out where it is and that way

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.009 
need to cut out where it is and that way
you<00:03:18.340> can<00:03:18.669> be<00:03:18.819> self-sufficient<00:03:19.209> next<00:03:19.690> time<00:03:19.840> but

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
you can be self-sufficient next time but

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.210 
you can be self-sufficient next time but
I<00:03:20.049> didn't<00:03:20.290> have<00:03:20.379> to<00:03:20.470> take<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> tank<00:03:20.859> down<00:03:21.040> if

the<00:03:33.760> finished<00:03:34.030> product<00:03:34.389> of<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.660> but<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.079> is

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the finished product of it but this is

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.080 
the finished product of it but this is
pretty<00:03:35.500> much<00:03:35.680> what<00:03:35.859> I've<00:03:35.980> done<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.760> it's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
pretty much what I've done and it's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.229 
pretty much what I've done and it's
right<00:03:37.329> there<00:03:38.519> now<00:03:39.519> let<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:39.910> ledge<00:03:40.209> right

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
right there now let this ledge right

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.569 
right there now let this ledge right
here<00:03:40.510> because<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.680> double-sided<00:03:42.190> and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
here because this is double-sided and

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.250 
here because this is double-sided and
I'm<00:03:43.030> just<00:03:43.239> going<00:03:43.359> to<00:03:43.419> go<00:03:43.510> ahead<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:43.930> put<00:03:44.139> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
I'm just going to go ahead and put the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.080 
I'm just going to go ahead and put the
screws<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.530> hold<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:44.980> because<00:03:45.519> if<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.760> lift<00:03:45.970> it

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
screws to hold it because if you lift it

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.369 
screws to hold it because if you lift it
up<00:03:46.209> like<00:03:46.359> I<00:03:46.419> said<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.840> come<00:03:47.019> this<00:03:47.169> way<00:03:47.230> a
