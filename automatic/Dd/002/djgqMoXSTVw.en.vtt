I'm<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> explain<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.050> really

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
Dro is actually already set to auto and

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.850 
Dro is actually already set to auto and
this<00:00:36.809> creates<00:00:37.350> havoc<00:00:38.329> in<00:00:39.329> auto<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.620> get

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this creates havoc in auto you can get

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
this creates havoc in auto you can get
images<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.370> people<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:42.660> look<00:00:43.230> like

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
images of people that actually look like

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.860 
images of people that actually look like
they've<00:00:44.190> been<00:00:44.219> shot<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> flash<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.719> in

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
they've been shot with a flash when in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.850 
they've been shot with a flash when in
reality<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.059> just

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
reality you know it's just

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.049 
reality you know it's just
overcompensating<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:49.890> too<00:00:50.250> much<00:00:50.370> shadow<00:00:50.700> or

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
overcompensating for too much shadow or

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
overcompensating for too much shadow or
too<00:00:51.270> much<00:00:51.420> highlight<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.320> creates<00:00:52.649> noise

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
too much highlight and it creates noise

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.790 
too much highlight and it creates noise
because<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:53.850> adjusting<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> image<00:00:54.800> so

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
because it's over adjusting the image so

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
because it's over adjusting the image so
I<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> leave<00:00:56.460> mine<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.730> level<00:00:57.180> 2<00:00:57.420> now

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I like to leave mine on level 2 now

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
I like to leave mine on level 2 now
really<00:00:58.590> quick<00:00:58.890> I'm<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> level

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
really quick I'm going to go up to level

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.160 
really quick I'm going to go up to level
5<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.899> I'll<00:01:01.109> set<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.620> level<00:01:01.829> 5<00:01:03.170> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
5 here and I'll set it on level 5 and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
5 here and I'll set it on level 5 and
now<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.710> obviously<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.670> it's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
now you can obviously see what it's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.190 
now you can obviously see what it's
doing<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> me<00:01:06.390> through<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> back<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
doing to me through the back of the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.310 
doing to me through the back of the
camera<00:01:07.729> it's<00:01:08.729> making<00:01:09.119> me<00:01:09.210> look<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:10.140> low

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
camera it's making me look very low

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560 
camera it's making me look very low
contrast<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> over<00:01:11.850> saturating

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
contrast and kind of over saturating

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
contrast and kind of over saturating
everything<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.229> making<00:01:13.890> me<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:14.490> look

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
everything and making me actually look

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.070 
everything and making me actually look
just<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.150> blown<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> that's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
just a little blown out and that's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.660 
just a little blown out and that's
really<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.770> want<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.369> video

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
really not what we want to do for video

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.080 
really not what we want to do for video
gives<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> horrible<00:01:19.110> looking<00:01:19.380> video<00:01:20.090> okay

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
gives you a horrible looking video okay

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.899 
gives you a horrible looking video okay
so<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.720> back<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so if we go back over here and we go to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.370 
so if we go back over here and we go to
the<00:01:24.150> menu<00:01:24.299> again<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.070> we<00:01:26.070> create<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.380> change

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the menu again and we create the change

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.039 
the menu again and we create the change
the<00:01:28.590> setting<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.979> -<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:30.150> -<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.840> actually

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the setting to - I think - is actually

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.770 
the setting to - I think - is actually
the<00:01:31.439> best<00:01:31.619> number<00:01:32.150> because<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.540> gives

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the best number because it just gives

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.170 
the best number because it just gives
you<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.619> slightest<00:01:35.130> bit<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:36.530> information<00:01:38.180> in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you the slightest bit of information in

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.910 
you the slightest bit of information in
the<00:01:39.509> highlights<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:40.770> more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the highlights and a little bit more

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.730 
the highlights and a little bit more
information<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> shadows<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.500> also

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
information in the shadows and this also

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
information in the shadows and this also
gives<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.490> videos<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> better<00:01:45.869> dynamic<00:01:46.500> range

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
gives your videos a better dynamic range

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.100 
gives your videos a better dynamic range
overall<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> don't<00:01:48.659> ever<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
overall so really you don't ever need to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
overall so really you don't ever need to
go<00:01:49.290> above<00:01:49.590> 2<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> keep<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.369> natural<00:01:50.520> looking

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
go above 2 to keep it natural looking

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
go above 2 to keep it natural looking
while<00:01:51.299> still<00:01:51.570> keeping<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.049> nice<00:01:52.200> now<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.189> cool

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
while still keeping it nice now the cool

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.950 
while still keeping it nice now the cool
thing<00:01:53.729> about<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.090> feature<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
thing about this feature is it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.459 
thing about this feature is it
eliminates<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> need<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.009> actually<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.579> HDR

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
eliminates the need to actually do HDR

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.050 
eliminates the need to actually do HDR
so<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.159> don't<00:01:59.369> actually<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.939> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so you know you don't actually have to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
so you know you don't actually have to
worry<00:02:00.210> about<00:02:00.329> doing<00:02:00.570> HDR<00:02:01.079> anymore<00:02:01.439> which<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
worry about doing HDR anymore which I

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
worry about doing HDR anymore which I
love<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.790> don't<00:02:03.240> even<00:02:03.329> know<00:02:03.479> why<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> options
