a question of damages what is a used

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.830 
a question of damages what is a used
pair<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.170> pants<00:00:40.530> worth<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.329> to<00:00:42.329> me<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> case

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
pair of pants worth and to me the case

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.389

is<00:00:42.989> worth<00:00:43.200> no<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.590> than<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.980> couple<00:00:44.129> hundred

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
is worth no more than a couple hundred

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.330 
is worth no more than a couple hundred
dollars<00:00:44.940> certainly<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.840> 54<00:00:46.440> million<00:00:46.800> dollars

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and I think it's outrageous that a judge

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
and I think it's outrageous that a judge
of<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.620> jurisdiction<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.940> file<00:00:51.210> such<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
of that jurisdiction would file such a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
of that jurisdiction would file such a
lawsuit<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.340> amount<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
think in this case is the customer right
and<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.379> degrees<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> valid

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
