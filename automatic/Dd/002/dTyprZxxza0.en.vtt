motors<00:00:48.730> wonderful<00:00:49.180> idea<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:50.140> use<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.649> 20<00:00:51.630> 20<00:00:52.630> ohm

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
motors wonderful idea to use a 20 20 ohm

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.440 
motors wonderful idea to use a 20 20 ohm
resistor<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:54.540> so<00:00:55.540> you<00:00:55.600> can<00:00:55.810> turn<00:00:56.020> it<00:00:56.079> down<00:00:57.450> so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
resistor and so you can turn it down so

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.299 
resistor and so you can turn it down so
it's<00:00:58.600> off<00:00:59.309> turn<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.340> on<00:01:00.960> till<00:01:01.960> it's<00:01:02.140> bright<00:01:02.470> my

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
it's off turn it on till it's bright my

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.039 
it's off turn it on till it's bright my
next<00:01:03.640> job<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:04.000> going<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.299> be<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.540> change<00:01:04.780> this

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
next job is going to be to change this

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
next job is going to be to change this
33<00:01:05.649> ohm<00:01:06.180> 222<00:01:07.180> ohm<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.570> see<00:01:07.719> what<00:01:07.869> happens<00:01:08.200> then

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
33 ohm 222 ohm and see what happens then

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.300 
33 ohm 222 ohm and see what happens then
so<00:01:12.600> alright<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.659> have<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:13.990> 22<00:01:14.409> ohm<00:01:14.650> resistor<00:01:15.190> in

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
so alright I have the 22 ohm resistor in

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.010 
so alright I have the 22 ohm resistor in
place<00:01:15.549> now<00:01:15.880> first<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.360> all<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.540> want<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.750> correct

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
place now first of all I want to correct

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.510 
place now first of all I want to correct
this<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.100> 25<00:01:19.060> ohm<00:01:19.590> rheostat<00:01:20.590> from

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
this this is a 25 ohm rheostat from

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.719 
this this is a 25 ohm rheostat from
RadioShack<00:01:21.880> great<00:01:22.869> idea<00:01:23.229> okay<00:01:23.979> so<00:01:24.040> now<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.490> have

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
RadioShack great idea okay so now I have

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.370 
RadioShack great idea okay so now I have
the<00:01:24.820> 22<00:01:25.180> ohm<00:01:26.170> resistor<00:01:27.070> at<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.520> base<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.909> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the 22 ohm resistor at the base of the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.670 
the 22 ohm resistor at the base of the
305<00:01:29.380> lat

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
305 lat

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:42.209 
305 lat
transistor<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:32.970> works<00:01:33.970> like<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.180> charm

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.319 

it's<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.700> lot<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.999> variation<00:01:44.969> there's<00:01:45.969> a<00:01:46.030> lot<00:01:46.210> of

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
it's a lot of variation there's a lot of

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's a lot of variation there's a lot of
variation<00:01:46.689> possible

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.390 

it<00:01:53.290> does<00:01:53.530> make<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.890> high-pitched<00:01:54.610> tone<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:56.400> think

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
it does make a high-pitched tone I think

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.250 
it does make a high-pitched tone I think
it's<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.850> good<00:01:57.970> idea<00:01:58.120> to<00:01:58.330> put<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.660> in<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.960> wooden

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
it's a good idea to put it in a wooden

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.910 
it's a good idea to put it in a wooden
box

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
box

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.850 
box
great<00:02:00.340> idea<00:02:00.760> lid<00:02:00.940> motor<00:02:01.440> okay<00:02:02.440> thanks<00:02:02.800> for

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
great idea lid motor okay thanks for

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.340 
great idea lid motor okay thanks for
watching
