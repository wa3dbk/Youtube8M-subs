through analogy on the closest thing to
an<00:00:33.640> analogy<00:00:34.180> I<00:00:34.210> came<00:00:34.540> to<00:00:34.780> was<00:00:35.079> when<00:00:35.410> I<00:00:35.649> started

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
an analogy I came to was when I started

an analogy I came to was when I started
talking<00:00:36.579> about<00:00:36.699> the<00:00:37.690> Flat<00:00:37.930> Earth<00:00:38.110> belief<00:00:38.920> as

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
talking about the Flat Earth belief as

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.790 
talking about the Flat Earth belief as
an<00:00:39.670> example<00:00:40.510> of<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.839> problems<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.410> bizarre

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
versus non bizarre delusion and that was

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:51.340 
versus non bizarre delusion and that was
just<00:00:43.780> an<00:00:43.989> example<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.960> an<00:00:47.229> analogy
