wheel<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.450> this<00:00:33.450> particular<00:00:33.809> wheel<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> also

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
wheel but this particular wheel I also

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
wheel but this particular wheel I also
want<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> point<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.880> by<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> color

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
want to point out is one by the color

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
want to point out is one by the color
wheel<00:00:36.630> company<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> great

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
wheel company I just think it's a great

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940 
wheel company I just think it's a great
tool<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.300> highly<00:00:39.600> recommend<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.710> let's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
get started so one of the first things
I'm<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> talk<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.390> complementary

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I'm going to talk about is complementary

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.819 
I'm going to talk about is complementary
colors<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> turn<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> wheel<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:49.260> top

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
colors so if you turn the wheel this top

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.860 
colors so if you turn the wheel this top
part<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> wheel<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.670> point<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> yellow

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
part of the wheel and point it to yellow

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.389 
part of the wheel and point it to yellow
you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> complement<00:00:53.190> of

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
you can see that the complement of

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.910 
you can see that the complement of
yellow<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.879> violet<00:00:56.420> if<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.930> point<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> blue

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
yellow is violet if you point it to blue

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
yellow is violet if you point it to blue
you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.579> complement<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> orange<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you can see the complement is orange and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850 
you can see the complement is orange and
if<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.710> point<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.539> red<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
if you point it to red you can see the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
if you point it to red you can see the
complement<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> green<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> those<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
complement is green so those are the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810 
complement is green so those are the
three<00:01:06.689> primaries<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.640> this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
three primaries but you can also do this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.690 
three primaries but you can also do this
to<00:01:09.000> any<00:01:09.210> color<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.720> between<00:01:10.140> those<00:01:10.409> red<00:01:11.250> orange

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to any color in between those red orange

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
to any color in between those red orange
complement<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> Bluegreen<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.409> they're

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
complement is Bluegreen so they're

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
complement is Bluegreen so they're
opposites<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.729> color<00:01:14.939> wheel<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.689> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
opposites on the color wheel this is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.679 
opposites on the color wheel this is
another<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.409> might<00:01:16.560> hear<00:01:17.689> complementary

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
another way you might hear complementary

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
another way you might hear complementary
colors<00:01:19.020> referred<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:19.799> opposites<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
colors referred to as opposites on the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.020 
colors referred to as opposites on the
color<00:01:21.030> wheel<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.640> thing<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
color wheel so that's one thing that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.630 
color wheel so that's one thing that
this<00:01:24.210> tool<00:01:24.600> does<00:01:25.100> another<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this tool does another thing that it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.649 
this tool does another thing that it
does<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.090> talk<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:28.470> show<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.659> ten

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
does is talk about or show you ten

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.289 
does is talk about or show you ten
stones<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.470> shades<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.640> means<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
stones and shades and what that means is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.789 
stones and shades and what that means is
that<00:01:33.829> if<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.490> turn<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.780> color<00:01:36.990> wheel<00:01:37.259> back<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that if you turn the color wheel back to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.080 
that if you turn the color wheel back to
this<00:01:37.950> blue<00:01:39.560> tint<00:01:40.560> tone<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> shade<00:01:41.430> shows<00:01:41.850> up

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this blue tint tone and shade shows up

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.840 
this blue tint tone and shade shows up
here<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.570> tint<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.290> adding<00:01:43.770> white<00:01:44.040> tone<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
here and tint is adding white tone is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.660 
here and tint is adding white tone is
adding<00:01:45.119> gray<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> shade<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> adding<00:01:46.439> black<00:01:46.920> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
adding gray and shade is adding black so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.850 
adding gray and shade is adding black so
it<00:01:47.909> shows<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.509> you're<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> get

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.649 

this<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> good<00:01:53.340> example<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:54.060> showing<00:01:54.119> tint

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this is a good example of showing tint

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.260 
this is a good example of showing tint
tone<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> shade<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.619> red<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.729> add<00:01:56.969> white

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
tone and shade with red so you add white

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
tone and shade with red so you add white
it's<00:01:57.509> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.960> more<00:01:58.200> pinkish<00:01:58.680> add<00:01:59.130> gray

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's going to get more pinkish add gray

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.300 
it's going to get more pinkish add gray
it's<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.479> gray<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.409> down<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.040> then

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it's going to just gray it down and then

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.179 
it's going to just gray it down and then
shade<00:02:02.640> darkens<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.469> that's<00:02:04.829> pretty

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
shade darkens it so that's that's pretty

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.330 
shade darkens it so that's that's pretty
cool<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:07.079> other<00:02:07.170> thing<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.890> color<00:02:08.099> wheel

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
cool the other thing the color wheel

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.570 
cool the other thing the color wheel
shows<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:09.030> split<00:02:09.360> complementary<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.430> I'm

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
shows is split complementary so if I'm

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.130 
shows is split complementary so if I'm
back<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.030> pointing<00:02:12.450> at<00:02:12.660> yell

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
back to pointing at yell

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.340 
back to pointing at yell
the<00:02:13.830> split<00:02:14.190> complementary<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.170> be

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the split complementary is going to be

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.150 
the split complementary is going to be
red<00:02:16.680> violet<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.520> blue<00:02:18.330> violet<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.950> color

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
red violet and blue violet on the color

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.700 
red violet and blue violet on the color
wheel<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.360> means<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
wheel so what that means is that the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.590 
wheel so what that means is that the
complementary<00:02:23.460> color<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.880> know<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:24.330> is

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
complementary color you know now is

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.130 
complementary color you know now is
violet<00:02:25.260> either<00:02:25.920> side<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.820> violet<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.570> what's

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
violet either side of violet is what's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.080 
violet either side of violet is what's
considered<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> split<00:02:29.070> complementary<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
considered the split complementary and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.090 
considered the split complementary and
what<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.810> means<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.440> these<00:02:31.740> colors

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
what that means is that these colors

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.180 
what that means is that these colors
will<00:02:32.280> go<00:02:32.400> nicely<00:02:32.640> together<00:02:33.740> for<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> longest

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
will go nicely together for the longest

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.650 
will go nicely together for the longest
time<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> was<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.730> well<00:02:35.940> what's<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.210> point<00:02:36.450> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
time I was like well what's the point of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.510 
time I was like well what's the point of
the<00:02:36.750> color<00:02:36.930> wheel<00:02:37.140> well<00:02:37.830> really<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.340> all

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the color wheel well really it's all

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.670 
the color wheel well really it's all
about<00:02:38.790> helping<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.750> figure<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.440> what

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
about helping you to figure out what

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.660 
about helping you to figure out what
colors<00:02:41.100> go<00:02:41.220> nicely<00:02:41.610> together<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:43.520> one<00:02:44.520> other

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
colors go nicely together so one other

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.910 
colors go nicely together so one other
thing<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.900> see<00:02:46.320> when<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.680> work

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
thing that you can see when you work

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.090 
thing that you can see when you work
with<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.280> color<00:02:47.610> wheel<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:49.230> three

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
with this color wheel is that three

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.449 
with this color wheel is that three
colors<00:02:50.700> together<00:02:51.270> or<00:02:51.570> side<00:02:52.020> by<00:02:52.230> side<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
colors together or side by side on the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.640 
colors together or side by side on the
color<00:02:53.700> wheel<00:02:53.820> are<00:02:54.330> considered<00:02:54.900> analogous

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
color wheel are considered analogous

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.040 
color wheel are considered analogous
colors<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:56.910> means<00:02:57.270> they<00:02:57.480> will<00:02:57.660> go<00:02:57.810> nicely

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
colors so that means they will go nicely

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.800 
colors so that means they will go nicely
together<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.520> see<00:02:59.550> those<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.450> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
together and you can see those do that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.170 
together and you can see those do that
would<00:03:00.959> be<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> nice<00:03:01.410> color<00:03:01.800> combination<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
would be a nice color combination for a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.750 
would be a nice color combination for a
painting<00:03:03.720> or<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.110> room<00:03:04.440> or<00:03:04.770> whatever<00:03:05.550> you're

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
painting or a room or whatever you're

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.340 
painting or a room or whatever you're
working<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:07.910> again<00:03:08.910> red<00:03:09.420> red<00:03:09.750> violet<00:03:10.200> and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
working on again red red violet and

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.090 
working on again red red violet and
violet<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:11.160> looks<00:03:11.310> really<00:03:11.520> nice<00:03:11.760> together

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
violet that looks really nice together

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.890 
violet that looks really nice together
another<00:03:14.100> thing<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.489> color<00:03:14.730> wheel<00:03:15.060> points<00:03:15.690> out

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
another thing the color wheel points out

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.960 
another thing the color wheel points out
is<00:03:16.580> warm<00:03:17.580> versus<00:03:18.239> cool<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.430> colors<00:03:20.430> up<00:03:20.610> here<00:03:20.850> on

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
is warm versus cool so colors up here on

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.910 
is warm versus cool so colors up here on
this<00:03:21.180> half<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.750> color<00:03:21.959> wheel<00:03:22.200> are<00:03:22.530> warm

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
this half of the color wheel are warm

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.630 
this half of the color wheel are warm
and<00:03:23.190> down<00:03:23.790> here<00:03:24.120> are<00:03:24.330> cooler<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.430> points

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
and down here are cooler so it points

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.620 
and down here are cooler so it points
that<00:03:27.060> out<00:03:28.310> what<00:03:29.310> else<00:03:29.459> does<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.790> have<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.120> here

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
that out what else does it have on here

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.620 
that out what else does it have on here
right<00:03:31.590> now<00:03:31.709> okay<00:03:31.950> then<00:03:32.910> on<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> other<00:03:33.299> side<00:03:33.600> of

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
right now okay then on the other side of

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.509 
right now okay then on the other side of
the<00:03:33.780> wheel<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.110> really<00:03:34.230> cool<00:03:34.620> because<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
the wheel is really cool because it

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.729 
the wheel is really cool because it
gives<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.790> an<00:03:35.880> idea<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.450> what<00:03:36.870> will<00:03:37.019> happen<00:03:37.080> if

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
gives you an idea of what will happen if

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.170 
gives you an idea of what will happen if
you<00:03:37.920> have<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.190> yellow<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.930> add<00:03:40.670> red<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:42.000> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
you have a yellow and you add red to it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.770 
you have a yellow and you add red to it
you're<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.170> get<00:03:43.380> an<00:03:43.590> orange<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:45.360> you

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
you're going to get an orange so you

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.940 
you're going to get an orange so you
probably<00:03:45.959> knew<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.290> already<00:03:46.769> that's

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
probably knew that already that's

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.610 
probably knew that already that's
probably<00:03:47.400> pretty<00:03:47.580> obvious<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.540> it's<00:03:48.870> cool<00:03:49.140> to

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
probably pretty obvious but it's cool to

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.220 
probably pretty obvious but it's cool to
look<00:03:49.799> at<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:51.030> add<00:03:51.360> yellow<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.930> yellow<00:03:51.959> you

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
look at if you add yellow to yellow you

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.979 
look at if you add yellow to yellow you
get<00:03:52.500> yellow<00:03:52.709> if<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.850> add<00:03:54.090> blue<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.810> yellow

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
get yellow if you add blue to yellow

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.720 
get yellow if you add blue to yellow
you're<00:03:55.290> going<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.530> get<00:03:55.709> some<00:03:56.040> sort<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.459> green

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
you're going to get some sort of green

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.270 
you're going to get some sort of green
if<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.480> add<00:03:57.750> white<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.170> yellow<00:03:58.799> you're<00:03:59.070> going

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
if you add white to yellow you're going

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.030 
if you add white to yellow you're going
to<00:03:59.370> get<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.580> really<00:03:59.970> lighter<00:04:00.780> version<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.769> if

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
to get a really lighter version of it if

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.550 
to get a really lighter version of it if
you<00:04:02.760> add<00:04:02.970> black<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.450> yellow<00:04:03.870> you're<00:04:04.320> going<00:04:04.500> to

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
you add black to yellow you're going to

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.910 
you add black to yellow you're going to
get<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:05.870> darker<00:04:06.870> version<00:04:07.019> or<00:04:07.410> yellow<00:04:07.620> of

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
get this darker version or yellow of

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.650 
get this darker version or yellow of
yellow<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:08.760> really<00:04:09.090> what<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.329> get<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.630> a

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
yellow but really what you get is a
