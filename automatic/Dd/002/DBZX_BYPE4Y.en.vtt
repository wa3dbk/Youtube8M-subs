what I've gained and every time he tries

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.040 
what I've gained and every time he tries
to<00:02:17.270> readjust<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:20.060> can<00:02:20.210> shift<00:02:20.420> up<00:02:20.600> in<00:02:20.750> or<00:02:20.960> you

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
to readjust you can shift up in or you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.290 
to readjust you can shift up in or you
once<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.740> get<00:02:21.860> them<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.070> into<00:02:22.220> here<00:02:22.610> he's<00:02:23.090> now

once you get them up into here he's now

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.540 
once you get them up into here he's now
operating<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.780> slope<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.220> can<00:02:25.310> start<00:02:25.490> to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
operating on slope so you can start to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:56.250 
operating on slope so you can start to
sink<00:02:25.880> under<00:02:26.210> it<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.830> get<00:02:28.520> this
