00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.370 
part my hair a little bit to the right
just<00:02:43.660> because<00:02:43.900> that's<00:02:44.110> where<00:02:44.230> my<00:02:44.320> natural

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
just because that's where my natural

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.740 
just because that's where my natural
part<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:45.010> but<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.180> works<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.570> as

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
part is but you know it works just as

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.380 
part is but you know it works just as
well<00:02:46.780> down<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.260> center<00:02:47.530> or<00:02:47.740> whichever<00:02:48.390> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
well down the center or whichever and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.930 
well down the center or whichever and
it's<00:02:49.960> basically<00:02:50.590> gonna<00:02:50.890> be<00:02:53.100> three<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.640> four

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
it's basically gonna be three to four

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.980 
it's basically gonna be three to four
curls<00:02:55.840> curlers<00:02:56.590> on<00:02:56.830> each<00:02:56.980> side

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
curls curlers on each side

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.200 
curls curlers on each side
you<00:02:58.990> don't<00:02:59.140> want<00:02:59.320> real<00:02:59.650> small<00:03:00.090> sections<00:03:01.090> of

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
you don't want real small sections of

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.550 
you don't want real small sections of
hair<00:03:02.010> because<00:03:03.600> we're<00:03:04.600> kind<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:04.960> for<00:03:05.230> for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
hair because we're kind of going for for

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.590 
hair because we're kind of going for for
bigger<00:03:05.740> curls<00:03:06.040> at<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.580> bottom<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.450> looks

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
bigger curls at the bottom so it looks

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.460 
bigger curls at the bottom so it looks
softer<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.340> not<00:03:09.340> quite<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:12.190> stiff<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.170> you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
softer and not quite so so stiff so you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.520 
softer and not quite so so stiff so you
get<00:03:14.740> section<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.430> twist<00:03:16.320> whichever<00:03:17.320> way<00:03:17.470> you

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
get section and twist whichever way you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.900 
get section and twist whichever way you
like<00:03:17.740> I<00:03:18.010> twist<00:03:18.310> mine<00:03:18.490> in<00:03:18.640> all<00:03:18.760> different

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
like I twist mine in all different

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.420 
like I twist mine in all different
directions<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:20.160> more<00:03:21.160> body<00:03:21.370> movement

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
directions so I have more body movement

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.170 
directions so I have more body movement
so<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.460> twist<00:03:24.730> down<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:27.070> then<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.580> little<00:03:28.030> bit

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
so you twist down and then a little bit

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.060

of<00:03:28.300> mousse<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.780> little<00:03:29.470> bit<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.770> don't<00:03:29.920> need<00:03:30.040> a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
of mousse a little bit you don't need a

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.370 
of mousse a little bit you don't need a
lot<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> ends<00:03:31.840> because<00:03:32.050> if<00:03:32.290> your

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
lot just to the ends because if your

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.020 
lot just to the ends because if your
hands<00:03:32.530> are<00:03:32.710> like<00:03:32.830> mine<00:03:33.040> they<00:03:33.250> don't<00:03:33.400> hold<00:03:33.670> as

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
hands are like mine they don't hold as

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.760 
hands are like mine they don't hold as
well<00:03:34.810> as<00:03:35.200> other<00:03:35.860> parts<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.340> your<00:03:36.460> hair<00:03:37.770> and

slide<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> end<00:04:07.030> what<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.209> does<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.780> it

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
they're fairly easy to move so you can

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.689

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
a little scruffy during sleep but that's

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.240 
a little scruffy during sleep but that's
because<00:07:10.740> I<00:07:10.979> toss<00:07:11.190> and<00:07:11.370> turn<00:07:11.930> so<00:07:12.949> basically<00:07:13.949> all

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.700 
you want to do is pull them out I don't
know<00:07:20.099> that<00:07:20.340> there's<00:07:20.490> really<00:07:20.669> a<00:07:20.789> technique<00:07:21.330> I

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
know that there's really a technique I

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.100 
know that there's really a technique I
usually<00:07:22.710> just<00:07:22.949> pull<00:07:23.940> it<00:07:24.030> straight<00:07:24.150> and<00:07:24.690> then

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
usually just pull it straight and then

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.890 
usually just pull it straight and then
do<00:07:25.979> that<00:07:26.160> number<00:07:26.340> you<00:07:26.699> slide<00:07:26.940> it<00:07:27.060> off<00:07:27.210> look<00:07:27.810> at

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900
