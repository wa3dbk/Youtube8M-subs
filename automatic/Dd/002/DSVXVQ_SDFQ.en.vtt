this<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.709> our<00:00:01.890> second<00:00:02.340> video<00:00:02.460> lesson<00:00:03.090> on

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
this is our second video lesson on

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.930 
this is our second video lesson on
chapter<00:00:03.720> 10<00:00:04.020> signaling<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.520> lesson

chapter 10 signaling in this lesson

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.200 
chapter 10 signaling in this lesson
we'll<00:00:06.060> be<00:00:06.210> looking<00:00:06.330> at<00:00:06.600> two<00:00:06.839> general<00:00:07.379> types<00:00:07.410> of

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
we'll be looking at two general types of

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.570 
we'll be looking at two general types of
receptors<00:00:09.889> first<00:00:10.889> we're<00:00:11.130> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.309> look<00:00:11.429> at

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
receptors first we're going to look at

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.110 
receptors first we're going to look at
the<00:00:11.700> g-protein<00:00:12.450> coupled<00:00:12.990> receptor<00:00:13.740> or<00:00:14.089> GPCR

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
the g-protein coupled receptor or GPCR

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.630 
the g-protein coupled receptor or GPCR
the<00:00:15.990> name<00:00:16.260> comes<00:00:16.500> from<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> fact<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the name comes from the fact that it's a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.760 
the name comes from the fact that it's a
receptor<00:00:18.180> that's<00:00:18.330> coupled<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:19.080> another<00:00:19.470> type

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
receptor that's coupled to another type

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.269 
receptor that's coupled to another type
of<00:00:19.800> protein<00:00:20.460> called<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.000> g-protein<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:22.100> each<00:00:23.100> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
of protein called a g-protein in each of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.939 
of protein called a g-protein in each of
the<00:00:23.369> cases<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.970> we'll<00:00:24.090> look<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.230> initial

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the cases that we'll look at the initial

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.220 
the cases that we'll look at the initial
signal<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> binding<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> ligand<00:00:28.080> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
signal is the binding of the ligand to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
signal is the binding of the ligand to
the<00:00:28.380> receptor<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.250> remember<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.939> always

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the receptor and remember that always

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
the receptor and remember that always
causes<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> conformational<00:00:31.170> change<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
causes a conformational change in this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.139 
causes a conformational change in this
transmembrane<00:00:33.649> protein<00:00:34.649> that's<00:00:35.309> our<00:00:35.670> first

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
transmembrane protein that's our first

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.080 
transmembrane protein that's our first
message<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.950> illustrated<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:38.940> on

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
message and that's illustrated here on

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
message and that's illustrated here on
the<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.450> our<00:00:39.719> ligand<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.379> blue<00:00:40.620> binds<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the right our ligand in blue binds to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.400 
the right our ligand in blue binds to
this<00:00:41.489> g-protein<00:00:42.300> coupled<00:00:42.690> receptor<00:00:43.260> in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
this g-protein coupled receptor in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
this g-protein coupled receptor in
purple<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> start<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.750> whole

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
purple that's going to start this whole

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.490 
purple that's going to start this whole
process<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.420> ligand<00:00:48.930> binds<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> receptor

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
process as the ligand binds the receptor

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
process as the ligand binds the receptor
and<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.730> conformation<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.480> receptor

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and the conformation that receptor

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.709 
and the conformation that receptor
changes<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.219> able<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> interact<00:00:54.090> with

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
changes it's now able to interact with

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.139 
changes it's now able to interact with
an<00:00:54.870> adjacent<00:00:55.370> g-protein<00:00:56.370> you'll<00:00:56.640> notice<00:00:57.000> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
an adjacent g-protein you'll notice that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.930 
an adjacent g-protein you'll notice that
the<00:00:57.300> g-protein<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.140> also<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.579> membrane

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the g-protein is also at the membrane

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.869 
the g-protein is also at the membrane
the<00:01:00.899> named<00:01:01.140> g-protein<00:01:01.920> comes<00:01:02.250> from<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> fact

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the named g-protein comes from the fact

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
the named g-protein comes from the fact
that<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.210> binds<00:01:03.449> guanine<00:01:03.960> nucleotides<00:01:04.680> either

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that it binds guanine nucleotides either

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.960 
that it binds guanine nucleotides either
GTP<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.360> GTP<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.560> we'll<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.549> cycle

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
GTP or GTP and we'll see how that cycle

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.990 
GTP or GTP and we'll see how that cycle
works<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.780> later<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.820> have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
works a little bit later so here we have

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.070 
works a little bit later so here we have
our<00:01:12.150> ligand<00:01:12.570> bound<00:01:12.930> receptor<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:14.490> been

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
interacts with the g protein and that

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
interacts with the g protein and that
converts<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.729> g<00:01:20.939> protein<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:21.840> inactive

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
converts the g protein from an inactive

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
converts the g protein from an inactive

sometimes portions of lipids as we'll

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.260 
sometimes portions of lipids as we'll
see<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:55.070> important<00:01:55.490> thing<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.820> remember<00:01:55.940> here

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
see the important thing to remember here

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.270 
see the important thing to remember here
is<00:01:56.660> that<00:01:56.780> these<00:01:56.990> second<00:01:57.500> messengers<00:01:58.100> are

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
is that these second messengers are

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.080 
is that these second messengers are
always<00:01:58.390> diffuse'<00:01:59.390> balandin<00:02:00.340> our<00:02:01.340> role<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
always diffuse' balandin our role is to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.719 
always diffuse' balandin our role is to
communicate<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.170> message<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.979> take<00:02:04.550> it

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
communicate that message and take it

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.210 
communicate that message and take it
from<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.180> membrane<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:06.020> where<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.800> needs<00:02:07.070> to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
from the membrane to where it needs to

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.389 
from the membrane to where it needs to
go<00:02:07.990> think<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.110> these<00:02:09.290> second<00:02:09.709> messengers<00:02:10.160> as<00:02:10.340> a

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
go think of these second messengers as a

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.850 
go think of these second messengers as a
bicycle<00:02:11.180> messenger<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.200> going<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> pick<00:02:12.680> up

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
type of receptor will look at is

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.690 
type of receptor will look at is
referred<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.290> as<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.680> receptor<00:02:43.220> tyrosine

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
referred to as a receptor tyrosine

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.350 
referred to as a receptor tyrosine
kinase<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.500> receptor<00:02:46.100> yet<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.120> has

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
kinase so it's a receptor yet that has

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.750 
kinase so it's a receptor yet that has
kinase<00:02:47.930> activity<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.800> think<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.610> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
kinase activity I think this is the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.729 
kinase activity I think this is the
first<00:02:49.940> time<00:02:50.239> we've<00:02:50.450> looked<00:02:50.810> at<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.140> term<00:02:51.470> a

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
first time we've looked at this term a

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.670 
first time we've looked at this term a
kinase<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.940> an<00:02:53.239> enzyme<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.780> transfers<00:02:54.200> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
kinase is an enzyme that transfers a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.940 
kinase is an enzyme that transfers a
phosphor<00:02:55.370> yo<00:02:55.549> group<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.810> some<00:02:57.080> molecule<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
phosphor yo group to some molecule and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.310 
phosphor yo group to some molecule and
that's<00:02:58.820> true<00:02:59.090> for<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.360> receptor<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.170> this

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
that's true for this receptor so this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.979 
that's true for this receptor so this
receptor<00:03:00.860> actually<00:03:01.280> has<00:03:01.489> enzymatic<00:03:02.150> activity

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
receptor actually has enzymatic activity

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.090 
receptor actually has enzymatic activity
it<00:03:03.290> transfers<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.070> phosphor<00:03:04.670> real<00:03:04.850> group<00:03:05.239> in

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
it transfers a phosphor real group in

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.490 
it transfers a phosphor real group in
this<00:03:07.100> case<00:03:07.340> also<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.090> initial<00:03:08.690> signal<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.320> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
this case also the initial signal is the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.990 
this case also the initial signal is the
binding<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.190> ligand<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> receptor

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
binding of the ligand to the receptor

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.540 
binding of the ligand to the receptor
and<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.660> causes<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.470> conformational<00:03:12.739> change

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
and that causes a conformational change

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.550 
and that causes a conformational change
in<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.790> case<00:03:15.090> because<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.750> enzyme<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
in this case because the enzyme is a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.460 
in this case because the enzyme is a
kinetic<00:03:17.130> kinase<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.970> transfers<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> phosphor

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
kinetic kinase it transfers a phosphor

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.010 
kinetic kinase it transfers a phosphor
Rio<00:03:19.650> group<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> that's<00:03:20.580> going<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.600> taken

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020

Rio group and that's going to be taken
from<00:03:22.170> ATP<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.330> it<00:03:24.330> Auto<00:03:24.680> phosphorylates

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
from ATP and it Auto phosphorylates

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.250 
from ATP and it Auto phosphorylates
itself<00:03:26.220> in<00:03:26.430> other<00:03:26.700> words<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.270> has<00:03:27.300> cytoplasmic

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
itself in other words it has cytoplasmic

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.500 
itself in other words it has cytoplasmic
domains<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.130> can<00:03:29.190> see<00:03:29.460> there<00:03:29.670> are<00:03:29.730> two<00:03:29.970> here

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
domains you can see there are two here

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.080 
domains you can see there are two here
and<00:03:30.660> one<00:03:31.440> domain<00:03:31.710> will<00:03:32.190> phosphorylate<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
and one domain will phosphorylate the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.930 
and one domain will phosphorylate the
other<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.960> Otto<00:03:34.310> phosphorylates<00:03:35.310> itself

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
other so it Otto phosphorylates itself

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.230 
other so it Otto phosphorylates itself
and<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.690> activates<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.860> as<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.070> kinase<00:03:39.000> or

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
and that activates it as a kinase or

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.920 
and that activates it as a kinase or

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
we have our active ligand receptor

complex the cytoplasmic domains have
been<00:03:59.030> phosphorylated<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.360> now<00:04:00.600> function

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
been phosphorylated and so now function

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.000 
been phosphorylated and so now function
as<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.620> kinase<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.960> now<00:04:03.960> it<00:04:04.110> can<00:04:04.230> activate<00:04:04.620> or

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
as a kinase and now it can activate or

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.400 
as a kinase and now it can activate or
inhibit<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.850> protein<00:04:06.360> or<00:04:06.570> enzyme<00:04:06.600> and

inhibit a protein or enzyme and

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.550 
inhibit a protein or enzyme and
typically<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.760> next<00:04:09.030> enzyme<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:10.020> another

kinase<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.580> example<00:04:12.000> here's<00:04:12.330> kinase<00:04:12.840> one

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
kinase in this example here's kinase one

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.860 
kinase in this example here's kinase one
it's<00:04:14.130> going<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.520> be<00:04:14.760> activated<00:04:15.660> by<00:04:15.810> the

it's going to be activated by the
receptor<00:04:16.440> tyrosine<00:04:16.830> kinase<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.330> goes

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
receptor tyrosine kinase and so it goes

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.710 
receptor tyrosine kinase and so it goes

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.530 
notice it's been phosphorylated this
also<00:04:24.900> is<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:25.320> kinase<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.820> will<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.300> turn

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
also is a kinase and so it will in turn

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.170 
also is a kinase and so it will in turn
act<00:04:27.930> upon<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.500> next<00:04:28.919> member<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.730> our<00:04:29.850> cascade

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
act upon the next member in our cascade

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.620 
act upon the next member in our cascade
our<00:04:30.840> kinase<00:04:31.380> 2<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:32.790> will<00:04:33.000> convert<00:04:33.419> it

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
our kinase 2 and that will convert it

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.570 
our kinase 2 and that will convert it
from<00:04:33.870> inactive<00:04:34.560> red<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.490> green

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
from inactive red to green

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.540 
from inactive red to green
active<00:04:38.480> and<00:04:38.690> so<00:04:39.260> notice<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.800> also<00:04:40.070> has<00:04:40.250> been

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
active and so notice it also has been

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.670 
active and so notice it also has been
phosphorylated<00:04:41.540> so<00:04:41.720> there<00:04:41.900> are<00:04:41.960> often<00:04:42.380> many

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
phosphorylated so there are often many

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.000 
phosphorylated so there are often many
steps<00:04:43.280> in<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.850> remember<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.200> fibrin

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
steps in this remember the fibrin

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.950 
steps in this remember the fibrin
cascade<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.790> we<00:04:46.940> looked<00:04:47.180> at<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:47.540> Chapter

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
cascade that we looked at in Chapter

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.190 
cascade that we looked at in Chapter
five<00:04:48.170> so<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> very<00:04:49.190> similar<00:04:49.490> type<00:04:49.970> of

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
five so a very similar type of

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.250 
five so a very similar type of
activation<00:04:51.200> cascade<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:53.000> end<00:04:53.330> effect<00:04:53.990> is

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
activation cascade and the end effect is

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.990 
activation cascade and the end effect is
that<00:04:54.290> there's<00:04:54.650> some<00:04:54.890> change<00:04:55.250> in<00:04:55.430> metabolic

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
that there's some change in metabolic

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.150 
that there's some change in metabolic
activity<00:04:56.660> or<00:04:56.870> gene<00:04:57.440> expression<00:04:58.160> in<00:04:59.860> our<00:05:00.860> next

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
activity or gene expression in our next

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.890 
activity or gene expression in our next
video<00:05:01.400> lesson<00:05:01.700> we<00:05:02.030> want<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.480> look<00:05:02.690> at<00:05:02.810> a

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
specific example of a g-protein coupled

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.610 
specific example of a g-protein coupled
receptor<00:05:05.840> we'll<00:05:06.020> look<00:05:06.110> at<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.380> beta

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
receptor we'll look at the beta

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.490 
receptor we'll look at the beta
adrenergic<00:05:06.970> receptor<00:05:07.970> we<00:05:08.720> also<00:05:08.870> want<00:05:09.230> to<00:05:09.290> see

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
adrenergic receptor we also want to see

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.440 
adrenergic receptor we also want to see
what<00:05:09.710> kind<00:05:09.980> of<00:05:10.100> changes<00:05:10.550> take<00:05:10.790> place<00:05:11.090> in<00:05:11.300> that

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
what kind of changes take place in that

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.780 
what kind of changes take place in that
g<00:05:11.720> protein<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.500> what<00:05:13.040> are<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.250> downstream
