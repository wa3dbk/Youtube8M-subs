read<00:00:29.970> from<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> title<00:00:30.949> maps<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.070> too<00:00:32.250> big<00:00:32.750> now

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
read from the title maps are too big now

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.000 
read from the title maps are too big now
that's<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.200> thinking<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.680> think<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that's not what I'm thinking I think the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.470 
that's not what I'm thinking I think the
maps<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.340> perfectly<00:00:35.790> fine<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
maps are perfectly fine but a lot of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
maps are perfectly fine but a lot of
people<00:00:36.630> saying<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> maps<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.219> too<00:00:38.399> big

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
people saying that the maps are too big

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.610 
people saying that the maps are too big
which<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> making<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> game<00:00:39.450> too<00:00:39.510> slow<00:00:40.230> pace

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
which is making the game too slow pace

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.709 
which is making the game too slow pace
it's<00:00:40.890> too<00:00:41.100> slow<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it's too slow and they don't like it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.639 
it's too slow and they don't like it
because<00:00:42.899> will<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> maps<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.890> too<00:00:44.100> big<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:45.649> I

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
because will the maps are too big and I

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.889 
because will the maps are too big and I
don't<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> why<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> saying<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.750> maps

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
don't get it why are you saying the maps

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
don't get it why are you saying the maps
are<00:00:49.020> too<00:00:49.170> big<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> maps<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.770> fine<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.460> they

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
are too big the maps are fine as they
