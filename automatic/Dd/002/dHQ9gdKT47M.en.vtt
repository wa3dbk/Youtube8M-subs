together we'll check those sayings out a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330 
together we'll check those sayings out a
little<00:00:30.840> later<00:00:31.019> let's<00:00:31.710> show<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.189> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
little later let's show you what this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430 
little later let's show you what this
looks<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.910> axiom<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.480> now<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.320> we

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
looks like an axiom right now so when we

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.990 
looks like an axiom right now so when we
open<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.800> an<00:00:34.950> application<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
open up an application you can see the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.850 
open up an application you can see the
status<00:00:36.239> bar<00:00:36.329> changes<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> same<00:00:37.530> color

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
status bar changes to the same color

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.040 
status bar changes to the same color
used<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> application<00:00:39.030> no<00:00:39.540> other<00:00:39.690> input

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
used in the application no other input

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.479 
used in the application no other input
is<00:00:40.170> needed<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.649> don't<00:00:40.829> need<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> spend<00:00:41.309> hours

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
is needed you don't need to spend hours

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.310 
is needed you don't need to spend hours
finding<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> correct<00:00:42.420> hex<00:00:42.750> color<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.260> each

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
finding the correct hex color for each

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
finding the correct hex color for each
app<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.800> finds<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.309> applies<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.579> all

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
app it finds and applies it all

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
app it finds and applies it all
automatically<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.469> status<00:00:46.770> bar

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
automatically for you the status bar

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
automatically for you the status bar
icons<00:00:46.980> will<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.760> change<00:00:48.030> color<00:00:48.360> based<00:00:48.660> on

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
icons will also change color based on

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
icons will also change color based on
the<00:00:49.110> background<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> status<00:00:50.039> bar<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.460> if

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the background of the status bar so if

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.100 
the background of the status bar so if
you<00:00:50.640> open<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.000> something<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.420> chrome<00:00:51.840> where

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you open up something like chrome where

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.389 
you open up something like chrome where
you<00:00:52.199> can't<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.829> because<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.250> too

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
you can't really see it because it's too

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
you can't really see it because it's too
white<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.270> change<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> kind<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
white it will change them to a kind of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
white it will change them to a kind of
darker<00:00:55.829> color<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.300> does

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
darker color so you can see them it does

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.000 
darker color so you can see them it does
also<00:00:57.719> work<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.079> applications<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
also work for applications like the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
also work for applications like the
Google<00:00:59.370> Play<00:00:59.399> Store<00:00:59.550> where<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.059> has<00:01:00.210> multiple

does have a few bugs you can see right

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
does have a few bugs you can see right
now<00:01:12.840> we're<00:01:13.290> seeing<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> those<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.159> took<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
now we're seeing one of those it took a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.980 
now we're seeing one of those it took a
little<00:01:14.580> while<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.060> actually<00:01:15.150> recognize<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
little while to actually recognize the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
little while to actually recognize the
color<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.740> did<00:01:16.920> seem<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> add<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> little

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
color and it did seem to add a little

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.890 
color and it did seem to add a little
bit<00:01:17.759> more<00:01:17.880> junk<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.420> opening<00:01:18.750> up

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
bit more junk when opening up

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020 
bit more junk when opening up
applications<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> should<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.670> noted<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
applications now it should be noted that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
applications now it should be noted that
it's<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> color<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> apps

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it's not just the color of the apps

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's not just the color of the apps
action<00:01:22.920> bar<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:23.310> being<00:01:23.490> matched<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.150> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
action bar that's being matched here so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
action bar that's being matched here so
wherever<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.049> are<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> nap<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> system

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
wherever you are in a nap the system

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.499 
wherever you are in a nap the system
bars<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.640> adapt<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:27.330> pretty

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
bars will adapt and that's pretty

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.270 
bars will adapt and that's pretty
impressive<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.590> we're<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> dive<00:01:29.100> into

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
impressive now we're going to dive into

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.679 
impressive now we're going to dive into
the<00:01:29.490> settings<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> we're<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> turn<00:01:30.509> on

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the settings and we're going to turn on

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.630 
the settings and we're going to turn on
the<00:01:30.869> dynamic<00:01:31.290> navigation<00:01:31.950> bar<00:01:32.130> setting<00:01:32.400> as

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the dynamic navigation bar setting as

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670 
the dynamic navigation bar setting as
well<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.180> changing<00:01:33.600> both<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.350> status

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
well so it's changing both the status

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
well so it's changing both the status
bar<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> navigation<00:01:35.850> bar<00:01:36.000> depending<00:01:36.570> on

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
bar and the navigation bar depending on

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
bar and the navigation bar depending on
the<00:01:36.840> app's<00:01:36.990> colors<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> case<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the app's colors so in the case of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
the app's colors so in the case of
Android<00:01:38.670> Central<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.240> stash<00:01:39.479> bar<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> green

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
Android Central the stash bar is a green

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
Android Central the stash bar is a green
color<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> navigation<00:01:41.460> bar<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> white

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
color and the navigation bar is a white

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
color and the navigation bar is a white
color<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.960> kind<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> merges<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> system

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
color so it kind of merges the system

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100 
color so it kind of merges the system
bars<00:01:44.430> into<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> app<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.119> overall<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.899> gives

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
bars into the app and overall that gives

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
bars into the app and overall that gives
more<00:01:46.380> continuity<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.310> flow<00:01:47.549> over<00:01:48.000> just

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
more continuity and flow over just

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.719 
more continuity and flow over just
having<00:01:48.570> black<00:01:48.960> bars<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> similar

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
having black bars you can see a similar

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
having black bars you can see a similar
effect<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.299> Twitter<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
effect with Twitter as well and one of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
effect with Twitter as well and one of
the<00:01:53.070> best<00:01:53.250> things<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.299> all

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the best things about this is it's all

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.969 
the best things about this is it's all
automatic<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.680> worry<00:01:55.860> about

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
automatic you don't have to worry about

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.620 
automatic you don't have to worry about
finding<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.579> different<00:01:56.969> colors<00:01:57.299> or<00:01:57.479> in

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
finding the different colors or in

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.850 
finding the different colors or in
putting<00:01:58.020> loads<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.350> different<00:01:58.439> colors<00:01:58.829> for

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
putting loads of different colors for

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
putting loads of different colors for
different<00:01:59.009> apps<00:01:59.369> turning<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> system<00:02:00.689> bar

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
different apps turning on the system bar

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.109 
different apps turning on the system bar
gradient<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.619> adds<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.070> gradient<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> bar

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
gradient just adds a gradient to the bar

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.120 
gradient just adds a gradient to the bar
so<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.200> block<00:02:04.500> color<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.920> kind

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so it's not just a block color it kind

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
so it's not just a block color it kind
of<00:02:05.219> fades<00:02:05.430> its<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> setting<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
of fades its way in and setting the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.960 
of fades its way in and setting the
darker<00:02:07.380> option<00:02:07.710> pretty<00:02:08.009> much<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.489> makes<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
darker option pretty much just makes the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.669 
darker option pretty much just makes the
system<00:02:09.149> bars<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.750> little<00:02:10.080> bit<00:02:10.170> darker<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
system bars that little bit darker and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.600 
system bars that little bit darker and
you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.890> definitely<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.370> there's<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> little

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you can definitely see there's a little

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.010 
you can definitely see there's a little
bit<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.000> difference<00:02:12.330> between<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.720> status

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
bit of a difference between the status

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.900 
bit of a difference between the status
bar<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.470> appliqu

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
bar and appliqu

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.090 
bar and appliqu
here<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.750> overall<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.200> love<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.620> look<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.950> feel

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
here so overall I love the look and feel

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.380 
here so overall I love the look and feel
that<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.430> tweak<00:02:16.730> gives<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.270> your

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
that this tweak gives to your

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.120 
that this tweak gives to your
applications<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.200> just<00:02:18.410> makes<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.770> feel<00:02:18.950> that

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
applications it just makes it feel that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.740 
applications it just makes it feel that
little<00:02:19.250> bit<00:02:19.460> more<00:02:19.610> polished<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.240> guess<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.660> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
little bit more polished I guess is the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.690 
little bit more polished I guess is the
best<00:02:20.780> way<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.110> put<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.710> yeah<00:02:22.250> everything

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
best way to put it and yeah everything

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.890 
best way to put it and yeah everything
just<00:02:22.850> flows<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> little<00:02:23.450> bit<00:02:23.540> more<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.750> it

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
just flows a little bit more and it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.840 
just flows a little bit more and it
makes<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.290> feel<00:02:24.470> like<00:02:24.530> less<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.280> screen<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
makes it feel like less of the screen is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.240 
makes it feel like less of the screen is
wasted<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.660> that's<00:02:26.930> always<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.200> good<00:02:27.410> thing<00:02:27.470> now

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
wasted so that's always a good thing now

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.890 
wasted so that's always a good thing now
as<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.790> mentioned<00:02:28.820> before<00:02:29.150> there<00:02:29.540> are<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.690> few

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
as I mentioned before there are a few

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.780 
as I mentioned before there are a few
bugs<00:02:30.230> sometimes<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:30.860> can<00:02:31.070> slow<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.520> device

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
bugs sometimes it can slow the device

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.880 
bugs sometimes it can slow the device
down<00:02:32.120> quite<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.600> bit<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.140> will<00:02:33.290> notice<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.830> I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
down quite a bit you will notice that I

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.770 
down quite a bit you will notice that I
think<00:02:34.160> right<00:02:34.340> now<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.630> beta

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
think right now but it is in beta

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.540 
think right now but it is in beta
hopefully<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.350> PA<00:02:36.530> team<00:02:36.770> can<00:02:37.010> rectify<00:02:37.190> all

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
hopefully the PA team can rectify all

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.220
