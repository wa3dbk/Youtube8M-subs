00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.449
 and well hello friends it is auxi 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.920
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.150
 new fashion presentation on 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.199
 minecraft today we end up 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.060
 for a small fashion 1.8 bauer apple then 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.529
 this power apple mode what is it 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.259
 good it's a mode that will add you 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.119
 super shit apples and in minecraft 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.739
 it is that an ore 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.920
 he's going to add a mineral to this mode 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.600
 and his apples will be very very very very 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.840
 very very very very very very hard at 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.250
 have and I 'll show you that all of 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.930
 suite so here are all the objects that 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.399
 are added by the mode you go 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.829
 power finally you can see that this 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.530
 very little is a mode not very long to 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.280
 finish but that is very expensive when 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.829
 even so we'll start by talking 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.079
 ore so here you add 4 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.960
 ores and two apples so there dimon 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.579
 apple and obsidian apple so everything 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 first to start this mode he will 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.380
 have to collect magic to gold so that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.070
 you can find between layer 0 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.790
 and 5 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.680
 it's a pretty rare ore the mode is 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.640
 really very very difficult way I 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.439
 tell you I tell you again 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.899
 then you will be able to have some 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.149
 magic oldest finally the magic of this forgiveness 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.100
 with the magic 2 you will be able to kraft 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.439
 and the magic diamond is as well as the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.000
 madgi obsidian dust and so suddenly I 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.119
 will show you right away the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.720
 kraft then there is a bug I can ah bah 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.479
 it works 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.009
 by ap eu of bug then so for ea magic 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.990
 2 and ben you can not to crafter 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.979
 you just break the magic and gold 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.430
 paul diamond magic dust you need 8 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.549
 diamond and a magic 2 to have a 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.259
 magic diamond is one you do not have 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.869
 only one to make an apple 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.500
 you need 9.8 sorry you need it 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.750
 8 you see the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.210
 consumption to make an apple and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 then the magic obsidian dust for the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.540
 do and I find it less expensive 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.110
 because it's easier obsidian 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.149
 to have only diamond so for the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.560
 business you will need eight obsidian 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.470
 and a magic dust then you have them 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.590
 apples so the apples you have first 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 so there dimon apple has and then there we can 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.190
 more see the craft we can not see anymore 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.890
 kraft it's very weird so I'm going 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:33.709
 show you myself the craft up 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.709
 it will take me one to port hope 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.680
 it will take low and the so beautiful if I 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.720
 know that do not see he'll have me 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.459

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.200
 that there are men bugs and not wait 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.150
 I 'm going to do like that here in the case 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.970
 it was good we had feared so for the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.910
 apple in diamonds you will need 8 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.250
 magic diamond is as well as an apple and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.090
 so you'll have to die manapul so the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.040
