00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.140 

nothing<00:01:19.040> they<00:01:19.190> take<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.490> place<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.700> arrows

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
nothing they take the place of arrows

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.490 
nothing they take the place of arrows
you<00:01:20.300> can't<00:01:20.510> physically<00:01:20.870> use<00:01:21.170> them<00:01:21.350> as<00:01:21.470> a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
you can't physically use them as a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.440 
you can't physically use them as a
stabbing<00:01:21.830> weapon<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.760> I<00:01:22.790> have<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.030> get<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:23.210> bow

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
stabbing weapon so I have to get a bow

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.770 
stabbing weapon so I have to get a bow
to<00:01:23.690> try<00:01:23.900> out<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.230> Spears<00:01:28.480> now<00:01:29.480> I'm<00:01:29.600> going<00:01:29.750> to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
to try out the Spears now I'm going to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.140 
to try out the Spears now I'm going to
draw<00:01:29.960> my<00:01:30.110> spear<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.650> it<00:01:31.550> just<00:01:31.760> looks<00:01:31.970> like<00:01:32.120> a

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
draw my spear and it just looks like a

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.620 
draw my spear and it just looks like a
reskin<00:01:32.630> arrow<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.350> really<00:01:33.770> thick<00:01:34.010> I<00:01:34.630> don't

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
reskin arrow it's really thick I don't

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.300 
reskin arrow it's really thick I don't
think<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.140> takes<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.500> little<00:01:36.620> bit<00:01:36.860> longer<00:01:37.070> to

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
think it takes a little bit longer to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.490 
think it takes a little bit longer to
draw<00:01:37.610> but<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:38.390> saw<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.630> base<00:01:38.870> damage<00:01:39.080> of<00:01:39.410> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
draw but you saw the base damage of the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.990 
draw but you saw the base damage of the
spear<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.860> base<00:01:40.010> damage<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.610> spear<00:01:40.850> is

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
spear the base damage of the spear is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.960 
spear the base damage of the spear is
incredibly<00:01:41.720> low<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:43.190> I'm<00:01:43.340> just<00:01:43.460> going<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.760> go

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
incredibly low so I'm just going to go

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.430 
incredibly low so I'm just going to go
into<00:01:44.180> third<00:01:44.360> person<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:44.930> can<00:01:45.110> see<00:01:45.260> what

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
into third person so you can see what

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.290 
into third person so you can see what
the<00:01:45.530> spears<00:01:45.770> look<00:01:45.950> like<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.280> my<00:01:46.400> back<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.970> what

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
the spears look like on my back and what

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.550 
the spears look like on my back and what
they<00:01:53.390> look<00:01:53.540> like<00:01:53.570> when<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:53.990> draw<00:01:54.229> them<00:01:54.380> with<00:01:54.530> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
they look like when you draw them with a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.100 
they look like when you draw them with a
bow<00:01:54.800> in<00:01:54.979> third<00:01:55.160> person<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.630> reason<00:01:56.960> why<00:01:57.080> I

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
bow in third person so the reason why I

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.780 
bow in third person so the reason why I
say<00:01:57.470> Spears<00:01:57.830> might<00:01:58.040> have<00:01:58.160> been<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.310> troll<00:01:58.520> moved

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
say Spears might have been a troll moved

farther back oh you can see the drop a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.259 
farther back oh you can see the drop a
little<00:03:08.090> bit<00:03:08.209> more<00:03:08.510> prominently

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.479 

and<00:03:15.269> yeah<00:03:16.019> that's<00:03:16.260> pretty<00:03:16.590> harsh<00:03:16.890> drop

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489

and yeah that's pretty harsh drop
I<00:03:23.390> don't<00:03:24.390> think<00:03:24.420> spheres<00:03:24.840> are<00:03:25.049> leveled<00:03:25.500> I'm

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
I don't think spheres are leveled I'm

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.710 
I don't think spheres are leveled I'm
pretty<00:03:26.310> high<00:03:26.489> level<00:03:26.849> right<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.420> think

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
pretty high level right now and I think

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.259 
pretty high level right now and I think
I'm<00:03:27.870> pretty<00:03:28.379> big<00:03:28.769> on<00:03:28.980> encountering<00:03:29.549> anything

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
I'm pretty big on encountering anything

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.009 
I'm pretty big on encountering anything
that<00:03:30.420> could<00:03:30.569> be<00:03:30.690> leveled<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.379> game<00:03:33.950> and

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
that could be leveled in the game and

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.509 
that could be leveled in the game and
there<00:03:37.019> don't<00:03:37.170> seem<00:03:37.379> to<00:03:37.440> be<00:03:37.560> any<00:03:37.680> variations

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
there don't seem to be any variations

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.539 
there don't seem to be any variations
other<00:03:38.700> than<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.060> rippling<00:03:39.450> Spears

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.309 

so<00:03:44.549> now<00:03:44.700> we'll<00:03:44.909> see<00:03:45.090> how<00:03:45.299> Spears<00:03:45.689> can<00:03:45.959> protrude

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319
