high-power<00:00:22.140> bicycle<00:00:22.920> light<00:00:23.660> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.560> end

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
high-power bicycle light in the end

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.060 
high-power bicycle light in the end
you'll<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.730> something<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.180> looks<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
you'll have something that looks a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:37.479 
you'll have something that looks a
little<00:00:29.070> bit<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:31.489> battery<00:00:32.489> pack<00:00:33.050> light

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.280 

you<00:00:38.489> could<00:00:38.730> also<00:00:38.940> build<00:00:39.270> something<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
you could also build something that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:54.139 
you could also build something that
looks<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.160> using<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.000> same<00:00:42.180> parts<00:00:53.149> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
looks like this using the same parts the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.130 
looks like this using the same parts the
guts<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.620> identical<00:00:56.960> just<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
guts of it are all identical just the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.090 
guts of it are all identical just the
housing<00:00:58.530> differs<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> we'll<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.140> over<00:01:01.410> all<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
housing differs so we'll go over all the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
housing differs so we'll go over all the
parts<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.820> before<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:04.170> have

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
parts that you see before you we have

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.270 
parts that you see before you we have
here<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> couple<00:01:05.400> connectors<00:01:06.000> male<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> female

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
here a couple connectors male and female

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
here a couple connectors male and female
one<00:01:08.280> comes<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> battery<00:01:09.180> pack<00:01:09.450> one

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
