so<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:06.750> basically<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.380> can<00:03:07.560> be

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
so that's basically all this can be

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.140 
so that's basically all this can be
going<00:03:07.860> out<00:03:07.950> foo<00:03:08.160> month<00:03:08.370> e<00:03:08.579> three<00:03:09.329> themes<00:03:10.070> Chima

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
and next month on might be the same I'm

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.890 
and next month on might be the same I'm
not<00:03:23.459> sure<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:23.760> still<00:03:23.820> deciding<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.540> Ninjago

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
not sure I'm still deciding on Ninjago

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.110 
not sure I'm still deciding on Ninjago
if<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.380> should<00:03:25.590> get<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.890> x1<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
if I should get the x1 and the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.729 
if I should get the x1 and the
destructoid<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:28.260> for<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.560> sake<00:03:28.709> of

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
destructoid just for the sake of

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.870 
destructoid just for the sake of
completing<00:03:29.370> than<00:03:29.519> jogo<00:03:30.060> 2014<00:03:30.750> collection<00:03:31.560> I

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
completing than jogo 2014 collection I

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.160 
completing than jogo 2014 collection I
guess<00:03:32.880> technically<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.420> haven't<00:03:33.690> completed

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
guess technically I haven't completed

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.340 
guess technically I haven't completed
that<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:35.690> well<00:03:36.690> actually<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.109> haven't

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
that and well actually I haven't

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.599 
that and well actually I haven't
completed<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.950> because<00:03:38.100> i<00:03:38.190> don't<00:03:38.370> have<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
completed that because i don't have the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.940 
completed that because i don't have the
x1<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.720> anyway<00:03:39.959> i'm<00:03:40.049> still<00:03:40.260> deciding<00:03:40.380> on<00:03:40.769> that

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
x1 but anyway i'm still deciding on that

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.770 
x1 but anyway i'm still deciding on that
so<00:03:41.579> probably<00:03:42.540> won't<00:03:42.780> be<00:03:42.840> getting<00:03:43.079> Ninjago<00:03:43.609> up

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
so probably won't be getting Ninjago up

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.940 
so probably won't be getting Ninjago up
now<00:03:45.780> something<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.590> would<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.799> to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
now something that I would like to

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.770 
now something that I would like to
announce<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.730> going<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.150> make<00:03:48.180> my<00:03:48.480> stop

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
motions a lot better and which will

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.789 
motions a lot better and which will
probably<00:03:53.250> be<00:03:53.430> more<00:03:54.060> exciting<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.260> got<00:03:55.530> a

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
probably be more exciting is I got a

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.380 
probably be more exciting is I got a
green<00:03:56.579> screen<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.600> am<00:03:57.900> going<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.290> be<00:03:58.440> using
