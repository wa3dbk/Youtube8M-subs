00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:10.139
 and youtube on which I'm going to teach 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.610
 a tutorial about how to play a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.839
 the villagers that really is something very 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 simple to do here as they can 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.460
 manage since it is already created by the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.050
 world of minecraft and well it is very 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.850
 simple what I did I did a little 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.039
 modifications to what houses would be 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.019
 from this village right now that I'm about 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.150
 the houses will be able to appreciate that in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.949
 instead of having only one door they have two 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 doors or have three doors and not only 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.970
 follow them from one side but they have you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.280
 of two or more sides and why is this 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.170
 good because according to friends told me 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.030
 well I informed myself a video the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.780
 the code has come out of minecraft 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.330
 how good what the villagers 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.100
 They place it as a house is a door that is 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.620
 if in a structure and a door is a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.600
 house and if there is another door is another house 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.360
 regardless if it is the same house or 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.130
 not if there are two doors are you going to think that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.600
 are two houses there are three doors going to 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.030
 pass yes they are three houses or at least 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.310
 from what I understood and what it is that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 help us this I will do so much this is 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.330
 hear noise in what this helps us 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.030
 good to have more houses as they can 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.280
 know the villagers reproduce between 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 the more they are and the more they are and have 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.350
 more space to procreate go then 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.730
 if they have a bigger house if they have 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.690
 more houses that means they have more space 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.630
 they can 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.950
 give birth and have children then like 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.990
 It should be like that with humans 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 or if you already have the house then perfect 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 we are going to have a child but we do not believe 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.810
 baby then well this is what they do 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.990
 the villagers very well very well villagers 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.480
 the batteries are put and nothing starts then 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.890
 already knowing how to do things to get out 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.420
 that will be the baby villagers that are those 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.090
 all little creatures that start 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.190
 to connect but is that many times the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 allies babies are very funny 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.110
 the little ones and how they run 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.340
 and tenderness in a way this 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.860
 basically it's all here as you can see 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.240
 I'm showing villages in the villages 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.640
 the houses as you can see have three 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.990
 doors or sometimes even more or two e 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.120
 regardless of how many you put 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 but as I understand it, the more 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.010
 doors put in a house or so there's more 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.680
 chances of being born faster 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.660
 the babies or that they come out more understood 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.250
 then it was when I showed nothing here 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.400
 fast what would this be and now we go 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.480
 to wait a while the truth I did not know 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 how long would I have to wait 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.260
 until a baby or two was born or to see 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.790
 how many were born in a certain time 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.400
 so I informed myself 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.230
 they were born every day or it was a day of 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.909
 complete minecraft and you could already 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.129
 find with one or two depending on 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.870
 how many villagers are you clear ok here 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.250
 as it may have marked of found 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.689
 I did not put a break because the little one 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.609
 elusive goes super fast to the 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.620
 speed of light and then get wet very 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.239
 quickly then I did not want to lose it and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.040
 then not having to show anything in the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.810
 video you have to think about what's wrong 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.189
 then remove as you can see be with 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.950
 his father seems to me to be from which 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.599
 he who gave birth to him and well here is 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.909
 the little one and see if he looks at me 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.799
 this ugly mini 6 and if you stop seeing what 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.139
 hey quiet old but it does not matter 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.810
 here as you can see already in October what 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.810
 that would be a baby a day, nothing else is 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.609
 thing to gather the villagers alone in 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.680
 a village to put several doors is 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.900
 as a little trick to increase your 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.500
 reproduction you also know what frames 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.930
 villagers there in a village is going to appear 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.189
 they keep the iron golem going to 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.169
 have more chances of appearing 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.760
 faster and these serve a lot because 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.409
 because if you are in the village or near 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.120
 of the village put in try to protect 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.170
 so they can protect you too 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.420
 tea 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.250
 in the villagers and well it's good to have them 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.230
 there because they really defend you 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.870
 help defend the most hostile 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.160
 so this is basically all the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.930
 tutorial I hope you liked it 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.150
 really any doubt or comment 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.110
 leave it down here and another answer with 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.580
 pleasure 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.170
 a like without much prohibited the channel 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.480
 encourages a lot and we know that the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.370
 content you're liking and good 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.000
 favorite if you've loved them there's no more 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.010
 what to say 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.170
 the tutorial is very simple you know if 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.090
 really just how to generate villagers by 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.830
 what because the villagers are not good for 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.450
 exchange with them and they can us 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.250
 give very useful things or we can 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.720
 troll too much like the bald 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.390
 price the story that sometimes trolls 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.280
 this is good times but this 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.410
 basically this the video one more time 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.590
 I hope you liked it and good 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.420
 so far I'm going to really leave 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.799
 I hope it serves me this is something that 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.060
 I knew I did not know that the villagers of 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.660
 faster playback while 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.639
 I had more doors but for me it's something 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.810
 interesting to know and then there is one thing 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.340
 more than learning from minecraft to doubles 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.229
 days then this has been all for today 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.540
 I hope you liked it like 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:29.760
 chubby treats kristen vertex player 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.760
 live 12 and see you on xbox live 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.640
 I do not know what's happening they keep looking at me 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.640
 a private session for stopping talking
