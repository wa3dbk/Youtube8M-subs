a<00:01:19.140> medium<00:01:19.590> instead<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.189> small<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> went

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
a medium instead of a small but I went

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.560 
a medium instead of a small but I went
by<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> size<00:01:21.840> guide<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.729> site<00:01:24.180> in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
by the size guide that's on the site in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.440 
by the size guide that's on the site in
the<00:01:24.810> site<00:01:25.080> sizes<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> guess<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.909> Chinese

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the site sizes I guess in like Chinese

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.700 
the site sizes I guess in like Chinese
sizes<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.630> would<00:01:30.630> think<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
sizes so I would think that I'm like the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.420 
sizes so I would think that I'm like the
same<00:01:31.979> size<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.270> Chinese<00:01:33.780> woman<00:01:34.259> but

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
same size as a Chinese woman but

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.469 
same size as a Chinese woman but
unfortunately<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.790> waist<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
unfortunately not my waist it's just a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
unfortunately not my waist it's just a
little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.900> larger<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.310> particular

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
little bit larger so in this particular

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.810 
little bit larger so in this particular
skirt<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.479> need<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.200> medium<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.950> definitely<00:01:41.460> size

to look together because you got the
matching<00:04:28.469> shirt<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.009> then<00:04:29.189> you<00:04:29.340> got<00:04:29.520> the

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699

matching shirt and then you got the
polkadot<00:04:30.180> skirt<00:04:30.629> and<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.379> just<00:04:31.560> really<00:04:31.740> feel

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.760 
polkadot skirt and so I just really feel
like<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.639> pulled<00:04:32.909> the<00:04:33.180> look<00:04:33.719> together<00:04:34.199> but<00:04:34.620> it

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
like it pulled the look together but it

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.800 
like it pulled the look together but it
also<00:04:34.949> poured<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.610> apart<00:04:36.029> because<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.449> got<00:04:36.629> the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
also poured it apart because you got the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.260 
also poured it apart because you got the
matching<00:04:37.020> shirt<00:04:37.499> and<00:04:37.740> skirt<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.610> it's<00:04:38.879> kind<00:04:39.150> of

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
matching shirt and skirt so it's kind of

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.450 
matching shirt and skirt so it's kind of
doing<00:04:39.479> a<00:04:39.779> lot<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:40.349> then<00:04:40.529> when<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.889> put<00:04:41.159> pair

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
doing a lot but then when you put pair

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.939 
doing a lot but then when you put pair
it<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.879> red<00:04:42.090> pumps<00:04:42.749> that<00:04:43.169> also<00:04:43.379> has<00:04:43.710> that

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
it with the red pumps that also has that

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.610 
it with the red pumps that also has that
clear<00:04:44.340> insole<00:04:44.909> I<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:45.689> it<00:04:45.810> really<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.110> puts

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
clear insole I think it really just puts

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.409 
clear insole I think it really just puts
it<00:04:46.830> together<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.639> just<00:04:47.819> makes<00:04:48.060> everything

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
it together and just makes everything

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.959 
it together and just makes everything
look<00:04:48.599> really<00:04:49.139> classy<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:49.710> edgy<00:04:50.340> but<00:04:50.520> also

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
look really classy and edgy but also

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.360
