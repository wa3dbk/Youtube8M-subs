00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.240
 at the moment in Ukraine it is very 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.349
 brittle lull 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 which at any time can be 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.840
 explode any provocation and in 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 once again grow into a collision 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.810
 as I understand it now in general 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.239
 the process of resolving the situation on 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.730
 Ukraine is already much less 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.120
 degree depends on own 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.990
 Ukrainian politicians in these positions 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 because after officially 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.930
 too deep involvement was lit 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.480
 united states guide the entire 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.510
 proper Ukrainian opposition and all 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.090
 her demands with desire and aspirations i 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.030
 I understand that before but after that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 so one hundred percent 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.630
 Russian Federation with full 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.579
 official non-interference cannot 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.430
 participate in this conflict at least 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.619
 United States negotiation level 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.630
 because today it is clear 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.149
 It was clear a couple of months ago 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.399
 it does not hide even the individual 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.499
 the opposition that the war in Ukraine 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.909
 being fought not so much against Ukraine 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:22.859
 so much against the Ukrainian government 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.200
 how much against the Russian Federation 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.960
 so russia whether he wants it or not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.149
 wants is a party to conflicts and here 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.689
 Now due to the fact that the Ukrainian 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.520
 power 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.039
 sorry for the tautology is not able 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.679
 by the power of the holder because when you have 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.560
 two months to a row of 4 thousand militants 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.420
 paralyze the life of the capital and display 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.520
 proving the life of the whole state 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 you are no longer the power and the opposition is not 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.639
 state this power raise because 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.219
 have so to say status parliamentary 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:56.039
 the opposition is practically nothing there 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.779
 support her on the same maidan by 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.850
 sundays comes best 

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:02.069
 one and a half to two thousand of Kiev residents so take a walk 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.200
 on holiday and the rest of the time 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.909
 the main shock force of the same 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.709
 the opposition is the same action movie 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.990
 which do not control is not rated and 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.950
 klitschko not even generally not 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.950
 controls 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.060
 Therefore, the opposition does not have the strength to power 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.950
 lift from the ground and it is clear that the crisis is to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.890
 play could only be resolved by two 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.330
 in ways 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.180
 either flowing already started 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.880
 civil war in the bloody phase when 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.060
 there would be no 57 on the streets 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.190
 and hundreds of thousands of corpses would be either the same 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.410
 gradually wear it out 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.690
 some sort of compromise which 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.600
 actually does not cancel in opposition 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.780
 but puts it off for a while 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.300
 as far as I understand now this kind 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.030
 compromise option somewhere groped and 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.340
 starts to pretend to life judging by 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.300
 all negotiations will be about 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.739
 so for the next presidential election 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.590
 presidential powers were maximally 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.580
 reset to the same time for 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.550
 new constitution bill 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.739
 federalization actually occurred 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.709
 countries and much of the authority 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.540
 It was transferred to the field to remove here 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.840
 this one is a conflict between the west and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.760
 east at least for a while this 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.010
 it is clear that all the same west east 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.650
 will vote in different ways it is clear that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.540
 all the same part of the parliament chosen 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.280
 east torment parliament chosen 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.320
 West will still look in 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.750
 different sides and it is clear that this 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.690
 conflict is not resolved completely non 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.160
 least be some way 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.470
 postponed until parliamentary elections 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.870
 seventeenth year from my point of view 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.840
 Now the opportunity Olya so 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.850
 I sum up the possibility of quasi and 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.000
 the peaceful resolution of conflict that is 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.269
 transfer it to the latent stage 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.140
 when it will be put off somewhere 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.570
 seventeenth year this can be achieved 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.310
 only by actual zeroing 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.610
 presidential authority what is now 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.310
 negotiations are underway and thus withdrawal 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.980
 conflicts for 15 year and the only 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.040
 a problem that does not allow 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.310
 one hundred percent certainty to say that 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.810
 peaceful resolution is almost inevitable 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.990
 it's having a big enough 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.240
 the number of militants including on the streets 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.070
 Kiev who have nothing to lose and nowhere 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.590
 go and 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.320
 not by chance lately 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.630
 constantly warns of upcoming 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.430
 provocations preparing terrorist attacks and so 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.380
 then I understand that people who 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.030
 conflict resolution is necessary 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.830
 as the only chance to stay on 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.400
 freedom 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.560
 they just need to shift the blame for 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.030
 blood on the planning side and therefore 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.030
 any provocations are really possible
