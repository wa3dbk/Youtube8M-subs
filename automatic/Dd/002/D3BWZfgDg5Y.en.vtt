00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
one mil in this game that is not the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
one mil in this game that is not the
start<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.340> hoping<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
start that I was hoping for and you can

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
start that I was hoping for and you can
definitely<00:01:15.780> tell<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.770> momentum<00:01:17.369> was<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
definitely tell the momentum was all the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
definitely tell the momentum was all the
way<00:01:18.210> towards<00:01:18.810> our<00:01:18.990> opponents<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> game

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
way towards our opponents in this game

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.490 
way towards our opponents in this game
so<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> figure<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.290> turn

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
so we have to figure out how we can turn

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740 
so we have to figure out how we can turn
it<00:01:22.650> around<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.159> hopefully<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it around and hopefully we can do that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.050 
it around and hopefully we can do that
soon<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> attack<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:26.939> him

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
was one of the most ugly goals that I've

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160 
was one of the most ugly goals that I've
ever<00:02:01.350> shot<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.610> at<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> same<00:02:03.090> time<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.689> didn't

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
ever shot but at the same time I didn't

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.249 
ever shot but at the same time I didn't
even<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.560> credit<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.790> yeah<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.990> don't
