00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
saying you will die much quicker you

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.580 
saying you will die much quicker you
can't<00:02:56.760> run<00:02:56.940> out<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.269> Rambo<00:02:57.780> like<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.560> in

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
can't run out like Rambo like you can in

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.050 
can't run out like Rambo like you can in
Halo<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.400> not<00:02:59.640> fun<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.030> is

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
Halo not that that's not fun it is

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.420 
Halo not that that's not fun it is
extremely<00:03:00.600> fun<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:01.980> doesn't

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
extremely fun but here it just doesn't

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.759 
extremely fun but here it just doesn't
work<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.390> introduces<00:03:04.050> more<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.440> slower

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
work so it introduces more of a slower

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.880 
work so it introduces more of a slower
pace<00:03:05.100> more<00:03:05.600> strategical<00:03:06.600> kind<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.230> thought

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
pace more strategical kind of a thought

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.410 
pace more strategical kind of a thought
process<00:03:08.190> when<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.640> actually<00:03:08.820> go<00:03:09.060> into<00:03:09.300> these

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
process when you actually go into these

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.300 
process when you actually go into these
fire<00:03:09.720> battles<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.320> can't<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.709> throw<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
fire battles you can't just throw a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.610 
fire battles you can't just throw a
grenade<00:03:11.459> repeatedly<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.630> run<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.380> could

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
grenade repeatedly and run in you could

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.020 
grenade repeatedly and run in you could

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
if you're doing co-op because then

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.699 
if you're doing co-op because then

waves<00:04:19.260> basically<00:04:20.010> like<00:04:20.190> horde<00:04:20.489> mode<00:04:20.669> from

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
waves basically like horde mode from

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.510 
waves basically like horde mode from
years<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.299> war<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.470> they<00:04:22.680> just<00:04:22.889> keep<00:04:23.040> coming

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
years of war and they just keep coming

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.030 
years of war and they just keep coming
and<00:04:23.639> coming<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.270> coming<00:04:24.470> what<00:04:25.470> they<00:04:25.770> change

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
and coming and coming what they change

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.920 
and coming and coming what they change
it<00:04:26.160> up<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.460> bit<00:04:26.490> when<00:04:26.850> they<00:04:26.910> put<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.330> skulls<00:04:27.750> like

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
it up a bit when they put on skulls like

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.600 
it up a bit when they put on skulls like
auto<00:04:28.590> auto<00:04:29.540> evade<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.900> other<00:04:31.770> ones<00:04:32.070> like<00:04:32.310> they

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
auto auto evade and other ones like they

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.070 
auto auto evade and other ones like they
have<00:04:32.820> better<00:04:33.030> chance<00:04:33.389> of<00:04:33.540> sticking<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.050> with

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
have better chance of sticking you with

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.530 
have better chance of sticking you with
grenades<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:34.919> on<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.940> increases

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
grenades and so on so it increases

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.420 
grenades and so on so it increases
difficulty<00:04:37.470> as<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.710> go<00:04:37.830> on<00:04:37.890> with<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.220> waves

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
difficulty as you go on with the waves

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.850 
difficulty as you go on with the waves
and<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.780> randomized<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.560> fight

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
and it is randomized so you fight

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.230 
and it is randomized so you fight
different<00:04:41.220> enemies<00:04:41.490> every<00:04:41.730> time<00:04:41.910> which<00:04:42.090> is

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
different enemies every time which is

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.050 
different enemies every time which is
very<00:04:42.419> cool<00:04:42.600> so<00:04:43.169> it's<00:04:44.130> basically<00:04:44.370> like<00:04:44.790> horde

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
very cool so it's basically like horde

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.730 
very cool so it's basically like horde
mode<00:04:45.210> for<00:04:45.450> halo<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:46.230> very<00:04:46.290> fun

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
mode for halo and I think it's very fun

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.230 
mode for halo and I think it's very fun
and<00:04:46.860> have<00:04:46.950> fun<00:04:47.130> with<00:04:47.310> four<00:04:47.550> players<00:04:47.790> more<00:04:48.030> so

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
and have fun with four players more so

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.050 
and have fun with four players more so
than<00:04:48.390> hormone<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.100> it's<00:04:50.100> it's<00:04:50.400> challenging

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
than hormone and it's it's challenging

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.880 
than hormone and it's it's challenging
especially<00:04:51.240> on<00:04:51.630> heroic<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.290> legendary<00:04:52.710> these

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
especially on heroic and legendary these

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.180 
especially on heroic and legendary these
guys<00:04:53.070> will<00:04:53.340> will<00:04:53.970> probably<00:04:54.450> kill<00:04:55.169> you<00:04:55.320> no<00:04:55.950> joke

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
guys will will probably kill you no joke

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.640 
guys will will probably kill you no joke
so<00:04:56.669> firefight<00:04:57.510> works<00:04:57.750> single<00:04:58.229> player<00:04:58.380> works

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650

simply because you also get all the

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.510 
simply because you also get all the

multiplayer maps for halo 3 to play
afterwards<00:05:32.970> on<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.840> too<00:05:34.080> plus<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.680> can<00:05:34.830> play

halo 3 on this 2 multiplayer for long
you<00:05:38.370> don't<00:05:38.490> need<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.880> disc<00:05:39.150> for<00:05:39.570> halo<00:05:39.810> 3

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.980 
you don't need the disc for halo 3
anymore<00:05:40.289> so<00:05:40.830> um<00:05:41.250> overall<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:42.419> think<00:05:42.479> it's<00:05:42.810> worth

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
anymore so um overall I think it's worth

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.620 
anymore so um overall I think it's worth
it<00:05:43.229> but<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.310> can<00:05:44.640> see<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.060> if<00:05:45.270> you're<00:05:45.450> not<00:05:45.570> a

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
it but I can see that if you're not a

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.840

big<00:05:45.870> fan<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.110> halo<00:05:46.530> you<00:05:47.039> probably<00:05:47.430> won't<00:05:47.669> love

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
big fan of halo you probably won't love
