00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.639
 Hello everyone today, I want to show how 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 me if i don't have fried sea 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.550
 sea ​​cabbage or gem like me her 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:23.060
 I cook that is sold in stores 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:29.189
 this is such a fried sheet 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:33.260
 crispy sea ​​kale either can 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.030
 buy a lot cheaper 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.860
 50 bodies. for sushi in that almost seven 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 Sheets price is about the same to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.050
 u7 writes the top ten but it's cabbage I just 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.090
 for sushi it is raw and just let tapia 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 not very tasty for those who love 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.149
 roasted cabbage will show her 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 make home to start i'll cut 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.030
 in half a sheet because I took 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.030
 small pan 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.420
 so here I have a mixture of sesame and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.360
 olive oil mix because 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 sesame oil is very hot at 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.409
 frying us our sheet 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 show on one sheet of sheet must be very 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.200
 it is good to miss the oil on both sides but 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.009
 I thought the amount of oil depends on 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.810
 every person who does not like goering 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.810
 here also do less 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 Mystic 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:06.260
 not fried not much more affordable here 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.260
 such a high price 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:21.390
 so you can do it yourself so me 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.890
 warming up the pan hope you can see me 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.890
 I put my leaf in the pan and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.890
 fry 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.069
 one of the parties 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.599
 middle side fire 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.940
 need such a layer to impose each on 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.940
 friend and seas there 10 20 sheets 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.970
 see how sesame oil starts 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.920
 so you can burn in simple oil 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.840
 fry that i usually buy ready 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.200
 sliced 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:46.060
 crying you are a load of sesame oil therefore 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:50.470
 used remove turn on 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:55.540
 frying pan and here loksy here 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.730
 are pepper-flavored slides with wasabi and 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:04.959
 salt in general, quite what you like 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:11.010
 you can sprinkle wasabi me or 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:14.010
 I prefer vertebras with red pepper 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.010
 manageable 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.219
 talk a little bit 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.690
 you can see how crisp it turned out 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.039
 so and 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:53.890
 turned out exactly the same crunchy 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:56.860
 Fried faxes are probably heard as 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.490
 my children are very, very crunchy 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:05.500
 love but such a leaf for example put 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:08.890
 cooked rice pub and slice salty 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.640
 cabbage kimchi and either river where it is very 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:16.960

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:20.280
