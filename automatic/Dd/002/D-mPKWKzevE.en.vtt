stunt is most impressive out of the

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.559 
stunt is most impressive out of the
people<00:02:52.159> competing<00:02:52.700> they<00:02:53.000> would<00:02:53.209> win<00:02:53.419> or

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569

something<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.109> another<00:02:54.829> idea<00:02:54.980> similar

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
something like that another idea similar

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.280 
something like that another idea similar
to<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:56.000> thought<00:02:56.239> was<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.870> would<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.079> pretty

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
to this I thought was it would be pretty

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.140 
to this I thought was it would be pretty
cool<00:02:57.349> in<00:02:57.769> game<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:58.280> there<00:02:58.489> was<00:02:58.639> a<00:02:58.760> team

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
cool in game if there was a team

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.699

type<00:03:12.169> games<00:03:12.439> but<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.859> think<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.459> definitely

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
type games but I think it's definitely

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.819 
type games but I think it's definitely
possible<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.599> introduce<00:03:15.139> game<00:03:15.349> modes<00:03:15.560> very

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
possible to introduce game modes very

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.439 
possible to introduce game modes very
similar<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.340> things<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.639> tony<00:03:16.909> hawk<00:03:17.150> games

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
similar to things like tony hawk games

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.119 
similar to things like tony hawk games
and<00:03:17.659> considering<00:03:18.319> what<00:03:18.500> they've<00:03:18.650> done<00:03:18.799> i<00:03:18.859> mean

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
and considering what they've done i mean

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.740 
and considering what they've done i mean
we<00:03:19.280> do<00:03:19.400> have<00:03:19.430> tennis<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.090> golf<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:20.599> have

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
sports in game so rock stars

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.339 
sports in game so rock stars
capabilities<00:03:23.150> are<00:03:23.299> pretty<00:03:23.479> much<00:03:23.629> the<00:03:23.690> sky<00:03:24.109> and

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
capabilities are pretty much the sky and

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.990 
capabilities are pretty much the sky and
the<00:03:24.409> potential<00:03:25.159> for<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.519> would<00:03:25.699> be<00:03:25.819> there

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000
