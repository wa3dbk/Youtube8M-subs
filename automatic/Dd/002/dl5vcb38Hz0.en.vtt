server just totally had an orgasm over

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.229 
server just totally had an orgasm over
this<00:00:50.199> because<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.219> all<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.729> cool<00:00:51.909> buildings

this because of all the cool buildings

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.380 
this because of all the cool buildings
you<00:00:52.390> can<00:00:52.420> make<00:00:52.629> with<00:00:52.780> these<00:00:52.960> um<00:00:54.089> now<00:00:55.089> instead

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
you can make with these um now instead

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.719 
you can make with these um now instead
of<00:00:55.449> doing<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:55.960> you<00:00:56.229> can<00:00:56.379> well<00:00:57.219> knock<00:00:57.550> that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
of doing this you can well knock that

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.360 
of doing this you can well knock that
you'd<00:00:57.969> have<00:00:57.999> to<00:00:58.300> put<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.479> block<00:00:58.839> and<00:00:59.079> then

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
you'd have to put a block and then

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.160 
you'd have to put a block and then
underneath<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.329> looks<00:01:01.539> maybe<00:01:01.929> a<00:01:02.019> little

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
underneath so it looks maybe a little

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.259 
underneath so it looks maybe a little
better<00:01:02.379> depending<00:01:02.679> on<00:01:02.920> how<00:01:03.609> you<00:01:03.670> use<00:01:03.819> it<00:01:03.969> and

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
better depending on how you use it and

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.670 
better depending on how you use it and
I'm<00:01:04.330> not<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.510> good<00:01:04.659> builder<00:01:05.019> I<00:01:05.199> just<00:01:05.530> play
