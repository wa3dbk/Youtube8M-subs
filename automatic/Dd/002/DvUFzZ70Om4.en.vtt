about how many different types of water
holding<00:00:41.190> frogs<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.360> so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
holding frogs are there there are so

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.790 
holding frogs are there there are so
many<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> really

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
many and you know one of the really

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
many and you know one of the really
interesting<00:00:44.010> things<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> Australia<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.270> but

interesting things in Australia is but

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.290 
interesting things in Australia is but
there's<00:00:46.230> always<00:00:46.559> new<00:00:47.129> species<00:00:47.670> being<00:00:47.910> found

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
there's always new species being found

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.590 
there's always new species being found
so<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.960> constantly<00:00:49.680> changing

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
so it's constantly changing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.939 
so it's constantly changing
when<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.750> frogs<00:00:52.140> burrow<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> ground

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
when these frogs burrow into the ground

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.529 
when these frogs burrow into the ground
they<00:00:53.370> form<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> cocoon<00:00:54.030> around<00:00:54.390> themselves

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
they form a cocoon around themselves

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.380 
they form a cocoon around themselves
made<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> their<00:00:55.500> own<00:00:55.649> loose<00:00:55.980> skin<00:00:56.390> inside

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390

made up of their own loose skin inside
this<00:00:57.570> cocoon<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.170> Frog<00:00:58.350> keeps<00:00:58.620> completely

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
this cocoon the Frog keeps completely

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000 
this cocoon the Frog keeps completely
still<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.910> slows<00:01:00.719> its<00:01:00.960> metabolism<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
still and slows its metabolism to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.179 
still and slows its metabolism to
prevent<00:01:02.340> moisture<00:01:02.550> loss<00:01:03.290> some<00:01:04.290> aboriginal

prevent moisture loss some aboriginal

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.070 
prevent moisture loss some aboriginal
groups<00:01:05.220> view<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.880> frog<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.570> very

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
groups view this frog as a very

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
groups view this frog as a very
important<00:01:07.560> source<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.920> water<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> outback

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
important source of water in the outback

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
important source of water in the outback
the<00:01:09.570> temperatures<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.140> soar<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:10.979> above<00:01:11.010> 40

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the temperatures can soar well above 40

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.940 
the temperatures can soar well above 40
degrees<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.510> water<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.470> become<00:01:13.590> almost

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
degrees and water can become almost

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
degrees and water can become almost
impossible<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.880> find<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.810> interesting<00:01:16.140> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
impossible to find it's interesting with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.410 
impossible to find it's interesting with
a<00:01:16.500> lot<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.920> stories<00:01:17.700> some<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
a lot of the stories some of them are to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
a lot of the stories some of them are to
do<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.350> finding<00:01:19.830> food<00:01:20.070> how<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> how

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
do with you know finding food how to how

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
do with you know finding food how to how
to<00:01:20.759> live<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> desert<00:01:22.229> you've<00:01:22.500> really

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to live and in the desert you've really

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.320 
to live and in the desert you've really
got<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.790> you're<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.090> survive

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
got to know how you're going to survive

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.140 
got to know how you're going to survive
so<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:25.020> you're<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> long<00:01:26.070> walk<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.909> don't

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so if you're on a long walk you don't

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
so if you're on a long walk you don't
have<00:01:27.360> any<00:01:27.509> water<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.159> is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
the dry creek bed you dig the dry creek
beds<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:32.850> dig<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> these<00:01:33.420> frogs

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
beds and you will dig one of these frogs

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
beds and you will dig one of these frogs
up<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> little

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
will be able to survive these frogs

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
will be able to survive these frogs
meant<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.320> more<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> Aboriginal<00:01:44.399> people

meant much more to the Aboriginal people

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
meant much more to the Aboriginal people
than<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> clever<00:01:45.210> way<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> finding<00:01:45.810> water

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
than a clever way of finding water

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
seem a little boring but it's better

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.850
