so here's an example of a young man who
consulted<00:01:03.440> about<00:01:03.579> having<00:01:04.579> his<00:01:04.670> nasal<00:01:05.000> labial

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
folds treated and looking at his face I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.540 
folds treated and looking at his face I
recommended<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.960> chin<00:01:09.229> augmentation<00:01:09.550> to

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
chin augmentation procedure and I think

you'll agree that um he looks great and
this<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:24.530> design<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.520> implant

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
this is the design of the implant

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.490 
this is the design of the implant
it's<00:01:26.530> silastic<00:01:27.549> it's<00:01:28.549> soft<00:01:28.940> it's<00:01:29.840> tapered<00:01:30.320> at

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
it's silastic it's soft it's tapered at

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.810 
it's silastic it's soft it's tapered at
the<00:01:30.950> edges<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:32.570> helps<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.140> contour<00:01:33.820> with

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
the edges and that helps it contour with

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.800 
the edges and that helps it contour with
your<00:01:35.030> natural<00:01:35.240> jaw<00:01:35.720> line<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:37.780> because<00:01:38.780> of

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
your natural jaw line and because of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.100 
your natural jaw line and because of
this<00:01:39.049> tapering<00:01:39.530> design<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:41.060> blends<00:01:41.450> in<00:01:41.750> with

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
this tapering design it blends in with

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.800 
this tapering design it blends in with
your<00:01:42.619> natural<00:01:42.979> jaw<00:01:43.460> line<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.850> we'll<00:01:44.570> see<00:01:44.780> that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
your natural jaw line and we'll see that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.960 
your natural jaw line and we'll see that
in<00:01:45.110> this<00:01:45.229> example<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.790> young<00:01:46.909> woman

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
in this example so this is a young woman

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.719 
in this example so this is a young woman
who<00:01:47.299> wanted<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.750> strengthen<00:01:48.200> her<00:01:48.290> jaw<00:01:48.500> line<00:01:48.729> we

fillers<00:02:19.319> underneath<00:02:19.680> their<00:02:19.860> eyes<00:02:23.569> so<00:02:24.569> here's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
fillers underneath their eyes so here's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.569 
fillers underneath their eyes so here's
another<00:02:25.230> example<00:02:25.439> and<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> nice

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
another example and one of the nice

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.630 
another example and one of the nice
things<00:02:26.879> about<00:02:27.560> chin<00:02:28.560> augmentation<00:02:28.739> surgery

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
things about chin augmentation surgery

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.149 
things about chin augmentation surgery
is<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:29.930> through<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.079> same<00:02:31.349> incision

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
is that through the same incision

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.990 
is that through the same incision
you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.640> both<00:02:33.239> augment<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.989> chin<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.000> sculpt

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you can both augment the chin and sculpt

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.599 
you can both augment the chin and sculpt
the<00:02:36.329> neck<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.379> can<00:02:37.620> make<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.069> face<00:02:38.430> look

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
the neck and this can make the face look

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.319 
the neck and this can make the face look
more<00:02:38.909> athletic<00:02:39.439> so<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:41.549> same<00:02:41.790> incision<00:02:42.209> was

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
more athletic so the same incision was

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.599 
more athletic so the same incision was
made<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.590> again<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.069> implant<00:02:44.430> was

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
made here and again the implant was

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.390 
made here and again the implant was
placed<00:02:44.939> and<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.680> time<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.069> did<00:02:47.250> some

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
placed and but this time we did some

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.860 
placed and but this time we did some
liposuction<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.359> addition<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:50.750> here<00:02:51.750> we've

more athletic more fit and we were both

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.220 
more athletic more fit and we were both
very<00:02:58.200> happy<00:02:58.349> with<00:02:58.650> these<00:02:58.769> results<00:03:00.230> here's

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.830 
very happy with these results here's
another<00:03:01.530> example<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.420> example<00:03:03.420> shows

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
another example and this example shows

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.770 
another example and this example shows
how<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:05.069> chin<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.849> cheeks<00:03:06.150> are<00:03:06.420> really

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
how the chin and the cheeks are really

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.830 
how the chin and the cheeks are really
important<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.650> making<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.700> face<00:03:08.909> look<00:03:09.180> good<00:03:09.420> so

very fast recovery

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.379 
very fast recovery
so<00:04:56.229> speaking<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.919> recovery<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.879> recovery<00:04:57.909> is

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
so speaking of recovery the recovery is

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
it's an outpatient procedure as we said

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.929 
it's an outpatient procedure as we said
before<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:04.599> here's<00:05:05.469> an<00:05:05.560> example<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:06.159> recovery

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
before so here's an example of recovery

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.170 
before so here's an example of recovery
this<00:05:07.900> is<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.139> man<00:05:08.409> was<00:05:08.620> interested<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:09.490> neck

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.890 
contouring and again we recommended a
chin<00:05:13.419> augmentation<00:05:14.939> these<00:05:15.939> are<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.300> final
