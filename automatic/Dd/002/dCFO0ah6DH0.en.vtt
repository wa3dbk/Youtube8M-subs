of the device so each email is fully

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.399 
of the device so each email is fully
encrypted<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.700> decrypted<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.990> moment<00:01:40.350> we

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
encrypted it's decrypted the moment we

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.109 
encrypted it's decrypted the moment we
access<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.009> soon<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.790> was
