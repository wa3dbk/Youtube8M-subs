00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
but they're heavy duty wax they're

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.770 
but they're heavy duty wax they're
really<00:00:43.290> difficult<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> recycle<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
really difficult to recycle and

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.119 
really difficult to recycle and
landfills<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:46.079> take<00:00:46.469> forever<00:00:46.679> to<00:00:46.949> break

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
landfills they take forever to break

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.130 
landfills they take forever to break
down<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.339> landfill<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> folks<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:48.870> clean

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
down a landfill so the folks at a clean

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.000 
down a landfill so the folks at a clean
flame<00:00:49.519> decided<00:00:50.519> they<00:00:50.640> would<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.929> kind<00:00:51.929> of

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
flame decided they would a kind of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
flame decided they would a kind of
repurpose<00:00:53.010> them<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.339> turn<00:00:53.519> them<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.820> these

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
repurpose them and turn them into these

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.880 
repurpose them and turn them into these
these<00:00:54.719> firestarters<00:00:55.019> which<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:55.679> really

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
these firestarters which are really

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.610 
these firestarters which are really
pretty<00:00:56.160> handy<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.089> I've<00:00:57.929> tried<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.499> them

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
pretty handy so I've tried one of them

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.500 
pretty handy so I've tried one of them
out<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> I'll<00:00:59.550> tell<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.089> burned<00:01:00.269> for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
out and I'll tell you that it burned for

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.130 
out and I'll tell you that it burned for
about<00:01:00.809> 13<00:01:01.469> minutes<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> that's<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.780> pretty<00:01:03.929> good

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
about 13 minutes so that's a pretty good

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
about 13 minutes so that's a pretty good
burn<00:01:04.379> time<00:01:04.650> before<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> fire<00:01:05.280> starter<00:01:05.640> it's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
burn time before a fire starter it's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.580

for a week you got rained on for about

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
for a week you got rained on for about
three<00:01:19.680> straight<00:01:20.010> days<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.970> has<00:01:21.150> been

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
three straight days and it has been

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
three straight days and it has been
drying<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.740> couple<00:01:23.010> days<00:01:23.190> but<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:23.940> still

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
drying for a couple days but it's still

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.570 
drying for a couple days but it's still
kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> damp<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.860> definitely<00:01:26.190> I<00:01:26.250> looked<00:01:26.460> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
kind of damp and definitely I looked you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.430 
kind of damp and definitely I looked you
can<00:01:26.730> see<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.690> may<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.110> even<00:01:28.290> see

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
can see you really may not can even see

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.350 
can see you really may not can even see
that<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.710> camera<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.160> is<00:01:29.220> kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> damp<00:01:29.730> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that on camera but it is kind of damp so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
that on camera but it is kind of damp so
what<00:01:31.230> I<00:01:31.260> thought<00:01:31.410> we'd<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.830> this<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
what I thought we'd do with this one is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
what I thought we'd do with this one is
go<00:01:32.700> ahead<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.230> dump<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.800> see<00:01:35.330> with<00:01:36.330> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
go ahead and dump it out and see with a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.880 
go ahead and dump it out and see with a
Ferro<00:01:36.660> rod<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.050> we<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:37.590> lit

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
Ferro rod if we can get this thing lit

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.000 
Ferro rod if we can get this thing lit
with<00:01:37.980> a<00:01:38.010> Ferro<00:01:38.220> rod<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.670> ok<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.860> just

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
with a Ferro rod so ok so and we just

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.500 
with a Ferro rod so ok so and we just
dump<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:43.670> no<00:01:44.670> further<00:01:44.910> processing

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
dump it out here no further processing

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.580 
dump it out here no further processing
we're<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.440> dump

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
we're going to do it it's going to dump

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.990 
we're going to do it it's going to dump
it<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.770> entirely<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.400> little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.730> damp

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it out entirely it's a little bit damp

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.330 
it out entirely it's a little bit damp
so<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.110> may<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.470> may<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.590> work<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> Ferro

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so this may or may not work with a Ferro

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
so this may or may not work with a Ferro
rod<00:01:50.400> this<00:01:50.670> time<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.600> first<00:01:51.840> time<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.260> did<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
rod this time the first time I did it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.070 
rod this time the first time I did it
with<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.980> Ferro<00:01:53.340> rod<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.540> very<00:01:54.630> dry

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
with a Ferro rod and it was a very dry

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.900 
with a Ferro rod and it was a very dry
and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.950> hit<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.370> couple<00:01:56.400> of<00:01:56.580> times<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
and I just hit it a couple of times it

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.090 
and I just hit it a couple of times it
lit<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.330> we'll<00:01:58.260> see<00:01:58.440> if<00:01:58.470> it'll<00:01:58.620> strike<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
lit so we'll see if it'll strike with a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:11.270 
lit so we'll see if it'll strike with a
fair<00:01:59.310> ride<00:01:59.870> after<00:02:00.870> being<00:02:01.080> wet<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.620> long

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.320 

so<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.340> can<00:02:12.459> see<00:02:12.580> it's<00:02:12.670> trying<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:12.940> smolder

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so you can see it's trying to smolder

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.770 
so you can see it's trying to smolder
but<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.690> really<00:02:17.879> it's<00:02:18.879> damp<00:02:19.180> I'm<00:02:19.450> telling

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
but it is really it's damp I'm telling

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.880 
but it is really it's damp I'm telling
you<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.989> mean<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.260> can<00:02:20.410> feel<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> as<00:02:20.709> being

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
you I mean I can feel it as being

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.839 
you I mean I can feel it as being
damaged<00:02:22.530> let's<00:02:23.530> maybe<00:02:23.709> try<00:02:23.830> processing<00:02:24.700> up<00:02:24.819> a

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
damaged let's maybe try processing up a

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.390 
damaged let's maybe try processing up a
little<00:02:25.030> bit<00:02:25.120> finer<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.989> want<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.950> give<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.190> every

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
little bit finer I want to give it every

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.789 
little bit finer I want to give it every
opportunity<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:28.390> work<00:02:28.599> because<00:02:28.900> when<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.769> was

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
opportunity to work because when it was

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.820 
opportunity to work because when it was
dry<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.400> lit<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:30.940> with<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.420> frail<00:02:31.720> ride<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.230> it

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
dry I lit it with a frail ride and it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.190 
dry I lit it with a frail ride and it
burned<00:02:33.069> for<00:02:33.519> 13<00:02:33.910> straight<00:02:34.120> minutes<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.720> it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
burned for 13 straight minutes and it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.990 
burned for 13 straight minutes and it
only<00:02:35.319> took<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.620> few<00:02:35.650> strikes<00:02:36.010> delighted<00:02:36.459> it's

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
only took a few strikes delighted it's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.490 
only took a few strikes delighted it's
just<00:02:37.239> too<00:02:37.390> damp<00:02:37.629> to<00:02:37.900> work<00:02:38.049> with<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.260> Pharaoh

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
just too damp to work with the Pharaoh

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770 
just too damp to work with the Pharaoh
rides<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.010> all<00:02:39.459> right<00:02:39.549> so<00:02:39.760> let's<00:02:39.880> try<00:02:40.120> hey

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
rides so all right so let's try hey

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.680 
rides so all right so let's try hey
lighter<00:02:41.910> because<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.090> believe<00:02:43.299> in<00:02:43.329> carrying<00:02:43.660> a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
lighter because I believe in carrying a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.140 
lighter because I believe in carrying a
big<00:02:43.840> ladder<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.410> being<00:02:44.590> prepared<00:02:44.739> but<00:02:45.519> it'll

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
big ladder and being prepared but it'll

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.589 
big ladder and being prepared but it'll
light<00:02:46.269> right<00:02:46.450> up<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> lighter<00:02:48.420> no<00:02:49.420> big

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
light right up with a lighter no big

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.690 
light right up with a lighter no big
deal<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.260> couple<00:02:50.950> things<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:51.340> thought<00:02:51.549> were

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
deal so a couple things I thought were

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.400 
deal so a couple things I thought were
really<00:02:51.849> cool<00:02:52.060> about<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.450> clean<00:02:52.630> flame<00:02:52.900> fire

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
really cool about the clean flame fire

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.170 
really cool about the clean flame fire
stars<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.950> they're<00:02:54.519> made<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.849> hundred

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
stars is they're made of a hundred

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.670 
stars is they're made of a hundred
percent<00:02:55.299> recycled<00:02:55.690> material<00:02:56.410> they<00:02:56.560> don't

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
percent recycled material they don't

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.620 
percent recycled material they don't
have<00:02:56.769> anything<00:02:56.980> at<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.340> at<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:57.579> they<00:02:58.269> just<00:02:58.480> use

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
have anything at it at all they just use

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.350 
have anything at it at all they just use
FDA<00:02:58.989> food<00:02:59.349> grade<00:02:59.590> wax<00:02:59.890> cardboard<00:03:00.459> boxes<00:03:00.849> they

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
FDA food grade wax cardboard boxes they

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.150 
FDA food grade wax cardboard boxes they
also<00:03:01.510> make<00:03:01.810> fire<00:03:02.049> logs<00:03:02.319> from<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.890> same

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
also make fire logs from the same

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.000 
also make fire logs from the same
material<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.840> there's<00:03:05.110> no<00:03:05.290> toxic<00:03:05.799> additives

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
material and there's no toxic additives

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.850 
material and there's no toxic additives
to<00:03:06.519> assist<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> burn<00:03:07.269> process<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.019> that's

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
to assist in the burn process so that's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.259 
to assist in the burn process so that's
probably<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.610> reasons<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.970> it

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
probably one of the reasons that it

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.460 
probably one of the reasons that it
didn't<00:03:10.540> really<00:03:10.629> like<00:03:10.870> when<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:11.170> down

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
didn't really like when it was down

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.550 
didn't really like when it was down
there<00:03:11.950> lightweight<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.519> little<00:03:12.730> packs<00:03:12.940> here

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
there lightweight the little packs here

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.819 
there lightweight the little packs here
this<00:03:14.560> pack<00:03:14.769> weighs<00:03:15.010> about<00:03:15.190> an<00:03:15.430> ounce<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.989> if

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
this pack weighs about an ounce and if

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.229 
this pack weighs about an ounce and if
it's<00:03:17.980> wet<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.370> just<00:03:18.549> pour<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.819> out<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.090> light

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
it's wet you just pour it out and light

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.059 
it's wet you just pour it out and light
it<00:03:19.359> directly<00:03:19.569> like<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.900> just<00:03:20.079> did<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.530> it

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
it directly like we just did and it

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.129 
it directly like we just did and it
lights<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.730> fine<00:03:22.000> with<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.450> flame<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.959> saw

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
lights just fine with a flame you saw

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.870 
lights just fine with a flame you saw
that<00:03:23.350> they're<00:03:24.010> also<00:03:24.160> good<00:03:24.489> for<00:03:24.609> starting

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
that they're also good for starting

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.430 
that they're also good for starting
barbecues<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.510> fireplaces<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.200> whatever

else<00:03:26.500> because<00:03:27.040> they're<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.519> not<00:03:27.670> toxic<00:03:28.150> you

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
else because they're just not toxic you

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.599 
else because they're just not toxic you
