00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello guys I don't load videos in this 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.610
 channel for a long time because the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.920
 grammar is engaging me enough 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.099
 and then because I don't always find things 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.099
 interesting to tell 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.680
 today they are particularly 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.199
 inspired and beyond to make you admire mine 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.240
 bedroom 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.599
 I wanted to talk to you about a lot of news 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.540
 interesting that I read on the internet is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.510
 which practically concerns the experience 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.040
 a boston teacher then a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.480
 US teacher who is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.770
 moved to Finland to live with the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.090
 his family to his Finnish wife 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 so he found himself doing 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.520
 the teacher in finland was a 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.550
 very interesting article because 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.640
 practically described as different 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 the organization of the school in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.689
 Finland compared to the United States but 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 from what of that respect but how 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.080
 also different from Italy from 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.290
 what I read because practically 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.000
 suffice it to say that the elections of the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.909
 pupils practically if I didn't understand 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.340
 bad there is say 3000 volts is practically 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.759
 I know if I didn't understand wrong there are nine 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.290
 classes in one school and are nine 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.680
 years of school 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.549
 I will no longer say practically any obligation 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.549
 I promise you 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.259
 and so nothing he found himself in 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.600
 do the teacher in this school and have 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:46.560
 said that for example the lessons last 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 45 minutes and at the end of each lesson of 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.869
 each of each lesson of each subject there 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.420
 they are fifteen minutes of pause then 15 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.040
 minutes of break every 45 minutes of 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.649
 lesson 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 obviously he found himself catapulted into 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.759
 a school reality very different from 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.229
 those of the united states and from what 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.770
 I have read very differently also compared 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.789
 to ours 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.379
 Italian because he was surprised ad 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.319
 example of the fact that they were all there 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.239
 these breaks but the boys when he has 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.069
 attempted the first time not to do 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.860
 let's say this break they were going to 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.720
 explode the pupils and so it is 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.330
 realized that these pauses are useful and do 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.459
 very well to the body and mind indeed 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.200
 he said told in the interview 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.049
 that during breaks come out that 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.299
 rain or the sun comes out 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.069
 to have fun, in short, to have some fun 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.319
 both boys and teachers 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:49.230
 even said that the first few times 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:50.810
 he in the 15-minute breaks yes 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.829
 preparing for the next lesson 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.720
 prepared the next lesson e 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.549
 Finnish colleagues told him but 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200
 you do come and have a coffee with us 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.140
 and therefore he made himself convinced 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.299
 noticed that it was actually useful to do 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.220
 this break every 45 minutes not just for 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.319
 students but also for teachers 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.840
 and therefore he realized that it is a method 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.069
 effective 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.739
 the boys are much cooler during 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.600
 all day with these short breaks and 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.769
 frequent are able to better follow the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.109
 elections 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.769
 alternating fun with concentration 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:28.380
 it is necessary at school and therefore all 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.750
 the school organization is at levels 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.049
 preparation for a lot more kids 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.319
 effective and much more bearable 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.489
 compared to the rest of the others 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.410
 schools where it does not work that way 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.019
 example from us because the first thing that 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.209
 I said I thought when I read 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.010
 the article said beautiful also Italy 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.019
 instead, Italy does not kill you 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.319
 elementary schools that are middle schools 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.530
 that it is in high school is a torture because 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.959
 however keep the concentration for 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.730
 five six hours in a row between 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.739
 tiny break of recreation that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.889
 it still takes ten minutes is very much 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:09.210
 difficult and really puts to 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:13.500
 let's say so 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.850
 makes it like saying it's very difficult to keep 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.170
 concentration ca n't find words 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.630
 seen I'm messing up a lot 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.550
 when I see my brothers that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.610
 deaths from school re-enter 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.110
 because in any case it is very tiring to go to 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.400
 school is not at all simple 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.730
 I wonder but how did I do it sometimes 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.500
 I ask him how did he wake me up all 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.460
 holy days at half past six 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.260
 morning and high school for example six 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.160
 consecutive teaching hours with ten 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.540
 minutes of pause 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.660
 I remember that I was very tired 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.940
 return home at 15 in the afternoon 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.920
 however, I still wonder how I did it 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.470
 endure such a thing will be that 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.340
 when you are young you don't even know there 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:03.870
 perhaps he realizes the real effort 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.390
 but if I think of going back to me 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.190
 I'd rather shoot because 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.260
 anyway 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.970
 I can't think of them, I think now 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.390
 like now if my school is being rewritten 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.250
 it would be a trauma six hours in a row too 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.040
 if maybe I studied at university 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.930
 many hours in a row studied at home 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.270
 but follow a slightly different lesson 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.250
 that anyway, at home, you get up at one 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.130
 pause you drink and fruit juice drinks you 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.320
 a coffee goes to the bathroom instead to school 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.630
 however you have to sit on that desk 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.030
 on the chair for six hours to listen 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.620
 carefully the lesson not to mention 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.740
 then of the anxieties of the gods 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.840
 queries and so on and so 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.240
 nothing was very interesting to have 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.440
 this comparison also because teaching 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:55.050
 Italian teaching Italian grammar 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:57.720
 even if only line for now 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.890
 is interested in knowing the realities of 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.630
 schools outside of Italy 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.090
 I know that in these countries in the countries 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.200
 Scandinavian 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.010
 I knew they were very different from each other 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.960
 but here I was absolutely not at 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.360
 current of all these pauses of this 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.560
 completely different organization for 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.930
 which nothing was an article 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.540
 interesting because it is right for 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.410
 these things because maybe you know it's there 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.110
 abroad a better organization 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.740
 could maybe bring one tomorrow 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.990
 school also changes 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.419
 also the Italian school even if not 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.100
 I think I just threw a sentence of one 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.810
 hope but I don't know how much it will change 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.970
 because I think the school here anyway 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.220
 in Italy it is not well organized for 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.280
 nothing is seen even from the preparation 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.240
 and from the people who come out 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.529
 from school 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.749
 in short, nowadays 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:57.399
 and a somewhat complicated but not a situation 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:01.619
 I want to open this topic because 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:04.709
 otherwise it would be a flop of three and a half hours 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:08.459
 and therefore nothing 

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:09.909
 let me know what you think if 

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:12.009
 appreciated in this type of 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:13.509
 organization if you have heard maybe 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.159
 from other countries where it exists 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.749
 yet a different organization but 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:22.529
 much more challenging than the 

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:22.529
 our school and I greet you
