00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.980
 good then we will try to make the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.110
 cooking we're going to make a little dessert to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.389
 milk base something extremely 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.429
 simple you never did that 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.710
 but thank god we have two specialists 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.590
 the little alexandra the little sandra who 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.109
 are two little sarah who know 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.269
 very very good cook so there we have not 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.099
 of risk took place this is one of 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.480
 the simplest recipes that is there 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 what does it take 6 e it takes 140 g of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.300
 sugar a vanilla pod a liter of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.680
 milk that's all not the watch then you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.890
 see how simple it is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.410
 start by pouring milk from raw milk 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.530
 or pasteurized milk it does not 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 of importance and we will put it to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.469
 boil 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:58.440
 he's here we'll see you and that's it 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.890
 so here we start forgiveness and that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.260
 market 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 what fat still works there 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.549
 are you going to break eggs when 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.270
 even never go to lady break 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.430
 eggs that I look at you in the milk 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.869
 we will put a vanilla pod then 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.369
 I always make the pod of 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.610
 vanilla in two you see I do like 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.530
 that and I will try to knock down 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.790
 all the little grains because you 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.560
 see inside the pod of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.180
 vanilla there are plenty of small grains 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.240
 you see them there at the end you see them 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 ben look at his stars must then i'm going 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.939
 to scratch well and I will 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.650
 have them all fallen inside 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 the pan because that's what will give 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.450
 really taste it's going to cook 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.540
 quietly we are there is enough the six 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.600
 alosi vasic towards this month that in and the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.329
 more will do quietly 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 you will mix the sugar oil and not 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.430
 afraid to put your fingers when we 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.979
 cooking you have to put your fingers 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.479
 that's it and go ahead 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.520
 stir that and during that time there is going 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.140
 to make a small caramel a small caramel 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.829
 so we'll put a little bit of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.170
 sugar whose semolina bottom because 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.420
 that's what will allow us to see 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.050
 we put a little sugar and we go 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.360
 put a 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.360
 he gets two months see the post 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.010
 you see no more than that we put that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.150
 whose bottom is maybe not 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.020
 a lot and we put another one 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.270
 little bit that's it and we're going 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:30.000
 light his way there and then the sugar and 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.280
 the water will start to melt it's going 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.260
 change color it will become first 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.330
 light beige and then it will darken 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.050
 and we're going to do what's called 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.910
 caramel 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.700
 oh there, we're in the process of 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.260
 succeed in all of that so I'm not coming 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.680
 it goes up it goes up it goes up 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.480
 slowly 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.550
 look look look look at his 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.640
 flat mode and we stop 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.370
 it was time but it was successful then 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.510
 there you see we'll leave him a whole 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.000
 a little cool 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.830
 there we will remove it look caramel 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.470

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.290
 beautiful there it is really perfect on 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.270
 will leave him there now you see 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.060
 the cooled 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.100
 I'm going to pour it gently into the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.590
 bowl very gently 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.860
 watch out and you keep spinning 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.989
 look how good it is you see 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.940
 all these little black dots this is the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.070
 vanilla what they are like leaving it 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.660
 bomb 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.500
 look like it smells good it smells 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.239
 milk and vanilla it's great 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.400
 and here and there now I'm going to 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.530
 verse whose mold can not do 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.420
 something simpler than that 1 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.070
 it's beta are frankly 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.230
 and here and now I'm going to put 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.480
 on you've seen I've done something 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.770
 thing and I have no explanation because 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.450
 my grandmother when she was doing 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.980
 eggs with milk she always put a 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.630
 piece of paper in the bottom of the mold 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.700
 I do not know why she was doing it 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.989
 but always did it and I do not 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.890
 could not give me explanations 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.310
 besides, I told him why you 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.140
 do this 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.459
 she tells me I do not know but my grand 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.989
 mother was telling me to do it like that 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.180
 so I'm doing exactly that 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.950
 as it will cook in a bain-marie the wine 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.440
 husband that means with water and in 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.000
 the oven I put a little water see 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.920
 the paper is being spoiled 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.390
 here is a little bit of water to make 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.150
 bain marie is what you want to have the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.489
 kindness to open the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.400
 the tote to my little bunny then 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.780
 look we're going to put that in an oven at 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.150
 220 to 220 and we'll let him cook 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.150
 for 40 minutes 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.680
 or it's not bad at all and therefore this 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.300
 matter then 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.100
 so what I advise you is 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.960
 to go wait there in the living room in 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.160
 the greenhouse we will let it cool and 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.990
 we're going to eat it now look at my 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.280
 little wolves to watch these loans 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.600
 look how beautiful and how 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.699
