00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
your piece of jewelry and then we're

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
your piece of jewelry and then we're
also<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> cover<00:00:57.989> earrings<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
also going to cover earrings and how to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.340 
also going to cover earrings and how to
play<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> drops<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.239> necklace<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.199> going

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
play it drops to necklace so it's going

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.550 
play it drops to necklace so it's going
to<00:01:01.440> twist<00:01:01.940> back<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:06.600> opens<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.320> loop

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
to twist back and that opens that loop

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.670 
to twist back and that opens that loop
up<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.610> enough<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.900> able<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.290> bring<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
up just enough to be able to bring this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.310 
up just enough to be able to bring this
in<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> slide<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
in and slide it and you can see it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.649 
in and slide it and you can see it's
trapped<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.939> I'm<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
trapped on there then I'm just going to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.530 
trapped on there then I'm just going to
reach<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.979> pliers<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.390> going

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
reach with my pliers and now I'm going

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
reach with my pliers and now I'm going
to<00:01:18.659> rotate<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.130> rotated<00:01:20.670> our

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to rotate that just like we rotated our

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.760 
to rotate that just like we rotated our
wire<00:01:21.000> back<00:01:21.810> toward<00:01:22.170> my<00:01:22.350> body<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:24.770> here

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
wire back toward my body like so here

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.170 
wire back toward my body like so here
are<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:25.979> samples<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> give<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> little

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
are some samples to give you a little

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.920 
are some samples to give you a little
bit<00:01:27.360> extra<00:01:27.689> inspiration<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.770> went<00:01:29.490> ahead<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
bit extra inspiration I went ahead and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.899 
bit extra inspiration I went ahead and
wire<00:01:30.930> wrapped<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.439> large<00:01:31.770> lampwork<00:01:32.430> bead<00:01:32.670> here
