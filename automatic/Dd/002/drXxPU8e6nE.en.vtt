00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 new video guys talk here on the channel and the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.069
 Today's video is another tutorial 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.080
 advanced and remembers how I 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.610
 you the advanced tutor viruses they 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.780
 They do not come with rules actually is I 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.670
 I will propose that for you it is a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 a bit more philosophical discussion 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.350
 So let's say what 's good, I'm going to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.630
 who knows some homework for 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.470
 see if we can improve together 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.510
 as a player 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.150
 Let's talk about this one thing. 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 third time promised to do one more 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.789
 The third test was really just me. 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.789
 is that 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.469
 good the video of today he talks about the 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.539
 to create good habits in Pedro's book 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.120
 shopping the next level doctor and he 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.739
 He calls it shocks but I 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.750
 I will not use this jargon until 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.519
 besides not being very convenient it 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.920
 also causes a certain double jump 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.750
 sense with other rules that I can 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.340
 come to talk in future tutorials 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 so let's just focus on creating good 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.110
 habits basically what I mean 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.240
 with creating good habits when you go 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.130
 I play doctor and I want you to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.619
 The following situation imagines that you have the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.299
 letter follow and you have another 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.220
 trintÃ£o at stake is the following to 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.799
 nice mobility you can pay 2 and 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.600
 gives protection to give color to your choice 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.700
 for the target newt 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 when you make an attack when you 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.030
 has that possibility 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.830
 remember that you should review everything 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.149
 what can be can be done 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.319
 it can happen 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.000
 you can give protection to yourself 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.459
 then you talk of production for the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.080
 atlantis you can of this protection before 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.909
 to declare the blockers for 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.799
 that creatures are not blocked 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.569
 You can also do this when the 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.340
 creature have already been locked to 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.910
 that they do not take damage and only cause 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.590
 damage 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.959
 You can also do this in response. 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.849
 to a removal and reminding you if you 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.519
 example to confer protection against the 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.410
 white for the sig himself, he can stay 

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:01.390
 immune to even his probability 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.310
 this kind of thing happens too 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 When we play people normally 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.629
 tends to think of all the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.759
 at least it is possible possibilities 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:12.459
 what should be done however the 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.830
 good player is one that eliminates all 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.900
 the bad possibilities and focus on that 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.849
 at best when you start focusing 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.129
 only the best of the possibilities of 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.500
 you make it a habit you run out 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.170
 releasing mental space to think about 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.209
 more advanced layers of reasoning 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.819
 as foresee for example the plays that 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.980
 You'll do five shifts from here. 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.599
 four shifts starting to imagine and 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.459
 calculate the likelihood of you buying 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.690
 determined kata and with that could 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.730
 interfere with your game 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.120
 Let's go to an example of habits that you 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.430
 can create as a player to reduce the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.379
 Yours, and you're only going to stay. 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.510
 full of things to think and release 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.970
 space for more advanced reasoning 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.340
 Let's go, for example, to turn your 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.930
 land as optimally as possible. 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 you have for example legendary terrains 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.519
 the terrain 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.860
 in fact you will always come to the before 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.599
 of basic land because that's because 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.180
 legendary stars and artifacts they are 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.319
 more vulnerable to the emotions and effects of 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.260
 type 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.329
 another way is to always leave untapped 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.799
 those lands that generate human 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.720
 different colors regardless of you 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.670
 have or not the cards in your hand because 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.349
 even if you only have one piece of land in your hand 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.060
 sometimes it's interesting you fail to 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.409
 facing that mountain you 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.480
 you may only have one piece of land in your 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.680
 opponent may come to imagine that you 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.420
 may have a radius 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.920
 You understood what I mean. 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.870
 players often do 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.700
 plays of the guy type you should not have 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.440
 turned his land this way he 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.819
 She told me but Carol, what's the problem? 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.040
 will make the slightest difference with the hand 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.840
 that I have is makes no difference with 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.940
 hand that you have but makes total difference 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.920
 in the way your opponent understands 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.780
 as such your battlefield 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.859
 You got to get more or less what I 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.690
 I mean by that 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.180
 now we go to the next stage of the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.670
 our reasoning as well as creating good 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.379
 habits and begin to focus on the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.109
 your game to do things the most 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.239
 As good as possible, I do not want you to 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.769
 take these good habits and transform 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.790
 in a simple play 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.349
 automatic 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.269
 suppose you are accustomed to 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.459
 always hit cards against a 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.349
 particular medium you are often 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.299
 playing deck is not exactly that 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.829
 classic list you are accustomed to 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.930
 to find on the internet 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.880
 so it's worth thinking then 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.340
 creating good habits is not the same as 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.510
 stop thinking and start playing 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.910
 automatically creating good habits is 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.180
 just make room for your reasoning 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.510
 to reason things a bit more 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.130
 complexes 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.590
 Now let's also talk a little bit about 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.380
 What would they get used to if habit 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.120
 basically it's something you do for 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.550
 instinct is something that is so 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.500
 used to doing it rather is made 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.440
 automatically not that you are not 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.690
 thinking of an example is the importance 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.610
 you dedicate your training and play in the 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.320
 foundations in the same way as in 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.099
 sport the fundamentals are the most part 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.110
 important is not a talent is a 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.210
 alleged player 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.860
 wonderful are not the basics is 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.930
 train the basics that will make the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.960
 team go the same thing happens in 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.969
 doctor is to stay watching gameplay of 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.530
 amazing and wonderful players with 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.729
 those plays the team of the steering wheel that 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.930
 will improve you as 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.699
 player 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.250
 if you realize that the moment you 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.690
 they start to play only the choice of 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.389
 ground that they do to put in 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.039
 game already makes all the difference is in this 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.590
 aspect that I want you to focus on. 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.770
 on the fundamentals of the game and not on plays 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.539
 good luck the message is this 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.150
 It's very simple and homework to 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.550
 It is when you go play begins 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.470
 to discuss a little more in all 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.419
 plays that you are always going to make 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.460
 to ask yourself what I'm doing 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.080
 wrong this turn and if you think 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.150
 You did not do anything wrong at night. 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.530
 Can you be sure you 're wrong? 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.840
 probably you did something 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.639
 the wrong way and at the end of each 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.620
 every doctor with your training partner 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.570
 ask what could have done what? 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.070
 could have changed the move could have 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.509
 improved with the game 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.610
 most professional players 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.669
 does this and most of the players 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.380
 professionals ensures the doctor is very 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.169
 less luck than it seems 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.130
 what else determines victory are played 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.139
 techniques 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.360
 so remember that the player who 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:13.669
 have the best and most good habits 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.349
 well-trained fundamentals is usually the 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.780
 player who gets more wins 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.520
 good this video of today the guys do not know 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.740
