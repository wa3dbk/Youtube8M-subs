have<00:02:23.200> done<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:25.150> set<00:02:25.360> your<00:02:25.540> valves<00:02:26.020> and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
have done that to set your valves and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.670 
have done that to set your valves and
these<00:02:26.440> engine<00:02:27.220> guys<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.930> want<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.320> do<00:02:29.500> is

these engine guys what you want to do is
you<00:02:29.800> want<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.040> rotate<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.850> engine<00:02:31.360> in<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
you want to rotate the engine in the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.910 
you want to rotate the engine in the
direction<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.610> engine<00:02:34.060> runs<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.920> bring

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
direction that the engine runs and bring

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.150 
direction that the engine runs and bring
it<00:02:36.070> up<00:02:36.220> on<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.820> compression<00:02:37.240> stroke<00:02:37.920> once<00:02:38.920> you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
it up on the compression stroke once you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.980 
it up on the compression stroke once you
bring<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.520> up<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.940> compression<00:02:40.540> stroke

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
bring it up on the compression stroke

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.210 
bring it up on the compression stroke
and<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:42.100> verify<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.110> bring<00:02:44.110> your<00:02:44.380> engine<00:02:44.950> up

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
and you verify that bring your engine up

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.530 
and you verify that bring your engine up
to<00:02:45.610> top<00:02:46.210> dead<00:02:46.540> center<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.610> simply<00:02:48.610> use<00:02:48.940> a

to top dead center and simply use a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.190 
to top dead center and simply use a
couple<00:02:50.020> feeler<00:02:50.530> gauges<00:02:50.950> your<00:02:51.940> intake<00:02:52.600> valve

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
couple feeler gauges your intake valve

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.480 
couple feeler gauges your intake valve
you<00:02:54.040> want<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.460> set<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.910> at<00:02:55.260> mm<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.490> your

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
you want to set it at mm and your

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
exhaust valve at 3,000 once you've

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.670 
exhaust valve at 3,000 once you've
established<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:03.630> good<00:03:04.630> clearance<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.560> your

don't do valve clearance with the engine
hot<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.730> make<00:03:21.940> sure<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.240> it's<00:03:22.660> cooled<00:03:22.930> down
