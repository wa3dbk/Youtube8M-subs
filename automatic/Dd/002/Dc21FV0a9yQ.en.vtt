00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hello everyone, glad to present you my 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.230
 airbrush compressor made on base 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.160
 car compressor car 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.900
 the compressor is meaningless what 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 allows to avoid hit of oil in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.740
 air lines and avoid damage 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.019
 oil painting this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.359
 the compressor consists of the usual 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.279
 automotive source compressor 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710
 power from the computer that allows 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.480
 use car compressor and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.760
 not only 12 volt mains new from 220 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:44.070
 also this receiver pressure gauges and 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.129
 dehumidifier dehumidifier here with 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.489
 gearbox this lever can 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.820
 expose pressure to within 10 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.379
 atmospheres which is very convenient when working with 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.329
 different paint density done here 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.160
 ordinary car nipple embedded 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.869
 can be used in principle any 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:13.880
 car countries here 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.880
 standard non-magic connector 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.520
 let's start the compressor now and pump it up 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.520
 receiver 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.010
 so pumped up the receiver to 3 atmospheres 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:52.290
 Now open the crane lower the flow 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:53.610
 air in the hands we see on the gearbox 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.180
 pressure is now set to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 one and a half atmosphere can be regulated 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:06.080
 less than one and a half is enough for me 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.230
 well now let's try something 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 to draw
