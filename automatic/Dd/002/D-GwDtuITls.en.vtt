00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.249 
sometimes three out of my hair so it's
not<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:49.950> any<00:01:50.790> different<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.049> really

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
not really any different I really really

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.260 
not really any different I really really
like<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.070> smoothing<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.700> spreads

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
like it it's really smoothing it spreads

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.240 
like it it's really smoothing it spreads
easily<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.899> doesn't<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> huge<00:01:55.829> leather

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
easily it doesn't have a huge leather

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.670 
easily it doesn't have a huge leather
but<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> don't<00:01:56.969> find<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:58.409> problem

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
but I don't find that that is a problem

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.770 
but I don't find that that is a problem
because<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.189> still<00:01:59.460> spreads<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.570> nicely

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
because it still spreads really nicely

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990

different<00:03:35.000> can't<00:03:36.000> really<00:03:36.210> comment<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.660> how

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
different can't really comment on how

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.760 
different can't really comment on how
they<00:03:37.320> go<00:03:37.850> color<00:03:38.850> preserving<00:03:39.840> wise<00:03:40.110> because<00:03:40.650> my

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
they go color preserving wise because my

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.700 
they go color preserving wise because my
hair<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.010> dark<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:41.760> it's<00:03:41.910> got<00:03:42.120> oils<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.470> so

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
hair is dark and it's got oils in it so

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.650 
hair is dark and it's got oils in it so
my<00:03:44.280> hair<00:03:44.490> is<00:03:44.520> kind<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.940> all<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> bit<00:03:45.300> funny<00:03:45.480> at

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
my hair is kind of all a bit funny at

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.820 
my hair is kind of all a bit funny at
the<00:03:45.690> moment<00:03:45.960> because<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.230> foils<00:03:46.590> are<00:03:46.650> only

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
the moment because the foils are only

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.850 
the moment because the foils are only
knew<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.790> can't<00:03:48.120> really<00:03:48.480> comment<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.500> how<00:03:49.740> it

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
knew so I can't really comment on how it

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.670 
knew so I can't really comment on how it
goes<00:03:50.010> with<00:03:50.190> preserving<00:03:50.790> those<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.050> imagine

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
goes with preserving those but I imagine

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.100 
goes with preserving those but I imagine
it<00:03:52.770> would<00:03:52.830> do<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:52.980> quite<00:03:53.250> nice<00:03:53.460> job<00:03:54.240> so<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.540> really

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
it would do a quite nice job so I really

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.540 
it would do a quite nice job so I really
really<00:03:55.290> enjoy<00:03:55.560> these<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.190> are<00:03:56.340> really
