00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.269
 how much has changed for you personally 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.769
 team training process and process 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.190
 game 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 but for gameplay I can say that 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.049
 requirements are much higher 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.770
 training nothing else has changed 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.659
 the same exercises are tactics too 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.250
 that's all the same team mood 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.330
 how much has changed in that time 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.270
 when zhigan came but the team knows what 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.159
 need to win all the time mood 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.039
 was fighting 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.840
 only goes up for young all the time 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.399
 the same task was laid out 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.470
 to the fullest and perform and again 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.890
 programmers there is almost nothing 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.890
 is changing 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.050
 buy 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.430
 so i think we have become more intensive 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.119
 Now let's say the guys coming out of the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.119
 depressive state 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.500
 and I think that 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.600
 As they say the chicken pecks on grain 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.700
 so let's increase with each 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.370
 playing with each workout intensity 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.720
 interior cabin better 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.790
 let's say guys are not clamped 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.010
 come out with a smile well uses 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.420
 dedication that unimportant changing room 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.720
 began to live 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.040
 Generally before Donbas what special 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.629
 installation how much will change the composition 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.660
 but the composition and it is very central 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.910
 will change in principle 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.220
 more change and we will not do because 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.740
 what 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.780
 difficult then often change players do not 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.520
 manages to get used to 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.880
 in general, and we will also stick 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.300
 too exactly the rank 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.930
 the focus will be to make sketches of yourself 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.980
 Donbass know that Andrei Nazarov 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.380
 practicing more North American 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.900
 some throws go on finishing off then 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.340
 have in this plan need to be prepared and 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.640
 through swing and backs 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.710
 and does not let the most important thing 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.710
 in the danger zone where the puck is seeking
