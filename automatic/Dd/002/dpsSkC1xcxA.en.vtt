00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 We love to have a first look at the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.259
 quantum of the seas of royal caribbean 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.599
 international in autumn 2014 at the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.130
 start and the characteristic what 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 we already see it is the so-called 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.560
 north star and that is one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.930
 Viewpoint which is currently located 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.050
 So a huge arm you should do with it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.029
 reach a height of about 90 meters 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.430
 that's why she cares so much about me 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 spectacular and the whole thing should be too 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.990
 its free to use is so in the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 Travel price included only to certain 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 Time to sunrise or sunset 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 should cost the money and all 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.020
 spectacular man is supposed to be up there 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
 can actually marry so yes 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 Of course then the requirement that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 it is guaranteed that there is no heights 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420
 So skydiving can be done 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.489
 a stream of air also float completely 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.940
 exciting and this area is her name 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.410
 plex ideal for kids for teens and kids 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.030
 You can drive a car scooter there 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.260
 that actually existed so far 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.910
 not on a cruise ship so 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.879
 really very spectacular 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.650
 this area is called music hall and he 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.060
 goes over two decks here you can see in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.900
 These animations are not really correct yet 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.380
 terribly much but that should be through 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.170
 design for music lovers with live music 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.299
 yes yes and this is a very 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 Spectacular area is called tu 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.720
 seventy so has 270 270 degrees outlook 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.110
 one from there and that is only one 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.079
 huge huge lounge so was with 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.150
 with stage and year it should be there 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.040
 shot against I have already considered 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.439
 this area is replacing the theater 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.030
 completely this is not yet clear 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.130
 but I do not guess at the essens 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.450
 Rear area to protect and theater 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.710
 are usually in the front area so 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.930
 that will not be an aida anyway 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.369
 theatrium even if it is natural 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.990
 similarities but has the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.250
 probably will not replace the theater 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.420
 I could imagine but more 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.100
 still warm this year 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.979
 then experience 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 So I have to be very spectacular 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.460
 really say yes what else can you do 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.799
 Finally, the view on this one 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 inside cabin is no balcony cabin sees 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.680
 like that but that's because you 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.509
 here a so-called virtual 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.209
 balcony has so we are very curious 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.920
 what else comes here on ship tester 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.900
 de you are of course always with you so 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.220
 best subscribe to the channel and then 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.910
 let's see each other again 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.910
 bye bye
