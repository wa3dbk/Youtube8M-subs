00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
 they change and i hope that other people have this creative energy 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.460
 pick up and implement and then have a few years said areas 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.010
 Investment Banking Yes 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.109
 and then you do not have to be the developer too 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.039
 he rewards 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.500
 that they just have not been the mechanisms the templates have been successful 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.669
 just apply in the past 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.919
 RTL see because she is her thing 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.660
 playful to solve because also pleasures also earns money that is 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.529
 if somebody does not have to be fulfilled, namely 1 3 percent 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.020
 year 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.210
 then you have to do this 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.609
 Percent pleased in silos programming skills sometimes 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.159
 Hello, Biodiesel is the name of the game when he's great, but we are 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.159
 have programmed game because they have nothing to do 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.380
 and as if you were a game even if you just become number 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.710
 For sure the men left me a bit on the walls 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.899
 which he first exhibited in public 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.539
 and we must step more courageously to eat great game in development 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.170
 and it can also be wicked 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.600
 because that nobody bought him and as a state winner percent voter approval 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 becomes a leader 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.570
 to be similarly innovative similar to what new to go from home and abroad 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.560
 century 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.390
 is prevent 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.030
 therefore better before 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.240
 While that's no end in sight, Alfa's first breakthrough 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.150
 Talents he has dropped percent it is worth innovating and courageous 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.030
 and to be new 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.049
 can be both financial and financial and therefore arrested 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.549
 you should leave the Uhlenkrug Steiner growing fast 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.140
 because that does not feel excluded 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.430
 what to do was super good at what you really want but he does not want 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.150
 a lot at the European Championships but then it is hard he is hot-dip galvanized 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.760
 Alisa Penalty would have forgiven one 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.640
 If you can see that everything has a different opinion on the artwork 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.080
 were or that the summer break the board got ripped off 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.040
 to address the first but not concrete fact the situation is one 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.110
 other 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.600
 In the meantime it is important to save the francs we are 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.430
 these more too 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.070
