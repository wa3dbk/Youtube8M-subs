00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.669
 two 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.130
 and many of the more studies 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.290
 significant on the brain it 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.000
 they gave from enigmatic cases that 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.469
 allowed to glimpse functions of 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.330
 brain linked to structures 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.190
 particular the same which is the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.770
 cerebral mechanism that allows to recognize 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.990
 the faces of others and even the own 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.269
 a face can be confused 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.039
 familiar by that of an impostor what 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.259
 It happens when a person suffers a damage 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.359
 the brain area where they are processed 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.310
 the images can be upsetting the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.920
 accent with which we speak from 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.660
 a damage to the brain these are some 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.240
 of the questions that we will address in 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 this second block of the enigmas of 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.750
 brain 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.380
 and now I want to tell you the case of a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.070
 very important American artist Chad 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.590
 close that has a selective deficit in 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.870
 the recognition of faces however 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.450
 this has not prevented this artist 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.430
 generate deals based on first 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.130
 photographic drawings in the lobe 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.070
 temporary there is a region that is critical 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.290
 for the process of the faces is called 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.900
 I turn jose and form many of these 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.660
 patients with prosopagnosia is the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.550
 inability to recognize faces have 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.460
 a congenital problem of birth but 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.500
 others have it from injuries in 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.780
 the fusiform gyrus for example a 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.520
 stroke or a tumor 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.200
 in that specific area of ​​the brain 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.060
 [Music] 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 now I want to tell you a syndrome 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.090
 similar but different from the previous one the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.789
 goat syndrome in this condition the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.590
 people think there is an imposter 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.509
 even if they know that person by 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.340
 example women who think that their 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.380
 husband is an impostor although he 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 they recognize physically they think that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.600
 been replaced by the real the week 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.869
 past a patient's family I 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.630
 call and tell me doctor my mother does not 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.850
 recognizes he thinks I'm an imposter 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.229
 what happened to the patient who was 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.000
 intellectually normal is that there was a 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.789
 abnormality at the confluence of 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.190
 affective memory information and 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.069
 sensory another similar case but 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.110
 also different from the previous two 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.599
 is the anton syndrome these people 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.450
 they are blind they can not process the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.970
 visual information however they deny 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.739
 that are blind and act as if they are not 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.640
 they were blind the problem of these 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.390
 people 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.450
 in the eyes or in the optical way but 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.910
 have a lesion in the lobe or cortex 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.210
 occipital is responsible for processing the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.210
 visual information 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.210
 [Music] 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.300
 Imagine one day waking up and talking 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.310
 a foreign accent sounds like science 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.310
 fiction however this what happens 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.590
 when certain vascular accidents 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.420
 affect the brain for example a 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.460
 Argentine person who has an accident 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.130
 zero vascular in addition to the problems 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.450
 Motors and intellectuals start talking 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.420
 with a Chilean accent this can happen in 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.180
 a condition called the syndrome of 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.520
 foreign accent this condition not only 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.070
 appears secondary to an accident 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.380
 vascular but can also occur in 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.450
 children and even in diseases 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.390
 psychiatrists do not know the cause of 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.940
 this phenomenon a hypothesis is that the 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.550
 patients have impaired motor skills 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.680
 fine and this would impact on how they 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.800
 they pronounce the phonemes of their language 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.800
 maternal 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.160
 that we learned today all these cases and 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.400
 others have taught us how the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.230
 healthy brain today we also have the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.569
 opportunity to study the brain in 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.120
 I live the normal brain for centuries 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.239
 the researchers depended on these 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.340
 cases to imagine how the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.950
 brain normally and how to rehabilitate 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.560
 the brain is plastic after a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.660
 injury in a specific area other areas 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.670
 many of them are silent 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.790
 activities can even replace 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.500
 the injured area for many decades 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.100
 I thought that brain neurons 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.100
 adult was not regenerated today we know in 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.840
 part by the work of decades of 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.300
 a single Argentine fernando I do not have 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.750
 working in new york 'that the brain 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.610
 adult generates neurons in certain parts 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.770
 of the brain until the last day of 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.470
 our lives thank you for joining us 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.360
 on this wonderful trip through the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.820
 most complex object in the universe the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.740
 human brain I invite you to the next 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.719
 program where we will analyze the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.479
 positive emotions pleasure 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:51.300
 reward love as the brain regulates 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.699
 the pleasure and the reward that happens to 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.270
 our brain when we fall in love is 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.310
 equal the maternal love of passionate love 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.779
 from the biological point of view the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.779
 I hope next week 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.030
 yes 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:24.730
