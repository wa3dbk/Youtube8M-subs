what risk if y'all going into a boat I

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.490 
what risk if y'all going into a boat I
think<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:21.909> a<00:03:21.970> huge<00:03:22.120> boost<00:03:22.450> but<00:03:22.720> we'll<00:03:23.319> see

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
think it's a huge boost but we'll see

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.960 
think it's a huge boost but we'll see
what<00:03:23.620> ball<00:03:23.829> we<00:03:23.950> get<00:03:24.069> slated<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.730> night<00:03:24.849> they

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
what ball we get slated to it night they

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.930 
what ball we get slated to it night they
won't<00:03:25.060> start<00:03:25.329> from<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.659> from<00:03:25.780> there
