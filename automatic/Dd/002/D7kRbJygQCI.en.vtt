really open all these folders just copy

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.770 
really open all these folders just copy
this<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:23.959> programs<00:03:24.959> all<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.230> games<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:26.780> after

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
this in programs all the games and after

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.360 
this in programs all the games and after
you<00:03:27.870> copy<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> program<00:03:29.099> pouch<00:03:31.370> you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
you copy that in the program pouch you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.430 
you copy that in the program pouch you
want<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:32.970> do<00:03:33.120> more<00:03:33.330> pair<00:03:33.750> what<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.200> do<00:03:34.319> we

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
want to do more pair what you do we

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.410 
want to do more pair what you do we
multiply<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:35.129> probably<00:03:35.640> follow<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> game<00:03:36.299> is

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
multiply you probably follow the game is

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.890 
multiply you probably follow the game is
in<00:03:36.540> program<00:03:36.750> call<00:03:37.819> when<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.970> copy<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.360> files

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
in program call when you copy the files
