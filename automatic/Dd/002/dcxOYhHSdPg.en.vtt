 from gay my name is Dima and this 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.830

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.540
 Champions League 14 keys Mats we have with 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.599
 Manchester first match 1 4 Ural 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.170
 just with meat victory at bavaria 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.210
 over time 20 so 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:30.990
 skipping zapasochka season and begin 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:34.850

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 win need to win friends 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.360
 diaper 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.260
 Orpheus vs. Ramos what a dangerous moment 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.690
 the strength saves in general handsome 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.600
 settle for what it will not change all the sheets 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.869
 again casillas well done here first 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.149
 moment from our manchester i 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.939
 I think just can not play back 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.409
 Become a veranda through yourself as 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.119
 would just pass but he was not at all 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.119
 exact again van persie 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:25.009
 Okay, it's time for us to try and 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:25.009
 attack already but the ball intercepted 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.700
 minor changes in the composition 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.700
 expected ronaldo 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.649
 well this blow of course was awful awful 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.670
 just on goal pass flight somehow but 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.819
 I would like to punch another suddenly scored a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.990
 suddenly large without painting will leave for 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.990
 we had a place and a warrior 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.990
 well, not a bad way of course kosovato but 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.819
 he was quite good for a month and was goin then I 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.560
 no more permutations there 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.560
 composition again early yes breaks ahead 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.410
 seedlings 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.410
 orsio both alonso and then punch 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.390
 a good blow is very tight only necessary 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.390
 was in the far corner and send 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.209
 but then I probably will try to submit 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.829
 Well 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.829
 attempt terrible of course 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.090
 he is percy offside was anderson 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.150
 where am I gonna be late awful just here 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.150
 two bale's left foot fit 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.340
 yes our sword 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.030
 I bow racially 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.890
 you can 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.090
 and the other 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.690
 zil that with you that with you it was 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.390
 running for a not very dangerous moment 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.320
 dangerous van persie tried to pierce it 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.320
 he does well 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.489
 rushed in place 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.079
 without a sober pin burqa make and 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.079
 here is the source 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.430
 but so far more strong moments have created 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:24.570
 urine players are sterile, etc. it's time for us 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.570
 also add a lot of them 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.250
 blink and pass gave handsome man Ramos 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.780
 but how do I risk 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:02.090
 iguain pie 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.090
 Ozil enzymes where that gave 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:13.409
 benzema 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.409
 and fuck of course groin attempt 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.130
 van persie comes out 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.690
 Ramos handsome again 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.930
 dixie 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:46.210
 and they go back to us because we play 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:48.659
 Away, here 's one of the reasons. 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.659
 difficult 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.110
 randa break out bursting aronova no 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.409
 days rafael 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.650
 cafe and for the first time that is pervi got to 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.650
 swords 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.020
 after all 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.370
 ronaldo 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.960
 between our 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.930
 iron deficiency 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.930
 and he think of something 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.710
 where are you giving modric 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:40.890
 gone crazy offside this is one hundred percent 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:43.940
 aces website would be there offside on tuesday 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.940
 he has something to include but 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.619
 Ok, here's the match is over gone 1 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.200

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:09.250
 here of all hard fa ananda on 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.250
 runs out 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.270
 discover 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:23.050
 why aren't we three of us ca n't he 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.770
 select everything was clean and our ball 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:30.010
 cool played wise handsome little at all 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.950
 We bring away from sin to Ronaldo but in 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.680
 there is no ball at all to nowhere 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.240
 if i try to get us in there 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:42.600
 do badly trying and him box 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:47.260
 punches how do I know who 00 while we play 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.390
 first match is finished second match will be 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.830
 Katsa will play me at home a lot 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:08:04.590
 it's easier for me hope so hopefully 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:08:04.590
 for now, it's 0202 and 000 so 

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.690
 from this power you will only see a series 

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.640
