00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey guys I'm just showing off my war

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey guys I'm just showing off my war
there's<00:00:02.879> cantilever<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.600> railroad<00:00:03.990> crossing

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
there's cantilever a railroad crossing

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.260 
there's cantilever a railroad crossing
signals<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:04.950> purchased<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.609> bought<00:00:05.910> four<00:00:06.240> of

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
signals I purchased I bought four of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.450 
signals I purchased I bought four of
these<00:00:06.450> not<00:00:06.720> too<00:00:06.899> long<00:00:07.080> ago<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.429> just

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
these not too long ago and I just

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.110 
these not too long ago and I just
purchased<00:00:08.790> any<00:00:09.179> controller<00:00:10.759> the<00:00:11.759> borders

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
purchased any controller the borders

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.780 
purchased any controller the borders
crossing<00:00:12.540> controller<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.349> now<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:14.700> are

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
crossing controller for it now what are

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.150 
crossing controller for it now what are
the<00:00:14.849> main<00:00:15.059> complaints<00:00:15.660> about<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.500> that

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the main complaints about this is that

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.710 
the main complaints about this is that
it<00:00:17.310> only<00:00:17.520> operates<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.710> single<00:00:19.710> track<00:00:19.949> DC<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it only operates on single track DC so I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
it only operates on single track DC so I
like<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:22.769> bit<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.340> work<00:00:23.430> with

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
like a little bit I like to work with

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.769 
like a little bit I like to work with
wiring<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.090> stuff<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.600> alright

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
wiring and stuff so I'm like alright

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.630 
wiring and stuff so I'm like alright
let's<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.470> can't<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.830> anything<00:00:26.070> myself

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
let's see if I can't do anything myself

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.040 
let's see if I can't do anything myself
because<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> came<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> detection

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
because it came with the detection

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.500 
because it came with the detection
circuit<00:00:28.529> which<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.830> light<00:00:29.310> sensors<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
circuit which is light sensors in the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.229 
circuit which is light sensors in the
package<00:00:30.869> came<00:00:31.019> before<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
package came before of them and

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.690 
package came before of them and
according<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> directions<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:35.399> depends

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
according to the directions it depends

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
according to the directions it depends
on<00:00:35.760> polarity<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.899> one<00:00:37.079> gets<00:00:37.230> set<00:00:37.469> off<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
on polarity which one gets set off if it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.479 
on polarity which one gets set off if it
makes<00:00:37.920> any<00:00:38.100> sense

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
makes any sense

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.910 
makes any sense
let's<00:00:38.879> say<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> trains<00:00:39.420> traveling<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.860> here

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
let's say a trains traveling from here

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.229 
let's say a trains traveling from here
hit<00:00:41.370> sensor<00:00:41.760> D<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:43.170> C<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:45.030> are

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
hit sensor D and then C and a are

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.900 
hit sensor D and then C and a are
inactive<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.350> goes<00:00:46.469> across<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.010> then

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
inactive so it goes across that then

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
inactive so it goes across that then
when<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> last<00:00:48.420> car<00:00:48.780> passes<00:00:49.350> B<00:00:49.620> B<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.160> shut<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
when the last car passes B B was shut it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.720 
when the last car passes B B was shut it
off

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
off

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.930 
off
as<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.390> vice-versa<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.440> sensor<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> Chinese

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
as in vice-versa as sensor a a Chinese

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220 
as in vice-versa as sensor a a Chinese
coming<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.390> way<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> sensor<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> would

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
coming from this way a sensor a would

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.639 
coming from this way a sensor a would
turn<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:56.160> crossed<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.989> some<00:00:57.989> Circe<00:00:58.410> will

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
turn on go crossed and some Circe will

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.950 
turn on go crossed and some Circe will
shut<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.690> that's<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
shut it off so that's what the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450 
shut it off so that's what the
directions<00:01:01.379> which<00:01:01.500> comes<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:01.949> play<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> from

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
directions which comes into play it from

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
directions which comes into play it from
the<00:01:02.579> power<00:01:02.760> pack<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.379> including<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> war

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the power pack this is including the war

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.350 
the power pack this is including the war
there's<00:01:05.189> crossing<00:01:05.580> signal<00:01:05.820> controller

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
there's crossing signal controller

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.890 
there's crossing signal controller
I<00:01:06.479> bought<00:01:07.040> there's<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.210> full<00:01:09.210> diagram<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.869> all

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
I bought there's a full diagram for all

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.429 
I bought there's a full diagram for all
you<00:01:10.080> want<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.080> here's<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you want to see it and then here's the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.660 
you want to see it and then here's the
controller<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.010> how<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> hook<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
controller and how to hook it up and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
controller and how to hook it up and
everything<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> wire<00:01:15.630> color<00:01:16.020> code

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
everything and all the wire color code

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.070 
everything and all the wire color code
it's<00:01:16.439> really<00:01:16.710> easy<00:01:17.270> but<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> did<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it's really easy but what I did is I

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.429 
it's really easy but what I did is I
completely<00:01:20.659> didn't<00:01:21.659> even<00:01:21.750> use<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.200> sensors

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
completely didn't even use these sensors

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.170 
completely didn't even use these sensors
I<00:01:22.890> made<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> manual<00:01:25.310> right<00:01:26.310> now<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> power

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
I made a manual right now I have a power

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.370 
I made a manual right now I have a power
pack<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> MRC<00:01:31.040> tech<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:33.049> I'm<00:01:34.049> RC

clips hooked up to the terminals not the
neatest<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.189> temporary<00:01:47.700> setup

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
neatest this is just a temporary setup

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
neatest this is just a temporary setup
to<00:01:48.180> show<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> guys<00:01:48.540> how<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> works<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.200> think

to show you guys how it works I think
got<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.159> war<00:01:50.340> there's<00:01:50.490> crossing<00:01:50.790> signal

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
got my war there's crossing signal

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.980 
got my war there's crossing signal
controller<00:01:51.329> right<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:53.310> got<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> DC<00:01:54.750> track

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
controller right here I got the DC track

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
controller right here I got the DC track
voltage<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.799> through<00:01:56.000> these<00:01:57.000> ones

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
voltage going right through these ones

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
voltage going right through these ones
right<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.619> into<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> track

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
right here and going up into the track

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.289 
right here and going up into the track
and<00:01:59.540> I<00:02:00.540> got<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.960> color-coded<00:02:01.950> wires<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:03.090> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
and I got the color-coded wires going to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.270 
and I got the color-coded wires going to
the<00:02:03.420> crossing<00:02:04.170> signal<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.299> got<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:08.069> AC

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the crossing signal and I got the AC

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.199 
the crossing signal and I got the AC
power<00:02:08.700> which<00:02:09.690> goes<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> AC<00:02:10.289> terminals

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
power which goes to the AC terminals

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.910 
power which goes to the AC terminals
so<00:02:11.510> anyways<00:02:11.810> all<00:02:12.079> I<00:02:12.109> do<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.379> flip<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.769> on

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
so anyways all I do is flip the on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.050 
so anyways all I do is flip the on
switch<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.909> tech<00:02:14.750> for<00:02:15.430> nothing<00:02:16.430> happens<00:02:16.819> I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
switch on the tech for nothing happens I

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.429 
switch on the tech for nothing happens I
gotta<00:02:17.359> give<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.510> little<00:02:17.599> bit<00:02:17.780> track<00:02:18.019> power<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
gotta give a little bit track power to

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.679 
gotta give a little bit track power to
simulate<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.890> train<00:02:19.099> coming<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:20.150> crank<00:02:20.599> it

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
simulate the train coming and crank it

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.580 
simulate the train coming and crank it
up<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.840> little<00:02:20.900> bit<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.760> signals<00:02:22.760> activate<00:02:23.590> get

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
up a little bit in signals activate get

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.110 
up a little bit in signals activate get
down<00:02:24.739> for<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.950> closer<00:02:25.189> look<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:28.670> isn't<00:02:28.969> really

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
down for a closer look this isn't really

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.270 
down for a closer look this isn't really
set<00:02:29.480> up<00:02:29.599> on<00:02:29.719> my<00:02:29.750> layout<00:02:30.019> just<00:02:30.769> like<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.159> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
set up on my layout just like this is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.149 
set up on my layout just like this is
just<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.609> temporary<00:02:31.909> set<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.359> show<00:02:33.040> what<00:02:34.040> they

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
just a temporary set to show what they

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.610 
just a temporary set to show what they
look<00:02:34.280> like<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:35.659> flash<00:02:35.870> pattern<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.379> really

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
look like the flash pattern is really

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.179 
look like the flash pattern is really
nice<00:02:37.150> these<00:02:38.469> crossing<00:02:39.469> signal<00:02:39.799> controllers

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
nice these crossing signal controllers

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.490 
nice these crossing signal controllers
can<00:02:40.370> control<00:02:40.730> up<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:41.650> four<00:02:43.030> crossing<00:02:44.030> signals

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
can control up to four crossing signals

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.569 
can control up to four crossing signals
they<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.590> enough<00:02:45.739> power<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:45.980> do<00:02:46.159> that<00:02:46.310> I

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
they have enough power to do that I

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.000 
they have enough power to do that I
picked<00:02:47.180> mine<00:02:47.359> up<00:02:47.389> for<00:02:47.750> less<00:02:48.439> than<00:02:48.590> thirty<00:02:48.829> nine

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
picked mine up for less than thirty nine

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.580 
picked mine up for less than thirty nine
dollars<00:02:49.189> I<00:02:49.579> twenty<00:02:50.120> percent<00:02:50.480> off<00:02:50.569> is<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.409> my

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
dollars I twenty percent off is that my

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.259 
dollars I twenty percent off is that my
hobby<00:02:51.769> shop<00:02:52.010> for<00:02:52.189> quite<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> while<00:02:52.639> so<00:02:52.970> they

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
hobby shop for quite a while so they

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.119 
hobby shop for quite a while so they
give<00:02:53.599> me<00:02:53.720> discount<00:02:54.109> on<00:02:54.169> it<00:02:54.200> cuz<00:02:54.590> they're<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
give me discount on it cuz they're so

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.610 
give me discount on it cuz they're so
long<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:56.450> yeah<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> really<00:02:56.900> got<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.290> got<00:02:57.469> these

long but yeah I really got I got these

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.250 
long but yeah I really got I got these
running<00:02:57.980> I'll<00:02:58.099> probably<00:02:58.400> keep<00:02:58.639> them<00:02:58.849> for

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
running I'll probably keep them for

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.800 
running I'll probably keep them for
manual<00:03:00.260> operation<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:02.209> bugs<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.599> lot<00:03:02.750> of

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
manual operation that bugs a lot of

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.030 
manual operation that bugs a lot of
people<00:03:03.079> a<00:03:03.109> lot<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.260> people<00:03:03.349> like<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.829> trains

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
people a lot of people like the trains

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.009 
people a lot of people like the trains
to<00:03:04.219> set<00:03:04.340> them<00:03:04.489> off<00:03:04.579> but<00:03:05.239> honest<00:03:05.599> it<00:03:05.780> doesn't

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
to set them off but honest it doesn't

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.440 
to set them off but honest it doesn't
really<00:03:06.290> bother<00:03:06.439> me<00:03:06.650> much<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.609> kind<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.299> neat

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
really bother me much it's kind of neat

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.050 
really bother me much it's kind of neat
to<00:03:08.480> mine<00:03:09.139> it<00:03:09.260> off<00:03:09.379> yourself

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
to mine it off yourself

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.539 
to mine it off yourself
flip<00:03:11.060> them<00:03:11.209> off<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.680> let<00:03:13.099> they<00:03:13.189> activate

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
flip them off and let they activate

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.460 
flip them off and let they activate
again<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:17.120> let's<00:03:17.479> just<00:03:17.629> go<00:03:17.810> show<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:18.139> do<00:03:18.440> not

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
again but let's just go show you do not

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.479 
again but let's just go show you do not
need<00:03:18.919> to<00:03:19.310> use<00:03:19.699> the<00:03:20.329> supplied<00:03:21.109> light<00:03:21.919> sensors

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
need to use the supplied light sensors

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.280 
need to use the supplied light sensors
basically<00:03:23.329> how<00:03:23.419> those<00:03:23.629> work<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:24.019> in<00:03:24.139> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
basically how those work is in the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.349 
basically how those work is in the
diagram<00:03:24.769> like<00:03:25.069> I<00:03:25.190> said<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.849> shadow<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.239> the

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
diagram like I said is the shadow of the

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.240 
diagram like I said is the shadow of the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
passing train car passes over to show

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.909 
passing train car passes over to show
there's<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> train<00:03:28.729> coming<00:03:29.199> but<00:03:30.199> if<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.769> don't

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
there's a train coming but if you don't

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:31.390 
there's a train coming but if you don't
mind

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400
