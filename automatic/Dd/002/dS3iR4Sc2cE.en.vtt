00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hi everyone, I just got a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.899
 park by one in milan with 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.639
 inside the news that have come out and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 so I decided to make a video for 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.290
 I will also show you how much 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.929
 the enamels part has many things already 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.330
 I had it and so I will keep many things 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.330
 aside to give them to you in other words 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.859
 small gifts that I make in social media e 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.539
 so if not followed you in yet 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.849
 social in sta dear facebook and twitter 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.240
 refer to the information box found i 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.070
 link 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.679
 let's start with the lasting color line 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.930
 new gel colors have come out 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.270
 and there are a couple that make me 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.940
 literally going crazy 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.829
 then I tell you that in the meantime the new ones 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.079
 colors that came out obviously 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.070
 are purely colors at 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.450
 miur apart from some are already summer I see 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 that the camera was lifting me up 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.390
 colors I bless sailor by distorting 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.449
 ugly 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 then three shades on magenta pink 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.340
 Rose going to become a fuchsia 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.030
 magenta and there are 128 127 that make me 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.189
 literally going crazy are wonderful 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 then three tones came out instead 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.439
 on orange the clearest if I have 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.470
 light and dark and even these are here 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 really very very very nice and then 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.060
 on two pearly colors a pearly white 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.100
 and a rosin by side I know you are 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 seeing everything extremely bright but 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.939
 if you try to change something 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 I have basically tried before me 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.079
 it all becomes very very very much 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 dark and those for now I decide to 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.500
 leave so maybe I insert you some 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.400
 images that are a little more truthful 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.400
 regarding the colors 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.270
 however the singular effect already from 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.070
 part of pearls that therefore not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.759
 ends differently than the classics that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.710
 they are however lacquered etc. always 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.420
 are things have been effect of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.890
 long life dry quickly in the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 larger panel that allows 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.500
 an even easier application 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.790
 some colors are already covering the first one 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.140
 passed some 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.670
 however, for the second pass 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.280
 very quickly established to me like this 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.990
 how tall they really are 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.170
 so many this year all lowered 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.540
 practically 3d applications instead 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.340
 to go out with the kits came out with 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.590
 enamels with special effects 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.680
 the first of which I speak to you are correct 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.250
 awsat in satragno news should be 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.250
 in any case of satiny news for the note 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.150
 there are six colors of course all 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.940
 neutral are enamels with a finish 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.220
 satin therefore practically opaque 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.490
 they can be used alone or above 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.290
 the enamels and we say are the trends of the 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.560
 moment in the sense that this year too 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.530
 news are reconfirmed as a trend but 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.320
 no longer covering then not these naked 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.030
 own foundation effect the news that 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.460
 however, they do show a little bit 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.600
 to the bezel but that they go to perfect 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.510
 a little to the surface of the nail 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.210
 so that even by themselves they go to 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.120
 to recreate a very refined manicure 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.470
 elegant of these here nice dry 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.850
 this too very quickly and 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.540
 obviously they do not require the application 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.280
 of the trot above always if shade for 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.500
 regarding the denim jeans line 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.890
 they are mainly tv jeans colors 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.520
 precisely it is always light gray jeans 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.520
 the darkest gray 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.790
 these give a typical effect of jeans and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.530
 so a bit rough know opaque but not 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.409
 they are to be compared there they are kind 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.870
 sugar effect is a middle area 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.420
 in short, they are not really so porous 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.239
 he is always so rough that they give 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.239
 the diligence- like effect, however, is not 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.739
 extremely rough here is precisely they are 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.140
 these parks also dry here 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.310
 quickly and I have to say I owe you 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.690
 to say that we like these here 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.980
 lot 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.430
 among all those who have left 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.590
 these are another line that you are now 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.329
 monster are the ones I like about 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.640
 more than ever 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.100
 these are the diamond ast and are i 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.380
 my favorites together are the denim 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.510
 jeans but I also prefer denim jeans 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.729
 and so are my two favorites but 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.720
 these here the gas die are in 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:31.289
 absolute for me the top are enamels 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.660
 extremely bright with passes 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.160
 they become opaque and I like them 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.810
 very much because you can play a 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.630
 sack with these glazes and lately 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.979
 staring at me with the glitters that shine 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.280
 of its own light 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.060
 contain more glitter inside 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.979
 great glitter in the little ones e 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.070
 I am also seeing that there are of various 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.849
 colors for no charity, however, remains 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:00.169
 silvered however of all the i 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.760
 bigger letters are really 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.120
 they have multi-colored facets 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.250
 so they pull colors out of the light 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.000
 wonderful and I love them so much 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.889
 I really love these here as I have 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.169
 having said yes here it has already been using them for quite a while 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.880
 I really don't like them very much 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.889
 these here already since the first time 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.620
 jobs tv or maxi million for type say the 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.979
 truth latest news for this season 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.610
 they are always colorful in more masons 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.610
 tone 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.350
 these are precisely the most in May in 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.360
 meaning they contain microparticles 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.160
 type of micro plus puts instead of 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.500
 go and put the first over are already 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.510
 contained within the enamel are 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.370
 cute because they are stratifies it is bili 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.060
 these here are very useful in nail 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.740
 Article 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.600
 obviously even from a gas I am very 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.580
 useful in art because they allow 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.110
 go the light spots with these here yes 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.180
 can play a lot because nothing these 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.330
 straws let you work 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.430
 so much the imagination can be 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.320
 take advantage of so many many opportunities 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.300
 or even simply by yourself too 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.330
 these layering get not here 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.220
 I say a total coverage but in short yes 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.560
 manages to cover most of the nail 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.180
 here also with all this I hope 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.060
 that these videos will please you 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.750
 meanwhile in a huge kiss and gives in to 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.750
 next hello
