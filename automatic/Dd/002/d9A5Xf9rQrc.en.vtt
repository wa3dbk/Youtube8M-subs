00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.750
 in the world of the anses guide and 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.270
 welcome to the second channel and 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.940
 Welcome to the second chapter of the 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.730
 guide on the released ps3 and we are in 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.619
 the tutorial of how to install the ps3 ita 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.870
 manager and the multi man 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.150
 first of all I will explain a little 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.640
 what are they for and in others 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.920
 I'll show you how to use it 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.530
 first and explain how to install the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.360
 first program in our ps3 released 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.270
 Well, as I 'm telling you , we're going to 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.250
 start with the ps3 and is manager worth 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.680
 this same and good you will have in the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.450
 description the links of the programs and 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.579
 If you see that someone falls, 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.150
 you say and in the re again but you 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.070
 same 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.050
 you try to search the internet for 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.460
 not have to wait long and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.520
 Well, what we have to do is 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.380
 put a usb that occupies less than 32 gigs 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.140
 on your computer and will form the 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.059
 fahl 32 if you have a hard drive like me 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.800
 Well, I'll show you how to format the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.320
 alpha 32 is worth it because we have to notice that we have 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.450
 than having it on fat32 because if not the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.979
 console will not detect the things that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.960
 metamos is very important that you do 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.310
 this and well then when we already have a 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.970
 hard drive or a 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.700
 usb in fat32 we enter and in the first 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.520
 folder or at the root of the usb 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.950
 well here we will put the multi man and the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
 ita manager well now basically 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.030
 it would be these to not have to do anything else 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.820
 and well finally I will not install 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.200
 again because possibly I was 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.450
 change some things that I have already 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.070
 modified is valid and I do not want it to be 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.409
 modify so the only thing that is going to 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.720
 do is uninstall ita manager and what 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.460
 reinstall with this new for 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.470
 so you can see more or less how it would be done 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 and basically with the multi bad it would be 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.429
 the same and good then what we will have 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.369
 what to do very important is to have a 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.140
 released ps3 console released 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.490
 released do not tell me this new 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.039
 it works because it has to be released 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.369
 obviously lower and good what we have 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:04.490
 what to do is install the multi man and the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.020
 ps3 and it is manager there are different 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.819
 programs but in my case I install 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.349
 these two that give me very good and good I 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.720
 I'm going to erase it so you can see what 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.730
 I'm going to reinstall and it's the same and 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.830
 one later with the last one I'm not going to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.329
 erase because it's basically the same and 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.260
 just in case I do not want to erase things 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.160
 because to see if they are going to erase me 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.010
 games that I already have and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.340
 then like this then we go to the folder 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.640
 install pkg files and then we search 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.400
 here the weighings that we have put in 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.410
 this case because the ita manager and what 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.020
 what we do is give a click to 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.180
 can install it and when we have it 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.250
 installed let's go here and we'll find it 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.370
 and well what we will do is start 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.200
 the game so to speak and we'll see that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.240
 For the first time we will get this screen 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.470
 here you do not have to touch absolutely anything 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.010
 neither up or down by itself 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.200
 maybe we just give the X and 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.990
 we will see a window worth this one 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.870
 we give it ok and it will tell us this 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.660
 we give that also and it will be all 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.820
 configured now I'm just going to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.000
 tell you some things that you have to put 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.880
 we give the button start vale and we will see here 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.710
 in network tools so here 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.200
 we will have the console and that is for 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.420
 change it and in and of itself do not plan and I 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.190
 it covered below so you can see that it appears 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.360
 down there and everything else already 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.209
 I will explain the only thing we are going to do 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.790
 now it's starting the ftp server because 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.640
 I will teach you later to put 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.590
 things by ftp and for now what 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.810
 we will do that is what we give to start and 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.329
 we say yes and you can see that it is already 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.829
 active that is so to say the ip that 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.930
 we will have to put in the computer 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.540
 when I'll explain later 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.090
 for now we will do this and the rest of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.459
 change the idea or what to restore the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.099
 original idea of the console all that already 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.230
 I will explain it later because 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.849
 I want to forget it a lot in the same video 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.129
 and for now what we will do is give it 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.870
 ps button and we'll come out of the game like this is 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.359
 how do you get out of this kind of programs 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.349
 and it is very important that the session be 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.120
 closed or inside the psn be 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.129
 closed we do not have to log in 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.019
 because if we can not bathe the idea in 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.609
 a moment but I'll explain it more 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.700
 forward because at the moment we do not have 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.070
 so to speak internet one intermediate 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.660
 we have no idea and later on 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.639
 I will explain how to change it as 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.620
 get and everything is worth 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.080
 and well this would be the multi man like 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.960
 we see there and this I will also explain in 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.610
 the next video I will show you what 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.740
 basic I will not explain anything to you 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.860
 I'm just going to tell you the things that 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.960
 have and the things that we will use a lot 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.210
 basic because I'm not going to say everything here 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.180
 everything that I can not touch nor the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.490
 but I will tell you the most important 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.370
 what I use the most so that so 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.770
 It serves you something and to get out of this 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.810
 kind of program game like what 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.419
 you want to call because I already tell you that it is 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.490
 giving the ps button keeping it and you 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.409
 you give out of the game that with all this 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.300
 kind of programs and well then in the 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.719
 next chapter I'm going to show you how 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.449
 unseat us in a ps3 released with the 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:09.610
 ps3 and is manager and good because this has 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.279
 been everything if you liked the video 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.419
 it would help a lot by giving it a like 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.460
