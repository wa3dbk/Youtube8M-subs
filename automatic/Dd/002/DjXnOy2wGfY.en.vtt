do<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.219> good<00:01:02.670> time<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.920> for<00:01:04.920> example<00:01:04.979> with

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
do a good time out with for example with

do a good time out with for example with
butter<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.270> oil<00:01:07.100> well<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.240> close<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
butter or oil well you can get close to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.450
