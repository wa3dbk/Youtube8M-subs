little bit and wasn't so heavy once it
started<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.399> bit<00:01:44.670> warmer<00:01:45.030> out

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
started to get a little bit warmer out

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.230 
started to get a little bit warmer out
so<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.810> foundation<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> actually<00:01:47.759> invisible

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
so this foundation is actually invisible

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.710 
so this foundation is actually invisible
cover<00:01:48.780> whereas<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.369> chanel<00:01:50.909> mat<00:01:51.149> lumiere<00:01:51.479> was

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
cover whereas the chanel mat lumiere was

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.469

a<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.049> full<00:01:52.530> coverage<00:01:53.009> foundation<00:01:53.479> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
a very full coverage foundation so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.840 
a very full coverage foundation so
immediately<00:01:54.750> when<00:01:55.259> i<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.310> hand<00:01:56.340> i

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
squirt a little bit on my hand and then
i<00:01:58.799> use<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> foundation<00:01:59.280> brush<00:01:59.729> all<00:02:00.149> over<00:02:00.390> my

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
face to distribute it it was a little

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.789 
face to distribute it it was a little
bit<00:02:03.000> liquidy<00:02:03.719> which<00:02:04.140> doesn't<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.560> bother

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
bit liquidy which doesn't really bother

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.760 
bit liquidy which doesn't really bother
me<00:02:05.009> i<00:02:05.189> mean<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.479> consistency<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.259> not<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> huge

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
me i mean the consistency is not a huge

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
me i mean the consistency is not a huge
issue<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.610> i<00:02:08.670> noticed<00:02:09.090> that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
issue but i noticed that

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
issue but i noticed that
right<00:02:09.509> away<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:10.080> thought<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.950> coverage<00:02:11.280> was

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
right away I thought that coverage was

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.040 
right away I thought that coverage was
good<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.810> wasn't<00:02:13.849> perfect<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.390> my<00:02:15.720> skin

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
good but it wasn't perfect it my skin

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.630 
good but it wasn't perfect it my skin
didn't<00:02:16.260> look<00:02:16.349> super<00:02:16.920> flawless<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.520> could

my<00:04:43.629> review<00:04:43.990> overall<00:04:44.949> I<00:04:44.979> would<00:04:45.280> give<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:46.030> be

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
my review overall I would give this a be

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.170 
my review overall I would give this a be
as<00:04:47.080> far<00:04:47.650> as<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.860> great<00:04:48.159> i<00:04:48.189> think<00:04:48.430> it's<00:04:48.729> great<00:04:49.030> i

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
as far as a great i think it's great i

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.689 
as far as a great i think it's great i
think<00:04:49.629> it's<00:04:49.840> very<00:04:50.259> easy<00:04:51.009> to<00:04:51.189> wear<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.460> very

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
think it's very easy to wear a very

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.029 
think it's very easy to wear a very
natural<00:04:51.969> looking<00:04:52.599> my<00:04:52.990> only<00:04:53.169> concern<00:04:53.650> with

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
natural looking my only concern with

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.790 
natural looking my only concern with
this<00:04:54.189> is<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.789> doesn't<00:04:55.300> cover<00:04:55.629> enough<00:04:56.409> so

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
this is that it doesn't cover enough so

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.040 
this is that it doesn't cover enough so
if<00:04:57.009> i<00:04:57.099> was<00:04:57.189> going<00:04:57.400> out<00:04:57.580> dancing<00:04:57.759> i<00:04:58.300> would<00:04:58.719> stick

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
if i was going out dancing i would stick

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.399 
if i was going out dancing i would stick
to<00:04:59.169> my<00:04:59.289> old<00:04:59.580> super<00:05:00.580> heavy<00:05:00.759> foundation<00:05:01.629> if<00:05:02.020> i

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
to my old super heavy foundation if i

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.959 
to my old super heavy foundation if i
was<00:05:02.590> going<00:05:02.800> out<00:05:03.009> to<00:05:03.129> dinner<00:05:03.250> going<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:03.789> date

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
was going out to dinner going on a date

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.519 
was going out to dinner going on a date
anything<00:05:04.330> like<00:05:04.479> that<00:05:04.509> like<00:05:04.900> i<00:05:05.020> said<00:05:05.259> i<00:05:05.289> would

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:05.529 
anything like that like i said i would

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.010 
anything like that like i said i would
definitely<00:05:06.310> do<00:05:06.909> this<00:05:07.090> another<00:05:07.569> selling<00:05:07.990> point

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
definitely do this another selling point

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.779 
definitely do this another selling point
to<00:05:08.229> this<00:05:08.349> foundation<00:05:08.830> is<00:05:08.979> that<00:05:09.219> in<00:05:09.340> photos

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
to this foundation is that in photos

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.209 
to this foundation is that in photos

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
this does not reflect white it doesn't

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.040 
this does not reflect white it doesn't
reflect<00:05:12.430> ghostly<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.300> have<00:05:13.509> taken<00:05:13.719> photos
