00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.940
 Well, just everyone, I hope that 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.890
 be pretty good and if for some 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.019
 strange reason of the universe of destiny 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.030
 You came this video on YouTube 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:14.139
 thank you because today I bring you the video 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.449
 gameplay the soccer physics game that 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.050
 in truth it is very funny and very 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.360
 simple to play is really from 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.730
 stressful and stressful at the same time and 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.770
 you will see why 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.590
 and that is very simple they just have to 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.320
 click here with the same key that is 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.579
 with what I played was with the key of the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.579
 keyboard go 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.010
 it's very simple as you can see they have 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.640
 what to score 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.750
 in goal 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.470
 of the red team that is not the goal 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 of the red team is my goal the team 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.050
 and it's a really fun game 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.710
 you need a lot of control and with a 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:07.600
 central or I almost get out so that 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.430
 it's not silly and do not get yourself 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.549
 and to be able to control pretty high pretty 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:19.440
 and tell him now go forward or 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.440
 888 goalie and if that gave you 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.130
 in my neighborhood a lot of the subject 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.630
 by tomÃ¡s 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.799
 I kicked his skull 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.799
 over here with wood 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.940
 and that was very simple really but 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:48.360
 I wanted to bring them and I found it thanks to 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.360
 Filipinos and if they know youtube 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.380
 who makes videos in English or 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.630
 and I said 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.350
 many many keep in English because 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.409
 they are something small or if you do not understand I do not know 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.630
 I at 12 when I was little you do not see 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.220
 English in fact I still do not know very well 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.470
 but I understand a lot of things that 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.690
 they say and I said then you can have it in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.160
 Spanish because it's not so fun that 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.860
 nobody can stay without taking this 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.400
 damn game I've been playing with him 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.060
 like three days and I can not stop now not 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.060
 I can stop 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.200
 I'm talking to myself while I pulse a 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.200
 damn key just one 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.239
 emotion and good goal that had put a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:40.030
 goal like that and I get excited with every shot with 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.189
 every shit like it 's funny 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.739
 I no longer have a head, nobody has a head 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.019
 besides that the goals grow 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.269
 they are tiny the climate changes when it falls 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.359
 snow the players move 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.840
 intensely where they want 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:59.409
 machines and where do you want to go up 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.669
 take that sound shot like that or a 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.669
 subway with my goalkeeper 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.500
 do not 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.850
 what 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.850
 I'm losing intensely 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.430
 sorry if I cut too short what I say 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.780
 but if you live is a clear example it is so 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.790
 funny 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.770
 If I have to prove it, I'm going to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.560
 leave a description the link of the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.450
 website page where in 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.550
 conjugate because it is a portable game not 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.870
 they have to download it or nothing in fact 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.870
 if they have a device 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.519
 a device you can 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.819
 You can download the application and play it 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.540
 on your phone 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.269
 and better if I had an iphone 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.560
 an older device initially 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.560
 I bought it for two dollars 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:14.730
 it's really worth it in the chapter of 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.460
 allianz that will surely go up 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.040
 today Thursday and this I'm recording 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:24.270
 Like the morning Juarez equal 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.780
 will be there because 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.000
 expressly if virtual they have warned of 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.740
 this until the truth is the 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.900
 I recommend and then nothing with nothing more than 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.379
 say here I say goodbye with this goal 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.930
 dedicated pss is not is not 9 dedicated but 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:41.930
 with this delicate goal for you 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.720
 that is my player ok 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.270
 so I do not care 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.070
 as yes but 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.560
 It is very difficult to be with the girl 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.590
 now I say goodbye I hope as you check 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.980
 if they liked it they obviously like it for 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.260
 that's the point and comment that they 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.290
 it seemed to me it seemed like a game 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.840
 too much fun very creative 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.210
 done and share it with people nobody 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.590
 you can stay without playing this blessed 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.940
 game 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.180
 seriously now I say goodbye to people and 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.180
 bye Bye
