 [Music] 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.570

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.570
 is going to release that in the video 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.340
 I have copied it because you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.260
 they just give you a click 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.940
 and we wait for him to load as you see here 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.770
 the game is uploaded to mega but first 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.630
 let's see this page where we will have 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.630
 to wait for every 15 seconds 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.699
 they finish one hundred second we are going to have this 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 button that says jump advertising you 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.600
 we will give a click 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.700
 and will load the media page as 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 they are watching 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.569
 we wait for 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.569
 [Music] 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.250

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.659
 the game as you will see are six parts 5 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.670

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.710
 he canceled because obviously they write down 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.800
 so he ordered the same thing with each 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.750
