00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
quality I also scored one dog could have

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
quality I also scored one dog could have
to<00:00:28.410> feel<00:00:28.680> us<00:00:29.029> skip<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> foot<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.390> great

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to feel us skip at the foot of great

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.669 
to feel us skip at the foot of great
chance<00:00:30.869> he's<00:00:31.080> got<00:00:31.199> himself<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.590> great

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
chance he's got himself in great

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.830 
chance he's got himself in great
positions<00:00:32.160> which<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.850> great<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.059> us<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.750> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
positions which is great for us and I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.090 
positions which is great for us and I
think<00:00:33.870> we've<00:00:34.170> removed<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> ball<00:00:34.890> more

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
think we've removed the ball more

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
think we've removed the ball more
fluently<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.059> certainly<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> last

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
fluently and then certainly the last

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.479 
fluently and then certainly the last
hour<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> game<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.100> opposed<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
hour of the game as opposed to the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.549 
hour of the game as opposed to the
austerity<00:00:39.030> box<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.450> don't<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.350> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
austerity box I don't think they do that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.319 
austerity box I don't think they do that
as<00:00:41.129> much<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> results<00:00:42.000> an

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
as much as you know the results an

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.819 
as much as you know the results an
all-important<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.140> always<00:00:43.350> nice<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> win

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
all-important it's always nice to win

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
all-important it's always nice to win
and<00:00:44.190> probably<00:00:44.460> merited<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> victory

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
