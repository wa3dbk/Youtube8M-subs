00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
you do downshift into Stewart you notice

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.860 
you do downshift into Stewart you notice
the<00:04:07.860> revs<00:04:08.070> go<00:04:08.370> up<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.670> little<00:04:08.820> bit<00:04:09.090> too<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
the revs go up a little bit too so the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.150 
the revs go up a little bit too so the
thing<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.110> going<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> give<00:04:10.740> you<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.950> maximum

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
thing is going to give you the maximum

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.050 
thing is going to give you the maximum
go<00:04:11.670> power<00:04:12.000> for<00:04:13.010> for<00:04:14.010> performance<00:04:14.550> driving<00:04:14.820> if

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
go power for for performance driving if

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.210 
go power for for performance driving if
that's<00:04:15.240> what<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.510> want<00:04:15.750> alternatively<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
that's what you want alternatively the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.229 
that's what you want alternatively the
vehicle<00:04:17.580> will<00:04:17.790> let<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.710> save<00:04:19.710> in<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.970> course

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
vehicle will let you save in of course

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.610 
vehicle will let you save in of course
and<00:04:21.450> that's<00:04:21.510> what<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.870> actually<00:04:22.410> about

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and that's what this is actually about

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.270
