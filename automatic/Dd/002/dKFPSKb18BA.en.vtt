my hair and building my regimen and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.280 
my hair and building my regimen and
finding<00:00:16.400> what<00:00:16.670> my<00:00:16.940> hair<00:00:17.300> needs<00:00:17.900> at<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.260> moment

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:21.440 
now when I was relaxed my regimen

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.830 
now when I was relaxed my regimen
changed<00:00:22.130> quite<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.400> bit<00:00:22.550> depending<00:00:23.119> on<00:00:23.480> what<00:00:23.660> my

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840

really<00:01:00.050> not<00:01:00.320> sure<00:01:00.380> because<00:01:01.010> I'm<00:01:01.370> totally

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
really not sure because I'm totally

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
confused and up here I know for a fact

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.639 
confused and up here I know for a fact
that<00:01:04.399> I<00:01:04.550> am<00:01:04.729> definitely<00:01:05.239> not<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.600> 3c<00:01:06.259> because

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
that I am definitely not a 3c because

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.859 
that I am definitely not a 3c because
the<00:01:06.800> texture<00:01:07.190> is<00:01:07.490> loose<00:01:07.820> just<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:08.570> small

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
the texture is loose just in this small

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.779 
the texture is loose just in this small
area<00:01:09.080> right<00:01:09.619> here<00:01:09.649> so<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:10.009> small<00:01:10.340> area<00:01:10.759> here

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
area right here so a small area here

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.660 
area right here so a small area here
small<00:01:11.780> area<00:01:12.200> here<00:01:12.229> two<00:01:12.800> different<00:01:13.220> textures

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
small area here two different textures

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.200 
small area here two different textures
and<00:01:13.880> then<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.390> rest<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.690> 3c<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.820> it's<00:01:16.820> over

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
and then the rest is 3c so it's over

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.539 
and then the rest is 3c so it's over
hair<00:01:17.390> typing<00:01:17.659> but<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.049> know<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.920> helps<00:01:19.340> other

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
hair typing but I know it helps other

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.730 
hair typing but I know it helps other
people<00:01:19.909> when<00:01:20.119> they<00:01:20.299> are<00:01:20.510> trying<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.470> find

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
people when they are trying to find

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.740 
people when they are trying to find
regimens<00:01:22.250> or<00:01:22.430> find<00:01:22.670> tutorials<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.720> are

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
prosody and it's super super easy now me

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.240 
prosody and it's super super easy now me
finding<00:03:52.370> out<00:03:52.520> that<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.970> am<00:03:53.270> low<00:03:53.450> porosity<00:03:53.720> is

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
finding out that I am low porosity is

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.320 
finding out that I am low porosity is
makes<00:03:55.250> sense<00:03:55.490> because<00:03:55.640> that's<00:03:55.910> why<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.120> takes

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
makes sense because that's why it takes

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.210 
makes sense because that's why it takes
forever<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.750> my<00:03:56.870> hair<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.290> dry<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.980> stuff

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
forever for my hair to dry and stuff

forever for my hair to dry and stuff

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
like that so basically I know now that

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.970 
like that so basically I know now that
when<00:04:02.240> I<00:04:02.270> build<00:04:02.540> my<00:04:02.690> regimen<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.320> need<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.800> deep
