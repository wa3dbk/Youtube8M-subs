00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
what's up guys this is I tweaks here and

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.169 
what's up guys this is I tweaks here and
today<00:00:02.310> I'm<00:00:02.460> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> be<00:00:02.669> doing<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.970> best

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
today I'm going to be doing the best

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.180 
today I'm going to be doing the best
tweaks<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.720> week<00:00:03.899> now<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.680> past<00:00:04.950> week

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
tweaks of the week now this past week

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.680 
tweaks of the week now this past week
there<00:00:05.400> weren't<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.730> whole<00:00:05.759> lot<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.210> tweaks<00:00:06.569> that

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
there weren't a whole lot of tweaks that

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.750 
there weren't a whole lot of tweaks that
were<00:00:06.839> released<00:00:07.259> since<00:00:07.770> my<00:00:07.919> last<00:00:08.130> video<00:00:08.429> so

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
were released since my last video so

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.190 
were released since my last video so
this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> be<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.269> pretty<00:00:09.420> short<00:00:09.780> video

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
this is going to be a pretty short video

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.350 
this is going to be a pretty short video
but<00:00:10.620> what<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> went<00:00:11.070> ahead<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.309> did<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:12.000> grab<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
but what I went ahead and did was grab a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.480 
but what I went ahead and did was grab a
tweak<00:00:12.840> that's<00:00:13.049> up-and-coming<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:14.190> hasn't

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
tweak that's up-and-coming that hasn't

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.919 
tweak that's up-and-coming that hasn't
been<00:00:14.580> released<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:15.089> yet<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.360> make<00:00:15.690> sure<00:00:15.719> you

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
been released just yet so make sure you

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.990 
been released just yet so make sure you
stick<00:00:16.170> around<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> preview<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.789> let's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
stick around for that preview so let's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.130 
stick around for that preview so let's
go<00:00:18.090> ahead<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.390> started<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> first

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
go ahead and get started so the first

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.420 
go ahead and get started so the first
week<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.470> want<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.650> show<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.800> guys<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.010> called

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
week we want to show you guys is called

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.370 
week we want to show you guys is called
equal<00:00:20.820> arm<00:00:21.029> now<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.810> tweak<00:00:22.050> does<00:00:22.230> is

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
equal arm now what this tweak does is

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
equal arm now what this tweak does is
basically<00:00:22.560> give<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.100> an<00:00:23.250> equation<00:00:23.609> when<00:00:24.210> your

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
basically give you an equation when your

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.179 
basically give you an equation when your
alarm<00:00:24.539> goes<00:00:24.689> off<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.590> solve<00:00:25.859> in

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
alarm goes off that you have to solve in

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
alarm goes off that you have to solve in
order<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.670> dismiss<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.300> alarm<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> can't

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
order to dismiss that alarm so you can't

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.839 
order to dismiss that alarm so you can't
just<00:00:28.500> hit<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> snooze<00:00:29.160> button<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.640> then<00:00:29.730> go

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
just hit that snooze button and then go

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
just hit that snooze button and then go
back<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> sleep<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> actually<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> solve

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
back to sleep you actually have to solve

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.350 
back to sleep you actually have to solve
an<00:00:31.920> equation<00:00:31.980> before<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.910> tap<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
an equation before you can tap the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.690 
an equation before you can tap the
snooze<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.309> we

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
snooze so you can see right here if we

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
snooze so you can see right here if we
open<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.059> our<00:00:36.180> settings<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> equal

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
open up our settings this is the equal

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.450 
open up our settings this is the equal
arm<00:00:37.440> settings<00:00:37.829> make<00:00:38.010> sure<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
arm settings make sure that it is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.130 
arm settings make sure that it is
enabled<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.480> four<00:00:39.719> levels<00:00:40.020> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
enabled and you have four levels of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.990 
enabled and you have four levels of
difficulty<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.190> tap<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.550> difficulty

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
difficulty so if we tap on difficulty

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.490 
difficulty so if we tap on difficulty
you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.629> easy<00:00:42.930> medium<00:00:43.469> hard

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you can see you have easy medium hard

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160 
you can see you have easy medium hard
and<00:00:43.980> insane<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.610> course<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> insane<00:00:45.960> or

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and insane of course hard and insane or

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
and insane of course hard and insane or
a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.500> bit<00:00:46.620> harder<00:00:46.980> than<00:00:47.520> easy<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.149> medium

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
a little bit harder than easy and medium

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
a little bit harder than easy and medium
so<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.100> go

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so you can see right here if we just go

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.880 
so you can see right here if we just go
over<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.539> tap<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.899> test<00:00:52.170> alarm<00:00:52.500> for

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
over here and we tap on test alarm for

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.080 
over here and we tap on test alarm for
easy<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.879> an<00:00:53.969> easy

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
easy then it's going to be an easy

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.060 
easy then it's going to be an easy
equation<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.870> that's<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.140> 14<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:55.890> tap

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
equation so that's just 14 will tap

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
equation so that's just 14 will tap
check<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.610> dismiss<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.260> back<00:00:58.530> here

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
check and dismiss now if we go back here

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
check and dismiss now if we go back here
I'm<00:00:59.370> sorry<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.820> go<00:00:59.940> back<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.120> difficulty<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I'm sorry we go back to difficulty and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.689 
I'm sorry we go back to difficulty and
tap<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.379> medium<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.070> gonna<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> little<00:01:02.489> bit

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
tap on medium it's gonna be a little bit

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
tap on medium it's gonna be a little bit
harder<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.210> too<00:01:03.600> difficult<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> can

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
harder but not too difficult so you can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.649 
harder but not too difficult so you can
see<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.549> 50<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.510> we'll

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
see right here this is just 50 so we'll

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.990 
see right here this is just 50 so we'll
tap<00:01:06.840> check<00:01:07.140> dismiss<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> get

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
tap check dismiss and it's going to get

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.130 
tap check dismiss and it's going to get
a<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.180> bit<00:01:09.360> more<00:01:09.479> difficult<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:10.020> going

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
a little bit more difficult you're going

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.780 
a little bit more difficult you're going
to<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.290> some<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:10.530> parentheses<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.700> you're

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to get some more parentheses that you're

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.920 
to get some more parentheses that you're
going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> deal<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> have

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
going to have to deal with so you have

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
going to have to deal with so you have
12<00:01:13.200> x<00:01:13.409> 12<00:01:13.710> minus<00:01:13.979> 1<00:01:14.580> 33<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.380> 144<00:01:17.310> minus<00:01:17.700> 1

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
12 x 12 minus 1 33 so that's 144 minus 1

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.840 
12 x 12 minus 1 33 so that's 144 minus 1
33<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.900> 11<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.280> we'll<00:01:20.400> tap<00:01:20.580> check

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
33 which would be 11 so we'll tap check

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
33 which would be 11 so we'll tap check
right<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.360> dismiss<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.500> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
right there and dismiss it and then of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
right there and dismiss it and then of
course<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> insane<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.150> gets

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
course if you go to insane then it gets

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.090 
course if you go to insane then it gets
a<00:01:24.479> whole<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:25.049> difficult<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.920> tap

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
a whole lot more difficult so if we tap

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700 
a whole lot more difficult so if we tap
test<00:01:26.369> alarm<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.659> 14<00:01:28.140> x<00:01:28.470> 8

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
test alarm right here you have 14 x 8

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.149 
test alarm right here you have 14 x 8
minus<00:01:29.369> 93<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.170> 80<00:01:31.650> which

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
minus 93 which is going to be 80 which

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.200 
minus 93 which is going to be 80 which
8112<00:01:35.159> minus<00:01:35.790> 93<00:01:36.600> which<00:01:37.409> would<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.979> 19<00:01:38.820> we'll

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
8112 minus 93 which would be 19 we'll

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
8112 minus 93 which would be 19 we'll
try<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.500> okay<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.890> dismiss<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
try that okay so you can dismiss it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.730 
try that okay so you can dismiss it
right<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.360> insane<00:01:42.869> difficulty<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
right there but the insane difficulty is

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
right there but the insane difficulty is
obviously<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.909> harder<00:01:45.240> than

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
obviously a little bit harder than

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.880 
obviously a little bit harder than
you're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> get<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> other<00:01:46.560> four

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you're going to get on the other four

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
you're going to get on the other four
but<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.610> basically<00:01:47.759> how<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.329> tweak

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
but that's basically how this tweak

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
but that's basically how this tweak
works<00:01:48.810> next<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.890> colorful<00:01:50.250> keyboard

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
works next up we have colorful keyboard

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120 
works next up we have colorful keyboard
pro<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> 99<00:01:52.470> cent<00:01:52.500> tweak<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
pro now this is a 99 cent tweak and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.280 
pro now this is a 99 cent tweak and
basically<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.670> does<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.180> change<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
basically what it does is change up the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.950 
basically what it does is change up the
color<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.829> your<00:01:56.280> keyboard<00:01:56.759> randomly<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
color of your keyboard randomly so you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810 
color of your keyboard randomly so you
don't<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> set<00:01:59.040> what<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.520> want

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
don't really get to set what you want

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.520 
don't really get to set what you want
the<00:02:00.210> keyboard<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.659> look<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the keyboard to look like it's just a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.069 
the keyboard to look like it's just a
random<00:02:01.979> every<00:02:02.369> time<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.930> populate<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
random every time that you populate the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.480 
random every time that you populate the
keyboard<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:04.950> right<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.369> we

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
keyboard so you can see right here if we

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
keyboard so you can see right here if we
pull<00:02:05.700> down<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.299> spotlight<00:02:06.840> you'll<00:02:07.049> notice

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
pull down the spotlight you'll notice

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.749 
pull down the spotlight you'll notice
that<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> random<00:02:08.009> keyboard<00:02:08.580> right

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that we have a random keyboard right

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.090 
that we have a random keyboard right
here<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.569> open<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.959> notes

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
here and if we open up the notes

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.740 
here and if we open up the notes
you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> completely

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you can see that we get a completely

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.260 
you can see that we get a completely
different<00:02:13.170> keyboard<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.190> looks<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:15.150> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
different keyboard so it looks kind of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.940 
different keyboard so it looks kind of
cool<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.840> little<00:02:16.080> bit<00:02:16.200> vibrant<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

little<00:02:17.160> bright<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.670> me<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.170> look

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
little bright for me but it can look

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.480 
little bright for me but it can look
good<00:02:19.440> depending<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:19.920> your<00:02:20.040> theme<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.460> your

crashes<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.160> that's<00:02:53.610> something<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
crashes so that's something that you

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.670 
crashes so that's something that you
can't<00:02:54.510> really<00:02:54.600> mess<00:02:54.960> with<00:02:54.990> right<00:02:55.350> now<00:02:55.500> it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
can't really mess with right now it's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.990 
can't really mess with right now it's
kind<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.890> bugged<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.370> hopefully<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:56.910> going

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
kind of bugged so hopefully that's going

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
kind of bugged so hopefully that's going
to<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.180> fixed<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.600> future<00:02:57.960> update<00:02:57.990> but<00:02:58.860> then

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
to be fixed in a future update but then

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
to be fixed in a future update but then
coming<00:02:59.250> down<00:02:59.280> here<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.060> some<00:03:00.330> sliders

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
coming down here you have some sliders

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.300 
coming down here you have some sliders
that<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.170> can<00:03:01.320> manage<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> hue

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
that you can manage you have the hue

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.700 
that you can manage you have the hue
degrees<00:03:02.610> min<00:03:02.880> max<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.690> brightness<00:03:04.200> min<00:03:04.440> max

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
degrees min max the brightness min max

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.490 
degrees min max the brightness min max
and<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.190> saturation<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.210> really<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.110> one

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and the saturation so really the one

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.140 
and the saturation so really the one
that<00:03:07.710> I've<00:03:07.860> messed<00:03:08.130> with<00:03:08.340> quite<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
that I've messed with quite a bit is the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.610 
that I've messed with quite a bit is the
saturation<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.990> can<00:03:10.110> actually<00:03:10.380> make<00:03:10.500> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
saturation you can actually make the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.650 
saturation you can actually make the
colors<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> whole<00:03:11.130> lot<00:03:11.280> softer<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.240> if<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.480> do

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
colors a whole lot softer so if we do

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.420 
colors a whole lot softer so if we do
that<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.050> then<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.290> go<00:03:13.440> out<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:14.280> you'll

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
that and then we go out then you'll

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.100 
that and then we go out then you'll
notice<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:15.300> we<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.540> into<00:03:15.690> our<00:03:15.870> notes

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
notice that when we go into our notes

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.080 
notice that when we go into our notes
and<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:16.530> pull<00:03:16.740> this<00:03:16.860> up<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.790> going<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:17.970> be<00:03:18.060> a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
and we pull this up it's going to be a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.570 
and we pull this up it's going to be a
little<00:03:18.330> bit<00:03:18.480> softer<00:03:19.010> colors<00:03:20.010> right<00:03:20.190> here<00:03:20.430> so

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
little bit softer colors right here so

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.190 
little bit softer colors right here so
you<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.940> faded<00:03:21.390> green<00:03:21.600> faded<00:03:22.020> blue

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
you can see a faded green faded blue

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.530 
you can see a faded green faded blue
faded<00:03:22.620> yellow<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.250> let's<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.120> go<00:03:24.240> in<00:03:24.360> here

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
faded yellow and let's just go in here

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.530 
faded yellow and let's just go in here
and<00:03:24.570> let's<00:03:24.750> move<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.080> up<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.650> little<00:03:25.830> bit

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
and let's move it up just a little bit

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.140 
and let's move it up just a little bit
and<00:03:27.540> let's<00:03:27.810> go<00:03:27.930> back<00:03:28.110> in<00:03:28.290> here<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.060> can

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and let's go back in here and you can

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.820 
and let's go back in here and you can
see<00:03:30.330> they're<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.540> little<00:03:30.750> bit<00:03:30.960> softer<00:03:31.440> than<00:03:31.680> it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
see they're a little bit softer than it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.110 
see they're a little bit softer than it
was<00:03:31.950> when<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.130> first<00:03:32.340> came<00:03:32.520> into<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> Notes<00:03:32.940> app

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
was when I first came into the Notes app

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.150 
was when I first came into the Notes app
but<00:03:33.720> still<00:03:33.960> you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.320> mess<00:03:34.500> with<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.860> settings

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
but still you can mess with the settings

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.620 
but still you can mess with the settings
in<00:03:35.490> there<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.820> then<00:03:35.910> kind<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.180> get<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.450> how<00:03:36.570> you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
in there and then kind of get it how you

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.780 
in there and then kind of get it how you
like<00:03:36.960> and<00:03:37.230> last<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.100> not<00:03:38.280> least<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.670> a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
like and last but not least we have a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.070 
like and last but not least we have a
preview<00:03:39.210> of<00:03:39.270> an<00:03:39.480> upcoming<00:03:39.690> tweak<00:03:40.050> called

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
preview of an upcoming tweak called

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.290 
preview of an upcoming tweak called
quick<00:03:40.650> music<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:41.850> see<00:03:41.970> right<00:03:42.000> here

quick music so you can see right here

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.850 
quick music so you can see right here

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
that once you set your activator gesture

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.140 
that once you set your activator gesture
I've<00:03:43.980> set<00:03:44.190> mine<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.400> tap<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.850> hold<00:03:44.940> on<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
status bar you can see that we get a

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.520 
status bar you can see that we get a
banner<00:03:48.210> right<00:03:48.690> up<00:03:48.840> here<00:03:48.930> at<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.050> top<00:03:49.110> it's

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
banner right up here at the top it's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.990 
banner right up here at the top it's
basically<00:03:49.890> showing<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.580> i'm<00:03:50.760> playing

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
basically showing that i'm playing

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.390 
basically showing that i'm playing
always<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.690> my<00:03:51.810> head<00:03:51.960> by<00:03:52.200> coldplay<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:53.310> of

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
always in my head by coldplay and of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.350 
always in my head by coldplay and of
course<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.880> play/pause<00:03:54.120> button

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
course you have the play/pause button

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.960 
course you have the play/pause button
right<00:03:54.930> there<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.350> once<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.980> pause<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.520> that

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
right there and once you pause it that

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.660 
right there and once you pause it that
music<00:03:57.540> information<00:03:58.170> actually<00:03:58.740> scrolls<00:03:59.280> up<00:03:59.520> so

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
music information actually scrolls up so

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.340 
music information actually scrolls up so
you<00:03:59.760> only<00:03:59.880> have<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.300> play<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.990> next<00:04:01.290> and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
you only have the play in the next and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.500 
you only have the play in the next and
the<00:04:01.440> previous<00:04:01.890> buttons<00:04:02.670> right<00:04:02.820> there<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.420> if

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the previous buttons right there so if

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.450 
the previous buttons right there so if
we<00:04:03.600> tap<00:04:03.750> play<00:04:03.930> again<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.680> should<00:04:04.920> go<00:04:05.070> ahead<00:04:05.160> and

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
we tap play again it should go ahead and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.130 
we tap play again it should go ahead and
pull<00:04:05.700> down<00:04:05.880> right<00:04:06.150> there<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.780> then<00:04:06.840> we<00:04:06.990> can

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
pull down right there and then we can

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.290 
pull down right there and then we can
actually<00:04:07.260> pull<00:04:07.650> down<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.760> little<00:04:08.940> grabber

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
actually pull down this little grabber

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.450 
actually pull down this little grabber
which<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.930> little<00:04:10.380> bit<00:04:10.620> difficult<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:11.130> grab

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
which is a little bit difficult to grab

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.970 
which is a little bit difficult to grab
has<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> pretty<00:04:12.030> small<00:04:12.270> hitbox<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.710> keep

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
has a pretty small hitbox so just keep

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.290 
has a pretty small hitbox so just keep
that<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.220> mind<00:04:14.490> if<00:04:14.640> you're<00:04:14.760> trying<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.030> pull<00:04:15.210> it

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
that in mind if you're trying to pull it

first open up the settings menu so we're

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.420 
first open up the settings menu so we're
not<00:05:04.560> going<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.740> go<00:05:04.800> through<00:05:04.979> that<00:05:05.070> right<00:05:05.370> now

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
not going to go through that right now

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.430 
not going to go through that right now
but<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.180> have<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.419> album<00:05:06.570> art<00:05:06.750> cover<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.199> if

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
but you have the album art cover so if

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.260 
but you have the album art cover so if
you<00:05:07.530> want<00:05:07.710> that<00:05:07.740> on<00:05:08.009> just<00:05:08.310> toggle<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.699> on<00:05:08.789> you

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
you want that on just toggle it on you

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.360 
you want that on just toggle it on you
also<00:05:09.479> have<00:05:09.630> album's<00:05:10.110> cover<00:05:10.440> squared<00:05:11.009> so<00:05:11.280> you

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
also have album's cover squared so you

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.830 
also have album's cover squared so you
can<00:05:11.490> change<00:05:11.699> it<00:05:11.820> from<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.030> rounded<00:05:12.479> corners

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
can change it from the rounded corners

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.409 
can change it from the rounded corners
that<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.080> has<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:13.889> squared<00:05:14.550> look<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.270> we'll

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
that it has to a squared look so we'll

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.270 
that it has to a squared look so we'll
go<00:05:15.539> ahead<00:05:15.599> and<00:05:15.720> do<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.710> also<00:05:16.830> have<00:05:17.009> cloud

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
go ahead and do that you also have cloud

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.920 
go ahead and do that you also have cloud
music<00:05:17.669> which<00:05:17.849> I<00:05:18.000> don't<00:05:18.210> really<00:05:18.419> use<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:18.900> I

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
music which I don't really use so I

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.810 
music which I don't really use so I
don't<00:05:19.199> have<00:05:19.289> that<00:05:19.320> toggled<00:05:19.800> on<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:20.610> have

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
don't have that toggled on and you have

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.430 
don't have that toggled on and you have
activator<00:05:21.449> gestures<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.020> if<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:22.199> want<00:05:22.349> to

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
activator gestures so if you want to

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.260 
activator gestures so if you want to
change<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.919> activator<00:05:23.310> gesture<00:05:23.669> or<00:05:23.699> set<00:05:24.150> it

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
change the activator gesture or set it

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.670 
change the activator gesture or set it
then<00:05:24.599> this<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:24.900> where<00:05:25.050> you're<00:05:25.169> going<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.410> do<00:05:25.530> it

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
then this is where you're going to do it

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.920 
then this is where you're going to do it
you<00:05:26.130> also<00:05:26.310> can<00:05:26.550> change<00:05:26.789> up<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.030> blur<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:27.599> we

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
you also can change up the blur so we

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.629 
you also can change up the blur so we
have<00:05:28.110> quite<00:05:28.470> a<00:05:28.500> few<00:05:28.590> different<00:05:28.860> blood<00:05:29.370> types

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
have quite a few different blood types

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.490 
have quite a few different blood types
right<00:05:29.909> here<00:05:30.180> let's<00:05:30.570> go<00:05:30.720> ahead<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:30.990> do<00:05:31.320> the

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
right here let's go ahead and do the

ultra dark just to show you kind of the

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.930 
ultra dark just to show you kind of the
contrast<00:05:34.380> of<00:05:34.500> what<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.680> have<00:05:34.889> right<00:05:35.099> now<00:05:35.310> you

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
quick music so if we tap on that then we

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.279 
quick music so if we tap on that then we
can<00:05:40.020> do<00:05:40.530> let's<00:05:41.370> do<00:05:41.520> something<00:05:41.909> let's<00:05:42.570> do<00:05:43.260> a

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
can do let's do something let's do a

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.649 
can do let's do something let's do a
blue<00:05:43.949> right<00:05:44.280> there<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.789> then<00:05:45.449> right<00:05:45.510> down

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
blue right there and then right down

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.360 
blue right there and then right down

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
here you have text font color so if we

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.450 
here you have text font color so if we
change<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:48.169> gray<00:05:49.169> actually<00:05:50.130> just<00:05:50.250> change

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
change that to gray actually just change

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.460 
change that to gray actually just change
it<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.669> white<00:05:50.849> so<00:05:51.810> now<00:05:51.960> let's<00:05:52.139> go<00:05:52.229> ahead<00:05:52.320> and

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
it to white so now let's go ahead and

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.379 
it to white so now let's go ahead and
activate<00:05:52.979> it<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:53.550> we'll<00:05:53.669> tap<00:05:53.849> and<00:05:54.000> hold<00:05:54.090> again

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
activate it so we'll tap and hold again

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.749

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
you can see that we have a dark very

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.060 
you can see that we have a dark very
dark<00:05:56.930> quick<00:05:57.930> music<00:05:58.259> tweak<00:05:58.470> and<00:05:58.650> then<00:05:58.770> we<00:05:58.860> can

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
dark quick music tweak and then we can

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.210 
dark quick music tweak and then we can
pull<00:05:59.400> down<00:05:59.840> because<00:06:00.840> we<00:06:00.960> have<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.259> blue<00:06:01.530> font

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
pull down because we have the blue font

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.490 
pull down because we have the blue font
color<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.699> that's<00:06:03.330> going<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.690> actually<00:06:03.930> put<00:06:04.470> a

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
color and that's going to actually put a

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.260 
color and that's going to actually put a
border<00:06:04.830> around<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.220> album<00:06:05.669> art<00:06:05.759> cover<00:06:06.030> to

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
which we have pointed corners rather

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.399
