00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.710
 we have taken one more doubt one more doubt 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.530
 for someone who has it that is a 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.840
 suffering team that works and wins the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.869
 last week we have taken it out a late 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.699
 team that is losing and goes back that is 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.170
 it makes us grow a lot and that's how it is not the 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.530
 path 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.530
 people ask 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.880
 defensively speaking finally 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 Y 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.270
 yes without doubt without hesitation an approach 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 an approach that had a lot to do 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.480
 with this match a line of three 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 a huge job in all colors 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 offensive band players who have 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.410
 known to defend young people from above that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.530
 know how to press the entrance has been 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 perfect I also came what I have 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.940
 saying 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.100
 if you have to be self-critical it would be critical 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.340
 in the football that we have done 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.150
 it has not been pretty soccer porn I did not have 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.830
 it did not play but the merit of 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.960
 our players have been fantastic 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.470
 who has come here today to the stadium has 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.690
 seen an honest soccer team and 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.520
 worker that you have to be like that for 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.240
 win 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 solbes 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.050
 if it had to do with this match of a 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.320
 option that we discussed had more than one 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.900
 line of 2-2 two lanes one half the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.790
 center and two forwards because we knew 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.210
 that the party can be followed there with 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.740
 people in the area 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.450
 and the work they speak they have done 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.010
 had a lot to do with this one option 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.230
 plus 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.620
 for our team because you have to be 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.270
 versatile 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.680
 wish all the tourists parties 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.680
 health agostinas 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.070
 I'm sure it's going to look like 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.170
 have an opportunity to congratulate the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.300
 street I think they do a huge job 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.870
 I believe that the dynamic that comes from 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.390
 last year it allows them to be so 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.430
 powerful 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.660
 in a competition the Spanish league that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.410
 is that it is complicated with a lot of quality 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.630
 congratulate the work I have done 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.959
 personally and I wish everyone the hobby 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.880
 to see how he has behaved because he is 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.130
 a pleasure to come here to play hopefully last 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.130
 many years good thank you
