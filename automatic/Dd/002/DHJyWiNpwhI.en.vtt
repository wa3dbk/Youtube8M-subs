00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
wake up I thrown the left or any other

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.500 
wake up I thrown the left or any other
region<00:00:27.840> which<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.099> move<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
region which you can move from the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.420 
region which you can move from the
bottom<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.059> left<00:00:34.190> on<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
bottom on to the right or the left on to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.030 
bottom on to the right or the left on to
the<00:00:35.520> top<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.899> quite<00:00:37.170> easy<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.710> move<00:00:37.860> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the top so it's quite easy to move this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.670 
the top so it's quite easy to move this
one<00:00:38.870> let's<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.290> into<00:00:40.530> one

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
one let's say if you are into one

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
one let's say if you are into one
application<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> would<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
application if you would like to the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
application if you would like to the
battery<00:00:42.989> jump<00:00:43.230> from<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.649> application<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
battery jump from this application to

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
battery jump from this application to
the<00:00:45.000> video<00:00:45.239> player<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.989> move<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.770> way

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the video player you can move that way

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.709 
the video player you can move that way
but<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> best<00:00:47.670> part<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.210> feature<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
but the best part of this feature is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.740 
but the best part of this feature is
that<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.829> only<00:00:49.860> swap<00:00:50.430> from<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that you can not only swap from one that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.119 
that you can not only swap from one that
leads<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> other<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.649> actually

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
leads to the other one you can actually

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.069 
leads to the other one you can actually
run<00:00:53.280> both<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.940> same<00:00:54.059> time<00:00:54.480> so

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
run both of these at the same time so

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
run both of these at the same time so
for<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.440> let<00:00:55.590> me<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.829> show<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.129> preview<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
for that let me just show you preview of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
for that let me just show you preview of
the<00:00:56.760> same<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.510> let's<00:00:57.690> say<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:58.949> into

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the same so let's say if you are into

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.310 
the same so let's say if you are into
this<00:00:59.309> application<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.329> video<00:01:00.870> position

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this application there's video position

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
this application there's video position
you<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.949> actually<00:01:02.309> browse<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you would like to actually browse the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.870 
you would like to actually browse the
web<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.949> by<00:01:05.369> actually

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
web then you can do that by actually

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.530 
web then you can do that by actually
turning<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.960> application<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.770> then

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
turning one application and then

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.520 
turning one application and then
dragging<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.689> dropping<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.110> second<00:01:10.409> one

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
dragging and dropping the second one

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.250 
dragging and dropping the second one
onto<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:13.229> are

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
onto this here now as you can see we are

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.420 
onto this here now as you can see we are
actually<00:01:13.409> running<00:01:13.770> both<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> these

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
actually running both of these

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
actually running both of these
applications<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.150> same<00:01:15.390> time<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.869> view

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
applications at the same time so view

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.899 
applications at the same time so view
this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> default<00:01:17.189> browser<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this is the default browser which is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.300

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
forget if you use a power-play also for

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.730 
forget if you use a power-play also for
this<00:01:28.909> feature<00:01:29.090> let<00:01:29.810> me<00:01:29.960> describe<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:30.530> with

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
this feature let me describe this with

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.380 
this feature let me describe this with
some<00:01:30.950> other<00:01:32.110> application

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.800 

so<00:01:35.900> let's<00:01:36.080> say<00:01:36.290> while<00:01:37.060> right<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.540> main<00:01:38.750> and

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
so let's say while right in the main and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.010 
so let's say while right in the main and
I<00:01:39.680> would<00:01:40.400> like<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.850> check<00:01:41.060> out<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.450> map<00:01:41.660> I

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
I would like to check out the map I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.890 
I would like to check out the map I
could<00:01:42.560> do<00:01:42.680> that

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
could do that

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.530 

so<00:01:45.320> yeah<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.550> you<00:01:46.640> can<00:01:46.760> also<00:01:46.910> spread<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
so yeah and you can also spread the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.440 
so yeah and you can also spread the
screen<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.590> also<00:01:48.980> set<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.490> size<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.150> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
screen and also set the size of the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.760 
screen and also set the size of the
other<00:01:51.380> application<00:01:52.060> this<00:01:53.060> way<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.620> also

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
other application this way and it also
