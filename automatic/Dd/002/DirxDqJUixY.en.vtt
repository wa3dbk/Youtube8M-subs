00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.210
 good in this and how to accelerate your 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.890
 processor and how to speed up memory does not 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.200
 let's start with the first point we 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.200
 let's start we're going to write ms 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.900
 and April 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.240
 is 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.940
 ms corp 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.170
 but good we're going to grab that in the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.510
 radio but the advanced options and 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.550
 let's go where the nuclei are 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.410
 the nuclei we are going to give him a popcorn 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.610
 to put on the spine how 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.010
 solve the biggest number that 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.870
 have in my case from the number two 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.050
 with two cores well in the processor is 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.710
 the inter-premium and here we are going to give 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.160
 accept let's give apply and accept 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.809
 in these parts it is also in you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.320
 but as I already have it I 'm going to leave 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.390
 without restarting 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.909
 and we're going to go to the next point how 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.100
 boost your morale we're going to 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.790
 team start we are going to go to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.790
 properties 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.700
 and here in this window we will go to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.590
 Advanced configuration 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.829
 but on this window we will not go to 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.829
 configuration 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.659
 and we are going to give you the adjustment to obtain 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.140
 the best performance to you is going to 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.030
 seem all selected 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.370
 but they will give you the adjuster to 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.080
 get the best performance since what 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.690
 so they are going to select all 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.840
 they will give you to apply and they will have to 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.840
 wait 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.370
 it is removed they are going to accept 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.020
 appear a small square, they have to 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.530
 wait and from there they will give you to do 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.140
 for the same here is already 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.780
 but everything has been everything 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.460
 I hope we continue a lot to improve 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.880
 its performance and for those who play 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.850
 pc games because it's going to speed up a lot 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.750
 more the performance of your game will be more 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.500
 fast just remember to put the video 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 a like 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 provide comments whether they are in doubt 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 also some contribution in which it would be 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.360
 a lot of help
