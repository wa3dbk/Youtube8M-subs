thing<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:39.649> this<00:00:40.649> printer<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.520> see

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
thing first this printer you can see

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.490 
thing first this printer you can see
actually<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.420> word<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.969> see

actually the word at all you can see
it's<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:47.370> 3<00:00:48.180> inch<00:00:48.390> taller<00:00:48.690> than

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it's about like 3 inch taller than

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's about like 3 inch taller than
regular<00:00:49.140> printer<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:51.230> normally<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> tank

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
regular printer so normally the tank

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.420 
regular printer so normally the tank
should<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> same<00:00:54.000> table<00:00:55.010> with<00:00:56.010> the
