00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
first place its defenses aren't that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.769 
first place its defenses aren't that
great

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
great

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.150 
great
but<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> people<00:00:28.890> were<00:00:28.980> actually

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
but a lot of people were actually

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.939 
but a lot of people were actually
complaining<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.619> having

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
complaining about you know it having

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.860 
complaining about you know it having
lightning<00:00:32.309> rod<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.759> honestly<00:00:33.210> don't<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
lightning rod I honestly don't see a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
lightning rod I honestly don't see a
problem<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.469> because<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.640> can

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
problem with it because now you can

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.610 
problem with it because now you can
actually<00:00:35.940> switch<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.660> volt<00:00:36.899> switches<00:00:37.320> like

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
actually switch it on volt switches like

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.400 
actually switch it on volt switches like
Rotom<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.489> basically<00:00:38.879> done<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.809> cannot<00:00:40.230> do

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
Rotom is basically done it cannot do

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.619 
Rotom is basically done it cannot do
anything<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> make<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> sceptile<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.790> but

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
anything to make a sceptile at all but

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
anything to make a sceptile at all but
basically<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.110> switch<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.860> electric

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
basically you can switch in on electric

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.889 
basically you can switch in on electric
moves<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.360> make<00:00:45.480> sure<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
moves and you can make sure that you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
moves and you can make sure that you
don't<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.410> paralyzed<00:00:47.010> which<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> pretty<00:00:47.610> huge

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
don't get paralyzed which is pretty huge

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
don't get paralyzed which is pretty huge
for<00:00:47.969> Dragon<00:00:48.570> types<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> honestly<00:00:50.010> think

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
for Dragon types so I honestly think

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.069 
for Dragon types so I honestly think
that<00:00:50.430> lightning<00:00:51.210> rod<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:51.870> good

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that lightning rod is a pretty good

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
that lightning rod is a pretty good
ability<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> guy<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.850> know

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
ability for this guy and you know

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
ability for this guy and you know
obviously<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.530> boost

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
obviously you know if you get that boost

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
obviously you know if you get that boost
then<00:00:56.100> those<00:00:56.579> dragon<00:00:57.090> pulses<00:00:57.420> those<00:00:57.539> lead

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
then those dragon pulses those lead

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
then those dragon pulses those lead
storms<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.920> much<00:00:59.070> more

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
storms are going to just do so much more

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.130 
storms are going to just do so much more
so<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> think<00:00:59.730> that's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.239> great<00:01:00.390> ability<00:01:00.930> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so I think that's a great ability for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.740 
so I think that's a great ability for
mega<00:01:01.350> Sceptile<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.699> what<00:01:02.879> stat<00:01:03.180> boost<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> he

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
mega Sceptile now what stat boost is he

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.570 
mega Sceptile now what stat boost is he
going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.140> most<00:01:04.409> likely<00:01:04.890> speed<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
going to get most likely speed and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to get most likely speed and
special<00:01:05.970> attack<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.600> special<00:01:06.810> attack

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
special attack because special attack

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
special attack because special attack
would<00:01:07.290> benefit<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:07.740> lightning<00:01:08.250> rod<00:01:08.570> but

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
would benefit from lightning rod but

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
would benefit from lightning rod but
other<00:01:09.869> than<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.020> maybe<00:01:10.560> attack<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.430> for

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
other than that maybe attack just for

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
other than that maybe attack just for
like<00:01:11.790> his<00:01:12.150> physical<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.140> he<00:01:13.260> does

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
like his physical side because he does

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
like his physical side because he does
have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.770> physical<00:01:14.250> side<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
have a physical side and kind of you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
have a physical side and kind of you
know<00:01:15.720> Pokemon<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.290> end<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.650> doing<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
know Pokemon just end up doing that or I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
know Pokemon just end up doing that or I
guess<00:01:17.549> Game<00:01:17.790> Freak<00:01:17.970> does<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> lot<00:01:18.600> with

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
guess Game Freak does that a lot with

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
guess Game Freak does that a lot with
some<00:01:19.020> Pokemon<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.220> even

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
some Pokemon like you know with even

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.520 
some Pokemon like you know with even
with<00:01:20.640> mega<00:01:20.880> latias<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.659> mega<00:01:21.810> Latios<00:01:22.290> they

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
with mega latias and mega Latios they

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.980 
with mega latias and mega Latios they
still<00:01:22.799> gave<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.759> pretty<00:01:24.090> good<00:01:24.270> attack<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
still gave them a pretty good attack and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
still gave them a pretty good attack and
curry<00:01:25.110> especially<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.650> mega<00:01:25.799> latias<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
curry especially for mega latias so I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.770 
curry especially for mega latias so I
definitely<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.340> thing

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
definitely think that that thing

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.929 
definitely think that that thing
probably<00:01:30.780> will<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.140> somewhat<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.400> attack

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
probably will have somewhat of a attack

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
probably will have somewhat of a attack
stat<00:01:33.329> boost<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.930> probably<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.979> biggest<00:01:35.189> ones

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
stat boost but probably the biggest ones

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
stat boost but probably the biggest ones
will<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> speed<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.479> special<00:01:36.930> attack<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
will be speed and special attack the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
will be speed and special attack the
first<00:01:37.979> set<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> want<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> show<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
first set I want to show you is going to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
first set I want to show you is going to
be<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.960> all-out<00:01:40.380> attack<00:01:40.799> or<00:01:41.040> leaf<00:01:41.340> storm

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
be this one all-out attack or leaf storm

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670 
be this one all-out attack or leaf storm
focus<00:01:42.030> wise<00:01:42.210> dragon<00:01:42.750> pulls<00:01:42.930> an<00:01:43.079> HP<00:01:43.470> fire

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
focus wise dragon pulls an HP fire

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.230 
focus wise dragon pulls an HP fire
that's<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that's what I think is going to be the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.819 
that's what I think is going to be the
most<00:01:45.360> beneficial<00:01:45.570> obviously<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.649> leaf

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
most beneficial obviously with leaf

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.280 
most beneficial obviously with leaf
storm<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.340> stab<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:48.329> powerful<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.110> kind

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
storm it's stab very powerful it's kind

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.690 
storm it's stab very powerful it's kind
of<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.439> Draco<00:01:49.680> meteor<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.490> grass

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of like Draco meteor but just for grass

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
of like Draco meteor but just for grass
and<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.090> dragon<00:01:51.450> pulse<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.780> also<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and then dragon pulse you also get a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.289 
and then dragon pulse you also get a
dragon<00:01:52.560> stab<00:01:53.310> move<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:53.700> would<00:01:53.820> help<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> lot

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
dragon stab move which would help a lot

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
dragon stab move which would help a lot
HP<00:01:55.020> fire<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.649> stuff<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.890> scissor<00:01:56.369> or

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
HP fire for stuff like scissor or

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.709 
HP fire for stuff like scissor or
fortress<00:01:57.030> whatnot

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
fortress whatnot

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.889 
fortress whatnot
Ferrothorn<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.820> course<00:01:59.899> focused

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
Ferrothorn and then of course focused

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.810 
Ferrothorn and then of course focused
bus<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.460> able<00:02:02.759> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bus just because it's there it's able to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.389 
bus just because it's there it's able to
hit<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> lot<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.240> stuff<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.540> hard<00:02:04.399> especially

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
hit a lot of stuff very hard especially

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.310 
hit a lot of stuff very hard especially
like<00:02:05.579> he<00:02:05.759> trance<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.570> definitely<00:02:07.020> think

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
like he trance so I definitely think

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.770 
like he trance so I definitely think
that<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.280> set<00:02:08.910> will<00:02:09.090> probably<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.750> most

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that that set will probably be the most

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.479 
that that set will probably be the most
common<00:02:10.470> out<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.190> them

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
common out of all of them

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.910 
common out of all of them
I<00:02:11.520> also<00:02:12.360> thought<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.720> maybe<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.470> a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I also thought of maybe like a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.100 
I also thought of maybe like a
plus<00:02:14.280> three<00:02:14.610> attacks<00:02:14.910> set<00:02:15.240> which<00:02:15.960> is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
plus three attacks set which is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.199 
plus three attacks set which is
basically<00:02:16.470> getting<00:02:16.860> rid<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.100> HP<00:02:17.640> fire<00:02:17.940> but

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
basically getting rid of HP fire but

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.300 
basically getting rid of HP fire but
then<00:02:18.330> again<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.780> substitute<00:02:19.380> that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
then again you get substitute that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.100 
then again you get substitute that
actually<00:02:20.940> supposed<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> Giga<00:02:21.900> Drain

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
actually supposed to have a Giga Drain

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.949 
actually supposed to have a Giga Drain
instead<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.920> leaf<00:02:23.160> storm<00:02:23.569> because<00:02:24.569> get<00:02:24.870> your

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
instead of leaf storm because get your

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.270 
instead of leaf storm because get your
drain<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.380> have<00:02:25.470> substitute<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
drain if you have substitute then you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.160 
drain if you have substitute then you
can<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.670> HP<00:02:27.060> back<00:02:27.240> with<00:02:27.510> Giga<00:02:27.780> Drain<00:02:27.959> I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
can get that HP back with Giga Drain I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.620 
can get that HP back with Giga Drain I
think<00:02:28.380> that'd<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.920> helpful<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:30.240> those

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
think that'd be very helpful so those

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.630 
think that'd be very helpful so those
are<00:02:30.810> probably<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.350> two<00:02:31.440> sets<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.040> I'm<00:02:32.310> going

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
are probably the two sets that I'm going

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.449 
are probably the two sets that I'm going
to<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.820> running<00:02:33.060> um<00:02:33.300> but<00:02:34.230> definitely<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.070> oil

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
to be running um but definitely the oil

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.770 
to be running um but definitely the oil
attacker<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.030> feel<00:02:36.209> like<00:02:36.360> that's<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.720> be

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
attacker I feel like that's going to be

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.040 
attacker I feel like that's going to be
the<00:02:36.870> most<00:02:37.080> commonly<00:02:37.470> used<00:02:37.620> um<00:02:38.060> now<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.900> could

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
the most commonly used um now you could

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.740 
the most commonly used um now you could
run<00:02:40.260> recovery<00:02:40.739> with<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.420> but

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
run recovery with it it's up to you but

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.990 
run recovery with it it's up to you but
obviously<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.620> make<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> sceptile<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:44.880> going

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
obviously I make a sceptile it's going

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.300 
obviously I make a sceptile it's going
to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.150> pretty<00:02:45.600> good<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.200> stick<00:02:46.950> around<00:02:46.980> for

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
to be pretty good so stick around for

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.570 
to be pretty good so stick around for
the<00:02:47.610> other<00:02:47.640> three<00:02:48.480> videos<00:02:49.220> deities<00:02:50.220> gonna<00:02:50.400> be

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the other three videos deities gonna be

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.790 
the other three videos deities gonna be
well<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.239> guess<00:02:51.420> diancie<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.959> say<00:02:52.350> apply<00:02:52.470> might

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
well I guess diancie and say apply might

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.900 
well I guess diancie and say apply might
be<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.130> bit<00:02:53.280> more<00:02:53.459> difficult<00:02:53.820> because

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
be a little bit more difficult because

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.130 
be a little bit more difficult because
we<00:02:54.180> don't<00:02:54.330> know<00:02:54.420> what<00:02:54.570> their<00:02:54.690> abilities<00:02:55.110> are

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
we don't know what their abilities are

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.990 
we don't know what their abilities are
going<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> be<00:02:55.590> or<00:02:55.769> if<00:02:56.580> they're<00:02:56.730> gonna<00:02:56.820> have

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
going to be or if they're gonna have

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.240 
going to be or if they're gonna have
type<00:02:57.209> change<00:02:57.510> especially<00:02:57.989> for<00:02:58.260> Sableye<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.070> lot

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
type change especially for Sableye a lot

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.190 
type change especially for Sableye a lot
of<00:02:59.340> people<00:02:59.519> think<00:02:59.760> maybe<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:00.390> from<00:03:00.780> you

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
of people think maybe you go from you

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.400 
of people think maybe you go from you
know<00:03:01.230> dark<00:03:01.860> ghost<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.310> ghost<00:03:02.489> rock<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:04.080> didn't

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
know dark ghost to ghost rock you didn't

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.050 
know dark ghost to ghost rock you didn't
I<00:03:04.530> don't<00:03:04.709> know<00:03:04.860> because<00:03:05.190> it's<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.489> diamond<00:03:05.910> it's

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
I don't know because it's a diamond it's

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.300 
I don't know because it's a diamond it's
a<00:03:06.120> gym<00:03:06.390> who<00:03:07.050> knows<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.500> anyways<00:03:07.950> we'll<00:03:08.160> figure

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
a gym who knows but anyways we'll figure
