00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.429
 Come on we're with the big winner 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.830
 so this 2013 edition after its 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.030
 victory in the mid-2000s 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 thomas how was the day 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.960
 just okay it's not it's 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 passed quickly but it was hard anyway 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 because there have been a lot of low attacks 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.539
 throughout the day 1 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.050
 it was not a very easy scenario to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.180
 control who sits for the first 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.039
 modification or after for attacks 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.800
 successive runners that was just 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 behind me general but good the team 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.899
 the team worked hard so that's fine 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.120
 been anyway 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 now it's going to be what's going to be from 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 the quiet recovery at home before 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.340
 before the championships because actually 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.440
 there, even so, I did a criterium 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 dauphiné released 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 I only have three days between 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.079
 dauphiné and then there the southern route and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 mons and demanding steps that it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.620
 be dolphined where the southern route is in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.379
 term of the courses 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.660
 so yes there must be the body 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.699
 will say that level if we speak in terms 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 of work is she really is the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 last phases of work really 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 dauphiné had south and there I have left 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 six days to recover for 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.540
 championship of France and after ever the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 France will have five days to recover 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.680
 for the start of the lap so yes it's 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.049
 clearly the work is done as one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.729
 said one last question you're going 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.600
 when you come on the south road ben 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.220
 you always come with a lot of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.350
 pleasure you lead a woman and children 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.150
 it allows you as low as possible 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.979
 decompress a little bit before the tour 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.100
 it feels good to have the way family 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.810
 is clearly a leap in 2004 and 2006 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.979
 I had not come with since I had 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.140
 my wife but I had not abducted 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.260
 still child in May but no it's 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.580
 true that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.770
 I'm leaving, I'm doing about a hundred 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.110
 of race days in the year the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.280
 absences this is probably the side in 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.840
 any case when one is a father 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.470
 it's probably the most 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.540
 difficult of the trade and I allow myself 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.760
 I'm lucky to be here I am 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.410
 see that my wife and my kids but 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.510
 come to follow me anyway often 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.100
 so the mistress sometimes rattles a little 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.080
 because I missed a lot of schools 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 but also discover a lot 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.070
 on the races so very important for 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.540
 me to be often with family and the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.009
 south road it allows to be with family 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.200
 because I'm not that far from 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.350
 the good house and a campsite because we take 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.790
 the time is the opportunity to do 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.470
 a small family vacation for 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.520
 for my wife and children who will me 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.340
 I'm at work but it's true 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.130
 that before the stage it's not 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.520
 quantifiable well-being and that that 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.820
 provides 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.130
 thank you very much thomas and welcome back 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.420
 see you hear it a very very big 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.870
 public today at isle-daydain 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.270
 to encourage thomas voeckler he and he 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.610
 did the job as they say he did well 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.560
 managed his race and he's really 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.120
 really solicited today as 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.540

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.540
 the tour de france
