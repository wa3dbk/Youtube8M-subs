85
explanation<00:00:31.369> 85<00:00:32.150> I<00:00:32.599> find<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.770> players

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
explanation 85 I find that the players

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.660 
explanation 85 I find that the players
make<00:00:34.280> crisper<00:00:34.730> passes<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:36.770> feel<00:00:37.400> like<00:00:37.520> my

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
make crisper passes I feel like my

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.790 
make crisper passes I feel like my
offense<00:00:38.090> just<00:00:38.240> flowed<00:00:38.510> better<00:00:38.660> at<00:00:38.900> 85<00:00:39.410> if<00:00:39.710> you

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
offense just flowed better at 85 if you

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.380 
offense just flowed better at 85 if you
don't<00:00:40.040> like<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.370> serve<00:00:40.610> people<00:00:40.850> in<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.300> out

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
don't like to serve people in and out

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.630 
don't like to serve people in and out
you<00:00:41.600> might<00:00:41.780> not<00:00:41.990> want<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:42.230> put<00:00:42.380> it<00:00:42.470> on<00:00:42.560> 85<00:00:43.040> but<00:00:43.610> I

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
you might not want to put it on 85 but I

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.670 
you might not want to put it on 85 but I
found<00:00:43.850> it<00:00:44.030> on<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.240> low<00:00:44.420> settings<00:00:45.020> that's

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
found it on the low settings that's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.020 
found it on the low settings that's
where<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:45.980> get<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.280> animations<00:00:46.850> where<00:00:46.970> the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
where you get the animations where the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.690 
where you get the animations where the
ball<00:00:47.210> hangs<00:00:47.540> in<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.810> air<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:49.250> ball<00:00:49.430> just

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
ball hangs in the air and the ball just

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.430 
ball hangs in the air and the ball just
moves<00:00:49.880> around<00:00:50.000> slower<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.720> just<00:00:50.930> seems<00:00:51.110> it

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
moves around slower it just seems it

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.020 
moves around slower it just seems it
seems<00:00:51.590> like<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:51.950> got<00:00:52.040> something<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.430> do<00:00:52.550> it

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
seems like it's got something to do it

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.240 
seems like it's got something to do it
affects<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.540> passing<00:00:53.990> somehow<00:00:54.350> in<00:00:55.010> my

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
affects the passing somehow in my

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.100 
affects the passing somehow in my
opinion<00:00:55.700> I<00:00:55.850> just<00:00:55.940> may<00:00:56.240> just<00:00:56.450> be<00:00:56.600> seeing<00:00:56.870> this

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
opinion I just may just be seeing this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.930 
opinion I just may just be seeing this
and<00:00:57.260> thinking<00:00:57.560> it<00:00:57.650> but<00:00:57.830> that's<00:00:58.430> why<00:00:58.580> I<00:00:58.610> got<00:00:58.820> it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
and thinking it but that's why I got it
