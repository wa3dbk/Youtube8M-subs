00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.129 
off
a<00:03:31.919> little<00:03:32.919> shake<00:03:33.959> comes<00:03:34.959> right<00:03:35.139> off<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:38.079> you

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
a little shake comes right off so you

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.240 
a little shake comes right off so you
can<00:03:38.319> see<00:03:38.919> you're<00:03:39.099> there<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:41.590> see<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.949> prongs

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
can see you're there you see the prongs

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.659 
can see you're there you see the prongs
right<00:03:42.639> there<00:03:43.349> prongs<00:03:44.349> prongs<00:03:45.870> inside<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:47.319> you

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
right there prongs prongs inside of you

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.589 
right there prongs prongs inside of you
so<00:03:48.669> you<00:03:48.729> just<00:03:48.849> got<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.030> bend<00:03:49.299> up<00:03:49.449> those<00:03:49.659> corners

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
so you just got to bend up those corners

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.210 
so you just got to bend up those corners
I'm<00:03:52.599> going<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> lift<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.169> up<00:03:53.319> actually<00:03:53.919> look

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
I'm going to lift that up actually look

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.969 
I'm going to lift that up actually look
like<00:03:54.370> this

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
like this

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.089 
like this

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
careful don't mess with the needles and

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.830 
careful don't mess with the needles and
you<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.519> put<00:04:00.639> this<00:04:00.759> off<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.150> side<00:04:03.659> so<00:04:04.659> once

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
you can put this off to the side so once

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.740 
you can put this off to the side so once
you<00:04:04.959> do<00:04:05.079> that<00:04:05.109> you<00:04:05.949> get<00:04:06.129> your<00:04:06.340> q-tip<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.329> your

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
you do that you get your q-tip and your

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.199 
you do that you get your q-tip and your
acetone<00:04:08.489> you'll<00:04:09.489> start<00:04:09.729> wiping<00:04:09.879> away<00:04:10.120> all

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
acetone you'll start wiping away all

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
this there and I'm still working on this

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.160 
this there and I'm still working on this
side<00:04:57.810> nope<00:04:58.840> so<00:04:59.170> we're<00:04:59.440> all<00:04:59.530> done<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:02.110> looks

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
like that you see light go through it's

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.920 
like that you see light go through it's
clear<00:05:08.290> white<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:12.430> just<00:05:13.180> put<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.450> back<00:05:13.540> on<00:05:13.780> in

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
clear white and just put it back on in

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.840 
clear white and just put it back on in
Reverse

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.820 

and<00:05:17.420> once<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.690> put<00:05:17.870> everything<00:05:18.110> back<00:05:18.410> on<00:05:18.590> you

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
and once you put everything back on you

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.960 
and once you put everything back on you
want<00:05:18.980> to<00:05:19.040> make<00:05:19.160> sure<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.400> bend<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.700> clips

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
want to make sure you bend the clips

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:27.780 
want to make sure you bend the clips
back<00:05:20.090> in<00:05:20.390> right<00:05:20.630> there<00:05:20.900> -<00:05:21.260> one<00:05:22.060> two<00:05:23.770> three<00:05:25.090> four

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
back in right there - one two three four

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.620 
back in right there - one two three four
and<00:05:28.790> as<00:05:28.910> you<00:05:29.060> can<00:05:29.150> see<00:05:29.210> after<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:31.330> lot<00:05:32.330> brighter

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
and as you can see after a lot brighter

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.170 
and as you can see after a lot brighter
I'm<00:05:32.870> going<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.080> put<00:05:33.320> in<00:05:33.410> some<00:05:33.590> blue<00:05:33.800> LEDs<00:05:34.430> later

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.930 

it's<00:05:38.180> not<00:05:38.450> green<00:05:38.780> at<00:05:38.930> all<00:05:39.520> versus<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.550> stock

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
it's not green at all versus a stock

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.100 
it's not green at all versus a stock
green<00:05:41.210> right<00:05:41.480> there<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:44.330> there<00:05:44.510> it<00:05:44.630> is<00:05:44.780> just

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
green right there so there it is just

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.440 
green right there so there it is just
like<00:05:45.470> that<00:05:45.680> calyx<00:05:46.280> towards<00:05:46.640> like<00:05:46.790> the<00:05:46.940> SDI<00:05:49.450> so

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
like that calyx towards like the SDI so

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.000 
like that calyx towards like the SDI so
to<00:05:50.570> change<00:05:50.780> LEDs<00:05:51.290> the<00:05:51.500> ones<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:51.770> want<00:05:51.950> to

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
to change LEDs the ones you want to

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:59.110 
to change LEDs the ones you want to
change<00:05:52.490> or<00:05:52.940> one<00:05:53.390> two<00:05:55.450> three<00:05:57.730> four<00:05:58.730> and<00:05:59.090> five

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
change or one two three four and five

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.310 
change or one two three four and five
and<00:06:00.400> six<00:06:01.480> and<00:06:02.480> then<00:06:02.600> when<00:06:02.810> you're<00:06:02.960> all<00:06:02.990> done

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
and six and then when you're all done

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.270 
and six and then when you're all done
should<00:06:03.710> look<00:06:03.920> something<00:06:04.160> like<00:06:04.280> this<00:06:06.250> nice<00:06:07.250> and

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
should look something like this nice and

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:15.880 
should look something like this nice and
better<00:06:12.040> even<00:06:13.040> light<00:06:13.400> distribution<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:15.560> feel

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
better even light distribution the feel

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.550 
better even light distribution the feel
and<00:06:16.130> temperature<00:06:16.670> gauge<00:06:16.880> is<00:06:17.030> kind<00:06:17.240> of<00:06:17.270> low<00:06:20.560> let

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
and temperature gauge is kind of low let

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.830 
and temperature gauge is kind of low let
me<00:06:21.710> up
