00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
to get into the small eyelashes under

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the eyes or the corners both inner and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.569 
the eyes or the corners both inner and
outer<00:00:36.750> corners<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> eyes<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:38.070> very<00:00:38.340> nice

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
outer corners of the eyes it's very nice

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.770 
outer corners of the eyes it's very nice
to<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> better<00:00:40.440> precise

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
to do that you can get a better precise

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.590 
to do that you can get a better precise
application<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
application and I really like it and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.110 
application and I really like it and
overall<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> give<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> an<00:00:46.649> eight<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.399> here's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
overall I give it an eight now here's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
overall I give it an eight now here's
the<00:00:48.239> problem<00:00:48.510> i<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:49.739> probably<00:00:50.100> not

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the problem i would probably not

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.029 
the problem i would probably not
repurchase<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.030> again<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.690> why<00:00:52.469> i<00:00:52.500> would

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
repurchase this again and why i would

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
repurchase this again and why i would
not<00:00:53.160> repurchase<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.850> again<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
not repurchase this again because it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.799 
not repurchase this again because it
takes<00:00:54.899> too<00:00:55.260> long<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.590> apply<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.579> mascara<00:00:56.809> for

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
takes too long to apply my mascara for

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.900 
takes too long to apply my mascara for
me<00:00:57.989> i<00:00:58.230> could<00:00:58.500> probably<00:00:58.680> easily<00:00:59.070> spend<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> good

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
me i could probably easily spend a good

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.569 
me i could probably easily spend a good
five<00:01:00.180> minutes<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.899> more<00:01:01.320> applying<00:01:02.280> mascara

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
five minutes or more applying mascara

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.160 
five minutes or more applying mascara
with<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.600> regular<00:01:03.870> wand<00:01:04.320> um<00:01:05.450> now<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:07.020> i'm

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
with a regular wand um now out if i'm

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
with a regular wand um now out if i'm
going<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> door<00:01:07.680> yeah<00:01:08.220> i<00:01:08.280> could<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.670> three

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
going out the door yeah i could do three

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
going out the door yeah i could do three
sites<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> door<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.650> few

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
sites and be out the door and just a few

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
sites and be out the door and just a few
you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.580> 30<00:01:12.000> seconds<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.170> i'm<00:01:13.350> very

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you know in like 30 seconds but i'm very

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
you know in like 30 seconds but i'm very
picky<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.869> having<00:01:15.869> each<00:01:16.110> eyelash<00:01:17.000> coated<00:01:18.000> well

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
picky on having each eyelash coated well

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.600 
picky on having each eyelash coated well
but<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.380> year<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.650> takes<00:01:19.890> too<00:01:20.070> long<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
but this year just takes too long this

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
but this year just takes too long this
here<00:01:20.909> would<00:01:21.060> pollute<00:01:21.360> 8<00:01:21.570> me<00:01:21.689> 10<00:01:21.869> minutes<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
here would pollute 8 me 10 minutes I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.420 
here would pollute 8 me 10 minutes I
think<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.340> way<00:01:23.820> too<00:01:23.880> long<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.430> maybe

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
think it's just way too long and maybe

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
think it's just way too long and maybe
if<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.689> you're<00:01:27.810> more

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
if you're really really if you're more

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.679 
if you're really really if you're more
picky<00:01:28.200> than<00:01:28.290> me<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.890> may<00:01:29.040> love<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
picky than me you may love it so the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.480

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
overall it's pretty good like i said i'd

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.300

because<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> application<00:01:44.549> because<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> takes

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
because the application because it takes

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.109 
because the application because it takes
