00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:06.990
Friends, Welcome to the Presidency's blog. 

00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:11.150
It is a new space for dialogue and communication 

00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:14.472
to keep in touch with you.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.228
I enormously appreciate that we have these new technologies that 

00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:21.277
technologies that can help bring us closer together, 

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:24.364
particularly those who govern and those who are governed.

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:29.422
If you ask yourself, as president 

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:32.588
what is the most important thing to do, 

00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:35.524
you have to put yourself in other people's shoes 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.586
and ask what would I like to defend the most. 

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:39.522
The people have a wonderful popular saying, which says:

00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:42.512
health comes first. For my government, 

00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:44.517
health comes first too. 

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:48.177
And when, as president, 

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:51.571
you ask yourself what you can do for Mexicans, 

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.035
you would obviously like to solve 

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:56.240
all the problems at once. 

00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:58.839
You would like people to have all the services, 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.208
jobs, education, and security ,absolutely everyone.   

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:05.549
Naturally, as president, you have to work on everything. 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.759
But I asked myself, if there was only one problem

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.433
I could completely solve in the country, 

00:01:12.434 --> 00:01:17.597
which is in government's hands, what would it be?

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:20.958
It is the problem of health. 

00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:23.486
That is the problem I will solve. 

00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:26.541
That is what I personally planned to do before taking office. 

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:29.435
I promised this to the people and basically that is why we prioritize

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:33.337
health during these years of government.

00:01:33.338 --> 00:01:38.169
Mexicans' lives will change substantially as a result 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.575
of this government and the previous one, 

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:42.704
because we are providing health services 

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:45.407
for all Mexicans. 

00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:48.674
The truth is that in the 21st century, 

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.301
in the year 2000, less than half of all Mexicans

00:01:51.302 --> 00:01:54.127
had some form of health service 

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:57.234
and today we are going to incorporate nearly 

00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:00.246
100% of all Mexicans into universal health coverage.

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:03.313
I remember when I was a boy 

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.693
and we lived in Morelia in a hospital zone. 

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:08.301
We lived three blocks from the civil hospital,

00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:10.935
which was close to the medical school 

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:13.575
and lots of doctors lived there. 

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:15.628
I remember that people came from

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.439
all over the state of MichoacÃ¡n 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.525
and that the people did not have any money. 

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:23.915
We didn't have much money either. 

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:26.565
We didn't lack anything but there was no money 

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:29.707
to spare and my mother asked

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:32.429
her friends and neighbors and women from the church 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.369
for money and she set up 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.674
an association called the Order of St. Eduviges. 

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:41.069
And as a result of the money she raised, 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.855
people would knock on the door 

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:46.709
and ask for money for x-rays, 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.864
for medicines, they didn't have 

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.809
anywhere to stay while their 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.287
loved one was in hospital. 

00:02:54.288 --> 00:02:57.786
My mother used to go out every day 

00:02:57.787 --> 00:02:59.354
and if she didn't have any money, 

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:02.680
she would get some and talk to the doctors.

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.472
And once I said to her, "Mum, why doesn't 

00:03:05.473 --> 00:03:08.199
the government pay for that?" 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.615
and I came to the conclusion then 

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:13.846
that the government should pay for that. 

00:03:13.847 --> 00:03:16.439
Those people, for example, will no longer 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.617
have to beg for what is theirs by right, 

00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:21.004
which is minimum care, that will change. 

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:23.341
I can see changes, for example, 

00:03:23.342 --> 00:03:25.682
in certain specific areas. Three years ago, 

00:03:25.683 --> 00:03:28.429
for example, most of the children that had cancer, 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.804
specifically leukemia, used to die because 

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:33.232
their parents had no hope. 

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.750
Since we incorporated them into 

00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:38.167
the Popular Insurance Scheme, 

00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:40.148
the majority, the vast majority of children 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:42.694
with leukemia are cured. 

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:45.603
This is a radical change for families; 

00:03:45.604 --> 00:03:48.065
it is like the difference between heaven and earth. 

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:50.379
And these changes are really worth it and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.757
it's all thanks to health services. 

00:03:52.758 --> 00:03:54.748
I believe in equal opportunities and 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.575
the opportunity to be healthy is an  

00:03:56.576 --> 00:03:59.007
opportunity that should not be denied to anyone. 

00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:03.625
Something that made me very angry is that

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:06.202
until we came to office people were discriminated 

00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:08.801
against because they lacked money. 

00:04:08.802 --> 00:04:10.996
If the father did not have a job

00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:13.259
or wasn't enrolled in the Social Security Institute, 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.230
it meant the family did not have access to health services. 

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:18.927
If a mother had a child who got sick, 

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:20.574
if she did not have any money to pay the doctor, 

00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:23.070
quite simply, the mother was condemned

00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:26.551
to watch her child die. 

00:04:23.552 --> 00:04:26.643
And that is not fair. 

00:04:26.644 --> 00:04:28.725
In Mexico, we still suffer 

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:31.071
a lot of discrimination, 

00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:34.535
but if there is one thing that is absolutely unfair 

00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:37.313
and unacceptable, it is when 

00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:39.766
someone is told: your child can go 

00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:41.551
to hospital because you have money to pay 

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:43.561
and yours can't, which is how inevitably

00:04:43.562 --> 00:04:45.685
many people lost their relatives. 

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:48.125
By giving everyone the right to health, 

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:50.913
we are taking a great step towards equality 

00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:52.840
in Mexico.

00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:54.271
It is a question of justice, 

00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:56.841
which is why health is so important to me, 

00:04:56.842 --> 00:04:59.425
and that is perhaps the most important 

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:01.707
thing we have done in the government I lead. 

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:04.346
I would like to invite you to continue 

00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:06.477
this conversation on the blog. 

00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:09.115
Send us your opinions and ideas. 

00:05:09.116 --> 00:05:11.367
Let us talk and hopefully, 

00:05:11.368 --> 00:05:13.849
through dialogue, we will be able 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.193
to continue building the Mexico we want. 

00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:17.566
That free, fair Mexico. 

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.839
That clean, safe, democratic Mexico 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.840
we all want to see.
