00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:25.783
The First Christmas

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:29.200
Retold by Eliane Pinheiro

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.450
and Maura Hurley

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.283
Around the month of December,

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.783
children like to imagine

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:41.200
what happened

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.117
on the very first Christmas ever,

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:43.950
even before

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.033
Santa Claus.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.533
I know the story well,

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.367
for I was watching it all

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.700
from above --

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.200
in the dark sky

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700
on the evening

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.450
of December 24th,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.283
oh so many years ago.

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:11.200
I am the Star of Bethlehem.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.033
I was requested by angels

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.450
to shine

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.033
brighter than

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:18.700
all the other stars

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.617
that night,

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:23.117
to tell the whole world

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:24.450
that a very special child had been born

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.783
that a very special child had been born

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:29.700
to spread

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.200
goodwill and peace.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.367
And this is the story

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:46.783
of the first Christmas.

00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:50.533
All was quiet that night

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:51.367
as I watched the Three Kings

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:54.117
as I watched the Three Kings

00:01:54.117 --> 00:01:55.617
traveling slowly on camelback

00:01:55.617 --> 00:01:57.117
traveling slowly on camelback

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.533
through desert lands.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:01.283
through desert lands.

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:03.700
Just then, I beamed brightly,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.700
as the angels had told me to.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.117
as the angels had told me to.

00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:09.117
The Kings noticed me in the East.

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:12.700
The Kings noticed me in the East.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.700
They couldn’t

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.700
resist my brilliance.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.533
resist my brilliance.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.283
Perhaps they had heard

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:23.867
Perhaps they had heard

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:24.950
that a star like me

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.867
that a star like me

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:29.700
was going to show the way

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.283
to the son of God.

00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:33.867
Traveling

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.950
through the night,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.533
the Kings met shepherds

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.867
watching over their flock.

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:42.617
“We are following

00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:44.950
that incredibly beautiful star

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.533
there in the East,

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.367
to find the place

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:50.700
where the son of God

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.367
has just been born.”

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:55.367
From there they all traveled

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.367
together,

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.533
watching me,

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:00.950
the brightest star in the sky.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.950
the brightest star in the sky.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.200
Finally,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.117
they arrived at a small town

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:10.117
called Bethlehem,

00:03:10.117 --> 00:03:13.033
and saw that I was gleaming

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:14.367
radiantly above the barnyard

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:17.700
of an Inn.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.950
All was quiet and peaceful.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.617
Their caravan entered

00:03:24.617 --> 00:03:25.950
Their caravan entered

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.033
the barnyard

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.533
to see the tender little baby

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:32.033
lying in a simple manger

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:34.283
fluffed with hay.

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:35.867
Next to the baby

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:38.617
were Mary and Joseph,

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:41.033
his mother and father,

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:44.283
and many farm animals.

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:45.617
The Kings offered

00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:48.783
the precious gifts

00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:51.450
they’d carried from afar

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.950
for baby Jesus:

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.533
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:01.533
The shepherds kneeled

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.450
on the ground to pray;

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.450
on the ground to pray;

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.200
they were grateful for the gift

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.283
they were grateful for the gift

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:09.700
of love and the purity

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.617
the baby

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.450
brought.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.783
Many people offered gifts

00:04:15.783 --> 00:04:18.033
after that -

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.450
I suppose this is

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.700
why on Christmas Day,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.950
why on Christmas Day,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.033
people around the world

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:26.283
people around the world

00:04:26.283 --> 00:04:28.450
enjoy offering gifts

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.617
as a sign of love and hope.

00:04:30.617 --> 00:04:33.033
as a sign of love and hope.

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:35.117
And they try their best

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:36.950
to bring happiness to others,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.200
as Jesus did

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.033
all his life.

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.200
Now I’d like to wish you

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200
a holiday season

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.950
that shines as brightly

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.450
as the Star of Bethlehem!
