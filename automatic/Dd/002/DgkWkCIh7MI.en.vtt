00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.990
 We are going to prepare soy stew 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.660
 ingredients that we need are for 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.730
 two people 125 grams of legume 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.129
 green soy 100 grams of green pepper 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.010
 red a grated ripe tomato 2 onions 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.170
 one or two carrots one potato one piece 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 of chorizo ​​a teaspoon of paprika 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 sweet 2 cloves of garlic water oil and salt 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 and let's start adding in our 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.879
 express pot a couple of teaspoons 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.059
 oil and we're going to support one of the 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.100
 onions that we have cut in julienne 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.329
 we also add garlic cloves 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.329
 well minced 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.500
 and we started to sauté 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.899
 and we add the grated natural tomato 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.930
 and we give him a little salt so that 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.200
 it can be better 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.960
 and at minute 2 we will also add the 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.120
 red and green pepper in our case what 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.940
 we add that we had it frozen in 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.690
 dice but if you have fresh pepper 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.420
 the hand much better 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.430
 then add the paprika and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.670
 we move quickly so that we are not 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.160
 burn the soya we have had it to soak 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.590
 all last night and we have 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.460
 drained well and we will add it to the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.840
 pot quickly we also add a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.000
 little water 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.000
 and we do it in this order to be able 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.799
 calculate well the water in the pot and go 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.039
 to add enough water to 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.649
 cover over two fingers of what is 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.500
 the level of soy now we put a 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.930
 little salt 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.300
 and we are going to add the fat stumbles 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 if we do it the other way as I said 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.880
 it will cost us more to calculate the level of 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.180
 water with the fat trips 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.820
 volumes change 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.450
 we are going to add everything in fat pieces 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.670
 to then be able to distribute the rations and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.740
 we add an entire onion because it is 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.750
 a touch that loves louis this 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.630
 type of stews and stews both in the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.350
 lentils as in soy we closed the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.000
 pot and we will have about 15 minutes 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.370
 at medium heat 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.070
 once depressurized the pot alone the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.230
 we open and ready we have our 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.390
 green soy stew that you see 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.880
 we have prepared the same as some lentils 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.400
 as the green vegetable soybean 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.560
 behaves very similarly to this 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.900
 previous and has a flavor and texture 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.030
 very nice for what we have been 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.030
 a delicious dish
