00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.990 
because it actually turns into a little
mini<00:00:56.760> automatic<00:00:57.360> pistol<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.579> reality<00:00:59.969> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
mini automatic pistol but the reality is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.049 
mini automatic pistol but the reality is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
ones but I don't think that would make a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.149 
ones but I don't think that would make a
difference<00:01:06.840> either<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.040> I'm

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
ammo with that little stupid calamity

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.199 
ammo with that little stupid calamity
missile<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:46.709> whatever<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.060> okay

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
missile or whatever and I was like okay

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.759 
missile or whatever and I was like okay
cool<00:02:48.510> i<00:02:48.599> could<00:02:48.900> see<00:02:49.019> his<00:02:49.110> little<00:02:49.290> flicker<00:02:49.590> at

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
cool i could see his little flicker at

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.210 
cool i could see his little flicker at
least<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.519> plus<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.099> just

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
least so that's a plus but it just

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.020 
least so that's a plus but it just
doesn't<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.610> near<00:02:53.849> as<00:02:53.940> much<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:56.030> I'm

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
doesn't do near as much and as I'm

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.880 
doesn't do near as much and as I'm
trying<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.720> do<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> guess<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.590> kind<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:58.799> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
trying to do this I guess it's kind of a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.289 
trying to do this I guess it's kind of a
series<00:02:59.160> i<00:02:59.190> guess<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.549> turned<00:02:59.730> into<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.970> series

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
series i guess it's turned into a series

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.370 
series i guess it's turned into a series
where<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.660> why<00:03:00.780> you're<00:03:00.959> right<00:03:01.079> here<00:03:01.200> check

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
I'm gone but but as you can see here the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.180 
I'm gone but but as you can see here the
he's<00:04:39.630> flashing<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.380> I'm<00:04:40.590> really<00:04:40.890> trying<00:04:41.160> to

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
he's flashing and I'm really trying to

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.280 
he's flashing and I'm really trying to
be<00:04:41.310> careful<00:04:41.460> with<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.240> shots<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
be careful with the the shots and you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.400 
be careful with the the shots and you
know<00:04:43.380> hit<00:04:43.530> him<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.720> thought<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.170> would

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
know hit him and I thought that I would

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.870 
know hit him and I thought that I would
have<00:04:46.500> been<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> little<00:04:46.770> kill<00:04:46.980> him<00:04:47.070> with<00:04:47.220> with

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
have been a little kill him with with

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.190 
have been a little kill him with with
the<00:04:48.150> SOG<00:04:48.510> like<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.260> have<00:04:49.740> 240<00:04:50.720> bullets<00:04:51.720> left<00:04:51.900> and

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
the SOG like I have 240 bullets left and

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.290 
the SOG like I have 240 bullets left and
he's<00:04:52.440> flashing<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.040> I<00:04:53.070> thought<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.550> got<00:04:54.120> this

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
he's flashing so I thought I got this

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.090 
he's flashing so I thought I got this
one<00:04:54.480> but<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.750> ends<00:04:55.350> up<00:04:55.440> getting<00:04:55.560> really<00:04:55.980> really

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
one but it ends up getting really really

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.040 
one but it ends up getting really really
close<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.580> bet<00:04:56.730> if<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:56.970> would<00:04:57.150> have<00:04:57.240> spaced<00:04:57.900> out

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
close I bet if I would have spaced out

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.410 
close I bet if I would have spaced out
the<00:04:58.200> shots<00:04:58.440> from<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.130> shotgun<00:04:59.460> and<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.180> and

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
the shots from the shotgun and this and

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.500 
the shots from the shotgun and this and
the<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.650> calamity<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.160> if<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.340> would<00:05:02.490> have<00:05:02.550> you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
the the calamity and if I would have you

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.270 
the the calamity and if I would have you
know<00:05:03.540> had<00:05:03.840> like<00:05:04.110> perfect<00:05:04.500> accuracy<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:05.160> would

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
know had like perfect accuracy it would

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.570 
know had like perfect accuracy it would
have<00:05:05.370> actually<00:05:05.640> killed<00:05:05.910> him<00:05:06.090> with<00:05:06.390> both<00:05:06.600> guns

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
have actually killed him with both guns

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.230 
have actually killed him with both guns
unfortunately<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.610> don't<00:05:08.700> have<00:05:08.820> that<00:05:08.940> great<00:05:09.120> of

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
unfortunately I don't have that great of

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.750 
unfortunately I don't have that great of
accuracy<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:10.040> it<00:05:11.040> doesn't<00:05:11.430> end<00:05:11.550> up<00:05:11.610> working

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
accuracy and it doesn't end up working
