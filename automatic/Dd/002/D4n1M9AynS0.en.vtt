00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello guys today I bring you another tutorial 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 this time it will be a chin and rabbit and the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.040
 cold porcelain glue materials 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.519
 white paints modeling tools 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.110
 and wire and the procedure first thing 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.139
 what we will do will be the head with a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.359
 gonista the ball will cover the of 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.200
 porcelain skin color with palm 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.420
 hands 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.190
 we are going to go carrying everyone in that 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.460
 up to completely cover the 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.460
 pellet 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.610
 once we have everything covered the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.829
 let's take out the excess and we're going to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.100
 match with your hands so that it is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.100
 smooth 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 we will have something like that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.129
 with the body he did it with a heart of 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.210
 unicel which I cut the part of 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.239
 down 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.000
 and a little bit to the point so he wants in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.250
 cone or triangle shape and I'm going to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.190
 Lining with pink base 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.050
 clear trunks no matter what that looks like 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.890
 The important thing is to cover all 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.290
 the pieces of unicel and then with the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.910
 we will be modeling it for the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.790
 that remains in cone form and that of a 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.710
 flat shape like this with white paint 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.760
 I'm going to draw a rabbit 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.760
 this is optional 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 I'm going to let it dry and then do the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.870
 details with blue color mass we are going to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.870
 make a band-aid to form the legs 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.450
 let's do two 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.390
 and with black before the shoes with the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.580
 half circle 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.340
 to which we are going to stick under the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.590
 legs and we're going to stick them to the body 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.440
 with wire over now let's do the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.980
 arms are like more elongated drops 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.010
 13 are darker pink and we're going to 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.630
 paste the sides a ball to form 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.630
 skin-colored hands 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.819
 we will make the hair I will make it 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.440
 blond I will make a name for you for 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.330
 make a girl and they can do them the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.959
 longer hair I'll make droplets 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.959
 little girls 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.560
 comes a tool I will give 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.019
 hair texture and I 'm going it to 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.450
 start hitting with more like more 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.260
 like this case, how good are you? 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.470
 mark and long walk they like 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.260
 let's make a white band 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.120
 we calculate to make dots to the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.960
 ends and we're going to stick it up 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.600
 of the head like a headband 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.870
 not to be a kind of drop with dough 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.850
 the white will crush a bit 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.300
 so that we have a way similar to 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.120
 this simulating rabbit ears with 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.000
 pink color let's put a droplet at 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.270
 medium and I'm just going to stick with wire 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.450
 so that they are good stops for me 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.450
 these 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.260
 let's make a neck with a little ball 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.260
 smaller 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.960
 and with wire 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.960
 I'm going to stick the body on my head 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.030
 now it's just missing the 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.030
 details I will do the eyes 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.230
 and so I stay is the caritas charity 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.240
 a bunny 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.100
 anger 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.310
 but if I stay a hair in the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.310
 ears 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.210
 and I hope you liked it, do not forget
