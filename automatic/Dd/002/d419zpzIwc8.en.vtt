annular<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.400> finger<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:39.160> probably<00:00:40.160> going<00:00:40.670> to

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
annular a finger is probably going to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.570 
annular a finger is probably going to
require<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.570> lot<00:00:42.020> more<00:00:42.050> attention<00:00:42.290> than<00:00:42.950> all

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
require a lot more attention than all

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.660 
require a lot more attention than all
the<00:00:43.700> other<00:00:43.820> fingers<00:00:44.650> because<00:00:45.650> in<00:00:45.890> our<00:00:46.130> anatomy

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
the other fingers because in our anatomy

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.640 
the other fingers because in our anatomy
and<00:00:46.820> our<00:00:46.970> physiology<00:00:47.330> is<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:47.840> weakest<00:00:48.470> finger

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
and our physiology is the weakest finger

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.640 
and our physiology is the weakest finger
so<00:00:48.920> we<00:00:49.040> have<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.310> spend<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.180> lot<00:00:50.330> of<00:00:50.360> time<00:00:50.690> doing

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
so we have to spend a lot of time doing

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.590 
so we have to spend a lot of time doing
exercises<00:00:52.310> to<00:00:52.430> with<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.820> finger<00:00:53.030> up<00:00:53.360> and

four five and six seven eight nine ten
eleven<00:02:37.569> will<00:02:38.569> be

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.570 

so<00:02:47.080> that's<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.440> huge<00:02:47.470> difference<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:48.220> Tampa
