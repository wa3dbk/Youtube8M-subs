so<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> say<00:02:01.070> three<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:03.409> g3<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.710> G<00:02:06.020> open<00:02:07.020> D

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:35.960 

one<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:11.670> D<00:02:12.710> open<00:02:13.710> D<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:33.440> then<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:35.700> kind<00:02:35.940> of
