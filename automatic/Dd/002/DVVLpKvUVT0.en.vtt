up<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:24.890> I<00:00:24.949> would<00:00:25.099> make<00:00:25.609> sure<00:00:25.880> I'd<00:00:26.000> wear<00:00:26.210> this

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
with a white top underneath so obviously

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.870 
with a white top underneath so obviously
it's<00:00:28.910> not<00:00:28.939> serious<00:00:29.300> yet<00:00:30.160> so<00:00:31.160> this<00:00:31.310> is<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.519> ship

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
it's not serious yet so this is a ship

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.690 
it's not serious yet so this is a ship
and<00:00:32.170> style<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.470> what<00:00:33.560> I<00:00:33.620> like<00:00:33.860> about<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.250> is

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
and style to what I like about this is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.210 
and style to what I like about this is
the<00:00:34.940> fact<00:00:34.970> that<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:35.630> has<00:00:35.870> full<00:00:36.170> lining<00:00:36.470> is<00:00:37.070> it

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
the fact that it has full lining is it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.120 
the fact that it has full lining is it
is<00:00:37.370> share<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.420> full<00:00:38.600> lining<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.140> enables

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
is share so the full lining it enables

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.070 
is share so the full lining it enables
it<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.310> be<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:41.300> know<00:00:41.420> you<00:00:41.510> can<00:00:41.750> wear<00:00:41.930> it
