00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.490
 occasion we are going to prepare a recipe that 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.270
 we had already been asked for this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.400
 good but they are the typical churros 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.220
 thick or churros fat are typical 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.160
 here in Jalisco let's start let's go 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.960
 need a cup and a half a cup and a half 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.750
 Of flour 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.410
 of wheat we're going to need a cup of 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.649
 water we are going to need a cajeta to 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.680
 fill them and we're going to need a 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:44.989
 mixture of sugar with cinnamon powder that 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.089
 sprinkle this we're going to reserve 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.160
 for the end and we're also going to 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.880
 need 200 grams of butter 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.880
 three eggs 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.510
 and we're also going to need vanilla and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.550
 oil where we are going to fry our 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 yachts we are going to boil our 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.090
 cup of water 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.979
 it starts to boil and we're going to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 incorporate the ingredients that in this 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.619
 case will be 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.619
 the vanilla 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 and the butter 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.190
 the 200 grams of butter and we're going to 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.190
 wait until they are engaged 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.659
 already our butter was undone 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.020
 began to boil our water then 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.500
 we are going to incorporate the cup and a half of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 hit flour let's pay our 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 fire and add the cup and a half of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.960
 flour 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.740
 let's stir to mix everything well 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.810
 until they are forming 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.720
 a kind of more 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.840
 already our mass was made as well as 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.210
 very hard we are going to put an egg and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.280
 let's see how we have left if you need 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.280
 more the corporates more 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.740
 and we're going to stir him up to join 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.740
 our mass 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.250
 already our egg was incorporated nothing else 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.310
 we're going to need one we're not going to 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.410
 need more and good is already ready 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.090
 our mass here is when the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.400
 We would doubt if the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.709
 we were going to make churros of those 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.470
 delgaditos that go with figure of 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.450
 star or something like that but we 're going 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.519
 to make the typical churros fat 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.860
 here of Jalisco that are filled with 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.920
 Then what are we going to do? 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.310
 we are going to we will not need 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.120
 you are going to have to stretch them as 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.120
 if it were a mass 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.709
 we put a little flour to be able 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.680
 handle it and we're going to incorporate our 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.409
 mass here 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.000
 and we're going to start giving it the shape that 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.750
 we want in this case for the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.750
 fat churro 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.550
 the flour this is so that we are not 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.380
 Stick on the surface and power 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.560
 handle it with our hands 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.050
 directly these fat churros are 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.050
 very typical here in Jalisco and we 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.400
 they had asked in several videos 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.260
 previous nothing else we had not 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.550
 could do it for different things and 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.800
 as we had several videos already 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.440
 pre-recorded that we had to go up 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.910
 little by little that's why we do not 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.310
 we could have done but there was not 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.960
 asked our friend to play sushi and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.680
 our friend 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.680
 cl 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.600
 so here it is a little bit late but 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:48.590
 good is ready the video of how it is 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.739
 they make fat churros jalisco style 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.510
 and good these are going to stretch to 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.050
 stretch as if we were going to make a guy 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.860
 it does not screw 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.530
 but we're not going to screw it up 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.700
 we stretch it must be something like 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.700
 as what cycle are 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.440
 from here we cut and we take it to 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.810
 fry for this you have to have already your 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.660
 liter of oil in a saucepan in a 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.510
 casserole 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.480
 very hot 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.170
 we already have our oil hot 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.560
 then let's put our mass of 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.560
 Churros 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.860
 good if solitos are fixed and solitos 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.800
 they raise good rather they reach the 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.650
 oil surface is because I already know 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.490
 they are lasting and that is what we 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.930
 we search here and nothing else is to wait 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.190
 that they take the color that we 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.160
 we hope there is a golden color 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.530
 well, our 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.170
 fat churros well as it was reached 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.450
 inflate and good are already in the golden 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.700
 perfect in the gold that I like 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.160
 if you like them more golden, you can 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.410
 leave it longer but for me it is already 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.810
 good enough then we're going to 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.810
 prepare to prepare it simply the 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.850
 you open 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.760
 and here inside is where you're going to spread 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.770
 The cajeta 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.990
 with a napkin with the paper because 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.650
 They were hot 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.650
 and good simply you raise cajeta 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.820
 the amount you prefer 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.440
 and the brand that you prefer the 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.480
 cajeta 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.180
 I've already done this, we're not going to take 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.660
 the mixture that we had before of sugar 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.920
 with cinnamon 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.920
 we're just going to 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.480
 to roll over to impregnate 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.009
 and this would be all this would be the typical 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.520
 fritter 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.520
 in cajeta 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:33.749
 and so good here is the video and play 

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:35.789
 sushi and you like it a little late 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:38.969
 but I'm sure I hope you liked it 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.889
