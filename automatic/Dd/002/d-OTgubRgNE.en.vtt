00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 hello today we are going to do pinches 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.420
 in the poland style 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.779
 first we're going to need two cups of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.779
 flour 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.240
 the eggs 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.380
 up to half a cup of oil 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.059
 a cup of milk 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:54.690
 a spoonful of sugar and water according to 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.750
 need we are going to stir everything because 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.960
 We are already have prepared here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.809
 pasta is already made has to be 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.979
 watery almost like water, not someone who does not have 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.140
 to stay this is so we 're going to be 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.090
 adding water depending on 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.090
 consistency that we want to be 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.650
 We put to heat a pan 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.630
 and now let's start 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.799
 to do the pricks 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.930
 It expands all over the pan 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 we wait for that thing stain 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.700
 when it starts making bubbles 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.190
 means that it is already cooked 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.190
 from below and you have to flip it 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.840
 let's get a little closer so that 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.840
 see 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.170
 to see if the lumps are visible 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.480
 what can the brightness is not achieved to 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.480
 see very well 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.090
 it takes off a little from the sides so that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.090
 do not stick when flipping it 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.340
 we wait for it to be on the other side 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.260
 we see that it is already cooking 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.690
 little bit golden every time it gets hot 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.080
 more of the pan will be leaving more more 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.080
 Golden 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.150
 so we are doing 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.240
 the pasta that we prepare 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.590
 the next step is going to be the filling of 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.590
 the niches 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.430
 let's start filling in the lynxes 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.200
 let's see how it's done here we already have 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.890

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.360

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.840
