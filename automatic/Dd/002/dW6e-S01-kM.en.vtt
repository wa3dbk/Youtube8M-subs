everything and never lost contact it's a

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.440 
everything and never lost contact it's a
little<00:03:34.980> bit<00:03:35.070> snowy<00:03:35.340> outside<00:03:35.640> today<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.209> I'm

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
little bit snowy outside today so I'm

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.810

not going to go out and walk so it's the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.880 
not going to go out and walk so it's the
unimportant<00:03:39.420> get<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.870> would<00:03:40.050> assume<00:03:40.440> that

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
unimportant get but I would assume that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.300 
unimportant get but I would assume that
