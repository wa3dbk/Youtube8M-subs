00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
filmic look the first I want to talk

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.769 
filmic look the first I want to talk
about<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.770> setting<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.699> camera<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.240> 24

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
frames a second to be honest this is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.279 
frames a second to be honest this is
probably<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.750> has<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> least

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
probably the one that has the least

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.609 
probably the one that has the least
amount<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.830> value<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.810> it<00:00:27.810> happens<00:00:28.230> more<00:00:28.470> on

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
amount of value to it it happens more on

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
amount of value to it it happens more on
a<00:00:28.650> subconscious<00:00:28.980> level<00:00:29.429> most<00:00:30.029> people<00:00:30.420> can't

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
a subconscious level most people can't

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
a subconscious level most people can't
tell<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> difference<00:00:31.410> between<00:00:31.529> 24<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.610> 30

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
tell the difference between 24 and 30

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.569 
tell the difference between 24 and 30
frames<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.540> second<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.530> reason<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.040> shoot<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.460> 24

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
frames a second the reason I shoot at 24

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
frames a second the reason I shoot at 24
frames<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> second<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.870> much<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> look

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
frames a second it's not so much to look

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.040 
frames a second it's not so much to look
it's<00:00:38.250> because<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.790> creates<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.329> smaller<00:00:39.690> file

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it's because it creates a smaller file

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.100 
it's because it creates a smaller file
size<00:00:40.379> shoot<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:42.090> shallow<00:00:42.600> depth

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
think some of the other manufactures
they<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.489> huge<00:00:47.820> large<00:00:48.180> sensors<00:00:48.750> on

they have these huge large sensors on

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
they have these huge large sensors on
them<00:00:49.020> which<00:00:49.620> help<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> create<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.730> super
