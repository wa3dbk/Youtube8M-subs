little<00:01:28.259> incorrectly<00:01:28.880> was<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.000> did<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.240> account

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
little incorrectly was I did not account

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.890 
little incorrectly was I did not account
for<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> extra<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.420> quarters<00:01:33.840> of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
for the extra you know three quarters of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.200 
for the extra you know three quarters of
an<00:01:34.020> inch<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> piece<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> wood<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.030> went

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
an inch of the piece of wood that went

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.830 
an inch of the piece of wood that went
on<00:01:36.299> here

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
on here

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
on here
so<00:01:37.079> when<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> cut<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.040> cut<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.549> fit

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so when I cut this I just cut it to fit

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.069 
so when I cut this I just cut it to fit
the<00:01:39.360> face<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> wood<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.320> didn't<00:01:40.740> leave<00:01:41.520> any

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
the face of the wood I didn't leave any

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.830 
the face of the wood I didn't leave any
overhang<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.700> account<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
overhang just to account for that so I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.249 
overhang just to account for that so I
do<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.740> again<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.630> let's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
do it again I would do that and let's

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.609 
do it again I would do that and let's
see<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:51.360> didn't<00:01:51.930> feel<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
see I didn't feel like going and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.639 
see I didn't feel like going and
spending<00:01:53.130> money<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.430> an<00:01:53.820> actual<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
spending money on an actual you know a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.999 
spending money on an actual you know a
nice<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.549> don't<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.770> l-bracket<00:01:58.770> there

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
nice little I don't know l-bracket there

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.459 
nice little I don't know l-bracket there
so<00:01:59.399> just<00:02:00.119> use<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.600> wood<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.320> own

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
so just use some wood to make my own
