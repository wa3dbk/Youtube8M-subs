 Later gestures like the sushi others to mujica reveal that Indian doctors 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:28.509
 they were the first to perform plastic surgery inventing procedures 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.569
 such as rhinoplasty 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.960

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.020
 weather 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.009
 however ayurveda did not advance further to its surgical techniques 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.919
 probably due to the influence of Bushism in cycle three before 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.740
 Christ 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.169
