earth story as 6% 3bet let's go over the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
earth story as 6% 3bet let's go over the
the<00:00:50.940> HUD<00:00:51.090> real<00:00:51.270> quick<00:00:51.570> 8:46<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> number<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the HUD real quick 8:46 is the number of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.959 
the HUD real quick 8:46 is the number of
hands<00:00:53.129> 14<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.149> VIP<00:00:54.829> 13<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.219> preflop

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
hands 14 is the VIP 13 is the preflop

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.639 
hands 14 is the VIP 13 is the preflop
raise<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.539> three<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> aggression<00:00:58.469> factor

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
raise and three is the aggression factor

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
raise and three is the aggression factor
so<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> will<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.149> played<00:01:00.390> back<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> little

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so I will get played back out a little

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
so I will get played back out a little
bit<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.469> guy<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.129> like

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
bit from this guy but it's not like

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.140 
bit from this guy but it's not like
crazy<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> mean<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.510> might<00:01:03.690> consider

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
crazy you know I mean I might consider

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
crazy you know I mean I might consider
well<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> mean<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.830> hand<00:01:07.979> with

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
well I mean I'm this kind of hand with

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.219 
well I mean I'm this kind of hand with
King<00:01:08.310> 10<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.580> probably<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.479> fold<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
King 10 I'm probably not gonna fold it's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.410 
King 10 I'm probably not gonna fold it's
I<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.830> bit<00:01:11.010> too<00:01:11.189> strong<00:01:11.420> but

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I think it's a little bit too strong but

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 
I think it's a little bit too strong but
I'm<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.750> gonna<00:01:12.900> worry<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.830> rank

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
I'm not really gonna worry about I rank

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.410 
I'm not really gonna worry about I rank
too<00:01:14.400> much<00:01:14.580> until<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.030> three<00:01:15.180> about<00:01:15.330> is

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
too much until it's three about is

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
too much until it's three about is
approaching<00:01:15.869> about<00:01:15.960> 10%<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.950> 6%<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.700> fairly

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
approaching about 10% so 6% is fairly

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.679 
approaching about 10% so 6% is fairly
normal<00:01:18.299> still<00:01:18.750> four<00:01:19.040> for<00:01:20.040> full<00:01:20.340> ring<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
mention look at the the stack size

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.139 
mention look at the the stack size
before<00:01:52.890> anything<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> hand<00:01:53.670> he's<00:01:53.850> only<00:01:54.000> got

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
before anything in a hand he's only got

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.660 
before anything in a hand he's only got
10<00:01:54.329> bucks<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.810> 40<00:01:55.710> big<00:01:55.860> ones<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.280> that's<00:01:56.960> will

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
10 bucks or 40 big ones so that's will

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.679 
10 bucks or 40 big ones so that's will
definitely<00:01:59.670> affect<00:01:59.939> how<00:02:00.240> we're<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> put

definitely affect how we're going to put

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.580 
definitely affect how we're going to put
him<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.610> we<00:02:02.610> make<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> three<00:02:03.570> times<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.320> blind

the Reg does folds and the the

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.550 
the Reg does folds and the the

recreational player in the big blind

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.360

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
calls so go to the flop we don't really

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.610 
calls so go to the flop we don't really
flop<00:02:22.670> anything<00:02:23.239> he<00:02:23.689> does<00:02:23.840> check<00:02:24.079> to<00:02:24.230> us<00:02:24.260> though

flop anything he does check to us though

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.679 
flop anything he does check to us though
and<00:02:25.219> it's<00:02:25.879> pretty<00:02:26.060> much<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.359> gonna<00:02:26.450> be<00:02:26.659> a

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
and it's pretty much just gonna be a

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.360 
and it's pretty much just gonna be a
standard<00:02:27.170> C<00:02:27.349> bet<00:02:27.530> for<00:02:27.739> me<00:02:27.829> in<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.099> spot<00:02:28.310> I

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
standard C bet for me in this spot I

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.899 
standard C bet for me in this spot I
think<00:02:28.609> that<00:02:30.219> yeah<00:02:31.219> there's<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> lot<00:02:31.609> of<00:02:31.760> hands

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
think that yeah there's a lot of hands

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.089 
think that yeah there's a lot of hands
that<00:02:32.120> he<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.329> have<00:02:32.510> that's<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:33.260> don't<00:02:33.980> know<00:02:34.040> if

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
that he can have that's I don't know if

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.699 
that he can have that's I don't know if
there's<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.370> lot<00:02:34.639> that<00:02:34.819> we're<00:02:34.969> still<00:02:35.269> ahead<00:02:35.359> of

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
there's a lot that we're still ahead of

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.819 
there's a lot that we're still ahead of
um<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:37.459> he's<00:02:37.549> gonna<00:02:37.730> call<00:02:38.000> with<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:38.829> you

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
um that he's gonna call with but you

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.379 
um that he's gonna call with but you
know<00:02:39.859> I<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.040> think<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.790> know<00:02:40.909> it's

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
know I just think that you know it's

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.809 
know I just think that you know it's
just<00:02:41.620> basically<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.739> standard<00:02:43.040> C<00:02:43.400> bet<00:02:43.609> we're

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
just basically a standard C bet we're

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.610 
just basically a standard C bet we're
gonna<00:02:43.879> take<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.329> down<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> fair<00:02:45.169> amount<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
gonna take it down a fair amount of the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.289 
gonna take it down a fair amount of the
time<00:02:45.799> we<00:02:46.040> still<00:02:46.250> got<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.639> overs

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
time we still got to overs

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.699 
time we still got to overs
you<00:02:47.389> know<00:02:47.480> if<00:02:47.659> he<00:02:47.750> does<00:02:47.930> call<00:02:48.169> we<00:02:48.379> could<00:02:48.560> hit

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
you know if he does call we could hit

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.610 
you know if he does call we could hit
some<00:02:48.919> on<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.159> turn<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:50.780> just<00:02:51.260> think<00:02:51.409> it's<00:02:51.530> a

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
some on the turn I just think it's a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.399 
some on the turn I just think it's a
much<00:02:51.859> better<00:02:52.099> decision<00:02:52.909> than<00:02:53.120> than<00:02:53.989> checking

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
much better decision than than checking

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.259 
much better decision than than checking
back<00:02:54.590> versus<00:02:55.159> a<00:02:55.189> player<00:02:55.489> who's<00:02:55.699> playing<00:02:56.000> half

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
back versus a player who's playing half

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.409 
back versus a player who's playing half

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.589 
spike our top pair on the turn which is
good<00:03:39.379> and<00:03:39.650> he<00:03:40.370> decides<00:03:40.729> to<00:03:40.849> check<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.209> us<00:03:41.299> again

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
good and he decides to check to us again

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.080 
good and he decides to check to us again
so<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.519> kind<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.819> a<00:03:43.939> spot<00:03:44.239> where<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:47.030> know

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
so this is kind of a spot where you know

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.729 
so this is kind of a spot where you know
I<00:03:47.120> might<00:03:47.329> consider<00:03:47.780> slowing<00:03:48.259> down<00:03:48.409> against

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
I might consider slowing down against

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.849 
I might consider slowing down against
some<00:03:48.919> other<00:03:49.069> players<00:03:49.400> but<00:03:49.849> I<00:03:50.150> think<00:03:50.989> in<00:03:51.379> this

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
some other players but I think in this

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.879 
some other players but I think in this
spot<00:03:52.189> it's<00:03:52.579> pretty<00:03:53.120> much<00:03:53.419> just<00:03:53.479> a<00:03:54.229> guaranteed

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
spot it's pretty much just a guaranteed

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.689 
spot it's pretty much just a guaranteed
bet<00:03:55.280> for<00:03:55.549> value<00:03:55.579> against<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.689> player<00:03:56.870> who's<00:03:57.259> got

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
bet for value against a player who's got

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.599 
bet for value against a player who's got
arranged<00:03:58.699> this<00:03:58.909> wide<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:01.219> know<00:04:01.340> kind<00:04:01.579> of

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
arranged this wide and you know kind of

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.189 
arranged this wide and you know kind of
the<00:04:01.699> good<00:04:01.849> thing<00:04:02.030> about<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.389> hand<00:04:02.599> is<00:04:02.840> like

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
the good thing about this hand is like

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.199 
the good thing about this hand is like
we<00:04:03.829> can't<00:04:04.069> really<00:04:04.159> get<00:04:04.459> check<00:04:04.669> rays<00:04:04.909> big

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
we can't really get check rays big

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.699 
we can't really get check rays big
because<00:04:05.509> he<00:04:05.629> doesn't<00:04:05.780> have<00:04:06.019> much<00:04:06.229> of<00:04:06.259> a<00:04:06.439> stack

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
because he doesn't have much of a stack

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.209 
because he doesn't have much of a stack
so<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:08.060> plan<00:04:08.269> here<00:04:08.299> will<00:04:08.689> just<00:04:08.959> be<00:04:09.169> to<00:04:09.469> to<00:04:10.039> bet

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:10.219 
so the plan here will just be to to bet

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.909 
so the plan here will just be to to bet
the<00:04:10.370> turn<00:04:10.579> and<00:04:10.909> to<00:04:11.180> call<00:04:11.509> any<00:04:11.930> kind<00:04:12.229> of<00:04:12.289> show<00:04:12.560> or

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
the turn and to call any kind of show or

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.520 
the turn and to call any kind of show or
anything<00:04:13.099> like<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:14.750> we<00:04:15.019> do<00:04:15.139> bad<00:04:15.289> about

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
anything like that so we do bad about

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.140 
anything like that so we do bad about
two-thirds<00:04:15.889> spot<00:04:16.070> again<00:04:16.310> on<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> turn<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:16.969> he

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
two-thirds spot again on the turn and he

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.510 
two-thirds spot again on the turn and he
does<00:04:17.329> actually<00:04:17.690> go<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.099> indeed<00:04:19.099> go<00:04:19.340> into

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
does actually go and indeed go into

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.980 
does actually go and indeed go into
shoves<00:04:22.520> all<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.729> money<00:04:22.909> and<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.509> mean<00:04:23.900> I've

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
shoves all the money and so I mean I've

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.929 
shoves all the money and so I mean I've
talked<00:04:24.199> about<00:04:24.349> before<00:04:24.469> in<00:04:25.310> several<00:04:25.669> videos

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:25.939 
talked about before in several videos

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.230 
talked about before in several videos
previous<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.449> this<00:04:26.599> that<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:28.520> check<00:04:28.879> raised<00:04:29.090> on

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
previous to this that a check raised on

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.260 
previous to this that a check raised on
the<00:04:29.330> turn<00:04:29.539> is<00:04:29.840> often<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.740> nuts<00:04:30.919> but<00:04:31.460> in<00:04:32.150> a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
the turn is often the nuts but in a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.570 
the turn is often the nuts but in a
situation<00:04:32.870> like<00:04:32.900> this<00:04:33.469> it's<00:04:33.979> quite<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.400> bit

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
situation like this it's quite a bit

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.360 
situation like this it's quite a bit
different<00:04:34.969> because<00:04:35.090> we're<00:04:35.419> against<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:36.370> very

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
different because we're against a very

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.029 
different because we're against a very
short<00:04:37.699> stacked<00:04:37.999> opponent<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:38.689> I<00:04:39.620> think<00:04:39.860> in<00:04:39.979> a

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
short stacked opponent and I think in a

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.219 
short stacked opponent and I think in a
spot<00:04:40.340> like<00:04:40.370> this<00:04:40.580> it's<00:04:41.029> kind<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.419> like<00:04:41.479> if<00:04:41.900> he

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
spot like this it's kind of like if he

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.129 
spot like this it's kind of like if he
can<00:04:42.439> beat<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.979> mean<00:04:43.249> we<00:04:43.370> have<00:04:43.520> taught<00:04:43.759> pare

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
can beat I mean we have taught pare

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.659 
can beat I mean we have taught pare
almost<00:04:45.139> all<00:04:45.319> top<00:04:45.770> kicker<00:04:46.009> at<00:04:46.219> this<00:04:46.340> point<00:04:46.550> I

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
almost all top kicker at this point I

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.070 
almost all top kicker at this point I
mean<00:04:46.759> if<00:04:46.909> he<00:04:47.029> can<00:04:47.210> beat<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:47.419> it's<00:04:47.749> just<00:04:47.900> kind

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
mean if he can beat that it's just kind

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.809 
mean if he can beat that it's just kind
of<00:04:48.110> like<00:04:48.259> good<00:04:48.469> for<00:04:48.620> him<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.800> know<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.310> it's

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
of like good for him you know and it's

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.629 
of like good for him you know and it's
likely<00:04:50.029> we<00:04:50.300> do<00:04:50.479> have<00:04:50.629> outs<00:04:50.840> in<00:04:51.050> this<00:04:51.169> spot<00:04:51.639> and

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
likely we do have outs in this spot and

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.670 
likely we do have outs in this spot and
with<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.479> short<00:04:53.750> stacked<00:04:54.050> opponent<00:04:54.560> like<00:04:54.650> this

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
with a short stacked opponent like this

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.189 
with a short stacked opponent like this
I<00:04:55.069> think<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:55.550> I<00:04:56.330> think<00:04:56.779> that<00:04:56.900> they<00:04:57.020> will

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
I think that I think that they will

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.950 
I think that I think that they will
freak<00:04:57.710> out<00:04:57.889> with<00:04:58.250> some<00:04:58.580> dumb<00:04:59.060> crap<00:04:59.479> from<00:04:59.750> time

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
freak out with some dumb crap from time

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.629 
freak out with some dumb crap from time
to<00:05:00.139> time<00:05:00.169> as<00:05:00.500> well<00:05:00.529> because<00:05:00.919> they're<00:05:01.400> just

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
to time as well because they're just

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.390 
to time as well because they're just
kind<00:05:01.849> of<00:05:01.909> feel<00:05:02.509> like<00:05:02.539> they're<00:05:02.870> pocketed<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.680> I

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
kind of feel like they're pocketed and I

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.459 
kind of feel like they're pocketed and I
believe<00:05:04.699> that's<00:05:04.849> actually<00:05:05.240> what<00:05:05.449> did<00:05:06.080> happen

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
believe that's actually what did happen

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.529 
believe that's actually what did happen
in<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.680> sounds<00:05:07.099> is<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.610> he<00:05:08.060> was<00:05:08.210> in<00:05:08.360> there

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
in the sounds is that he was in there

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.749 
in the sounds is that he was in there
was<00:05:08.659> some<00:05:08.810> nonsense<00:05:09.259> yeah<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:10.779> I<00:05:11.779> think<00:05:12.229> that<00:05:12.759> I

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
was some nonsense yeah so I think that I

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.249 
was some nonsense yeah so I think that I
hope<00:05:13.969> this<00:05:14.180> M<00:05:14.330> was<00:05:14.479> Illustrated<00:05:14.960> for<00:05:15.020> you<00:05:15.110> guys

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
hope this M was Illustrated for you guys

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.939 
hope this M was Illustrated for you guys
I<00:05:15.529> think<00:05:15.740> that<00:05:15.949> versus<00:05:16.729> short<00:05:16.939> stacks<00:05:17.949> you

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
I think that versus short stacks you

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.679 
I think that versus short stacks you
know<00:05:19.069> you've<00:05:19.400> kind<00:05:19.819> of<00:05:19.909> got<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.089> throw<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.659> the

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
know you've kind of got to throw the the

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.499 
know you've kind of got to throw the the
hole<00:05:21.169> he's<00:05:22.159> always<00:05:22.400> got<00:05:22.699> a<00:05:22.729> monster<00:05:23.240> when<00:05:23.449> you

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
hole he's always got a monster when you

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.850 
hole he's always got a monster when you
get<00:05:23.659> check<00:05:23.870> raised<00:05:24.110> on<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.379> turn<00:05:24.560> out<00:05:24.710> the

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
get check raised on the turn out the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.100 
get check raised on the turn out the
window<00:05:25.159> a<00:05:25.189> little<00:05:25.370> bit<00:05:25.669> they<00:05:26.539> will<00:05:26.719> have<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:26.900> big

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
window a little bit they will have a big

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.510
