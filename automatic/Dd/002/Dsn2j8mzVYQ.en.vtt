00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.209 
he says he took one of his best images
well<00:02:03.540> he<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> Midas<00:02:04.380> muffler<00:02:04.680> shop

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
well he was at a Midas muffler shop

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.510 
well he was at a Midas muffler shop
which<00:02:06.030> i<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> great<00:02:06.719> example<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:08.099> how

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
which i think is a great example of how

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.450 
which i think is a great example of how
you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.849> find<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.509> subject<00:02:10.440> anywhere

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
you can find a subject anywhere

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.940 
you can find a subject anywhere
I<00:02:11.520> think<00:02:12.420> showing<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.870> work<00:02:13.110> again<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.650> out

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I think showing this work again and out

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.580 
I think showing this work again and out
of<00:02:14.160> its<00:02:14.310> original<00:02:14.820> context<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.350> good

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
of its original context is it's a good

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.280 
of its original context is it's a good
thing<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:17.480> interesting<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:19.020> sort<00:02:19.200> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
thing it's interesting to sort of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.490 
thing it's interesting to sort of
reconsider<00:02:19.970> whatever<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.210> 35<00:02:21.720> years<00:02:22.140> later

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
reconsider whatever it is 35 years later

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.090 
reconsider whatever it is 35 years later
you<00:02:23.280> know<00:02:23.370> what<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.700> work<00:02:23.970> means<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.660> maybe

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
you know what this work means and maybe

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.790 
you know what this work means and maybe
it<00:02:26.100> could<00:02:26.250> allow<00:02:26.520> us<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.630> see<00:02:27.840> different<00:02:28.590> lines

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
it could allow us to see different lines

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.700 
it could allow us to see different lines
of<00:02:29.010> influence<00:02:29.550> maybe<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.530> move<00:02:31.530> had

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
of influence maybe that the move had

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.130 
of influence maybe that the move had
been<00:02:31.830> obscured<00:02:32.280> certain<00:02:32.790> figures<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.390> taking

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
been obscured certain figures of taking

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.170 
been obscured certain figures of taking
pictures<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.530> were<00:02:35.000> important<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.060> other

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
pictures that were important to other

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.550 
pictures that were important to other
photographers<00:02:36.870> maybe<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.290> are<00:02:37.320> very

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
photographers maybe that are very

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.960 
photographers maybe that are very
prominent<00:02:38.010> now<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:39.410> weren't<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.530> clear

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
prominent now that weren't so clear

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:50.230 
prominent now that weren't so clear
before

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240
