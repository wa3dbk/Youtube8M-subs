00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.960
 beauty galera dedicates here today would be 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.700
 make another video 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 good people today he teaches how 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.199
 use the basic tutorial staff there 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.970
 but that some people have not yet 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.449
 understand very well how it is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.580
 uses UPyD controlling and jots 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.740
 among others, are personal 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.359
 so I made this drawing here pretty bad 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.510
 made a poorly done sketch and with the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.700
 upe of my parent company but it will 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.090
 apply any other if you play 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.899
 Equator The Staff Same Good Principle 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.899
 the buttons we have are on the middle 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.020
 it means behind 2 x 0 forward and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.000
 putting high the next hulk more 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.520
 inexpensive staff or manual where the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.070
 people are going to use the im and alt buttons 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.090
 when using the personal button when 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.920
 tighten im 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.800
 I 'm going to set loop start point 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.439
 oauth the end point in the club after 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.790
 pressing the audi the top lights 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.860
 automatically tell you that the club is 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.439
 It's on but you actually dialed 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.970
 here manually staffed yet 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.240
 Thank you you can for just clicking. 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.759
 in the middle button is behind you 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 to decrease sizes or by half 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.240
 today 2x you will double the size 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.070
 of its staff increased and increased it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.710
 has double or that you decrease 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.869
 by half you have increased twice as much 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 southern size 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.070
 some if controllers have a dj 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.020
 High automatic upe I sit here 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.189
 the amount you want to use 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 can be from one eighth with 16 students and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.250
 one 32 1 64 very small even up to 4 8 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.530
 16 are the most used in the personnel 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.710
 so god's just right here years 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.960
 and press the I say it personal and some 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.280
 buyers is still just a little more 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 sophisticated how we push the button 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.430
 holding the game through the gil that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.470
 is the disk we have in ccj for the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.830
 stj 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.280
 we can change the beginning of hupe the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.690
 end of the staff say here to stay 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.520
 bigger for you to understand better 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.610
 but now let's go to the practical part 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.820
 where I will demonstrate in my parent company 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.520
 that's all for you, let's just pump it 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.700
 so let's now go to the practical part 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.500
 of the bago among its business staff is 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.290
 the following I'll give you a little bit here in 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.510
 our neighbors music or click on the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.220
 end but who the small potential to 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.830
 Last burn end point in your account 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.760
 if you can see if it goes a little wrong but 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.590
 no problem 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.860
 then I started to feel an 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.290
 indicate that ours is working 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.930
 turn off the other simply appears 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:58.340
 again soon mark a little way 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:03.110
 more right now I could only score more 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.120
 I fought as you can see who was more 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.880
 slow just there with a little better 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.110
 So who is starting a fight to 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.700
 last final 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.220
 then put it on simply 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.120
 Here he squeezes in the middle as he went to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.000
 you 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.370
 close to new in a new half 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.970
 half for inventing the team is still in the 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.310
 half and until very small and if I 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:34.050
 who 2 x increase in size of it 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:35.160
 we begged half and bon jovi tirol and 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.560
 goal 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.480
 the people now here you are not going to me 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.050
 see but the teams and such any size 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.080
 one not to automatically personal tupi 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.760
 do not need to compensate very 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.209
 here for the size of four and when 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.840
 I do simply press on 234 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.599
 you can see 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.650
 pressed and how had that button that was 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.540
 same way halfway through half of the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.790
 so here in high luxury I also need 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.000
 with whom I want the size of a month and 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:14.400
 implement tightening will stay in eighth and 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.900
 will normally run staff and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.600
 now he is to show you what 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.430
 happens in this in something that we can 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.620
 cite the beginning with the end 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.760
 good staff where it is produced 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.190
 no matter if I press here 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.280
 noto lupi I will quote manually as 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.370
 you can see putting the furniture only 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.539
 even hit the club is here you have 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.770
 this group just click here to alter it 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.410
 in the team it was only to see that I go and 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.720
 decreasing the size of the core goes 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.169
 Turning the game I even get very 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.169
 small 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:55.239
 at that time the zone of the road is tightening 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.349
 the im 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:02.349
 I'm going to sit at the beginning in Ukraine only 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.860
 who also comes back is simply the same 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.860
 game 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.199
 as you can see, it 's basically 

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:09.909
 that 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.789
 the group function is very simple even 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.259
 but it's always good, it's complicated for who 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.829
 I did not know some functions to know 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.419
 now and who does not know how to use 

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:22.149
 Use it now, right? 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.159
 so basically this is just too much 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:26.860
 thank you to watch the video servers 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.449
 that since I liked the favorite being 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.610
 a channel has signed up not to lose 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.069
 videos and that's it, it's just a 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.069
 Doubt your prayer today is just that. 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.379
 even with the ball I bring more news 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.139
 for you, just a hug to everyone and 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:45.360
 until the next good person comes out and it is 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.360
 that 's what it said today I went
