00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
this place it looks good for a trap and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.110 
this place it looks good for a trap and
would<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:26.310> mortal<00:02:27.310> trap<00:02:28.650> I'm<00:02:29.650> going<00:02:29.980> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
would not a mortal trap I'm going to

would not a mortal trap I'm going to
build<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.560> confusion<00:02:32.560> trap<00:02:33.840> let's<00:02:34.840> see<00:02:35.170> what

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
build in confusion trap let's see what

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.890 
build in confusion trap let's see what
point<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.579> that<00:02:36.700> point<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.269> soon<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> these

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900
