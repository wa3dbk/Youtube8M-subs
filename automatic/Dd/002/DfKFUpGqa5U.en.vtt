brush that's flatpoint medium stiff is

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
brush that's flatpoint medium stiff is
it<00:00:53.670> kind<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> resembles<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.719> bit<00:00:54.809> more

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it kind of resembles a little bit more

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.380 
it kind of resembles a little bit more
of<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> sharpie<00:00:56.309> marker

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
of what you do with the sharpie marker

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
of what you do with the sharpie marker
rather<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> circles<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
rather than just one of the circles that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
rather than just one of the circles that
will<00:00:59.160> look<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> generic<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:01.140> I'm

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
will look kind of generic and then I'm

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
will look kind of generic and then I'm
going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> size<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.739> way<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:04.010> I'm<00:01:05.010> just

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280

going to choose a black paint here and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
going to choose a black paint here and
now<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.460> my<00:01:11.670> signature

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
with the mouth and this is going to kind

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
with the mouth and this is going to kind
of<00:01:17.040> look<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> doctor<00:01:17.880> signature<00:01:18.390> here

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
of look like a doctor signature here

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.120 
of look like a doctor signature here
it'll<00:01:19.020> take<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> couple<00:01:19.409> tries<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.040> it
