the<00:03:44.950> wisps<00:03:45.400> we<00:03:45.819> know<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.450> her<00:03:46.540> first

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the wisps we know that her first

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.530 
the wisps we know that her first
encounter<00:03:46.900> with<00:03:47.380> mordioux<00:03:48.069> ended<00:03:49.060> with<00:03:49.269> her

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
encounter with mordioux ended with her

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.530 
encounter with mordioux ended with her
turning<00:03:50.019> into<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.319> monstrous<00:03:50.920> bear<00:03:51.540> buddy

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
turning into a monstrous bear buddy

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.020 
turning into a monstrous bear buddy
regresses<00:03:53.170> now<00:03:53.620> she<00:03:54.069> probably<00:03:54.340> wanted<00:03:54.970> to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
regresses now she probably wanted to

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.059 
regresses now she probably wanted to
turn<00:03:55.299> him<00:03:55.420> into<00:03:55.569> a<00:03:55.690> bear<00:03:56.019> because<00:03:56.350> solely

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
turn him into a bear because solely

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.520 
turn him into a bear because solely
resembles<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.090> bear<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.630> she<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.049> still<00:03:59.260> trying

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
resembles a bear and she is still trying

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.870 
resembles a bear and she is still trying
to<00:03:59.590> figure<00:03:59.799> out<00:03:59.980> why<00:04:00.220> Sully

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
to figure out why Sully

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.140 
to figure out why Sully
is<00:04:01.060> what<00:04:01.480> he<00:04:01.569> is<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.230> where<00:04:03.160> he<00:04:03.310> comes<00:04:03.549> from

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
is what he is and where he comes from

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.960 
is what he is and where he comes from
does<00:04:04.359> Boo<00:04:04.540> ever<00:04:04.720> find<00:04:05.049> Sully<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:06.639> to<00:04:06.760> think

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
does Boo ever find Sully I like to think

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.349 
does Boo ever find Sully I like to think
so

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
so

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.229 
so
he<00:04:08.019> surely<00:04:08.579> reunited<00:04:09.579> with<00:04:09.790> her<00:04:09.970> at<00:04:10.090> least

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
he surely reunited with her at least

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.690 
he surely reunited with her at least
once<00:04:10.630> as<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.870> child<00:04:11.230> at<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:12.010> end<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.340> Monsters

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
once as a child at the end of Monsters

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.670 
once as a child at the end of Monsters
Inc<00:04:12.880> but<00:04:13.299> eventually<00:04:13.540> he<00:04:14.170> had<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.410> stop

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
Inc but eventually he had to stop

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.819 
Inc but eventually he had to stop
visiting<00:04:14.950> but<00:04:15.790> her<00:04:16.120> love<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.750> Sully<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.260> after

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
visiting but her love for Sully is after

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.649 
visiting but her love for Sully is after
all<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.160> crux<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.820> entire<00:04:19.150> Pixar

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
all the crux of the entire Pixar

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.200 
all the crux of the entire Pixar
universe<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:20.709> love<00:04:20.979> of<00:04:21.190> different<00:04:21.640> people<00:04:21.970> of

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
universe the love of different people of

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.670 
universe the love of different people of
different<00:04:22.659> ages<00:04:22.810> and

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
different ages and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.340 
different ages and
even<00:04:24.039> different<00:04:24.610> species<00:04:25.030> finding<00:04:25.990> ways<00:04:26.139> to

even different species finding ways to

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.219 
even different species finding ways to
live<00:04:26.500> on<00:04:26.620> earth<00:04:26.800> without<00:04:27.070> destroying<00:04:27.639> it

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
live on earth without destroying it

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.100 
live on earth without destroying it
because<00:04:29.229> of<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.410> lust<00:04:29.620> for<00:04:30.070> energy<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.810> is

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
because of a lust for energy and that is

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.670 
because of a lust for energy and that is
the<00:04:32.380> Pixar<00:04:32.919> theory<00:04:33.720> now<00:04:34.720> more<00:04:35.139> will<00:04:35.350> be<00:04:35.470> added

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
the Pixar theory now more will be added

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.300 
the Pixar theory now more will be added
to<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.930> when<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.080> next<00:04:38.350> Pixar<00:04:38.710> movie<00:04:39.009> the<00:04:39.130> good

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
to it when the next Pixar movie the good

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.730 
to it when the next Pixar movie the good
dinosaur<00:04:39.789> comes<00:04:40.030> out<00:04:40.150> in<00:04:40.240> 2014<00:04:40.660> but<00:04:41.440> until

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
dinosaur comes out in 2014 but until

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.740 
dinosaur comes out in 2014 but until
then<00:04:41.919> not<00:04:42.160> much<00:04:42.490> about<00:04:42.789> it<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.120> really<00:04:43.360> known

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
then not much about it is really known

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.590 
then not much about it is really known
so<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.740> can't<00:04:45.370> really<00:04:46.080> expect<00:04:47.080> anything<00:04:47.410> more

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
so you can't really expect anything more

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.439 
so you can't really expect anything more
now<00:04:49.600> again<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.199> will<00:04:50.530> link<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:51.220> original<00:04:51.449> blog

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
now again I will link the original blog

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.200 
now again I will link the original blog
post<00:04:52.810> down<00:04:53.110> below<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.860> description

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
post down below in the description

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.550 
post down below in the description
because<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.330> is<00:04:55.419> not<00:04:55.570> my<00:04:55.690> content<00:04:56.139> but<00:04:56.530> I

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
because it is not my content but I

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.719 
because it is not my content but I
figured<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.919> lot<00:04:57.039> of<00:04:57.160> people<00:04:57.400> don't<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:57.669> to

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
figured a lot of people don't like to

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.580 
figured a lot of people don't like to
actually<00:04:58.090> read<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.660> watching<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.229> video<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.530> a

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
actually read and watching a video is a

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.469 
actually read and watching a video is a
little<00:04:59.830> bit<00:04:59.949> more<00:05:00.160> interesting<00:05:00.669> so<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.120> figured

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
little bit more interesting so I figured

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.620 
little bit more interesting so I figured
I<00:05:01.539> would<00:05:01.570> go<00:05:01.810> ahead<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.259> make<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.940> video<00:05:03.940> on<00:05:04.150> it

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
I would go ahead and make a video on it

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.210 
I would go ahead and make a video on it
so<00:05:05.259> thank<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:06.039> john<00:05:06.520> Negroni<00:05:07.419> for<00:05:08.349> posting
