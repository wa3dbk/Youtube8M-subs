00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.800
 niche form 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.870
 I will try to craft 10 items something 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:29.780
 so i bought the cheapest drop for 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.340
 start what comes out of it like this 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.190
 selected 10 items 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.960
 since I can not see everything 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:44.600
 button and click exchange exits the contract 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 our rank so subscribe as it were 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.180
 sent them a contract see what he told us 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.230
 will give a sandy hatch come on 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.230
 something like that 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 good ak-47 african mesh 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.590
 I would pskov well that is, out of 10 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:20.380
 items 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:20.380
 we have crafted an African net here 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:34.520
 watch it here it is the African grid 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:39.119
 fell that is so an hour after the field 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.149
 so right now classen sell and on the grass 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.079
 the site now I will look there it will be visible 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.079
 it will be generally cool 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:59.609
 towards 026 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:02:03.969
 I spent on craft honestly say 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.670
 it was 0 3 Art Well, take 040 to dollars 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:14.739
 i.e 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:19.569
 more expensive than what I got I took 10 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:24.160
 items at 0 40 and it turned out 06 that is 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.849
 unprofitable craft I certainly do not know 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.799
 plainly 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.030
 as in this there is a certain recipe for 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.849
 knife certain things roll out 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.640
 defined there and you are bob or ak-47 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:43.480
 laminate is what I was told there and 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.310
 watching videos on youtube how to craft the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:52.510
 certain things to shower and only 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:57.010
 then will this or that weapon's 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.650
 honestly easier and easier to open the box 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.660
 because in general to buy because I scrub 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.870
 can you anything fly maybe 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.230
 you talk to let's say like me 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.040
 Well, let's say the magician I already have myself 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.049
 I bought the author, he would not need it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.599
 yes and sell sense and drives something like me 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.169
 went to minus on principle this is the first 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.799
 craft 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:25.090
