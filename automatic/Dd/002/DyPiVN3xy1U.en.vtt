could<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.530> another<00:01:22.920> plot<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.790> they

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
could be like another plot and they

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
could be like another plot and they
might<00:01:24.659> introduce<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.500> later<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> movies

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
but I highly doubt that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.319 
but I highly doubt that
but<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> mean<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:32.490> could<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.030> mean<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
but the but I mean it could I mean I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.789 
but the but I mean it could I mean I
just<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.200> that's<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
just really don't know that's really the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
just really don't know that's really the
only<00:01:34.890> app<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.400> think<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
only app I can think of like is that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.690 
only app I can think of like is that
he's<00:01:37.079> gonna<00:01:37.200> meet<00:01:37.500> his<00:01:37.650> dad<00:01:38.869> or<00:01:39.869> either<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
he's gonna meet his dad or either at the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
he's gonna meet his dad or either at the
reason<00:01:41.700> app<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.970> travel<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.450> come<00:01:42.630> across<00:01:42.899> him

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
reason app to travel and come across him

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.969 
reason app to travel and come across him
either<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:45.530> but<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.770> really

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
either like that but I'm not really

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.550 
either like that but I'm not really
entirely<00:01:47.250> sure<00:01:48.409> they<00:01:49.409> keep<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.860> either<00:01:49.950> way

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.960 
really don't know I mean probably know
it's<00:02:15.470> be<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:16.120> like<00:02:17.120> another<00:02:17.510> psychotic<00:02:18.110> enemy

it's be a like another psychotic enemy
psychotic<00:02:19.970> Rhino<00:02:20.210> tiger<00:02:21.080> or<00:02:21.140> something<00:02:21.530> like

psychotic Rhino tiger or something like
that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.610 
that
it'd<00:02:23.270> actually<00:02:23.300> be<00:02:23.600> pretty<00:02:23.930> cool<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> see<00:02:24.350> its

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
it'd actually be pretty cool to see its

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.030 
it'd actually be pretty cool to see its
higher<00:02:24.800> as<00:02:25.100> an<00:02:25.250> enemy<00:02:26.710> actually<00:02:27.710> would<00:02:27.890> be

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
higher as an enemy actually would be

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.090 
higher as an enemy actually would be
pretty<00:02:28.250> cool<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.110> mean<00:02:30.290> there's<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.680> such

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
pretty cool but I mean there's like such

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.210 
pretty cool but I mean there's like such
a<00:02:31.130> far<00:02:31.460> range<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.910> enemies<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.750> can't<00:02:33.710> even<00:02:33.830> say

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.700 

wrongly<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.550> could<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.790> panda<00:02:38.710> but

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
wrongly know it could be a panda but

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.230 
wrongly know it could be a panda but
they<00:02:39.830> wouldn't<00:02:40.040> do<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.340> then<00:02:40.550> pretty<00:02:40.970> pretty

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
they wouldn't do that then pretty pretty

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.370 
they wouldn't do that then pretty pretty
sucky<00:02:43.510> you've<00:02:44.510> heard<00:02:44.660> any<00:02:44.810> interesting<00:02:45.320> you

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
know and and maybe for the third one

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.420 
know and and maybe for the third one
that<00:02:49.760> since<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.360> second<00:02:50.720> one<00:02:50.840> had<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.220> shin<00:02:52.220> as

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
that since the second one had a shin as

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.449 
that since the second one had a shin as
like<00:02:52.670> an<00:02:52.880> enemy<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.570> like<00:02:53.720> post<00:02:54.020> past<00:02:54.459> maybe

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
like an enemy of like post past maybe

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.740 
like an enemy of like post past maybe
they<00:02:55.580> could<00:02:55.730> do<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.180> third<00:02:56.390> one<00:02:56.600> of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
they could do that in the third one of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.170 
they could do that in the third one of
like<00:02:56.900> tigers<00:02:57.410> has<00:02:57.650> passed<00:02:57.940> because<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.000> mean<00:02:59.150> I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
like tigers has passed because I mean I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.860 
like tigers has passed because I mean I
know<00:02:59.300> people<00:02:59.390> say<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.140> on<00:03:01.240> her<00:03:02.240> parents<00:03:02.570> were

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
know people say that on her parents were

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.020 
know people say that on her parents were
killed<00:03:03.200> by<00:03:03.410> Tai<00:03:03.800> Lung<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.340> during<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.760> rage

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
killed by Tai Lung and during that rage

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.810 
killed by Tai Lung and during that rage
that<00:03:05.060> he<00:03:05.450> wasn't<00:03:05.630> chosen<00:03:05.930> as<00:03:06.200> Dragon<00:03:06.380> lawyer

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
that he wasn't chosen as Dragon lawyer

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.610 
that he wasn't chosen as Dragon lawyer
but<00:03:07.820> we<00:03:07.910> don't<00:03:08.090> know<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.240> for<00:03:09.110> sure

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
but we don't know that for sure

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.220 
but we don't know that for sure
I<00:03:09.670> think<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:10.970> know<00:03:11.180> we<00:03:11.450> didn't<00:03:11.720> hear<00:03:11.930> anything

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
I think we know we didn't hear anything

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.060 
I think we know we didn't hear anything
about<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:13.570> we're<00:03:14.570> just<00:03:14.690> assuming<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.260> but

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
about that we're just assuming that but

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.949 
about that we're just assuming that but
I<00:03:16.100> mean<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:17.030> with<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.480> guys<00:03:17.660> that's<00:03:17.870> a

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
I mean I I'm with you guys that's a

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.070 
I mean I I'm with you guys that's a
pretty<00:03:18.140> safe<00:03:18.380> assumption<00:03:19.959> but<00:03:20.959> it'd<00:03:21.050> be

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
pretty safe assumption but it'd be

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.199 
pretty safe assumption but it'd be
pretty<00:03:21.440> interesting<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.130> see<00:03:22.370> an<00:03:22.580> enemy<00:03:22.820> if

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
pretty interesting to see an enemy if

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.330 
pretty interesting to see an enemy if
that<00:03:23.870> wasn't<00:03:24.110> if<00:03:24.440> he<00:03:24.769> didn't<00:03:25.010> kill<00:03:25.190> her

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
that wasn't if he didn't kill her

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.800 
that wasn't if he didn't kill her
parents<00:03:26.200> but<00:03:27.200> whoever<00:03:27.470> didn't<00:03:28.480> showed<00:03:29.480> up<00:03:29.630> as

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
parents but whoever didn't showed up as

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.220 
parents but whoever didn't showed up as
an<00:03:29.959> enemy<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.440> third<00:03:30.650> one<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.810> way<00:03:33.050> we

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
an enemy and the third one that way we

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.979 
an enemy and the third one that way we
get<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.739> her<00:03:33.950> past<00:03:34.450> we<00:03:35.450> don't<00:03:35.600> we<00:03:35.870> don't

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
get to see her past we don't we don't

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.890 
get to see her past we don't we don't
got<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.230> big<00:03:36.440> insight<00:03:36.860> on<00:03:37.010> her<00:03:37.160> past<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:37.670> all

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
got a big insight on her past at all

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.240 
got a big insight on her past at all
except<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:38.930> secrets<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.800> Furious<00:03:40.160> Five

except for secrets of the Furious Five

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.050 
except for secrets of the Furious Five
and<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:41.600> really<00:03:41.810> doesn't<00:03:42.050> give<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.470> much

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
and that really doesn't give you a much

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.060 
and that really doesn't give you a much
insight<00:03:44.060> on<00:03:44.239> her<00:03:44.330> past<00:03:44.570> either<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:45.800> showing
