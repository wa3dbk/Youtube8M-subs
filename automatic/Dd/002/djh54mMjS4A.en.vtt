in your actual guild this game has no
in-game<00:03:09.750> auction<00:03:10.349> house<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:11.400> one<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.909> big

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
in-game auction house so one of the big

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.490 
in-game auction house so one of the big
parts<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.189> pvping<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.629> being<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.720> strong<00:03:15.900> PvP

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
parts of pvping and being a strong PvP

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.259 
parts of pvping and being a strong PvP
guild<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.220> when<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.519> take<00:03:17.819> over<00:03:18.829> a

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
guild is that when you take over a

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:30.760 
guild is that when you take over a
resource<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:22.010> PvP<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.549> claim<00:03:23.849> it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.570 

so<00:03:31.770> if<00:03:31.950> your<00:03:32.100> guild<00:03:32.370> claims<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:34.010> let's<00:03:35.010> say<00:03:35.160> keep

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
so if your guild claims a let's say keep

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.460 
so if your guild claims a let's say keep
then<00:03:36.000> your<00:03:36.180> chances<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.690> holding<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.350> that

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
then your chances of holding on to that

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.420 
then your chances of holding on to that
key<00:03:37.770> for<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.190> long<00:03:38.340> period<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.730> time<00:03:38.820> are<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.980> lot

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
key for a long period of time are a lot

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.190 
key for a long period of time are a lot
better<00:03:41.730> than<00:03:42.060> if<00:03:42.210> you've<00:03:42.360> just<00:03:42.540> got<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.780> lumber
