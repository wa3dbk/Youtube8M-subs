 while we see one single 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.169
 let's pop we will create 6 layers from this one with this goal of alcaraz 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.169
 the duplicate button 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.820
 a 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 this year his junk mail was captured with name

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
 change it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.200

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.510
 with this eta 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.870
 and in tenerife we ​​are going to make use of the tool 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.870
 of perspective and 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.410
 and now let's proceed 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 the inquina the image 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 in this way 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.510
 then we enter formal sac can be modified we go to the next 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 we do the same thing only this time we can imagine a little more 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.230
 transforming and we move on to the next 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.220
 transform and we move on to the next 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.220
 we are always walking a little bit more 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.600
 stop it can generate in effect 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 of the movement 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.190
 we pass is the following 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190
 maybe it's a little more 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 and finally 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.879
 that we have all the images 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.689
 we can pier at least filter 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 and within animation 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.959
 reproduction 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.739
 all right 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.239

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.119
 as we have in effect 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.579
 that is elevating the image 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.579
 that what you have to do now is to know the answer 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.389
 come on file I can see how 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.389
 the task we are going to put as name 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.259
 animated wolf 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.639
 some point 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.979
 acasiete the only one that csif for the system to realize that this strike 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 mohsén animation click on save 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.329
 Vapors is four months if we create 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.689
 if we want to place a large mass we say yes 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.269
 in export 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.049

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.609
 and as for the brand and image 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.609
 impasable do not know the 150 milliseconds 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 let's see how it was 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.629
 we never have my image 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.629
