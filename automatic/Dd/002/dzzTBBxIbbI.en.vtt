00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
difficult you already have so if you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.820 
difficult you already have so if you
have<00:02:56.850> iOS<00:02:57.240> sdk<00:02:57.690> 3.2<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.320> already<00:02:58.650> have

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
developer utilities so since everyone

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.980 
developer utilities so since everyone
has<00:03:04.020> four<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.800> guess<00:03:05.400> if<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.270> already<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.840> it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
has four I guess if you already have it

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.520 
has four I guess if you already have it
I<00:03:07.140> say<00:03:08.010> continue<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.780> then<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.900> says<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
I say continue and then it says the

check this status it keeps on modifying

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.850 
check this status it keeps on modifying
depending<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.180> what<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.680> will

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
app status is waiting for upload then it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.780 
app status is waiting for upload then it
was<00:03:22.080> waiting<00:03:22.350> for<00:03:22.530> upload<00:03:22.860> now<00:03:24.080> let's<00:03:25.080> look<00:03:25.290> at

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
was waiting for upload now let's look at

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.490 
was waiting for upload now let's look at
something<00:03:26.790> else<00:03:27.030> what<00:03:27.240> else<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:28.080> once<00:03:28.290> it's

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
something else what else so once it's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.470 
something else what else so once it's
subway<00:03:29.010> ting<00:03:29.160> for<00:03:29.190> upload<00:03:29.580> now<00:03:29.760> I'll<00:03:30.000> open

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
subway ting for upload now I'll open

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.520 
subway ting for upload now I'll open
application<00:03:31.410> loader<00:03:32.360> ok<00:03:33.360> application<00:03:34.290> loader

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
application loader ok application loader

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.840 
application loader ok application loader
so<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.520> is<00:03:35.550> create<00:03:35.970> an<00:03:36.060> idea<00:03:36.480> no<00:03:37.410> no<00:03:37.680> wait<00:03:38.160> IPS

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
so this is create an idea no no wait IPS

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.690 
so this is create an idea no no wait IPS
value<00:03:39.180> different<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.110> when<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.320> go<00:03:41.280> here<00:03:41.490> it

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
value different so when I go here it

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.970 
value different so when I go here it
will<00:03:41.820> say<00:03:42.000> no<00:03:42.120> eligible<00:03:42.860> applications<00:03:43.860> were

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
will say no eligible applications were

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.920 
will say no eligible applications were
found<00:03:44.250> by<00:03:44.400> because<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.790> am<00:03:45.090> probably<00:03:45.360> signed<00:03:45.750> in

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
found by because I am probably signed in

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.370 
found by because I am probably signed in
as<00:03:46.140> someone<00:03:46.470> else<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.580> what<00:03:47.760> i<00:03:47.790> will<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.240> is<00:03:48.450> to

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
as someone else so what i will do is to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.920 
as someone else so what i will do is to
do<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.940> since<00:03:50.940> i<00:03:51.060> use<00:03:51.210> different<00:03:51.540> accounts

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
do this since i use different accounts

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.040 
do this since i use different accounts
and<00:03:52.110> i<00:03:52.260> upload<00:03:52.890> apps<00:03:53.160> different<00:03:53.790> accounts<00:03:54.210> it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
and i upload apps different accounts it

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.720 
and i upload apps different accounts it
will<00:03:55.350> always<00:03:55.500> show<00:03:55.770> me<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.010> last<00:03:56.190> logged<00:03:56.580> in

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
will always show me the last logged in

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.880 
will always show me the last logged in
user<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.690> i<00:03:57.720> don't<00:03:58.080> know<00:03:58.290> if<00:03:58.440> there's<00:03:58.650> any

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
user so i don't know if there's any

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.980 
user so i don't know if there's any
other<00:03:59.070> way<00:03:59.280> but<00:03:59.730> what<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.170> my

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
other way but what I do is I go to my

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.240 
other way but what I do is I go to my
library<00:04:03.990> think<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:06.380> references<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.710> guess

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
library think and references I guess

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.740 
library think and references I guess
references<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:10.400> look<00:04:11.400> for<00:04:11.750> application

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
references and look for application

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.780 
references and look for application
loader<00:04:13.020> they're<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:13.800> this<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.220> cache<00:04:14.490> file

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
loader they're like this like cache file

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.590 
loader they're like this like cache file
or<00:04:15.000> temporary<00:04:15.480> file<00:04:15.720> which<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.280> stores<00:04:17.600> can

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
or temporary file which is stores can

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.920 
or temporary file which is stores can
you<00:04:18.690> see<00:04:18.840> anything<00:04:18.989> application<00:04:19.770> loader<00:04:21.200> yeah

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
you see anything application loader yeah

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.510 
you see anything application loader yeah
it's<00:04:24.930> pretty<00:04:25.080> too<00:04:25.350> long<00:04:25.590> ok<00:04:25.919> these<00:04:26.070> two<00:04:26.310> files

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
it's pretty too long ok these two files

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.690 
it's pretty too long ok these two files
if<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.150> move

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
if I just move
