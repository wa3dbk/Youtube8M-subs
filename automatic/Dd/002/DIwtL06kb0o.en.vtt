00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
wouldn't miss it I'm a chiropractor and
hooping<00:01:33.899> Zach<00:01:34.140> changed<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> practice

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
hooping Zach changed the way I practice

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
hooping Zach changed the way I practice
chiropractic<00:01:36.030> because<00:01:36.659> I've<00:01:36.960> realized

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
chiropractic because I've realized

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.309 
chiropractic because I've realized
through<00:01:37.679> my<00:01:37.799> own<00:01:37.979> experience<00:01:38.670> that

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
through my own experience that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.240 
through my own experience that
exercising<00:01:40.319> the<00:01:40.440> small<00:01:40.709> muscles<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
exercising the small muscles that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.820 
exercising the small muscles that
stabilize<00:01:41.399> your<00:01:41.940> back<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.709> of

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
stabilize your back can get you out of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.199 
stabilize your back can get you out of
pain<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> keep<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.429> of<00:01:44.459> pain<00:01:44.670> long-term

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
pain and keep you out of pain long-term

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.499 
pain and keep you out of pain long-term
so<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.690> don't<00:01:45.869> need<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> chiropractor<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.649> much

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
so you don't need a chiropractor as much

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
so you don't need a chiropractor as much
basically<00:01:48.509> hooping<00:01:49.080> allows<00:01:49.770> while<00:01:50.220> you're

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
basically hooping allows while you're

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.070 
basically hooping allows while you're
moving<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.000> getting<00:01:51.149> range<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.569> motion<00:01:51.959> to

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
moving and getting range of motion to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.380 
moving and getting range of motion to
also<00:01:52.500> strengthen<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> tiny<00:01:53.459> muscles<00:01:53.880> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
also strengthen the tiny muscles that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
also strengthen the tiny muscles that
move<00:01:54.659> each<00:01:54.840> vertebra<00:01:55.409> most<00:01:56.009> people<00:01:56.280> are

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
move each vertebra most people are

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
move each vertebra most people are
really<00:01:56.729> weak<00:01:56.940> there<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.619> having

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
really weak there but actually having

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
really weak there but actually having
strong<00:01:59.189> stabilization<00:01:59.939> muscles<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.330> protect

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
strong stabilization muscles to protect

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.820 
strong stabilization muscles to protect
you<00:02:00.689> from<00:02:00.780> injury<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> future
