00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 good 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.910
 I have recorded this life a moment ago 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.250
 but I do not know what the hell happened not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 I could not know I liked Lexington Bear 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.360
 all the voice and I'm going back to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.270
 record and I am teaching you that a 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.910
 little what I'll do is open 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.160
 the little boxes and episode number 6 and I'm going 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 to open two boxes of the new ones of the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.239
 breakdown operation the boxes of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.360
 winter offensive and a small box 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.379
 together in which I'm marking them 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.190
 because right now I do not remember what 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.190
 I was saying it 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.739
 explaining 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.690
 well the intention is that things come out 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.530
 good and I know what has come out now 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.530
 believing 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.280
 the same as me because we open the 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.280
 first box and I to touch 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.630
 a nova 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.640
 she is pretty 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640
 America 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.720
 this to make the video like this in deferred 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.650
 as I do not know much but cut 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.240
 the directors are more more more more 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.320
 animated let's open the second box 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.320
 and it is winter 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.340
 and a mp7 dangers very nice value me 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.950
 like the black black camouflage with a 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.480
 little orange we're going to open it 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.190
 hunter's box 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.280
 it's not weird it's because I'm wearing helmets 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.000
 or the recipe star trac way I knew that 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.730
 I played but 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.730
 mola is the third recipe that I have I 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.790
 now winter offensive 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.590
 day and day 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.630
 with being after trying this new one does not give 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.210
 a lot of money 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.210
 also and now the last box 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.060
 from the new ones he left her for the last 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.920
 Four. Five 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.290
 labyrinth 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.409
 well 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.409
 and in the brave one that raises very good 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.390
 I had a little bit of sautéed asin 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.379
 I'm going to see I've gone to see a little 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.780
 prices no longer know how much 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.760
 were the weapons that have touched me for 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.500
 see what I paid what 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.500
 I would recover recovered different 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.580
 two keys 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.890
 the equivalent of two keys here is 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.580
 where you smell olés 13 bracos those cute 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.580
 that have touched me 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.140
 and it seems to me that 50 cents plus 30 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.510
 but 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.490
 the MP7 but hey we will not let it 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.490
