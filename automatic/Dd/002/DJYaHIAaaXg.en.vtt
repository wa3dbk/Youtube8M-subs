00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090 

Oh<00:00:00.149> one<00:00:00.630> thing<00:00:00.870> that<00:00:00.900> I've<00:00:01.170> been<00:00:01.350> noticing<00:00:01.890> a

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
Oh one thing that I've been noticing a

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.590 
Oh one thing that I've been noticing a
lot<00:00:02.340> recently<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:04.490> the<00:00:05.490> use<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.819> planes<00:00:06.180> when

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
lot recently is the use of planes when

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.440 
lot recently is the use of planes when
pooping<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.519> pretty<00:00:08.519> much<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.910> importance

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
pooping and pretty much the importance

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.600 
pooping and pretty much the importance
of<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.900> whether<00:00:10.410> you're<00:00:10.679> doing<00:00:10.889> single

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
of that whether you're doing single

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.890 
of that whether you're doing single
hooping<00:00:12.210> or<00:00:12.389> multi<00:00:12.750> hooping<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.700> I<00:00:14.900> really

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
hooping or multi hooping and I really

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.210 
hooping or multi hooping and I really
thought<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> would<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.560> nice<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
thought that it would be nice to do a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.040 
thought that it would be nice to do a
little<00:00:17.640> tutorial<00:00:18.600> post<00:00:20.090> log<00:00:21.090> thing<00:00:21.539> about

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
little tutorial post log thing about

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.980 
little tutorial post log thing about
planes<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.850> importance<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.779> have

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
planes and the importance that they have

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.179 
planes and the importance that they have
because<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:26.449> think<00:00:27.500> knowing<00:00:28.500> being<00:00:28.830> aware<00:00:29.130> of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
because I think knowing being aware of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.639 
because I think knowing being aware of
your<00:00:29.429> planes<00:00:29.840> can<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.910> make<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.090> hooping

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
your planes can just make your hooping

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.450 
your planes can just make your hooping
infinitely<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:35.570> skyrocket<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.460> precision

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
infinitely just skyrocket and precision

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.750 
infinitely just skyrocket and precision
and<00:00:38.850> cleanness<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:40.460> just<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> overall

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and cleanness and just the overall

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000 
and cleanness and just the overall
visual<00:00:42.390> value<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.469> you're<00:00:43.590> doing

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
visual value of what you're doing

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.290 
visual value of what you're doing
so<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:46.170> quite<00:00:46.590> often<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> things

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so as quite often the one of the things

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.400 
so as quite often the one of the things
that<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> noticed<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:48.930> people<00:00:49.230> who<00:00:49.320> are

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that I noticed with people who are

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
that I noticed with people who are
starting<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.890> hooping<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.520> they're<00:00:50.670> not

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
starting out hooping is they're not

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
starting out hooping is they're not
really<00:00:51.719> aware<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:53.870> keeping<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.230> hoop<00:00:55.410> on

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
really aware of keeping your hoop on

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
really aware of keeping your hoop on
these<00:00:56.520> different<00:00:56.760> planes<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.600> hoop<00:01:00.809> can

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
these different planes and the hoop can

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.540 
these different planes and the hoop can
kind<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.320> anywhere<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> their<00:01:02.219> body's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
kind of be anywhere and their body's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.039 
kind of be anywhere and their body's
facing<00:01:02.910> anymore<00:01:03.180> whatever<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.750> fine

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
facing anymore whatever and that's fine

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.600 
facing anymore whatever and that's fine
particularly<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.070> you're<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.400> learning

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
particularly if you're just learning

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.920 
particularly if you're just learning
because<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.090> doing<00:01:06.420> whatever<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.750> want

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
because you're doing whatever you want

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.859 
because you're doing whatever you want
but<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:08.100> planes<00:01:08.729> definitely<00:01:09.540> take<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
but I think planes definitely take a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
but I think planes definitely take a
huge<00:01:10.200> role<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:11.430> you're<00:01:11.670> performing<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
huge role when you're performing and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
huge role when you're performing and
you're<00:01:12.990> trying<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.040> create<00:01:14.610> something<00:01:14.939> for

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you're trying to create something for

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.590 
you're trying to create something for
someone<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.720> look<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.520> instance<00:01:17.970> let

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
someone to look at so for instance let

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.219 
someone to look at so for instance let
me<00:01:18.720> grab<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> food<00:01:23.240> you'll<00:01:24.240> notice<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
me grab a food you'll notice that this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.390 
me grab a food you'll notice that this
is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:26.909> more<00:01:27.090> boring<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.750> watch<00:01:28.400> something

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
is a lot more boring to watch something

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.840 
is a lot more boring to watch something
like<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.460> simply<00:01:32.460> because

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
like this or like this simply because

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.469 
like this or like this simply because
the<00:01:34.310> because<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> nature<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.030> hoop<00:01:36.210> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the because of the nature the hoop it's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.960 
the because of the nature the hoop it's
flat<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> much<00:01:40.979> potential<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.759> far

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
flat but it has so much potential as far

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.469 
flat but it has so much potential as far
as<00:01:42.090> framing<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.820> illusion<00:01:44.820> goes<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
as framing and illusion goes so you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
as framing and illusion goes so you
really<00:01:45.869> want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> emphasize<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.549> far<00:01:47.880> as

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
really want to emphasize that as far as

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.530 
really want to emphasize that as far as
I'm<00:01:48.689> concerned<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> gives

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
I'm concerned because it kind of gives

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
I'm concerned because it kind of gives
someone<00:01:51.869> something<00:01:52.409> more<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> look<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.070> if

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
someone something more to look at if

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
someone something more to look at if
you're<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.049> front<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you're just going like this in front of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.709 
you're just going like this in front of
someone<00:01:55.860> swinging<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> around<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.570> not

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
someone swinging it around and not

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.770 
someone swinging it around and not
really<00:01:57.750> paying<00:01:58.409> attention<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.780> whatever

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
really paying attention to like whatever

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.310 
really paying attention to like whatever
you're<00:02:01.020> doing<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.590> stuff<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:03.170> where

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you're doing and stuff and where

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.560 
you're doing and stuff and where
how<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> audience<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.880> seeing<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.330> group

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
how the audience is seeing the group

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.169 
how the audience is seeing the group
you're<00:02:07.350> gonna<00:02:07.560> lose<00:02:07.800> people's<00:02:08.369> interests<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you're gonna lose people's interests a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.750 
you're gonna lose people's interests a
lot<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.080> quickly<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.190> far<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.400> planes

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
lot more quickly so so as far as planes

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.480 
lot more quickly so so as far as planes
go<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.810> vertical<00:02:16.500> plane<00:02:16.980> which<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.459> a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
go you have a vertical plane which is a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.940 
go you have a vertical plane which is a
plane<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.000> work<00:02:18.660> mostly<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.740> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
plane that I work mostly and I think and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.160 
plane that I work mostly and I think and
then<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.060> your<00:02:21.209> horizontal<00:02:21.480> Clinton

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
then you have your horizontal Clinton

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.790 
then you have your horizontal Clinton
which<00:02:22.290> has<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> lot<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.860> potential<00:02:23.250> too<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.800> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
which has a lot of potential too and the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.740 
which has a lot of potential too and the
way<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.610> define<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.880> hoop<00:02:30.540> as

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
way that you can define the the hoop as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.449 
way that you can define the the hoop as
a<00:02:30.780> sphere<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.530> us<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> want<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.280> think

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
a sphere of us if you want to think

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.490 
a sphere of us if you want to think
about<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.970> way<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.959> think<00:02:34.170> about<00:02:34.350> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
about it that way and I think about the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.090 
about it that way and I think about the
way<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:35.720> leaving<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> trail<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.040> to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
way that it's leaving like a trail so to

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.140 
way that it's leaving like a trail so to
speak<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:44.340> wanted<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.970> bring

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
speak so I just I just wanted to bring

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
speak so I just I just wanted to bring
this<00:02:45.330> up<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.920> bring<00:02:46.920> people's<00:02:47.340> attention

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
this up so to bring people's attention

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.150 
this up so to bring people's attention
that<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:50.330> how<00:02:51.330> much<00:02:51.630> being<00:02:52.500> aware<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:52.950> keeping

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
that of how much being aware of keeping

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.820 
that of how much being aware of keeping
something<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> horizontal<00:02:54.870> plane<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
something on a horizontal plane and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.040 
something on a horizontal plane and
making<00:02:56.519> sure<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.090> parallel<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
making sure it really is parallel to the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.990 
making sure it really is parallel to the
ground<00:02:58.290> with<00:02:59.010> whatever<00:02:59.370> you're<00:02:59.640> doing

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
ground with whatever you're doing

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.190 
ground with whatever you're doing
whether<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.600> body<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.170> not<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.769> then

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
whether it's on body or not and then

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.680 
whether it's on body or not and then
also<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> potential<00:03:04.650> for<00:03:05.100> illusion<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
also the potential for illusion with a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.310 
also the potential for illusion with a
vertical<00:03:07.290> plane<00:03:07.590> too<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.810> what<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.140> do

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
vertical plane too and what you can do

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.630 
vertical plane too and what you can do
with<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:12.660> also<00:03:13.530> definitely<00:03:13.950> definitely

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
with that it also definitely definitely

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.240 
with that it also definitely definitely
most<00:03:15.630> importantly<00:03:16.110> comes<00:03:16.410> into<00:03:16.620> play<00:03:16.830> when

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
most importantly comes into play when

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.289 
most importantly comes into play when
you<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.370> two<00:03:17.820> boobs

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
you have two boobs

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.890 
you have two boobs
so<00:03:21.380> with<00:03:22.380> two<00:03:22.680> hoops<00:03:23.239> say<00:03:24.239> I'm<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.540> doing

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
so with two hoops say I'm just doing

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.720 
so with two hoops say I'm just doing
this<00:03:25.049> or<00:03:25.290> whatever<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:25.769> then<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.640> know

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
this or whatever but then you know

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.220 
this or whatever but then you know
you're<00:03:26.880> not<00:03:26.910> paying<00:03:27.269> attention<00:03:27.360> or<00:03:27.810> something

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
you're not paying attention or something

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.720 
you're not paying attention or something
and<00:03:28.350> then<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:28.980> all<00:03:29.130> wonky<00:03:29.370> and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and then this one it's all wonky and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.120 
and then this one it's all wonky and
starts<00:03:30.000> going<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.930> or<00:03:31.200> you're<00:03:31.470> trying<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.920> do

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
starts going in or you're trying to do

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.600 
starts going in or you're trying to do
something<00:03:32.459> like<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.390> then<00:03:34.459> like<00:03:35.459> I

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
something like this and then like I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.039 
something like this and then like I
don't<00:03:35.670> know<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.090> one<00:03:36.360> ends<00:03:36.600> up<00:03:36.690> kind<00:03:36.900> of

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
don't know this one ends up kind of

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.530 
don't know this one ends up kind of
being<00:03:37.320> more<00:03:37.440> horizontal<00:03:38.400> or<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.970> don't<00:03:39.450> know

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
being more horizontal or I don't know

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.410 
being more horizontal or I don't know
whatever<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.370> causes<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.390> to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
whatever it is it kind of causes you to

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.170 
whatever it is it kind of causes you to
look<00:03:42.690> less<00:03:43.620> crisp<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.459> clean<00:03:44.850> with<00:03:45.030> your

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
look less crisp and clean with your

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.420 
look less crisp and clean with your
moves<00:03:45.420> then<00:03:46.019> if<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.350> were<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.769> really<00:03:47.040> pay

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
moves then if you were to really pay

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.759 
moves then if you were to really pay
attention<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:48.030> keeping<00:03:48.480> them<00:03:48.690> on<00:03:49.019> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
attention to keeping them on the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.330 
attention to keeping them on the
vertical<00:03:50.220> plane<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:51.980> parallel<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.220> each

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
vertical plane and parallel to each

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.569 
vertical plane and parallel to each
other<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:56.810> guess<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:59.070> biggest<00:03:59.280> thing<00:03:59.549> that

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
other so I guess the biggest thing that

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.310 
other so I guess the biggest thing that
you<00:03:59.700> can<00:03:59.880> do<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.239> probably<00:04:00.630> watch<00:04:00.780> yourself<00:04:01.200> in

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
you can do is probably watch yourself in

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.830 
you can do is probably watch yourself in
a<00:04:01.410> mirror<00:04:01.769> also<00:04:02.459> take<00:04:02.610> videos<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.150> yourself<00:04:03.269> so

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
a mirror also take videos of yourself so

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.000 
a mirror also take videos of yourself so
then<00:04:03.989> you're<00:04:04.200> noticing<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:07.680> know<00:04:07.799> what

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
then you're noticing you know what

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.500 
then you're noticing you know what
you're<00:04:08.160> doing<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.610> maybe<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.940> just<00:04:09.180> makes<00:04:09.390> you

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
you're doing and maybe it just makes you

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.170 
you're doing and maybe it just makes you
a<00:04:09.540> little<00:04:09.720> bit<00:04:09.959> more<00:04:10.140> aware<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.670> next<00:04:12.000> time

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
a little bit more aware of the next time

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.090 
a little bit more aware of the next time
that<00:04:12.449> you're<00:04:12.600> doing<00:04:12.870> doubles<00:04:13.440> or<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.799> next

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
that you're doing doubles or the next

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.830 
that you're doing doubles or the next
time<00:04:14.280> then<00:04:14.609> you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
time then you

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.310 
time then you
trying<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.560> perform<00:04:16.950> or<00:04:17.340> whatever<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.320> to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
trying to perform or whatever and to

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.650 
trying to perform or whatever and to
think<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.890> okay<00:04:20.100> I'm<00:04:20.400> gonna<00:04:20.580> stand<00:04:20.940> here<00:04:21.090> and

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
think like okay I'm gonna stand here and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.990 
think like okay I'm gonna stand here and
I<00:04:22.140> want<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:24.530> want<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.920> like<00:04:26.130> use<00:04:26.340> these<00:04:26.580> circles

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
I want I want to like use these circles

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.910 
I want I want to like use these circles
it's<00:04:27.210> an<00:04:27.300> illusion<00:04:27.780> or<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:27.990> want<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.380> do<00:04:28.680> you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
it's an illusion or I want to do you

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.290 
it's an illusion or I want to do you
know<00:04:29.040> whatever<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.520> want<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.760> do<00:04:29.940> with<00:04:30.120> your

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
know whatever you want to do with your

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.350 
know whatever you want to do with your
circles<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:32.670> kind<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:33.000> how<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.180> think

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
circles this is just kind of how I think

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.120 
circles this is just kind of how I think
of<00:04:33.720> them<00:04:35.660> but<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.900> face<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.560> face<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.950> audience

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
of them but to face to face the audience

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.860 
of them but to face to face the audience
instead<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.790> doing<00:04:39.120> something<00:04:39.360> like<00:04:39.540> this

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
instead of doing something like this

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.500 
instead of doing something like this
where<00:04:40.200> your<00:04:40.380> focus<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:41.160> feel<00:04:41.820> like<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.180> lot<00:04:42.360> of

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
where your focus I feel like a lot of

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.270 
where your focus I feel like a lot of
times<00:04:42.750> it's<00:04:43.050> easy<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.410> lose<00:04:43.590> yourself<00:04:44.070> and

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
times it's easy to lose yourself and

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.070 
times it's easy to lose yourself and
what<00:04:44.400> you're<00:04:44.520> doing<00:04:44.880> during<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.450> performance

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
what you're doing during the performance

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.120 
what you're doing during the performance
and<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:47.960> not<00:04:48.960> take<00:04:49.170> us<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.410> audience<00:04:49.830> into

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
and to not take us the audience into

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.920 
and to not take us the audience into
account<00:04:50.430> but<00:04:50.640> you're<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.390> one<00:04:51.600> who's

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
account but you're the one who's

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.690 
account but you're the one who's
creating<00:04:52.530> entertainment<00:04:53.130> for<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.310> audience

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
creating entertainment for the audience

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.640 
creating entertainment for the audience
