 to stick the film on the screen 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.610
 there is one way when with using 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.140
 spray is applied to the screen then liquid 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.930
 plenochka just completely put and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.790
 fluid and aligned on screen how 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.700
 by using a credit card 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.660
 as plastic as such 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:47.150
 squeezed liquid and the second method 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.890
 when the film is put on top and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.090
 gradually 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.490

 the film moves very well on the screen 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.770
 on water 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.290
 to waste 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.980

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.980
 relief cards 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.849
 flat 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.580
 so the habit is exactly with us 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:27.089
 so there is almost no water left 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:27.089
 and now can be removed 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:37.400
