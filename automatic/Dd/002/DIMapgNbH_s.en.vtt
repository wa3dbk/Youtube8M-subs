00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 How much capital do you need around the world? 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.700
 stock exchange 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.950
 welcome successful 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.139
 Many people think that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 Thousands or tens of thousands of Euros 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.610
 eurus politics that's it at all 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.369
 and invest his money on the stock exchange 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.170
 I can tell this is more complete 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 idiocy 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 It is already possible his money with 25 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.160
 euro month makes sense on the stock exchange 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.769
 To create specifically for example in a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.760
 etf savings plan 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.890
 if you like your age 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.290
 want to make provision is and accordingly 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.880
 then have a long investment horizon 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.790
 is it really worthwhile an etf 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.700
 Create a savings plan and you can 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.170
 very well for your age I foresee 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.960
 already had you in the previous one 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.520
 Videos achieved that the dax in the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.600
 last 50 years an average 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.000
 annual return of 8 3 percent per 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 year dropped 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 we just go with you the times 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.100
 following example through you are 25 years 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 old and do you want to take care of your old age? 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.170
 correspond to the leg investment horizon 40 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.430
 years and you only have a budget of 25 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.150
 euro per month 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.670
 which stream is the canton wants 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 That's why you put your money in a etf 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.170
 savings plan on the dax 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 So you 're in an etf monthly 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.090
 deposit the dax and this on 25 euro 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.659
 in the month 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.280
 if it does not really hurt you 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.750
 and you do not want to live with me 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.850
 stock exchange and have you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.619
 Do not feel like the courses every day 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 follow 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.930
 So here are the facts you 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.159
 You will deposit for 40 years and this 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.009
 25 euro month and that means asking euro 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.689
 in the year on the dax and the stock market has in 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.520
 the last 50 years one 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.720
 average yield of 8.3 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.509
 percent dropped 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.180
 However, we see something pessimistic in 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.200
 the future and only at seven 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.210
 percent return per year 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.600
 and how much money will come at the end 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.020
 out guess how much for yourself 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.360
 money at 25 euros per month and 40 years 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.720
 out 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.180
 it is 64,000 euros 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.840
 so if you already you with with such a 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.340
 small amount of 25 euros 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 disciplined individually over the under dax 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.810
 let's just say seven percent 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.170
 would develop on average per 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.240
 year 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.180
 then you would already have 64,000 euros 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.000
 easy with these 25 euro month 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.680
 saved up and that is not with you 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.930
 neglect the operator or have 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.770
 So do not have good and how will it be 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.320
 look if you instead of the 25 euro 50 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.270
 deposit euro in the month is because of 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.580
 someone who works in the profession and one 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.720
 it's got regular income 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.970
 not so wild object has 25 eur 1 1 or 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.620
 50 Euros 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.660
 what do you think how much would you be on 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.480
 Get over the end when you are 40 years old 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.730
 50 euro in the dax wants to invest 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.360
 and the dax averages pro 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.230
 year would develop by seven percent 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.030
 you would have a fortune of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.740
 130,000 euros 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.890
 and I repeat again only through 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.480
 the regular investment of 50 euros 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 in the month 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.050
 and we do not expect 83 percent 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.630
 So the average yield of the 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.230
 laz we expect a bit more festive 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.130
 and although we expect something festive 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.560
 and calculate 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.050
 still comes with such small 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.500
 Months not worth such big 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.500
 in the end and how about 100? 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.620
 then invest euro in the month 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.040
 if you had 65 years a et wÃ¤ert 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:58.070
 So a fortune of 250 000 euro 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.170
 So that's about a million euros 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.420
 and presentation with 100 euros a month 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.980
 while I continue to speak, I'm blind 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.410
 then again with a small overview 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.770
 the whole monthly amounts and 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.209
 their valise no so how can it? 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.070
 be that you with such little ones 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.970
 such rowland values â€‹â€‹amount out 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:21.299
 get keyword compounding effect 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.220
 or rather, the interest rate this 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.610
 elementary blockpoints have it in 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.379
 yourself 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.789
 Now every investor should know 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.189
 and so I'll put it later in 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.620
 videos still my details go into me 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:33.750
 Now just want a short example 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.669
 short example industrial that one 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.509
 really should learn some basics and 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.490
 no role 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.590
 We will also later into the deep 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.539
 the investment approach goes beyond the us 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.909
 just spoke is the passive 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.189
 Invest and this is an investment 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.860
 approach every citizen in germany 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:52.289
 actually implement without problems 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.000
 could be the least we are 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.479
 can do with our worth others 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.430
 to provide for our age and this is 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.120
 unproblematic for example with this 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.860
 investment approach possible with 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.240
 this little video series showed 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.009
 that the money does not work at all 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.650
 complicated and that is the risk 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.500
 can minimize and tax and that one 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.409
 his money already with small amounts and 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.569
 can make little capital sense 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.340
 I hope you have learned a lot from me 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.319
 Got it on the sea as well 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.690
 Always a lot of fun and me 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.120
 Hope we have this video series 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.409
 liked and if you like this one 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.500
 I liked the video then I get one 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.659
 Thumb up and oppose main channel up 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.849
 to the next video or first in the 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.490
 video series deininger and successful 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.180
 invest more money less risk and 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.180
 a better life
