 today tutorial will be about how 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.580
 use the application to support the realm 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 case to generate the binary 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.960
 your android machine 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.390
 good they will download or apply to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.510
 description of the video in the case on our blog 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.120
 on the characteristics it encompasses and the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.949
 its good download and now it showed 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 tutorial on how to do it to generate 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.999
 your binary counter 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.159
 good first know that must have hulk 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.069
 on your device in the case of the video I 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.839
 did the 64 coup was to have hu 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:51.149
 ready here you will install by 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:55.049
 sd card as you already know and will open 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.909
 because it is far open that the triangle 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.379
 these will put you in the conditions of 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.219
 overcome the user so that he can 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 identify in case account of the torque 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.280
 this process should not be done in 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.439
 95 00 because it is a software and fable 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.530
 borges and processors are different 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.810
 so you are warned there that you should not 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.299
 do this on your e 95 00 the good package 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.250
 here you are seeing the confinement 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.259
 cloud model if it is not 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 this model will only be able to play the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.429
 playing is a treatment is almost 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.250
 system but in fact 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.420
 still exists when you clicked 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.539
 here it continued 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:44.249
 Ok, ok, you'll see if the 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:46.619
 webinar cost should gti 9505 knowing

 makes a singer 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.929
 clicking here and this operation is 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.630
 dangerous 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.869
 you can give him beaks he will continue 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.710

 your lapa it will start in case 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.180
 important and sometimes every 10 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.670
 seconds on the start button we will have 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.830
 everything always being careful 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.000
 ready to screw it preparing 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.380
 ke ha ha to make reservation in training 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.050
 with the triangle away 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.150
 in case he'll do it because I'm back in 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.120
 warranty does not depend on the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.430
 independent ready here he is already 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.930
 entering when they resort to booty 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.550
 in the case of the record is that it will show 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.709
 also the binary counter is because it 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.959
 will give you entry on the phone the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.470
 download to show if it's in cost 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.299
 in case here the very small is show 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.690
 I can get at what cost 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.600
 ae are official status in the case of non 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.730
 hesitated is the binary 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.440
 But from here, it's going to be soon. 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.820
 seconds in case he spoke there he 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.980
 will start in another so that it is in the 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.150
 case will be to reset the account of the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.100
 binary 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.329
 as you are seeing in 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.280

 on here 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.230
 it will run the binary counter it 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.630
 gave it here don do you mean ready now? 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.289

 show you what to say the same 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:41.340
 the binary counter ready now goes 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:46.889
 enter the modal login again and how 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.330

 you have here in the triangle and that it 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.460
 be the binary counter 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.530
 leaves him wot than here in the case 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.199
