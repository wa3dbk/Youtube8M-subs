our don't scratch that that's actually
just<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.560> reference<00:00:19.920> point<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> find<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
just a reference point to find out the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
just a reference point to find out the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
flags there so what those are they're

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720 
flags there so what those are they're
pins<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> set<00:00:41.579> up

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
pins so we're actually going to set up

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.760 
pins so we're actually going to set up
that<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> exact<00:00:42.600> corner<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.469> our<00:00:43.860> garage

that is the exact corner of our garage
that<00:00:46.770> we're<00:00:46.920> building<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.090> these

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that we're building so we have these

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
that we're building so we have these
four<00:00:48.390> corners<00:00:49.170> established<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.129> know

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
four corners established and now we know

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.569 
four corners established and now we know
that<00:00:51.320> we're<00:00:52.320> within<00:00:52.500> our<00:00:52.739> setbacks<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.430> we're

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that we're within our setbacks as we're

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.010 
that we're within our setbacks as we're
supposed<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.300> far<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> city<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
supposed to be as far as the city is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.860 
supposed to be as far as the city is
required<00:00:55.199> we're<00:00:56.190> backed<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.760> from<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> road

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.040 
required we're backed up from the road
as<00:00:58.379> far<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.680> our<00:00:58.770> setbacks<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.670> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
as far as our setbacks go there and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
as far as our setbacks go there and
we're<00:01:01.050> building<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> exactly<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.039> spot

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

because we have a garage door is we're

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.130 
because we have a garage door is we're
building<00:01:12.090> our<00:01:12.710> footings<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> 2<00:01:14.640> by<00:01:14.670> 12<00:01:15.140> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
building our footings with a 2 by 12 and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
building our footings with a 2 by 12 and
the<00:01:16.200> unique<00:01:16.500> part<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.909> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the unique part about that is what that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
the unique part about that is what that
allows<00:01:18.299> us<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.229> reuse<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.979> lumber

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
allows us to do is to reuse that lumber

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.179 
allows us to do is to reuse that lumber
as<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.119> header<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.750> our<00:01:21.930> garage<00:01:22.140> door<00:01:22.189> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
as the header for our garage door so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
as the header for our garage door so
that<00:01:23.670> 2<00:01:23.909> by<00:01:24.060> 12<00:01:24.119> material<00:01:24.780> will<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.020> become

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that 2 by 12 material will now become

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.870 
that 2 by 12 material will now become
the<00:01:25.470> header<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:26.009> grass<00:01:26.220> door<00:01:26.520> which<00:01:26.700> will

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the header for our grass door which will

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.660 
the header for our grass door which will
go<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.119> above<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.979> we're<00:01:28.979> able<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> reuse

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
go up above here and we're able to reuse

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.210 
go up above here and we're able to reuse
it<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.119> don't<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.540> strip<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.170> take<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it so we don't just strip it and take it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
it so we don't just strip it and take it
to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> dump<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.329> we've<00:01:33.750> ordered<00:01:34.049> our

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to the dump so we've ordered our

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.219 
to the dump so we've ordered our
foundation<00:01:35.310> material<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.810> building<00:01:37.110> our

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
foundation material and are building our

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749 
foundation material and are building our
foundation<00:01:37.710> slightly<00:01:38.189> differently<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
foundation slightly differently to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.310 
foundation slightly differently to
accommodate<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.630> lumber<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:39.990> we'll<00:01:40.229> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
accommodate the lumber that we'll be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.929 
accommodate the lumber that we'll be
able<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.560> reuse<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> build

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
able to reuse in the build

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.330 
able to reuse in the build
we've<00:01:42.720> also<00:01:43.049> delivered<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> rebar<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.130> and

our footings we're building our curb on
top<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:27.260> part<00:02:27.500> here<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
top so this this part here is the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.240 
top so this this part here is the
footing<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:29.420> right<00:02:29.630> here<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.080> curb<00:02:30.320> and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
you can see that corner right there is

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.840 
you can see that corner right there is
the<00:02:35.930> exact<00:02:36.800> same<00:02:37.010> as<00:02:37.070> this<00:02:37.340> corner<00:02:37.640> right<00:02:37.820> here
