your go away great a lot of the stuff
we're<00:02:08.570> talking<00:02:08.899> about<00:02:08.990> in<00:02:09.260> here<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.530> like

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
we're talking about in here it's like

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.760 
we're talking about in here it's like
folic<00:02:09.979> acid<00:02:10.430> zinc<00:02:11.390> copper<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.410> big<00:02:12.560> thing

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
folic acid zinc copper and the big thing

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.350 
folic acid zinc copper and the big thing
the<00:02:12.980> reason<00:02:13.220> they<00:02:13.310> think<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.640> works<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the reason they think it works is the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.570 
the reason they think it works is the
kattiline<00:02:14.900> catalase<00:02:15.350> supposedly<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.190> stops

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
kattiline catalase supposedly it stops

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.280 
kattiline catalase supposedly it stops
the<00:02:16.820> production<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.360> your<00:02:17.450> hydrogen<00:02:17.630> peroxide

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the production of your hydrogen peroxide

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.620 
the production of your hydrogen peroxide
which<00:02:18.470> causes<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.460> gray<00:02:19.640> hair<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.360> starts

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
which causes the gray hair so it starts

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.750 
which causes the gray hair so it starts
from<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> root<00:02:21.080> out<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.590> change<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.610> gray

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
from the root out so change the gray

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.850 
from the root out so change the gray
actually<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:24.050> for<00:02:24.440> new<00:02:24.620> hair

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
actually have it's for new hair

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.320 
actually have it's for new hair
production<00:02:25.370> which<00:02:25.550> would<00:02:25.700> make<00:02:25.910> me<00:02:26.060> assume

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
production which would make me assume

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.640 
production which would make me assume
that<00:02:26.390> every<00:02:26.720> time<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.960> get<00:02:27.050> stressed<00:02:27.410> your

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that every time you get stressed your

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.880 
that every time you get stressed your
body<00:02:27.830> produces<00:02:28.340> more<00:02:28.370> hydrogen<00:02:28.970> peroxide

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
body produces more hydrogen peroxide

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.440 
body produces more hydrogen peroxide
interesting<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.100> right<00:02:31.370> kit<00:02:31.820> but<00:02:32.210> it's<00:02:32.330> also
