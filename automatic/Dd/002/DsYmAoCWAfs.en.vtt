and<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.450> think<00:00:37.630> we're<00:00:37.780> playing<00:00:37.870> portal<00:00:38.559> so<00:00:38.800> it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
and I think we're playing portal so it's

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.380 
and I think we're playing portal so it's
based<00:00:39.219> on<00:00:39.309> portal<00:00:39.640> look<00:00:39.760> at<00:00:39.850> that<00:00:39.940> guy's<00:00:40.059> skin

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
based on portal look at that guy's skin

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.690 
based on portal look at that guy's skin
that's<00:00:40.989> crazy<00:00:41.290> and<00:00:41.980> pretty<00:00:42.190> much<00:00:42.280> what<00:00:42.520> it<00:00:42.550> is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
that's crazy and pretty much what it is

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.610 
that's crazy and pretty much what it is
it's<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.210> same<00:00:43.420> as<00:00:43.450> like<00:00:43.810> Call<00:00:44.200> of<00:00:44.230> Duty<00:00:44.500> one
