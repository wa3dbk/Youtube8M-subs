another nikkor lens the 55 to 200
millimeter<00:00:51.329> lens<00:00:51.739> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> left<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
millimeter lens on the left you see the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.450 
millimeter lens on the left you see the
55<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.329> 200<00:00:54.690> millimeter<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.010> 55

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.389 
to 300 millimeter the 200 millimeter
lens<00:00:59.010> tips<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> scales<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.300> 335<00:01:01.199> grams<00:01:01.739> so

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
lens tips the scales at 335 grams so

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.960 
lens tips the scales at 335 grams so
it's<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.329> good<00:01:04.110> bit<00:01:04.290> lighter<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> can

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it's a good bit lighter and here you can

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
it's a good bit lighter and here you can
see<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.420> size<00:01:06.810> difference<00:01:06.840> between<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.770> two

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
see the size difference between the two

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.719 
see the size difference between the two
lenses<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.520> full<00:01:09.510> telephoto<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:11.010> yes<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.549> new

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
lenses at full telephoto so yes the new

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
lenses at full telephoto so yes the new
lens<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.360> might<00:01:12.780> expect<00:01:12.930> weighs<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> little

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
lens as you might expect weighs a little

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.960 
lens as you might expect weighs a little
more<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.470> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.560> larger<00:01:17.130> than<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
more and is a little bit larger than the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.030 
more and is a little bit larger than the
old<00:01:18.240> 200<00:01:18.659> millimeter<00:01:18.990> lens<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.770> price

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
old 200 millimeter lens the price

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.950 
old 200 millimeter lens the price
difference<00:01:20.460> between<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.210> lenses<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
difference between these two lenses is a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.490 
difference between these two lenses is a
couple<00:01:22.560> hundred<00:01:22.740> bucks<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:24.000> paid<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.500> $400

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
couple hundred bucks we paid about $400

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.899 
couple hundred bucks we paid about $400
for<00:01:25.860> our<00:01:26.009> new<00:01:26.340> 55<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.420> 300<00:01:27.960> millimeter<00:01:28.350> lens

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
for our new 55 to 300 millimeter lens

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.120 
for our new 55 to 300 millimeter lens
the<00:01:29.909> extra<00:01:30.210> money<00:01:30.360> gets<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.409> reach<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the extra money gets you more reach and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
the extra money gets you more reach and
slightly<00:01:32.820> better<00:01:33.000> build<00:01:33.420> quality<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:34.200> we'll

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
slightly better build quality as we'll

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
slightly better build quality as we'll
see<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.950> minute<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:36.030> new<00:01:36.150> lens<00:01:36.420> also<00:01:36.930> comes

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
see in a minute the new lens also comes

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.520 
see in a minute the new lens also comes
equipped<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.890> lens<00:01:38.369> hood<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:39.320> don't<00:01:40.320> often

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
equipped with a lens hood I don't often

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.940 
equipped with a lens hood I don't often
use<00:01:40.650> lens<00:01:41.250> hoods<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> do<00:01:42.770> there<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
use lens hoods but if you do there you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.910 
use lens hoods but if you do there you
go<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> hood<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> rest<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> lens

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
go the hood like the rest of the lens

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.569 
go the hood like the rest of the lens
exterior<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.790> made<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.720> plastic<00:01:49.399> that's<00:01:50.399> not

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
exterior is made of plastic that's not

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.270 
exterior is made of plastic that's not
necessarily<00:01:51.270> bad<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.649> use<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.009> plastic

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
necessarily bad the use of plastic

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.590 
necessarily bad the use of plastic
certainly<00:01:53.850> helps<00:01:54.090> keep<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> weight

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
certainly helps keep the weight

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.100 
certainly helps keep the weight
manageable<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.579> seems<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.509> high

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
manageable and it seems to be of high

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.200 
manageable and it seems to be of high
quality<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:59.299> plastic<00:02:00.299> goes<00:02:01.820> taking<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.939> closer

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
quality as plastic goes taking a closer

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.719 
quality as plastic goes taking a closer

light camera like the D 5000 feel a

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.059 
light camera like the D 5000 feel a
little<00:03:32.690> unbalanced<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.840> front-heavy<00:03:34.260> but

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
little unbalanced and front-heavy but

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.759 
little unbalanced and front-heavy but
what<00:03:35.250> do<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.400> expect<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.169> large

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
what do you expect it's a large

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.520 
what do you expect it's a large
telephoto<00:03:38.730> lens

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
telephoto lens

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.319 
telephoto lens
now<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.590> widest<00:03:41.010> aperture<00:03:41.340> for<00:03:41.669> this<00:03:41.790> lens<00:03:42.060> is

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
now the widest aperture for this lens is

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.879 
now the widest aperture for this lens is
F<00:03:42.739> 4.5<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:45.239> obviously<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.230> low<00:03:46.590> light

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
F 4.5 so it's obviously not a low light

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.920 
F 4.5 so it's obviously not a low light
lens<00:03:47.250> now<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.299> we've<00:03:48.419> got<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.720> lens

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
