00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.519
 how should he be with us further 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.400
 gameplay commentary from me the last 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.980
 day here the weather was so nice people 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.690
 and therefore the last video unfortunately 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.270
 no normal comment from me that me 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.250
 just have fun for fun 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.740
 little bit uploaded from the web 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.350
 speaks the summer toboggan run and I found 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.540
 it really quite amusing the real 1000 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.579
 people from so many different 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.560
 cities just written under it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540
 do not have to go far for coaching 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.610
 apart this is the summer toboggan run 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 directly with me and it has become like that 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.540
 many people from backward cities 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.130
 be written it gets amusing and 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.500
 a country has also written under it 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.120
 funny that you everytime that because it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.410
 him near although all of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 has somewhere else just comes much 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 summer toboggan run looks almost the same 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 and yes it is people I lÃ¶s 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.809
 Just that was it 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.649
 summer toboggan run in Nuremberg wanted 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110
 Of course I'm not the customer 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.510
 Duisburg would not know this yet 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 and we are fallen because like this 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 make were just so already know and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.690
 then Mr. Bock has a really like that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.979
 it is cool weather and it can have you 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.650
 as I said no real 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.450
 comments from me just do one time 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.530
 then a little gorilla in german was 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.260
 I still with the other buddy of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.570
 me in the city and he can me one 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.310
 quite funny story to tell and indeed 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.140
 then we were like that at starbucks and he 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.400
 is half animal contact german man 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.460
 does not look that bad for them 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 other turk is and then we have that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.700
 is like so one of us was in 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 one therefore 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.350
 thematic and drawn to so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.390
 baroque about it so soon about everything 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.399
 others were seated differently 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.689
 already placed on the bar stool there, 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 to the left of you were two turkish 15 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.259
 16 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.189
 especially since talking as already said that he 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.720
 I think I always said something 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.060
 he had to laugh 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.770
 we have the wives and so offer or 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.829
 has one in Turkish for adoption 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.780
 says oh my god who totally laughs at us 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.979
 because we take pictures all the time 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.179
 until then did not have 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.430
 to hear that he is all the time 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.540
 referred to shooting then we have 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.760
 of course it noticed, of course, 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.200
 understood and then they have the whole 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.060
 Time kept on then we had to 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.450
 Of course that's why they laugh and say that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.390
 So it's all about Turkish 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.299
 embarrassing very early on and so the laugh and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.099
 all the time off and then we have like that 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.780
 I see now let's see that 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.400
 when I someone calls up as 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.950
 Just an alarm clock for in a minute 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.819
 and then we go extra turkish 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.019
 on the phone 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:43.590
 so he thinks he goes extra loud 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.290
 fruit quite admira bach and so and the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.670
 cup just looks so big eyes 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.069
 make it from one to the other 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.040
 other seconds will make bright red 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.769
 both turned around and in sync 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.440
 just better run it so well 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:02.459
 not funny the nastiest though 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.750
 head area horny and a bit 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.260
 shopping and so because he needed new ones 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.260
 shoes and I would say 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.739
 I think so nike and adidas and so 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.129
 I think everything is really small &amp; 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.189
 coll 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.840
 but i have to say i think of guys 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.730
 if it is totally cool but now this one 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.360
 a world I just link to you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.819
 here below 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.439
 I think these are just shoes out there 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.849
 Firstly in all colors then you can 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.000
 always dress appropriately 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.980
 I know it but it's cool 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.019
 and if you look for example in 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.760
 black picks are just neutral 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.500
 this simple one can to each one 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 Tighten are good so a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.120
 girl I now like but not so on 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.680
 I think he 's really good at guys 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.680
 The first time brought in I believe 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.060
 four different colors and the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.739
 Fantasy was pretty cool 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.750
 and yes , there are just a few left 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.120
 so bought things because he is not like that 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.159
 every time I chancellor with barely and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.439
 so a little styling advice our 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.939
 shit and then we have one 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.859
 bit shocked and the shocked 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.790
 City made about the next day 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.430
 I definitely have now 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.069
 really fun to go paintball play 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.889
 the problem is but I know that he 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.060
 I'm so funny about it 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.590
 somehow clarify maybe 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.260
 Run longer especially mothers are yes 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.599
 Most of the time it's so funny the whole thing 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.190
 time on the field still like to run around photos 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.650
 I might make you one 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.720
 little bit of it can show right 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.400
 bock on it now that I am in the 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.990

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.180
 to go play but in winter it is 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.680
 cold and no idea how I do that 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.180

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.169

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.360

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.740
 I've noticed everyone 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.870

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.160

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.440

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.210
 home and would like to stop relatively well 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.610
