00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
notice how the carbonation will pick

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
notice how the carbonation will pick
these<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.090> guys<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.750> pick<00:00:39.930> them<00:00:40.110> up

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.540 
weightlessness is that nice so the
carbon-dioxide<00:00:48.870> hooks<00:00:49.530> onto<00:00:49.770> them<00:00:50.070> goes<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
carbon-dioxide hooks onto them goes to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
carbon-dioxide hooks onto them goes to
the<00:00:50.760> top<00:00:50.969> verse<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.809> works<00:00:52.079> its<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.410> back

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the top verse and works its way back

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
the top verse and works its way back
down<00:00:52.829> again<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.399> ups<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> downs<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> a

some water into the plate like this and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
some water into the plate like this and
then<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:10.409> using<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.890> famous<00:01:11.150> gobstoppers

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
then we're using the famous gobstoppers

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
then we're using the famous gobstoppers
okay<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.290> take<00:01:13.500> some<00:01:13.710> gobstoppers<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
okay so take some gobstoppers and if you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.520 
okay so take some gobstoppers and if you
just<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.659> them<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.259> this

the<00:01:17.250> cool<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:17.729> gobstoppers<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the cool thing about gobstoppers is that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.749 
the cool thing about gobstoppers is that
they're<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.650> dissolve<00:01:20.070> pretty<00:01:20.460> quickly

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
they're gonna dissolve pretty quickly

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
they're gonna dissolve pretty quickly
and<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.630> over<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.500> mean<00:01:22.710> it'll<00:01:22.890> happen<00:01:22.950> very

see<00:01:25.080> how<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> dye<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.530> already<00:01:25.920> starting<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
see how the dye is already starting to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
see how the dye is already starting to
come<00:01:26.490> off<00:01:26.670> alright<00:01:27.150> collects<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> dye

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
come off alright collects are the dye

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.899 
come off alright collects are the dye
comes<00:01:28.259> off<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.159> let<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.369> sit<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.850> for

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909

literally<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.220> little<00:02:22.430> m<00:02:22.610> will<00:02:22.820> lift<00:02:23.060> off<00:02:23.330> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
literally the little m will lift off and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.300 
literally the little m will lift off and
it<00:02:23.960> solves<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.740> goes<00:02:24.860> right<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.280> top

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
it solves and it goes right to the top
