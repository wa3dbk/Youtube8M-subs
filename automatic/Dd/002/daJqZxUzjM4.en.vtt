00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
they had a bigger base on them so you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.570

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.620 
all this new stuff to my existing Smurfs
micro<00:04:28.060> village<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.310> question<00:04:30.940> I've

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
micro village that is the question I've

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.170 
micro village that is the question I've
already<00:04:32.170> removed<00:04:32.440> as<00:04:32.920> several<00:04:33.400> pieces<00:04:33.850> just

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
already removed as several pieces just

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.910 
already removed as several pieces just
so<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.540> could<00:04:34.810> get<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:34.990> head<00:04:35.230> start<00:04:35.440> here

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
so that I could get a head start here

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.150 
so that I could get a head start here
and<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.700> think<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.240> what<00:04:37.420> I'd<00:04:37.570> like<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.990> do
