00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.180
 hello everyone with you agility and welcome 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.400
 to my channel today i'm doing 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.680
 another marvel transformation or 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.630
 today's scissors celebration is 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.910
 gamora and guards of the galaxy 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.679
 I know that many of them are not really 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.420
 put of film Gamora 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.670
 and so today I will try 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.680
 present you with the original comic book 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.510
 version and let's work already and 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.180
 nets otherwise I agree to the very 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.670
 premiere first thing you need to 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.149
 face painting a glass of water and a brush for 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.430
 liquid tonal basis apply makeup in 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.430
 one direction or when you dry 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.320
 get mud I was fascinated by the process and 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.320
 completely forgot about the business card 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.570
 gamor yellow stroke around the eyes for 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.820
 of this step you will need a finger 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.160
 glue that you cover your eyebrows 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.359
 take a brush for eyelashes and lift 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.039
 your hairs up 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.140
 let dry the next step take 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.770
 white pencil and start to circle 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.840
 eye area 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.509
 your task is to achieve the maximum 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.750
 symmetry and as you notice symmetry is not 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.039
 my horse 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.170
 that's why we use white 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.200
 a pencil which at any time allowing 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:38.429
 correct lines can now continue 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:41.549
 There is no work with green color 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.429
 pupils so i insert white lenses 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.880
 better to do it before applying yellow 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.880
 colors 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.799
 the second layer of makeup, walk on the brows 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.150
 to hide gaps in color 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.490
 the next step we take a brush for 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
 details and begin to circle the yellow 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 contours 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.810
 be careful with their marks will be 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.810
 very hard to fix 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.040
 now let eyes i'm using 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.470
 black makeup you can use 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.470
 eyeliner if you are so familiar 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.220
 completion we put 2 layers of bulk ink 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.290
 for eyelashes 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:37.530
 apply green color to lips 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.020
 brighter it's time for the white suit 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.980
 pencil I draw approximate lines for 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.230
 making it easier to navigate 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.560
 then I cover the suit straps in gold 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.320
 color we did it in order not to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.220
 go on the line with green make-up be 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.220
 neat in application 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.670
 after i drew a target connecting two 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.730
 skulls on the pits of our heroine I circled and 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.160
 green so as not to smear now 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.400
 without fear you can freely fill 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.400
 spaces 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.170
 this part is not particularly interesting so i 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.170
 entertain myself as best I can at this stage 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.740
 I fill the remaining spaces with black 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.380
 make-up 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.040
 it will take some time, be 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.040
 are patient 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.730
 when we turn in the chain paint over and 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.770
 and black and the second layer make glare 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.770
 silver or white flowers 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.599
 now we finish the rest details 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.599
 costume 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:04.409
 I decided to stroke all the lines 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:06.689
 so that the suit seemed more effective last 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.610
 pitch wig and volume we are 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:11.870
 make it with black shadows and 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.870
 brushes for blush 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.069
 this is a complete version of my gamor to everyone 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.199
