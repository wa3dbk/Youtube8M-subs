Bluetooth turn on Bluetooth and you see

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it can do specific functions I can even

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:52.929 
it can do specific functions I can even
load<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.159> my<00:01:41.189> camera<00:01:42.110> open<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> camera<00:01:49.790> camera

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.470 

and<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
and so you see that I

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.990 
and so you see that I
have<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> couple<00:01:56.170> apps<00:01:56.350> over<00:01:56.680> its<00:01:57.340> name<00:01:57.550> very

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000 
have a couple apps over its name very
similarly<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.200> asked<00:01:59.470> me<00:01:59.560> what<00:01:59.710> app<00:01:59.830> I'd

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
similarly so it asked me what app I'd

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.830 
similarly so it asked me what app I'd
like<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.310> open<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.030> smart<00:02:01.600> enough<00:02:01.690> to

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
like to open so it is smart enough to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.270 
like to open so it is smart enough to
know<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.110> if<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:02.560> was<00:02:02.680> an<00:02:02.800> app<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:02.950> had

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
know that if there was an app that had

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.250 
know that if there was an app that had
the<00:02:03.400> same<00:02:03.610> name<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:04.000> different<00:02:04.480> areas<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.110> it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
the same name in different areas that it

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.200 
the same name in different areas that it
would<00:02:05.380> be<00:02:05.500> able<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.830> open<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.790> in<00:02:06.940> different

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
would be able to open it up in different

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.900 
would be able to open it up in different
formats<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.220> again<00:02:09.220> hold<00:02:09.520> down<00:02:09.610> your<00:02:09.790> home
