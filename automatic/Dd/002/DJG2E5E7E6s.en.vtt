 7 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.550
 I would we know to our video 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.710
 already called 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.750
 I hardly knew how to sleep last night 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.150
 Excitement just a million clicks 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.940
 and total sum 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:46.070
 You certainly already have 150,000 people 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.900
 if it was impossible for him then it became 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.420
 Once called and then there are 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.930
 still who see I have not got it yet 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.700
 hit 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.440
 I was busy and he believes that 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.900
 skin cares for them by itself 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.580
 I think it just girls doing 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.500
 I'm really sorry and we can not 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.810
 just as resolved the website stands 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.309
 the time runs out at 3 o'clock it is over 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.500
 is not over 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.660
 You have built me ​​up as me all 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.310
 had lost hope and will now 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.100
 I as popular and universally 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.979
 Beautiful lead just the same gate 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.930
 not now where yes I want to cheer up in 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.240
 Economics we have a lot about 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.520
 Marketing learned how to meet the demand 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.740
 we can do some things with it 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.740
 Everyone is crazy about the video 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.590
 trust me my love 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:39.409
 the man therefore burned down 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:42.909
 euro and probably not julia now 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.909
 franck in imst in the height 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.140
 only 15 calls at this tempo need 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.799
 we for the million one hundred thousand 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.420
 years 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.890

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.330

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.720

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.080
 I just do not walk 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.080
