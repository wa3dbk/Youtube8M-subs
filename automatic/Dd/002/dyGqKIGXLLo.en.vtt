00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.730
 many organisms pass on their genes 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.010
 descendants during sexual reproduction this 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.019
 happens when two gametes merge with 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.869
 germ formation genetically 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.339
 other than parent organisms 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.029
 the germ then becomes an adult 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.890
 by the body 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.470
 which in turn transmits 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.870
 own genes to their descendants process 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.300
 the formation of gametes is called meiosis 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.350
 cells performing mejos for 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.770
 gamete formation 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.600
 are called germline cells in 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.309
 diploid cell organisms germ 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.350
 lines have two copies of each 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.480
 chromosomes in the meiosis process 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.579
 they form haploid gametes 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.530
 which have only one copy of each 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.500
 chromosomes of these haploid gametes 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.039
 merge forms diploid embryo 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.510
 which grows into an adult organism 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.370
 meiosis is just one of the stages 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.890
 germ cell life cycle 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.320
 lines before joining my eyes 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.950
 these cells as in the case of mitosis 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 goes through inter phase and the same 1c and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.880
 2 phases during s-phase dna in cells 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.920
 germline doubles such 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.710
 double chromosomes are called 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.140
 sister chromatids chromatids 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.810
 remain connected up to 2 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.630
 mystical cell division during 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.909
 meiosis occurs 2 cell divisions a 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.920
 the first division of meiosis leads to 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.719
 appearance of 2 unique daughter cells 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.850
 each containing half 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.729
 parental genetic material 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.130
 germline cells as a result of 2 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.409
 mystical division is formed 4 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.539
 unique haploid cells which 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.509
 have only one copy of each chromosome 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.039
 these haploid gamete cells which 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.610
 capable of engaging sexual reproduction 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.439
 for offspring 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.370
 let's take a closer look at each 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.760
 of these divisions 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.950
 meiosis begins with prophase 1 on this 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.700
 dna stage condenses forming 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.250
 chromosomes 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.930
 here we see double nursing 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 chromatids connected in the region 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.320
 centromere during first division 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.620
 meiosis 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.870
 their centromeres remain connected further 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.670
 each pair of homologous chromosomes 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.890
 undergoes conjugation 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.800
 for the formation of a complex consisting of 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.080
 two pairs of sister chromatids then 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.720
 between two pairs of sister chromatids 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.630
 there is an exchange of chromosomal material 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.540
 this process is called recombination or 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.520
 crossing over after crossing over all 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.280
 country chromatids in each chromosome 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.680
 are no longer identical each other this one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.810
 of the reasons why brothers and sisters are for 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.780
 except for twins genetically not 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.400
 identical there are some more key 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.860
 stages of prophase 1 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.350
 at this stage begins to collapse 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.030
 the nuclear envelope then two centrosomes 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.630
 diverge to opposite poles 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.070
 cell spindle appears 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.770
 microtubules then joins 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.350
 chromosomes the next phase of meiosis 1 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.209
 called metaphase 1 while 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.820
 conjugated chromosomes line up 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.860
 along the equator of the chromosome cell 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.000
 settles randomly what 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.290
 leads to the emergence of various 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.450
 combinations during each act of meiosis 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.800
 followed by anaphase one on this 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.870
 stages homologous chromosomes 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.260
 divided and diverged towards the poles 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.450
 cells notice that sister 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.540
 chromatids remain bound in the region 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.020
 centromere final stage i of meiosis 1 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.770
 this is telophase 1 and cytokinesis at this time 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.520
 cell divides into two daughter cells 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.100
 each of these cells 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.230
 now entering the second division of meiosis 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.910
 which is similar to mitosis 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.120
 meiosis 2 begins with pro phase 2 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.250
 and again chromosomes are condensed nuclear 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.310
 the shell dissolves and forms 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.130
 spindle division main difference prophase 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.500
 2 from prophase 1 in that daughter cells 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.790
 have only one copy of each 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.700
 homologous chromosomes 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.010
 therefore during prophase 2 does not occur 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.780
 conjugation of homologous chromosomes or 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.480
 crossing over 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.450
 during metaphase 2 chromosomes 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.880
 line up along the equator cell and 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.980
 again their arrangement is random because 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.200
 now sister chromatids are not the same 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.389
 There are many options for them 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.930
 lining up 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.280
 during anaphase 2 sister chromatids 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.050
 pulled apart in different directions by 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.180
 shorten microtubules go to 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.490
 division with the poles of the cell 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.279
 diverge by lengthening microtubules 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.379
 during telophase 2 is restored 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.300
 nuclear membrane and cytoplasm 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.050
 divided into two children haploid 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.500
 cells 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.750
 and this division is called cytokinesis 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.240
 since we from 2 started with two cells 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.830
 and each of these cells is divided 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.690
 in two 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.330
 then at the output of meiosis we get 4 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.330
 unique haploid cells 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.599
 these cells are called gametes two 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.400
 gametes 1 from father and 1 from mother can 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.680
 merge to form diploid 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.120
 germ 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.919
 the formed germ then grows 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.430
 by numerous methodical 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.430
 cell division
