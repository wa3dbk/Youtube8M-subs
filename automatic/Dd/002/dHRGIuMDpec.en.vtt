00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:21.670
 this sample I did with 19 points that 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.190
 are each design has 4 points 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 to that you have to add a point 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.400
 additional so that the eights remain 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.580
 perfectly symmetrical and both 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.680
 edge points the first and the last 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.940
 what are we going to do in all the lines 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:45.160
 of the right and of the back the needles that 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.790
 use were 4.5 mm or the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.820
 equivalent to the American 7 the wool is 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 half a very soft medium common frog 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.660
 the stitch is not reversible it comes out 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:03.170
 only on the right side we're going 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.770
 to do that here I just ride they go bad 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.590
 give the 19 points and then we go 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.240
 to do career number one and first 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.350
 point we make a right below 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.350
 a reverse point 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.240
 then we do in right point three 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.240
 points 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.640
 I barely have those three points with the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.890
 tip of the needle of the left hand 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.040
 I take the points I have with this do 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.620
 so that they do not jump, I take the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.500
 first point of the three that I made in 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.940
 right point 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.730
 and he passed it over the two 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.730
 and so the day is dissolved , we're going 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.410
 to repeat has been dissolved then 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.410
 I do a reverse point 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.770
 again a right point 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.259
 23 right 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.490
 He passed the first of the three rights 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.250
 over the other two tissues the others 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.690
 two rights 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.770
 that's how it goes and is loose 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.770
 a reverse point 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.319
 one 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.590
 two 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.700
 and three 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.930
 as the first one passed it over 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.170
 the two that I have 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:40.319
 in law that way I loose a backhand point 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.319
 last time 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.870
 2 and 3 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.319
 with the needle of the left hand with the 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.930
 point as the point 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.469
 what did I do first 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.030
 I spend it on medium helped me with this 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:06.469
 finger over the two other two points 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:09.859
 loose I do a reverse and finish my 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:13.189
 line or row race with a point 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.610
 right that is the edge point and we're going 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.260
 for the race number two 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.340
 this race has to do the following 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.519
 way 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:28.960
 the point of order we do it in a 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:31.620
 right below a right 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.300
 a reverse 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.110
 a loop 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.110
 a reverse 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.870
 a right 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.730
 these two points that I have here 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.420
 were the two that I took together in the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.710
 past race and in between those two is 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.710
 I do the lacing 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.160
 and in the right point we are going to do it well 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.120
 I slow down a setback 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.120
 a loop 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.260
 a reverse 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.250
 a right 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.250
 a reverse 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.520
 a loop 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.739
 a reverse point 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.810
 a right point 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.390
 and I end up with a right edge point 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.390
 and we're going to race No. 3 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:37.760
 and this race we do well 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.760
 the first point a right point 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.950
 after that right point we make a 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.950
 reverse 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:55.669
 three rights 1 2 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:58.340
 and 3 1 point backwards 3 rights so that 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.020
 let's do in a right point the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.900
 laced 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.320
 you see this the lazada we do it in a 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.860
 right point and 3 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.670
 a reverse 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.880
 one 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.990
 two 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.680
 three rights 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.960
 a reverse 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.630
 and the last time in this race 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.200
 number three a right 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.200
 two 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:34.430
 three rights the reverse point and ended 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.919
 with a right edge point at the end 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.800
 of race number three we go for the 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.229
 race number four this race 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.810
 number four is made of the following 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.810
 way the edge point 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:54.100
 a right point 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.700
 three points backwards 1 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.700
 two 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.960
 three points back a right 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:13.880
 a reverse two backwards 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.880
 3 reverse one right three points backwards 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.350
 a right point 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.350
 three points backwards 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.470
 a right point and finished the fourth and 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.360
 last race with a right point 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.790
 when they have finished the race number 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.370
 four 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:41.720
 they start again on the side of the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.250
 right the 1 2 3 4 until you achieve the long 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.380
 that you want to give the garment 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.960
 that are knitting the same to the width 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.910
 here I made 19 points but you 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.310
 they have to calculate why because 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:57.820
 they always have to make multiples of 4 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:07:00.910
 plus one additional one time 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.210
 plus the two points of 12 any doubt 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.250
 Have them go to my page how to weave 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.410
 dotcom and there they find the 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:13.200
 written instructions and of all the 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.200
 stitches that I teach them constantly
