nice horse once he's done so that's the
thing<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.470> horses<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> get

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
thing is you know if your horses you get

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
thing is you know if your horses you get
on<00:01:23.280> even<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.240> look<00:01:24.390> good<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> lunge

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
on even if they look good on the lunge

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.120 
on even if they look good on the lunge
line<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.950> they're<00:01:26.100> really

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
line you know but if they're really

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
line you know but if they're really
swaybacked<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.360> had<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> lot<00:01:27.720> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
swaybacked or have had a lot of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300 
swaybacked or have had a lot of
difficulty<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.710> hard<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> mouth

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
difficulty and really hard in the mouth

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
difficulty and really hard in the mouth
they<00:01:29.790> may<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.180> quite<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.450> while<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
they may take quite a while and I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.480 
they may take quite a while and I
suggest<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.799> start<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> walk

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
suggest that you just start in the walk

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.760 
suggest that you just start in the walk
once<00:01:32.820> again<00:01:33.090> go<00:01:33.479> through<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> gears<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.320> order

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
once again go through the gears in order

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.140 
once again go through the gears in order
if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> can't<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> horse<00:01:35.610> soft<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
if you can't get the horse soft in the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
if you can't get the horse soft in the
walk<00:01:36.299> there's<00:01:36.659> no<00:01:36.810> point<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
walk there's no point in going on to the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.929 
walk there's no point in going on to the
track<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.280> only<00:01:38.460> gonna<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.880> worse

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
track because it's only gonna get worse

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
track because it's only gonna get worse
and<00:01:39.570> every<00:01:39.930> step<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> take<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> horse

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and every step you take with the horse

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.460 
and every step you take with the horse
