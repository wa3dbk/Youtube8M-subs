00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.420
 to have a tripod carrying system 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.710
 who saw that well done here if we put 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.040

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:42.690
 a system to carry it here and we have a 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.140
 something that is effective is still a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:53.730

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.549
 well improved since we have a lot of 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.830
 additional features 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.430
 we have here a pocket in which we sell 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.680
 for example 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.090

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.720

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:30.760

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.720

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.500
 a pair of twin binoculars a 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.190
 years to whom we can put have a lot of 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.910
 things eh it's a little m for example 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.420
 a camouflage net on loan 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.229
 open can even squarely 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 santa fe what does it contain then 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.410
 inside the interior we see there by 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.720
 a small example of what we can put 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.580
 in can put a lot of things on 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.509
 see here that's 1 405 6 1 are list 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.180
 of 102 8 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.870
 we still have a great time tool 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.330
 the macro objective we can put 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.340
 possibly maybe a flash trick 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.590
 here we have a big pocket with 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.209
 small details of a protection 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.320
 for easter the loop come shine 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.700
 the objective still pockets here 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.860
 really a bag that very well designed 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.560
 so he is in addition to his all weather 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:51.230
 it means that in case of heavy rain 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:56.510
 we have the possibility here to take out this bag 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.670
 who will protect him from sand and 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.860
 bad weather that can damage the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.890
 material at the portage level 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.890
 we have something who is who who 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.680
 comfortable 1 is not the minimum 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:15.140
 union we really have something 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.690
 here there seems enough if it's good if 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.739
 it's crazy as I said just now 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.350
 it takes a portage on the belt 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.299
 basically not on the shoulders need 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.180
 tighten the belt is important 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.320
 so we in 702 5 turkey will not wear 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.600
 a long distance 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.780
