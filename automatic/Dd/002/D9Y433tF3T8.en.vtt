different compared to the original xbox
controller<00:01:54.250> thumbsticks<00:01:55.250> are<00:01:55.549> more<00:01:56.330> raised

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
controller thumbsticks are more raised

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.809 
controller thumbsticks are more raised
than<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.259> actual<00:01:57.439> original<00:01:57.830> actual<00:01:58.700> original

than the actual original actual original

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.749 
than the actual original actual original
the<00:01:59.149> original<00:01:59.289> xbox<00:02:00.289> controllers<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.610> has

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
the original xbox controllers so it has

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.870 
the original xbox controllers so it has
that<00:02:01.789> feel<00:02:02.179> as<00:02:02.390> if<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.750> have<00:02:02.929> FPS<00:02:03.350> freeks<00:02:03.880> then

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
that feel as if you have FPS freeks then

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.699 
that feel as if you have FPS freeks then
that's<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.539> resistance<00:02:06.020> basically<00:02:06.590> I'm<00:02:06.679> just

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
that's the resistance basically I'm just

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.660 
that's the resistance basically I'm just
showing<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.280> how<00:02:07.759> loose<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.369> I

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
showing you that how loose it is and I I

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.630 
showing you that how loose it is and I I
tighten<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.209> all<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.420> way<00:02:11.510> right<00:02:11.660> here<00:02:11.720> and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
tighten it all the way right here and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.000 
tighten it all the way right here and
you<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.760> see<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:13.970> like<00:02:14.180> stiff<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.630> guy<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.170> said

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
you can see I like stiff a guy I said

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.460 
you can see I like stiff a guy I said
God<00:02:17.799> so<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:19.730> resistance<00:02:20.349> basically<00:02:21.349> I'm<00:02:21.440> just

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
God so the resistance basically I'm just

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.720 
God so the resistance basically I'm just
going<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.739> write<00:02:21.860> everything<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.400> controller

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
going to write everything the controller

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.539 
going to write everything the controller
itself<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.209> far<00:02:23.450> has<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.769> has<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.799> 10<00:02:25.280> out<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.459> 10

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
itself so far has a has a 10 out of 10

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.060 
itself so far has a has a 10 out of 10
the<00:02:25.910> resistance<00:02:26.359> the<00:02:26.600> resistant<00:02:27.140> adjustable

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
the resistance the resistant adjustable

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.759 
the resistance the resistant adjustable
resistant<00:02:28.670> thumbsticks<00:02:29.359> things<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:30.530> gives<00:02:30.680> a

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
resistant thumbsticks things it gives a

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.860 
resistant thumbsticks things it gives a
10<00:02:30.950> out<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.100> 10<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.519> I'm<00:02:32.329> just<00:02:32.570> showing<00:02:32.690> you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
10 out of 10 and I'm just showing you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.530 
10 out of 10 and I'm just showing you
like<00:02:33.140> my<00:02:33.350> settings<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.829> i<00:02:33.859> have<00:02:34.100> it's<00:02:34.340> a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
like my settings that i have it's a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.759 
like my settings that i have it's a
loosen<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.630> all<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.959> way<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.410> then<00:02:36.500> tighten

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
loosen it all the way and then tighten

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.890 
loosen it all the way and then tighten
it<00:02:37.069> eleven<00:02:37.459> klicks<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> right<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.299> just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
it eleven klicks to the right I just

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.380 
it eleven klicks to the right I just
farted<00:02:39.079> but<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.410> was<00:02:39.530> silent<00:02:39.709> Oh

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
farted but it was silent Oh

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.660 
farted but it was silent Oh
I<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:42.319> I<00:02:42.350> proved<00:02:42.530> my<00:02:42.650> pants<00:02:42.950> no<00:02:43.490> I'm<00:02:43.550> just

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
I think I proved my pants no I'm just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.960 
I think I proved my pants no I'm just
kidding<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.120> took<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.840> poop<00:02:45.020> in<00:02:45.140> my<00:02:45.200> pants<00:02:45.500> uh

kidding I took a poop in my pants uh
right<00:02:46.970> here<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.600> triggers<00:02:47.990> are<00:02:48.140> amazing<00:02:48.650> if

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
right here the triggers are amazing if

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.980 
right here the triggers are amazing if
you<00:02:48.860> play<00:02:49.010> paintball<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:50.180> feels<00:02:50.450> just

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
you play paintball it's it feels just

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.870 
you play paintball it's it feels just
like<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.440> just<00:02:52.130> like<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.370> paintball<00:02:52.640> pretty

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
like the just like that paintball pretty

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.070 
like the just like that paintball pretty
much<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.120> feels<00:02:53.390> exactly<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.750> paintball

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
much just feels exactly the paintball

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.870 
much just feels exactly the paintball
toria<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.459> have<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:57.440> four

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
toria then you have the to the four

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.500 
toria then you have the to the four
bumpers<00:02:58.880> microdrum<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:02:59.830> focuses<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:02.240> top

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
bumpers microdrum I'm focuses the top

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.050 
bumpers microdrum I'm focuses the top
left<00:03:02.750> bumper<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.230> for<00:03:03.530> switching<00:03:04.100> weapons<00:03:04.520> and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
left bumper is for switching weapons and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.080 
left bumper is for switching weapons and
at<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.390> top<00:03:05.600> right<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:05.930> for<00:03:06.350> reloading<00:03:06.650> and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
at the top right is for reloading and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.310 
at the top right is for reloading and
obviously<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.209> bottom<00:03:08.480> lb<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:08.989> repeated

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
obviously the bottom lb and I repeated

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.110 
obviously the bottom lb and I repeated
the<00:03:09.380> same<00:03:09.500> things<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:10.580> can<00:03:10.700> see<00:03:10.850> that's<00:03:11.030> a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the same things you can see that's a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.699 
the same things you can see that's a
trigger<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.930> trigger<00:03:12.140> design<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.560> different

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
trigger the trigger design is different

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.500 
trigger the trigger design is different
too<00:03:13.010> as<00:03:13.220> well<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.640> then<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.820> buttons<00:03:14.180> are<00:03:14.330> low

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
too as well and then the buttons are low

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.140 
too as well and then the buttons are low
profile<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.230> response<00:03:15.860> time<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.150> just

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
profile so this response time is just

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.410 
profile so this response time is just
phenomenal<00:03:17.650> then<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.770> have<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.220> epad<00:03:20.150> it's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
phenomenal then you have the epad it's

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.030 
phenomenal then you have the epad it's
not<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.720> clunky<00:03:21.019> it's<00:03:21.320> easy<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.950> you

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
not so clunky it's easy it that you

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.160 
not so clunky it's easy it that you
don't<00:03:22.130> press<00:03:22.610> right<00:03:23.420> if<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.660> mean<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.840> go<00:03:23.989> down

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
don't press right if you mean to go down

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.170 
don't press right if you mean to go down
so<00:03:24.590> let's<00:03:25.010> go<00:03:25.100> ahead<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.250> turn<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.550> on<00:03:25.640> and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
so let's go ahead and turn it on and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.530 
so let's go ahead and turn it on and
then<00:03:27.190> hold<00:03:28.190> on<00:03:29.080> as<00:03:30.080> you<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.350> see<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:31.370> B<00:03:32.120> X<00:03:32.150> Y

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
then hold on as you can see the a B X Y

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.080 
then hold on as you can see the a B X Y
buttons<00:03:32.930> are<00:03:33.200> backlit<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.310> that's<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.060> don't

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
buttons are backlit so that's I don't

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.050 
buttons are backlit so that's I don't
even<00:03:35.420> that's<00:03:35.480> only<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:35.750> torment<00:03:36.230> edition<00:03:37.060> and

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
even that's only on torment edition and

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.670 
even that's only on torment edition and
it<00:03:38.090> has<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.269> braided<00:03:38.810> cable<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.350> doesn't<00:03:39.620> get

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
it has a braided cable so it doesn't get

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.670 
it has a braided cable so it doesn't get
tangled<00:03:39.830> up<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.370> uh<00:03:41.230> basically<00:03:42.230> that's<00:03:42.470> been

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
tangled up but uh basically that's been

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.710 
tangled up but uh basically that's been
in<00:03:42.800> somewhat<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.550> an<00:03:43.700> unboxing<00:03:43.970> basically

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
in somewhat of an unboxing basically

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.880 
in somewhat of an unboxing basically
what<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.019> get<00:03:45.170> when<00:03:45.320> you<00:03:45.440> open<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.860> box

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
what you get when you open the box

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.759 
what you get when you open the box
itself<00:03:46.519> what<00:03:47.299> you<00:03:47.420> get<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.780> what<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.380> is<00:03:48.500> so

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
itself what you get and what it is so

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.620 
itself what you get and what it is so
I'll<00:03:49.160> have<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.340> review<00:03:49.700> on<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:49.940> controller<00:03:50.360> in

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
I'll have a review on this controller in

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.539 
I'll have a review on this controller in
a<00:03:50.720> day<00:03:50.900> or<00:03:51.049> two<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.380> got<00:03:52.190> used<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.519> it

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
a day or two I got used to it

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.310 
a day or two I got used to it
immediately<00:03:52.820> it's<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.720> don't<00:03:54.049> have<00:03:54.140> any

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
immediately it's I don't have any
