so<00:00:31.840> before<00:00:32.110> I<00:00:32.140> go<00:00:32.320> any<00:00:32.470> further<00:00:32.500> I<00:00:32.830> guess<00:00:33.070> I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
so before I go any further I guess I

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.760 
so before I go any further I guess I
kind<00:00:33.400> of<00:00:33.430> wanted<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:33.850> just<00:00:34.060> take<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.270> quick<00:00:35.140> note

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
kind of wanted to just take a quick note

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
kind of wanted to just take a quick note
of<00:00:36.010> where<00:00:36.190> I'm<00:00:36.280> at<00:00:36.460> right<00:00:36.670> now<00:00:36.730> before<00:00:37.240> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
of where I'm at right now before I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.450 
of where I'm at right now before I
totally<00:00:38.350> kind<00:00:38.560> of<00:00:38.620> not<00:00:38.890> really<00:00:39.100> change<00:00:39.310> out

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
totally kind of not really change out

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.920 
totally kind of not really change out
the<00:00:39.550> system<00:00:39.850> but<00:00:40.000> before<00:00:40.210> I<00:00:40.270> do<00:00:40.330> changes<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.840> my

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
the system but before I do changes to my

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.350 
the system but before I do changes to my
box<00:00:41.140> I<00:00:41.470> don't<00:00:42.070> know<00:00:42.130> if<00:00:42.220> you<00:00:42.280> notice<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:43.180> down

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
box I don't know if you notice that down

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.110 
box I don't know if you notice that down
there<00:00:43.570> but<00:00:43.840> I've<00:00:44.620> changed<00:00:45.040> it<00:00:45.100> over<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.760> fact

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
there but I've changed it over to a fact

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.210 
there but I've changed it over to a fact
to<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.300> slop<00:00:46.540> port<00:00:46.870> at<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.020> moment<00:00:47.350> but<00:00:48.010> I've

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
to a slop port at the moment but I've

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.010 
to a slop port at the moment but I've
gone<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.640> longer<00:00:49.059> slop<00:00:49.330> port<00:00:49.600> I'm<00:00:49.750> at<00:00:49.900> about

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
gone to a longer slop port I'm at about

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.950 
gone to a longer slop port I'm at about
three<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.470> half<00:00:50.620> inches<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:52.059> 36<00:00:52.450> right<00:00:52.840> now

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
three and a half inches by 36 right now

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.750 
three and a half inches by 36 right now
which<00:00:53.230> if<00:00:53.380> you<00:00:53.500> do<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.710> math<00:00:53.890> from<00:00:54.430> roughly

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
which if you do the math from roughly

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.320 
which if you do the math from roughly
Ghent<00:00:54.970> about<00:00:55.120> 60<00:00:55.510> inches<00:00:55.600> of<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.580> poor<00:00:57.580> perso

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
Ghent about 60 inches of a poor perso

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.310 
Ghent about 60 inches of a poor perso
right<00:00:58.900> now<00:00:59.050> which<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.260> given<00:01:00.070> me<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.190> 1.5

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
right now which is given me a 1.5

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.619 
right now which is given me a 1.5
resistance<00:01:02.320> on<00:01:02.440> my<00:01:02.589> box<00:01:02.830> right<00:01:03.190> now<00:01:03.540> what<00:01:04.540> I've

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
resistance on my box right now what I've

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.870 
resistance on my box right now what I've
also<00:01:04.780> done<00:01:04.960> recently<00:01:05.500> here<00:01:06.070> has<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.460> yesterday

also done recently here has of yesterday
as<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.660> can<00:01:07.870> see<00:01:07.990> I've<00:01:08.200> added<00:01:08.620> my<00:01:09.070> second<00:01:09.610> 10k

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
as you can see I've added my second 10k

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.760 
as you can see I've added my second 10k
onto<00:01:10.840> here<00:01:10.990> right<00:01:11.200> now<00:01:11.350> it's<00:01:11.470> just<00:01:11.500> kind<00:01:11.710> of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
onto here right now it's just kind of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.149 
onto here right now it's just kind of
temporarily<00:01:12.180> added<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.570> need<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.470> kind<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.920> make

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
temporarily added I need to kind of make

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
season which I haven't done yet I just

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.070 
season which I haven't done yet I just
did<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.470> quick<00:01:20.650> clamp<00:01:20.920> just<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.700> second<00:01:22.000> ago<00:01:22.090> just

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
did a quick clamp just a second ago just

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.149 
did a quick clamp just a second ago just
kind<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.290> see<00:01:23.409> where<00:01:23.530> I'm<00:01:23.590> at<00:01:23.740> I'm<00:01:23.860> actually

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
kind of see where I'm at I'm actually

kind of see where I'm at I'm actually
kinda<00:01:24.730> I'm<00:01:25.150> currently<00:01:25.840> wired<00:01:26.320> up<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.740> four

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
kinda I'm currently wired up to four

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.210 
kinda I'm currently wired up to four
ohms<00:01:27.159> right<00:01:28.060> now<00:01:28.270> just<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.170> see<00:01:29.350> what<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.950> amps

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
ohms right now just to see what the amps

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.680 
ohms right now just to see what the amps
are<00:01:30.340> doing<00:01:30.550> for<00:01:30.760> me<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:30.940> just<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.330> kind<00:01:31.510> of<00:01:31.540> see

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
where we're at for our stress level on

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.870 
where we're at for our stress level on
the<00:01:33.790> speakers<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.270> everybody<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.310> I'm

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the speakers and everybody and I'm

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.980 
the speakers and everybody and I'm
liking<00:01:37.090> what<00:01:37.270> I'm<00:01:37.360> seeing<00:01:37.420> actually<00:01:37.930> I'm

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
liking what I'm seeing actually I'm

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.210 
liking what I'm seeing actually I'm
gonna<00:01:38.110> actually<00:01:38.440> go<00:01:38.620> after<00:01:38.890> one<00:01:39.070> ohm<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:40.630> these

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
gonna actually go after one ohm on these

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.340 
gonna actually go after one ohm on these
and<00:01:42.240> kind<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.330> go<00:01:43.480> from<00:01:43.510> there<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.840> just<00:01:43.960> clean

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
and kind of go from there I just clean

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.960 
and kind of go from there I just clean
up<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.560> actually<00:01:44.830> roughly<00:01:45.010> about<00:01:45.220> 3000<00:01:45.850> and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
up to actually roughly about 3000 and

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.310 
up to actually roughly about 3000 and
some<00:01:46.150> watts<00:01:46.590> each<00:01:47.590> amp<00:01:48.150> at<00:01:49.150> 4<00:01:49.450> ohms<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.050> we're

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
some watts each amp at 4 ohms so we're

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.890 
some watts each amp at 4 ohms so we're
doing<00:01:50.560> pretty<00:01:50.710> good<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.480> said<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.720> is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
doing pretty good like I said this is

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.780 
doing pretty good like I said this is
just<00:01:53.080> kind<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.350> an<00:01:53.470> update<00:01:53.860> video<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.700> to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
just kind of an update video just to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.330 
just kind of an update video just to
kind<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:58.080> get<00:01:59.080> idea<00:01:59.470> of<00:01:59.560> what's<00:01:59.740> going<00:01:59.950> on<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.310> I

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
kind of get idea of what's going on so I

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.720 
kind of get idea of what's going on so I
don't<00:02:00.520> get<00:02:00.640> too<00:02:00.790> far<00:02:01.030> ahead<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.920> not<00:02:03.580> know

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
don't get too far ahead and not know

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.900 
don't get too far ahead and not know
what's<00:02:03.940> going<00:02:04.300> on<00:02:04.450> as<00:02:05.290> far<00:02:05.560> as<00:02:05.740> my<00:02:05.950> what<00:02:06.760> I've

what's going on as far as my what I've

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.480 
what's going on as far as my what I've
done<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.300> past
