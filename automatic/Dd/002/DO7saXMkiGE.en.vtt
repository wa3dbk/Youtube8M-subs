00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 Hello and welcome to the 10th 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.200
 no idea that one has this mettmann 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.700
 is spoken after I'm straight 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.750
 a round around block drove like that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.699
 A bit of a long way down 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.020
 and has me but I speak now 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.010
 a little bit because the audio quality and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.000
 always a little better 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.560
 also have a kind of video now 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.590
 just because I like to show 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.590
 would like to 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.410
 More mettmann we always talk about 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.149
 topics about which we can argue or 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 what you can philosophize about something like that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.750
 shut up today's theme I have me 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 selected wealth and that what 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.079
 Actually we have definitely enough 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.719
 wealth and i want from the beginning 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.059
 we say now not talking something like 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.520
 a shit or i do not need money 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.140
 i have my family so its 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.160
 sisters if you are of wealth 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.160
 counter-speech banks found 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.090
 who gives me money in wealth 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.810
 thinks it either stupid or he struggles and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.460
 that's just how it is good 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.870
 still together, pretty much everyone 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.200
 defines wealth that some people 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.060
 some people are wealthy if that's what 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.700
 I go to the cinema three times a week 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.430
 for some it is enough if they are too 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 clearly have the food on the table 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.510
 definition of wealth it first much 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.860
 to have something in the case of money 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840
 because as I said affection and love 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.130
 does not count for me as wealth that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 me such a burden for me 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.580
 of course, depending on the social fringe groups 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:45.440
 but depending on social jena depending on 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.440
 depending on how fortune man is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.789
 Of course, the wealth is complete 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.100
 different for some is the wealth 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.590
 The standards for Raich begin 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.289
 set relatively low and some 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.259
 relatively high up in the sense of I 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.020
 my a beach house in mallorca and 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.009
 that is wealth for me 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.170
 then there are people who say stop 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.579
 yes I am rich for me when I am one 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.580
 own car and drive around with it 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.209
 I can have a very clear one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.480
 definition of wealth and that is 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.319
 wealth for me actually is then 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.900
 If you can and if that sounds funny 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.360
 but sound like every day in 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.260
 a local restaurant if you are 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.019
 every day in a higher class 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.700
 restaurant food can go without 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.670
 to think about how much you pay 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.390
 because I'm also so I 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.040
 eating three four times a month is easy 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.860
 pleasant to say you have to go eat 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.480
 really nice steak or something for 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.500
 It is enough for me every day 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.239
 can eat 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.190
 in a restaurant a good one 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.550
 restaurant and does not worry 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.470
 somehow now calculations so far 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.390
 restaurant visit can be around 300 euros 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 cost 200 euros would be that in any case 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.550
 creates without worrying too 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.860
 have any other issues then 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.130
 is achieved and wants for me wealth 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.200
 I am interested in you 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.420
 Of course many people say hey man 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.220
 expensive stuff is you rich me 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.470
 my I wear too much lacoste 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.310
 I also cost 90 of my polo shirt 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.760
 euro and I are not now 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.480
 really rich so you have to say 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.560
 i do not really live high class or 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.020
 as it is called, I did not hear anything 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.640
 the word dispensed I just pull myself 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.930
 just like expensive things because I like the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.950
 quality of the improved but that is 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.120
 another thing will be over once 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.440
 Brand products do not make products 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.960
 talk some people say yes also 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.490
 somehow yes I should there is only one 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.570
 crocodile sewn on it therefore are not 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.280
 So no, so my opinion very clear 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.690
 if you can go to the restaurant everyone 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.560
 day without worrying that one 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.740
 Other issues this time are enough 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.510
 then you have enough of something and that is 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.600
 I believe correct definition so much 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.420
 or enough of something have my opinion 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.120
 will interest me your opinion and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.410
 I use that to mention briefly 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.730
 I have a second act what they all 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.440
 which does not have to do all around roller 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.459
 he finds on this channel the link is 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.440

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.840
 click on it is called reittv if you like that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.280

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.359

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.660
 nonsense among others a cellar I 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.130
 just remodeling but also other things the 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.430
 I do not necessarily show 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.880
 maybe even in the day or else 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.880
