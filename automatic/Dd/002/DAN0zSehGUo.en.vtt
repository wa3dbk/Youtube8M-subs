00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
so far so that looks pretty good as well

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.420 
so far so that looks pretty good as well
but<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.260> typically<00:03:10.709> like<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.949> stay<00:03:11.189> with<00:03:11.219> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
but I typically like to stay with the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.250 
but I typically like to stay with the
dark<00:03:11.609> color<00:03:11.819> that's<00:03:11.969> just<00:03:12.209> me<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:13.109> can

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
choose from a few options here again not

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.179 
choose from a few options here again not
a<00:03:14.939> whole<00:03:15.150> lot<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.419> options<00:03:15.810> no<00:03:16.469> notification
