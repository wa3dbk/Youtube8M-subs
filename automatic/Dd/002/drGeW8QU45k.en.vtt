 15 rugby for this ninth episode 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.640
 we will continue to talk about scrum 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.150
 closed including faults and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 simulations 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.210
 if you want to see the first 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.170
 part follow the link that is in 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.170
 the description of this video 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.559
 the scrum half who introduced the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.059
 balloon must do it in the lax of the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.480
 scrum and not to the back of his 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.070
 pack 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 players who do not participate in the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.309
 scrum must be more than 10 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.340
 meters behind the feet of the number 8 of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.229
 his team the opposing scrum half can 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 stay with his back ten meters from 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.619
 the melee can also be placed 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.240
 at the level of the scrum it can not then 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.280
 move only in a defined area 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 by two imaginary lines that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.580
 going through the balloon and the passing 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.580
 by the feet of a mother 8 of his team 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.550
 it happens that the melee swings to more than 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.500
 90 degrees from its axis of 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.479
 departure six voluntary states have joined 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 the city council if it decides that one of the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.750
 two teams is turning voluntarily 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.220
 the scrum it gives a free kick if that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.909
 him before the introduction of the balloon and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.350
 a penalty 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.350
 if the ball has been introduced 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.960
 it also happens that the first two 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 lines is standing under the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.650
 huge pressure of the two packs 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.610
 referee plays the scrum but it's a 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.050
 team dominates so heavy they 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.729
 will raise the first line opponent 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.500
 a penalty is awarded to the team 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.970
 dominant what is players 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 voluntarily push up 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.450
 their opponents 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 the abbreviation meaning is a penalty if 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.030
 players stand up voluntarily 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.890
 under the pressure of the opposing pack a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.040
 penalty is awarded to the team 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.040
 dominated 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 it also happens that a scrum 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.140
 collapses according to the reason 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.940
 referee can replay the scrum 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.500
 if there was a bad contact at the time 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.270
 link between the two packs or if the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.780
 players slipped or sanctioned a 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.010
 penalty 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.450
 the team whose players did not 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.680
 properly related to each other or if 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.680
 collapses voluntarily from the town hall 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.580
 when a scrum at five meters and 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.830
 ordered several times and that the defense 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.360
 gets dominated outrageously it happens 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.040
 that the defense pack multiplies 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.900
 voluntarily fouls in melee 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.459
 if the arbitrator considers that the defense has 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.050
 too many mistakes he can decide on a 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.090
 penalty test against the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.840
 defense because faults hinders year 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.840
 it is able to produce 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.129
 when one of the two teams can no longer 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.930
 aligned first two lines for 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.030
 injury issues the scrum is 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.530
 simulated this is to make a scrum 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.819
 without pushing and that the ball is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.209
 always recovered by the team that 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.209
 introduced 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.680
 so finishes this ninth episode we 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.450
 will talk in the next episode of 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.200
 offside what happens is extremely 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.120
