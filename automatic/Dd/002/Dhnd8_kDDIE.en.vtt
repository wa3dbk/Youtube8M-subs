that the lights that indicate the modes

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
that the lights that indicate the modes
aren't<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.990> different<00:02:01.500> in

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
as either blue in the turquoise so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.169 
as either blue in the turquoise so
you'll<00:02:07.590> know<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.069> changing<00:02:08.549> modes<00:02:08.849> by

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you'll know you're changing modes by

you'll know you're changing modes by
MIPS<00:02:09.539> behavior<00:02:10.110> you'll<00:02:10.769> find<00:02:11.039> there's<00:02:11.189> a<00:02:11.250> bit

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
MIPS behavior you'll find there's a bit
