only place that you can actually get a

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.859 
only place that you can actually get a
great<00:00:17.740> car<00:00:18.040> we<00:00:18.730> know<00:00:18.939> that<00:00:19.150> if<00:00:19.240> we<00:00:19.360> develop<00:00:19.779> a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
great car we know that if we develop a

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.530 
great car we know that if we develop a
car<00:00:20.110> here<00:00:20.410> we're<00:00:21.009> going<00:00:21.250> to<00:00:21.340> have<00:00:21.579> the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
car here we're going to have the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.630 
car here we're going to have the
excellence<00:00:23.110> and<00:00:23.320> technology<00:00:24.310> and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
excellence and technology and

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.179 
excellence and technology and
engineering<00:00:24.820> that<00:00:25.270> we<00:00:25.480> need<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.890> make<00:00:27.040> our

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
engineering that we need to make our

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.339 
engineering that we need to make our
products<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.669> best<00:00:27.849> so<00:00:28.809> when<00:00:28.930> we<00:00:29.050> looked<00:00:29.230> at

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
products the best so when we looked at

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.049 
products the best so when we looked at
what<00:00:29.649> we're<00:00:29.770> going<00:00:29.950> to<00:00:30.009> do<00:00:30.160> for<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.399> VF

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
what we're going to do for a VF

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.319 
what we're going to do for a VF
after<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.750> huge<00:00:32.290> success<00:00:32.349> of<00:00:32.800> ve<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:34.149> you

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
after the huge success of ve and you

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.020 
after the huge success of ve and you
keep<00:00:34.570> that<00:00:35.140> progression<00:00:35.590> of<00:00:35.980> engineering<00:00:36.820> and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
keep that progression of engineering and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.150 
keep that progression of engineering and
design<00:00:37.059> going<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:38.200> get<00:00:38.470> something<00:00:38.770> like<00:00:38.830> the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
design going you get something like the

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.410 
design going you get something like the
new<00:00:39.280> VF<00:00:39.640> I<00:00:40.650> gave<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:41.830> guys<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.010> brief<00:00:42.460> early<00:00:43.300> on

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
new VF I gave the guys a brief early on

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.620 
new VF I gave the guys a brief early on
in<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.630> program<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:44.620> make<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.370> more<00:00:45.880> edgy<00:00:46.330> make

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
in the program to make it more edgy make

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.500 
in the program to make it more edgy make
it<00:00:46.840> more<00:00:47.140> of<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.350> sports<00:00:47.650> car<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.790> content<00:00:49.300> that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
it more of a sports car the content that

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.350 
it more of a sports car the content that
exists<00:00:50.020> within<00:00:50.230> redline<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.130> that<00:00:51.610> make<00:00:52.090> it<00:00:52.240> a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
exists within redline and that make it a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.130 
exists within redline and that make it a
redline<00:00:52.570> is<00:00:53.500> really<00:00:54.040> about<00:00:54.310> three<00:00:54.700> things

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
redline is really about three things

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.650 
redline is really about three things
stop<00:00:56.140> go<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.860> turn<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.820> go<00:00:57.970> we<00:00:58.150> always<00:00:58.420> have

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
stop go and turn the go we always have

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.020 
stop go and turn the go we always have
we<00:00:58.960> have<00:00:59.170> v8<00:00:59.560> what<00:01:00.160> we've<00:01:00.310> done<00:01:00.460> with<00:01:00.610> redline

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
we have v8 what we've done with redline

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.760 
we have v8 what we've done with redline
with<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.630> addition<00:01:01.930> of<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.110> Brembo<00:01:02.470> brakes

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
with the addition of the Brembo brakes

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.030 
with the addition of the Brembo brakes
and<00:01:03.100> now<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.700> split<00:01:04.119> tires<00:01:04.420> front<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.350> rear<00:01:05.530> is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
and now the split tires front to rear is

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.679 
and now the split tires front to rear is
we've<00:01:06.280> added<00:01:06.399> an<00:01:06.610> enormous<00:01:07.030> amount<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.450> group

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
we've added an enormous amount of group

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.350 
we've added an enormous amount of group
and<00:01:08.079> particularly<00:01:09.040> precision<00:01:09.970> around

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
and particularly precision around

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.960 
and particularly precision around
steering<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:11.500> everything<00:01:11.950> started<00:01:12.430> with<00:01:12.850> the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
steering so everything started with the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.730 
steering so everything started with the
tires<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.670> VF<00:01:16.330> range<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.350> first<00:01:17.560> time

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
tires so the VF range is the first time

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.200 
tires so the VF range is the first time
on<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.159> redline<00:01:18.580> series<00:01:18.970> that<00:01:19.090> we've

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
on the redline series that we've

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.149 
on the redline series that we've
introduced<00:01:19.750> split<00:01:20.229> tires<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:20.799> we're<00:01:20.950> running

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
introduced split tires so we're running

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.789 
introduced split tires so we're running
a<00:01:21.220> 245<00:01:21.790> front<00:01:22.090> tire<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.570> at<00:01:22.659> 275<00:01:23.290> rear<00:01:23.560> tire

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
a 245 front tire and at 275 rear tire

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.100 
a 245 front tire and at 275 rear tire
that's<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.610> significant<00:01:25.540> change<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.930> the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
that's a significant change to the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.719 
that's a significant change to the
vehicle<00:01:26.530> balance<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:27.070> gives<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.280> really<00:01:27.460> good

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
vehicle balance it gives you really good

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.340 
vehicle balance it gives you really good
traction<00:01:27.790> out<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.780> corners<00:01:29.080> because<00:01:29.229> you've

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
traction out of corners because you've

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.469 
traction out of corners because you've
got<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.560> wide<00:01:29.710> rear<00:01:30.159> tire<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:30.940> starting<00:01:31.360> with

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
got the wide rear tire so starting with

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.880 
got the wide rear tire so starting with
that<00:01:31.540> we<00:01:31.840> work<00:01:32.020> our<00:01:32.229> way<00:01:32.260> back<00:01:32.590> through<00:01:32.620> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
that we work our way back through the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.350 
that we work our way back through the
rest<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.400> car<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> suspension

rest of the car and the suspension
development<00:01:35.049> that<00:01:35.260> goes<00:01:35.409> with<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:35.979> has<00:01:36.280> led

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
development that goes with that has led

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.649 
development that goes with that has led
to<00:01:36.990> changes<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.650> way<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:39.159> we<00:01:39.369> we<00:01:40.180> do<00:01:40.360> our

driving around in which case it has a
sporting<00:01:48.850> character<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:50.530> there's<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.799> second

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
sporting character then there's a second

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.850 
sporting character then there's a second

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
the track you press the button it

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.929 
the track you press the button it
changes<00:01:56.560> not<00:01:56.680> only<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:57.010> steering<00:01:57.430> tuning<00:01:57.790> but

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
changes not only the steering tuning but

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.490 
changes not only the steering tuning but
it<00:01:58.060> also<00:01:58.210> changes<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.869> stability<00:01:59.320> control

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
it also changes the stability control

possibly could we did have some ideas in

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
mind about how fast the year goes and

it's<00:02:34.459> fair<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.790> say<00:02:34.849> that<00:02:35.299> I<00:02:35.540> think<00:02:36.349> we've

it's fair to say that I think we've

it's fair to say that I think we've

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
exceeded what we thought we could do but
