00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
system as we all know young and it's you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210 
system as we all know young and it's you
know<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.259> average<00:01:46.259> rotation<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

sun is like one degree per day yeah one

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.130 
sun is like one degree per day yeah one
degree<00:01:52.350> per<00:01:52.409> day<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.700> takes<00:01:53.880> exactly<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.540> one

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
degree per day so it takes exactly a one

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.120
