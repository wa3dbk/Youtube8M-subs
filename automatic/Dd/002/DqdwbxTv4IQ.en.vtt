deploy them and using them okay well if

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.919

Congress<00:00:28.800> allows<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.550> drones<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.689> sold

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
Congress allows these drones to be sold

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.749 
Congress allows these drones to be sold
to<00:00:31.050> South<00:00:31.230> Korea<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> think<00:00:32.489> will<00:00:32.610> happen

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
to South Korea what I think will happen

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
to South Korea what I think will happen
is<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.600> they<00:00:33.930> will<00:00:34.110> use<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.680> drones<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
is that they will use these drones to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
is that they will use these drones to
monitor<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.480> demilitarized<00:00:37.380> zones<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
monitor of the demilitarized zones of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.680 
monitor of the demilitarized zones of
the<00:00:37.980> South<00:00:38.160> Korean<00:00:38.579> border<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.300> could<00:00:39.480> also

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the South Korean border they could also

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930 
the South Korean border they could also
potentially<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.710> used<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.250> monitor<00:00:41.460> North

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
potentially be used to monitor North

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
potentially be used to monitor North
Koreans<00:00:42.390> North<00:00:43.140> Korea's<00:00:43.410> nuclear<00:00:43.440> facilities

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
Koreans North Korea's nuclear facilities

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
Koreans North Korea's nuclear facilities
however<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.510> remember<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.960> North

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
however we have to remember that North

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.319 
however we have to remember that North
Korea<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:46.649> warned<00:00:47.100> many<00:00:47.250> times<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:48.149> its

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
Korea has warned many times but its

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
Korea has warned many times but its
territorial<00:00:48.960> integrity<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:50.070> will

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
territorial integrity so I think will

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.700 
territorial integrity so I think will
happen<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.329> South<00:00:51.690> Korean<00:00:52.050> drones<00:00:52.350> for

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
happen is if South Korean drones for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
happen is if South Korean drones for
example<00:00:53.070> penetrate<00:00:53.550> North<00:00:53.789> Korean<00:00:54.120> airspace

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
example penetrate North Korean airspace

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
example penetrate North Korean airspace
this<00:00:55.170> could<00:00:55.410> potentially<00:00:55.500> start<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.489> huge

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this could potentially start a huge

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.209 
this could potentially start a huge
conflict<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.230> look<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> results

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
conflict and if we look at the results

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
conflict and if we look at the results
of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> latest<00:00:59.489> South<00:00:59.850> Korean<00:01:00.180> elections<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
of the latest South Korean elections the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.290 
of the latest South Korean elections the
president-elect<00:01:01.800> Park<00:01:02.340> geun-hye<00:01:02.399> she

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
president-elect Park geun-hye she

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.090 
president-elect Park geun-hye she
campaigned<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> model<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.909> preaching

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
campaigned on a model of preaching

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
campaigned on a model of preaching
improved<00:01:08.100> relations<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.820> North<00:01:09.060> Korea

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
improved relations with North Korea

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.030 
improved relations with North Korea
feeling<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:10.080> easier<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.500> counting

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
feeling a little bit easier on counting

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250 
feeling a little bit easier on counting
but<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.330> shows<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.960> by

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
but I think what this shows is that by

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
but I think what this shows is that by
purchasing<00:01:13.770> these<00:01:13.979> drones<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.729> having<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
purchasing these drones are having the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
purchasing these drones are having the
intention<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.810> least<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.409> ruling<00:01:16.680> party

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
intention to at least the ruling party

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
intention to at least the ruling party
doesn't<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.729> any<00:01:17.880> plans<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.840> change

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
doesn't really have any plans to change

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.149 
doesn't really have any plans to change
its<00:01:19.619> foreign<00:01:20.250> policy<00:01:20.280> trajectory<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
its foreign policy trajectory and you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.499 
its foreign policy trajectory and you
say<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> drones<00:01:23.970> actually<00:01:24.299> cross

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
say that if the drones actually cross

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.690 
say that if the drones actually cross
over<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:24.960> North<00:01:25.590> Korean<00:01:25.950> territory<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
over into North Korean territory this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.819 
over into North Korean territory this
could<00:01:26.909> potentially<00:01:27.090> provoked<00:01:27.750> conflict<00:01:28.439> do

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
could potentially provoked conflict do

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
could potentially provoked conflict do
you<00:01:28.890> feel<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> sale<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.729> itself<00:01:30.150> could

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you feel that the sale in itself could

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
you feel that the sale in itself could
perhaps<00:01:31.259> make<00:01:31.619> North<00:01:31.890> Korea<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.400> reluctant

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
perhaps make North Korea more reluctant

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
perhaps make North Korea more reluctant
to<00:01:33.299> enter<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:34.740> dialogue<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to enter into dialogue with the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
to enter into dialogue with the
international<00:01:35.820> community<00:01:36.890> absolutely<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
international community absolutely I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.109 
international community absolutely I
mean<00:01:38.009> they're<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> use<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
mean they're going to use it as a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.420 
mean they're going to use it as a
justification<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:40.200> continue<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.100> be

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
justification to continue to be

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.480 
justification to continue to be
belligerent<00:01:41.840> now<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.049> don't<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.799> North

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
belligerent now I don't think North

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
belligerent now I don't think North
Korea<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.240> attack<00:01:45.570> anyone<00:01:45.990> unless<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
Korea will attack anyone unless it's the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560

apparently it's malfunctioning and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.999 
apparently it's malfunctioning and
reports<00:01:57.509> say<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> machine<00:01:58.320> work<00:01:58.710> done

unconditional<00:03:05.560> eight<00:03:05.739> now<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.580> think

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
unconditional eight now what I think

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.160 
unconditional eight now what I think
really<00:03:06.910> needs<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.360> happen<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.900> improve

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
really needs to happen to improve

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.120 
really needs to happen to improve
inter-korean<00:03:08.470> relations<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.489> improving

inter-korean relations is improving

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.340 
inter-korean relations is improving
basically<00:03:12.130> economic<00:03:13.030> ties<00:03:13.239> tourism<00:03:14.110> things

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
basically economic ties tourism things

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.500 
basically economic ties tourism things
like<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> Kaesong<00:03:15.040> Industrial<00:03:15.070> Complex<00:03:15.580> it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
like the Kaesong Industrial Complex it

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.420 
like the Kaesong Industrial Complex it
maybe<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> bit<00:03:17.410> conniving<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.010> point<00:03:18.280> out

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
maybe be a bit conniving to point out

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.699 
maybe be a bit conniving to point out
but<00:03:18.910> North<00:03:19.090> Korea<00:03:19.150> has<00:03:19.690> set<00:03:19.959> itself<00:03:20.230> up<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.470> be

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
but North Korea has set itself up to be

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.070 
but North Korea has set itself up to be
the<00:03:20.830> next<00:03:20.950> sweatshop<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.209> world<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.630> it

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
the next sweatshop of the world and it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.710 
the next sweatshop of the world and it
offers<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.650> lowest<00:03:23.860> labor<00:03:24.820> rates<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.450> all<00:03:25.600> of

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
offers the lowest labor rates in all of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.350 
offers the lowest labor rates in all of
Asia<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.560> think<00:03:26.830> there's<00:03:27.280> really<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.610> new

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
Asia so I think there's really a new

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.870 
Asia so I think there's really a new
precedent<00:03:28.660> here<00:03:29.050> for<00:03:29.320> both<00:03:29.470> parties<00:03:29.830> two<00:03:30.400> on

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
precedent here for both parties two on

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.270 
precedent here for both parties two on
each<00:03:30.940> side<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.600> border<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.130> profit<00:03:33.130> and

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
each side of the border to profit and

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.550 
each side of the border to profit and
improve<00:03:33.880> their<00:03:34.030> relations<00:03:34.510> well<00:03:35.260> certainly

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
improve their relations well certainly
