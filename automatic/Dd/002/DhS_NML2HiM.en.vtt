00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 6 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
 many girls so today I 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.710
 back with a video tutorial hairstyle 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.840
 So start eating the hair 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.410
 if we want to have enough length 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.900
 long 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.310
 having basic short hair so 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.890
 all that interests you I will leave you 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.290
 the rest of the video so first 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.180
 will need a pet to these groups 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.950
 to make a ponytail so to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.050
 pet that you take vehicles 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.180
 every morning then you will go to 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.690
 of a smaller horse anywhere 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.820
 what really very very small such as 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.140
 so think like hair clips 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.869
 then that's what's more if you 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.820
 want tp small headband for for 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.229
 hang the hair will grab more 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.240
 con that it's more and only if 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.710
 you want so I do not purposely 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.600
 to comb my hair I did nothing 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.570
 with my hair I got up there 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.260
 was like that so more than me it's 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.790
 for you 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.400
 one morning you're really lazy 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.700
 you want a hairstyle without you 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.930
 hair styling I'm here so 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.850
 sorry if I come back the mass and that 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.940
 I have my mirror 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.640
 so you're going to make a little horse and 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:54.390
 you 're going to lock those big ones in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:59.830
 down so roughly this thickness 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:07.409
 it's perfect that's pretty much 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.409
 thickness so this thickness there 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.470
 so here I did everything you valve 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.830
 you will come attached with the fat 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.830
 pet 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.150
 so those back and if you have the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.300
 lazy to put on your hair in the morning or even 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.870
 even like that to go to school 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.870
 it looks nice 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:55.150
 so here I made my ponytail 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:57.360
 and so you will see my hair 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.959
 with a ponytail 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:08.080
 he arrives below the chest at the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.880
 with a horse whore so much more and so 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.650
 you will come 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.989
 sorry and so you will come take 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.000
 your lock of hair that was 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.590
 behind you will take your wick 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.890
 knew how to take your ponytail 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.370
 assemblies whose call agree that 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.970
 my hair 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.480
 got there we'll get them there 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.640
 so we're going to make them grow a good 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.250
 fifteen centimeters so that's so 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.360
 after that point you do what 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.920
 you want but you have to tie them 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.160
 together because like that at in a 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.989
 current if we see how it has not been 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.000
 all do it so me what am I doing 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.950
 is that I take my hair I 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.989
 mix the short hair well with 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.709
 long hair up and I want to do well 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.709
 a braid 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.840
 and you go well duo 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.500
 so here I made the mat a year with 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.070
 your little darling you're going 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.070
 attached so 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:36.870
 so here and we see that my 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.760
 hair just arrived at the and we got them 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.350
 lengthened my hair are now 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.970
 attached makes the water result 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.460
 so we went from there we did the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.960
 ponytail and with our wick 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:56.440
 we tied and we made our match 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.800
 so it enlarged me already in the first 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.770
 length of my hair so his rival to 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:08.290
 that they have largely pushed these pretty 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.660
 names hairstyle she is pretty effective 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.540
 so it's really for every day 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:21.850
 then with your purposes 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:25.180
 so that's if you have some like 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:31.270
 me there little ones like me I hate 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:36.540
 that little hair that gets stuck 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.540
 little bit everywhere so tie you with 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:47.599
 your share so it's perfect I appreciate 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:49.669
 with the forceps nothing and then 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.710
 so there then you can accessorized 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:56.060
 with your jewels so 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:59.900
 so you can be for the master 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.960
 as you want to start this or nothing that 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:08.990
 in headband like that so you do it 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:20.599
 it's not the fact that you pass your tail 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:23.440
 horse outside and in headband so 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.440
 a headband 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:36.950
 so that's where you can really so 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:39.200
 the master in the back where you do not put 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.420
 nothing and it's pretty bone and as we see 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.190
 there a match of hairdressing rieles for 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.740
