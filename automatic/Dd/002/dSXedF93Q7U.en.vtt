00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
wondering where's Silent Hill 2 I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.700 
wondering where's Silent Hill 2 I
decided<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> put<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.640> very<00:00:24.480> slight<00:00:25.289> delay

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
decided to put a very very slight delay

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.040 
decided to put a very very slight delay
on<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.699> reasoning<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.779> on

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
on that my reasoning on this is on

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
on that my reasoning on this is on
Friday<00:00:28.410> night<00:00:28.740> I'm<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.880> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
Friday night I'm going to have to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.020 
Friday night I'm going to have to
concentrate<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.660> doing<00:00:30.929> my<00:00:31.080> side<00:00:31.349> updates

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
concentrate on doing my side updates

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.549 
concentrate on doing my side updates
generally<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.180> takes<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.600> while<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.989> thus<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
generally that takes a while and thus I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.049 
generally that takes a while and thus I
don't<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.950> time<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.430> both<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.880> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
don't have time to do both that and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.020 
don't have time to do both that and
upload<00:00:36.690> videos<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.710> such<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> didn't<00:00:38.820> want<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
upload videos as such I didn't want to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.760 
upload videos as such I didn't want to
have<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> non<00:00:39.570> upload<00:00:40.020> day<00:00:40.230> interrupts<00:00:40.680> the

have that non upload day interrupts the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
have that non upload day interrupts the

first few vids of Silent Hill 2 it would
have<00:00:42.930> been<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> break<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> flow

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

Silent Hill City Limits
until<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.100> fare<00:01:59.670> thee<00:01:59.700> well

so<00:02:05.090> after<00:02:05.450> my<00:02:05.570> display<00:02:05.930> of<00:02:06.080> guts<00:02:06.290> man<00:02:06.500> breaking

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
so after my display of guts man breaking

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.250 
so after my display of guts man breaking
enemy<00:02:07.280> AI<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.850> was<00:02:08.270> told<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.900> could<00:02:09.080> make

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
enemy AI I was told that you could make

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.370 
enemy AI I was told that you could make
things<00:02:09.530> even<00:02:09.800> worse<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:10.430> cut<00:02:10.640> man<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:12.020> here<00:02:12.260> we

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
things even worse for cut man so here we

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:30.220 
things even worse for cut man so here we
go<00:02:17.620> uh<00:02:27.850> yeah<00:02:28.850> even<00:02:29.300> less<00:02:29.480> room<00:02:29.690> for<00:02:29.750> him<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.080> run

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
go uh yeah even less room for him to run

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.060 
go uh yeah even less room for him to run
around<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.020> can't<00:02:33.320> do<00:02:33.470> anything<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.920> him

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
around but I can't do anything to him

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.910 
around but I can't do anything to him
right

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
right

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.920 
right
unless<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.070> course<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.580> go<00:02:37.970> right<00:02:38.270> up<00:02:38.480> against

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
unless of course I go right up against

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.990 
unless of course I go right up against
the<00:02:39.050> blocks<00:02:39.290> then<00:02:40.100> we<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.400> actually<00:02:40.580> throw

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
the blocks then we can actually throw

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.560 
the blocks then we can actually throw
blocks<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.900> hit<00:02:42.050> him<00:02:42.970> guts<00:02:43.970> man<00:02:44.150> kind<00:02:44.480> of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
blocks in to hit him guts man kind of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.660 
blocks in to hit him guts man kind of
breaks<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.900> game<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.110> little<00:02:45.290> bit<00:02:45.530> further<00:02:45.830> by

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
breaks the game a little bit further by

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.060 
breaks the game a little bit further by
breaking<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.270> physics<00:02:47.600> engine<00:02:47.750> he<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.800> force

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
breaking the physics engine he can force

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.160 
breaking the physics engine he can force
the<00:02:49.280> block<00:02:49.520> fragments<00:02:50.150> through<00:02:50.360> his<00:02:50.660> existing

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
the block fragments through his existing

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.890 
the block fragments through his existing
blocks<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:52.460> doing<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.940> against<00:02:53.300> pet<00:02:53.480> man<00:02:53.660> is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
blocks now doing this against pet man is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.560 
blocks now doing this against pet man is
a<00:02:53.930> bit<00:02:54.200> risky<00:02:54.350> if<00:02:54.980> he<00:02:55.520> has<00:02:55.730> even<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.060> slightest

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
a bit risky if he has even the slightest

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.110 
a bit risky if he has even the slightest
moment<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.050> he<00:02:57.140> can<00:02:57.320> use<00:02:57.500> his<00:02:57.650> critical<00:02:58.190> that

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
moment that he can use his critical that

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.010 
moment that he can use his critical that
does<00:02:59.450> destroy<00:02:59.870> guts<00:03:00.200> blocks<00:03:01.360> now<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.600> lesser

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
does destroy guts blocks now to a lesser

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.230 
does destroy guts blocks now to a lesser
extent<00:03:03.050> this<00:03:03.650> strategy<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.190> also<00:03:04.640> be<00:03:04.940> used<00:03:05.150> to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
extent this strategy can also be used to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.780 
extent this strategy can also be used to
make<00:03:05.420> things<00:03:05.690> easier<00:03:06.050> against<00:03:06.440> bum<00:03:06.710> men<00:03:06.980> but

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
make things easier against bum men but

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.260 
make things easier against bum men but
it's<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.150> as<00:03:09.160> clear-cut<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.400> thing<00:03:10.700> really<00:03:10.940> you

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's not as clear-cut a thing really you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.420 
it's not as clear-cut a thing really you
can't<00:03:11.959> quite<00:03:12.230> trap<00:03:12.530> him<00:03:12.740> in<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.890> block<00:03:13.100> that

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
can't quite trap him in a block that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.449 
can't quite trap him in a block that
small<00:03:13.910> his<00:03:14.780> critical<00:03:15.350> will<00:03:15.650> definitely<00:03:16.220> break

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
small his critical will definitely break

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.720 
small his critical will definitely break
it<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.760> he<00:03:17.030> will<00:03:17.209> definitely<00:03:17.450> use<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:19.640> you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
it and he will definitely use it so you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.130 
it and he will definitely use it so you
have<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.030> give<00:03:20.150> him<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.330> little<00:03:20.540> bit<00:03:20.750> more<00:03:20.930> room

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
have to give him a little bit more room

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:30.490 
have to give him a little bit more room
than<00:03:21.350> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.490 

and<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.650> doesn't<00:03:31.950> help<00:03:32.070> how<00:03:32.340> happy<00:03:33.090> he<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.330> to

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
and it doesn't help how happy he is to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.850 
and it doesn't help how happy he is to

you over here please come on you're
being<00:04:09.810> highly<00:04:10.290> uncooperative<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:11.190> know<00:04:11.310> that

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.170 

oh<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:19.630> was<00:04:19.780> right<00:04:19.959> where<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.140> needed<00:04:20.440> them<00:04:20.620> to

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
oh that was right where I needed them to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.720 
oh that was right where I needed them to
okay<00:04:22.180> there<00:04:22.390> we<00:04:22.480> go<00:04:22.600> it's<00:04:22.810> salvageable<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.580> now

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
okay there we go it's salvageable so now

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.340 
okay there we go it's salvageable so now
we<00:04:24.790> have<00:04:25.000> him<00:04:25.150> trapped

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.020 

the<00:04:29.350> only<00:04:29.470> drawback<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:30.190> this<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.490> if<00:04:30.610> he<00:04:30.700> jumps

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
the only drawback to this is if he jumps

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.740 
the only drawback to this is if he jumps
backwards

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
backwards

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.660 
backwards
you<00:04:32.320> can't<00:04:32.620> hit<00:04:32.740> him<00:04:32.890> because<00:04:32.980> he's<00:04:33.280> too<00:04:33.430> far

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
you can't hit him because he's too far

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.520 
you can't hit him because he's too far
away<00:04:33.760> he<00:04:34.600> can<00:04:34.750> only<00:04:34.840> use<00:04:34.990> him<00:04:35.290> when<00:04:35.410> he's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
away he can only use him when he's

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:45.450 
away he can only use him when he's
really<00:04:35.830> close<00:04:40.080> like<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:43.890> if<00:04:44.890> he<00:04:45.040> uses<00:04:45.190> is

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
really close like that if he uses is

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.580 
really close like that if he uses is
critical

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
critical

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.400 
critical
he<00:04:47.590> still<00:04:47.860> breaks<00:04:48.130> it<00:04:48.340> uh<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.810> I'm<00:04:50.140> still

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
he still breaks it uh so I'm still

00:04:50.410 --> 00:05:06.750 
he still breaks it uh so I'm still
missing<00:04:50.590> something<00:04:51.160> somewhere<00:04:51.580> here

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.219 

yeah<00:05:07.760> if<00:05:07.880> he's<00:05:08.030> right<00:05:08.210> up<00:05:08.389> against<00:05:08.810> it<00:05:08.930> he<00:05:09.050> can

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
yeah if he's right up against it he can

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.330 
yeah if he's right up against it he can
just<00:05:09.410> force<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:09.979> no<00:05:10.130> matter<00:05:10.280> what<00:05:12.340> so

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
just force that in no matter what so

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.409 
just force that in no matter what so
yeah<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:14.030> works<00:05:14.240> to<00:05:14.449> a<00:05:14.479> lesser<00:05:14.900> extent<00:05:15.350> but<00:05:16.419> it

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
yeah it works to a lesser extent but it

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.560 
yeah it works to a lesser extent but it
is<00:05:17.840> viable<00:05:18.229> somewhat<00:05:22.090> still<00:05:23.090> fighting<00:05:23.419> gone

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
is viable somewhat still fighting gone
