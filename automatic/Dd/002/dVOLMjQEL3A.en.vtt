00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.490
 aimar bump only who spoke jackson 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.269
 I'm here at my new home Sunday 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.679
 to wait for the day to talk about 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.839
 insulin is the hormone secreted by 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.570
 pancreas that is one of the most 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
 that there is to begin the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.279
 this line is a hormone 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.340
 peptide secreted by the pancreas and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.720
 in the liver stimulating the formation of 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.550
 glycogen in addition to inhibiting the conversion of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 nutrients other than a carbohydrate 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.350
 I always cooked insulin also increases 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.050
 the levels of ige now effect the function 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.450
 What interests us most is that it has the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 to take glucose into the cells 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 have insulin receptors ie 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.350
 takes nutrients to the cells and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 obviously the muscle cells are 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 included here what we can expect 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.910
 with more well- nourished cells 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.399
 increases protein synthesis and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 especially the very 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.699
 of the nutrients ingested in their 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.590
 diet 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.449
 and does not stop there with insulin has 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.720
 able to increase the levels of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.990
 lh fsh in turn increases the production of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.729
 testosterone and along with it 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.830
 enhances the link between 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.689
 anabolic steroids and receptors 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.009
 androgens is too good to be 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.780
 truth is not even 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.700
 but as always not everything is flowers to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.920
 is to stimulate the accumulation of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.330
 fat also not for nothing the athletes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.280
 professionals in combinations of 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
 hormones to potentiate only the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.890
 lean mass gain is where the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.009
 thyroid hormones t3 t4 between clear 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.979
 who together use gh gh and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.079
 i sure know all this maybe stay 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.360
 a little easier for you to understand 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.340
 because if you take maltodextrins after 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.979
 practice when you are training your 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.220
 insulin levels fall and levels of insulin 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.100
 glucagon idh increase after training with 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.380
 our famous and post-workout sheik 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.869
 simple carbohydrates protein levels 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.060
 of a baishan shit and the levels of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.350
 insulin due precisely to the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.869
 simple carbohydrate 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.250
 the idea is to maximize the absorption of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.439
 nutrients after training 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.660
 there is evidence that the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.090
 amino acids with dextrose may increase the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.030
 absorption of our in up to 50 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 always therapeutically the majority already 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.769
 you already know about insulins and 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.300
 for treating diabetes it has 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.819
 other features as well 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.709
 anti- catabolic treatment people with 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.060
 problems of extreme degradation of 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.739
 for people who have suffered 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.060
 severe burns 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.860
 to better quantify it all I 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.870
 I'll put it on a chart that I found 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.209
 where the black bars represents 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.340
 people using insulin and the bar 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.140
 obviously did not use it. 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 of these three bars are 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.459
 different levels after ingestion of 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.360
 varying amino acids and the amount of 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.970
 each one 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.819
 as you can see the three bars of 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.739
 proteins represent the protein synthesis that 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.430
 is much higher with the use of 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.739
 insulin 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.810
 the bars the three baton in the middle 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.090
 demonstrates the degradation of proteins that 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.160
 was reduced with the use of insulin and the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.910
 very low levels represented a balance of 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 from below 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.709
 this chart clearly demonstrates beginning 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.470
 potentiates the absorption of 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.629
 amino acids and now we're going to the types 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.180
 insulin because it's my friends 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.489
 There are five types of insulin 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 types varies in the time of action being 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.549
 ideal 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.530
 there is a logic that action insulin 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.840
 has a duration of about six months. 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.639
 hours a peak of action between one and two 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.950
 hours after application 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.319
 difficult to access beyond the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.090
 reliability due to 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.150
 which it requires in handling 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.970
 already the next option humulin r more 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.859
 used in the medium is much more 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.480
 easy to be mixed with 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.160
 slightly shorter duration 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.260
 besides being very fast there are also 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.760
 preference for this type of insulin is 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.919
 to facilitate user control 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.200
 they promote rapid peak and duration 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.359
 of this peak is also smaller the amount is 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.900
 is related to the weight of the 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:00.030
 person varies widely from wii to 40 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.130
 o and per day at the time of mentioning 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.799
 that we are clearly aware of the 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.019
 difference between mere mortals and athletes 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.849
 professionals and remember that whenever 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.950
 You 're just a mere mortal. 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.500
 generally the use is divided into 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.720
 portions and will be administered 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.660
 together with meals in other 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.450
 booze cases so divided into meals 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.130
 and post-workout as well as 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.550
 majority does so exist 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.770
 those who only use after training 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.420
 only here at the post workout meal 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.370
 in which case the quantity is usually a 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.410
 slightly larger in size according to the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.770
 the person 's weight is also to anyone 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.170
 that uses insulin to be resolved is 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.600
 diet does not matter about insulin 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.610
 you use there are no high levels 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.630
 amino acid in your blood you will not 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.330
 grow nothing 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.880
 in the end the diet that recounts the diet 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.550
 It's the bricks, no use, you got a thousand. 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.920
 masons and a limited number of 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.910
 Bricks no use game forgetting the 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.310
 insulin it has injectable administration 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.680
 subcutaneous injection, ie the injection is soon 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.230
 below the skin not reaching us like 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.180
 most of you now must 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.700
 To be finding a beauty, you 've already robbed it. 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.870
 of the neighbor who has diabetes 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.950
 are wondering what these people are 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.930
 What's in the box? 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.380
 the most important part of the video attention 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.300
 that there is a disease called 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.890
 diabetes that is diagnosed when the 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.780
 body has difficulties in maintaining 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.510
 adequate levels of insulin in the 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.270
 blood type 1 diabetes mellitus 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.890
 when the body has an action out munique 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.170
 and destroys the very cells that 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.270
 produce insulin and diabetes mellitus 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.790
 type 2 that is when the body produces 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.770
 insulin year but has not yet 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.540
 sensitivity to it in turn buy it 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.580
 producing more and more and more insulin 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.520
 but nothing happens because the receivers 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.740
 do not work in both cases it is 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.570
 of a terrible disease speaking thus not 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.340
 you can measure right but for whom 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.920
 know people who have known that I am 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.900
 talking said my blood is one thing 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.620
 much more complicated and sinister than 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.240
 looks 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.850
 I'm talking about a drug with 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.710
 potential to kill you much larger than 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.200
 any is the same gh 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.570
 in addition to the risk of developing diabetes 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.030
 incorrect use of insulin causes 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.480
 constant polysemy that has as its 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.910
 drowsiness and hunger symptoms and blurred vision 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.640
 dizziness headache sweating and 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.810
 another series of bad things and 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.080
 symptoms 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:32.500
 they come to announce the loss of their 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.690
 consciousness coma and death is that 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.800
 blood glucose is something that will kill you 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.990
 that simple 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.660
 athletes who use insulin and a 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.520
 24-hour monitoring is no accident. 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.950
 you need to be controlling your 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.200
 diet full time insulin use in 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.900
 a wrong schedule of the day is enough 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.600
 to kill you the type of insulin time 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.460
 demonstration and the types of food 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.800
 diet at every hour of the day need to be 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.600
 carefully studied and well defined 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.700
 so that there are no problems 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.860
 Of course it's an athlete who does. 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.440
 here you may think I'm overreacting 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.720
 is because you have become accustomed to and the 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.030
 when to do each thing when it should 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.460
 eat when to inject but for you is 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.470
 you already know this but for the 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.660
 most people do not mainly 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.120
 because disinformation reigns in the majority 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.730
 of places, son of a bitch is what 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.770
 But there is more I thought about 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.660
 How would you do this video then not 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.520
 I mentioned in detail ways to 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.530
 use that I do not want to see crazy 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.210
 He lived there because clearly I 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.160
 I worry about what someone can do 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.900
 with yourself after understanding better 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.980
 the functioning of insulin but I 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.380
 I hope you have thought enough. 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.270
 attention to this final part of the video and 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.160
 What I like is not in the channel if 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.350
 inscribes possible evaluation research 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.200
 I wanted to send a hug 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:50.050
 I wrote that I did my new 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.150
 banner he did not tell me his name but 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.070
 then a hug for you guy want 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:58.410
 buy facebook have in description 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.410
 It's a hug and even more.
