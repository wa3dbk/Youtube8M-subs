00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
maybe we'll round it up one day so I the

maybe we'll round it up one day so I the
first<00:00:55.170> thing<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:55.860> into<00:00:56.070> is

easiest things are throwing knives

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
easiest things are throwing knives
that's<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.600> duration<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.620> useless

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that's because duration is useless

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
that's because duration is useless
target<00:01:03.210> speed<00:01:03.480> useless

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
throw it all into cooldown that's what I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
throw it all into cooldown that's what I
do<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.830> throwing<00:01:08.159> knives<00:01:08.340> on

does is make it like obviously like how

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
does is make it like obviously like how
long<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.869> targets<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.700> impaired

long your targets going to be impaired
by<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.060> throwing<00:01:24.330> knives<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
by your throwing knives and two and a

by your throwing knives and two and a
half<00:01:25.650> seconds<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> lot<00:01:26.729> especially<00:01:26.939> when

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
half seconds is a lot especially when

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
half seconds is a lot especially when
you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:28.380> wait<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.220> closer

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you can just wait for them to get closer

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.620 
you can just wait for them to get closer
to<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:29.939> they're<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> could<00:01:30.299> pursuer

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
away from you most likely you're gonna

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.179 
away from you most likely you're gonna
be<00:01:34.110> able<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> chase<00:01:34.500> somebody<00:01:34.710> down<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
be able to chase somebody down that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
be able to chase somebody down that
amount<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.520> time<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.329> fact<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.570> their

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
amount of time and the fact that their

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170 
amount of time and the fact that their
momentum<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.560> slowed<00:01:38.009> down<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
momentum is slowed down because of the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
momentum is slowed down because of the
throwing<00:01:39.420> knives<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.810> they're<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.079> gonna

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
throwing knives like they're not gonna

be sprinting anymore most likely you're

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.520 
be sprinting anymore most likely you're
going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.899> able<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> catch<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
going to be able to catch up to that

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260 
going to be able to catch up to that
person<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.950> unless<00:01:44.549> you're<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> situations

for you guys is a very bread and buttery
kind<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.030> aspect<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.690> throwing<00:02:54.930> knives<00:02:55.170> what

the third use that I'm going to cover is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.460 
the third use that I'm going to cover is
the<00:03:05.330> cancelling<00:03:06.330> ability<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.900> knives<00:03:07.230> of

abilities for that matter but I know for
a<00:03:17.310> fact<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.580> it<00:03:17.760> works<00:03:17.850> during<00:03:18.090> teleport<00:03:18.630> and
