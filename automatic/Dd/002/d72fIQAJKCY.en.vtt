00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.330
 222 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:20.420
 Yes, hello . 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.740
 Ah this time looking at the experience of three gods to save God face 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:29.930
 It's time to tell you what I've played. 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.350
 Now, the generation that seeks God's face is made up of 16 words of in-pro. 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:38.900
 2 as a drummer before 16 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:43.670
 Is it very important to me right word 122 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.140
 If this word is always lowered to full , 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.470
 Sometimes I do not know . 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.490
 So I have to pretend to be a Thai buddy, 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.190
 You will. 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.190
 I got these two pre-paid high sl slugs. 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.539
 5 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.430
 This is the forest. 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 I'll show you again. 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:18.840
 Let's just say that we have two gusts and a third one 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.840
 I opened it and gave it a snare. 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.740
 Then 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 Ride the pool with his right hand chyeotjyo 2 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.850
 You can single-stroke this. 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:41.920
 Touching again on the show was shown to play like this 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.149
 4 This is the second generation of pros who will save God's face. 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.470
 It's possible 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:53.440
 How from here that will play in earnest while watching the video with me. 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.940
 I'll give you a ridorok descriptor contains a word with 50 to 16 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.630
 It's started . 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.580
 After the interview I wanted to give a strong impression on p. 4, so the ride cymbal 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.039
 Clash sawaseo itgoyo and Kim play 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:09.039
 After kicking the kick , I play one by one every night. 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.430
 Oh, he gave me one more kit. 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:17.290
 What wrong with you when the plane hit one throw three nights because it is too Short 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:22.959
 And earn 3, hit repeatedly by doesimyeon force 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:28.480
 Verse and want a genuine two troll from any and all jjeok eru 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:33.640
 And there is a pulse to the rhythm haejugo eonju using that most health 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:39.519
 Main reason gets a little catch in January writing the lyrics better than the desire to hear the end 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.570
 In order to make it easier to match the loud sound of the professional 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.100
 It is an accident by the way. 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.000
 I'm better looking than yiyeseul is a little unusual Sand 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.890
 One of the examples is 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.939
 There are symbols for speakers from jiljeong to this symbol up what wieda 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.109
 It looks like it's coming out. 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.310
 That sounds a little bounce hageodeunyo parties now see now the second start 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.510
 That's it. 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.010
 Believe in sin with 4 seconds using a snare Haier's wrong with you face 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:13.280
 The generation, the reason why the lyrics are bold, 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.280
 That's why I wanted to give something a little morning power. 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.360
 you 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.740
 U 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.610
 And now, right before the Corso 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.060
 This part is accented with a ride-on symbol 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.870
 And then it makes a false or this awesome move to 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.720
 And now I'm starting to see the flow of pros 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:48.940
 I'm playing at Hi s Open because I'll go to the next one. 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:51.010
 To give more than my loud sound great in Dalian cultural ties 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.180
 I had to choose s . 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:00.250
 And now the sound is very unique and I heard the explanation beforehand 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:04.950
 I used to be a spear loudspeaker 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.950
 It going rewarded uniquely peun the sound of more than 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.920
 Inde again indirectly part of West Island Tourist Site during the ride back to class now, and where significant 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.920
 I know. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:25.190
 Now, Spin, we 've come in earlier than usual, 1 malt. 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:26.330
 The softness of those who work where they fit well and put a word of epiphany 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.050
 There are many cases. 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.980
 I do not make timing for kn a little earlier. 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:38.990
 So much so that if it is made transplanted in time 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:42.380
 Itgekkeum make you feel the tension gave haneunge now stand where the high s study 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.970
 But the nuns are just doing it in style. 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.540
 Why does he have to repeat the first bell, but the second boss repeats 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.130
 do not have 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:55.130
 That's why I got into the first second taste right away. 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:59.480
 Now , let's go into the plus now. 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:03.860
 I'm doing it. 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.970
 It's a chorus, but I just opened it under the same 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:14.480
 As you know the concept, the force will repeat once more. 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:18.920
 It will be a repeat of the new thing To be loud to play Now it's too big 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.500
 I do not party and you see on the right is another crash more Chris in October 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.090
 What's on it? 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:30.290
 The'd just grimace x epl series of books called What danisin 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.490
 8 inches Shoes inde second trial does place right now striking up hadeoraguyo Borough 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.490
 Now too home 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:41.880
 I need to connect Zaire to a big world. 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:48.389
 Unlike some would be almost the same as what the key intro to next year 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:52.830
 Jugetdaneun'll try to do that day would give a pretty book on the side this way 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:55.950
 And he got more and more crashes. 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.930
 More on profiles and more 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.930
 I 'm using a lot of media . 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.149
 U 

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:09.169
 Now it's the last breach before ending. 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:13.999
 With the glacier s open in Africa , I 'm playing the power with the beat 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:16.969
 This is one of the largest Yiwu ohnya So anyway not live more sunseong 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:22.849
 But please make sure you can listen to powerful sound. 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:29.439
 Plus, I get awesome because that means as he topped a new shoe 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:29.439
 Hey , listen to that sound with the pass, so I picked this symbol . 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:34.419
 I end up with a Zarita. 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:46.529
 Now, here are my three images of God's face 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:53.029
 I do not know how much more informative it can be for you. 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:53.029
 Anyway, we'll see you in the future look to you with this content
