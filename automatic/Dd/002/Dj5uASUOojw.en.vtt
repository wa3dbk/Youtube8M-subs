00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190
 now 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.800
 up to the moment of difficulty 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.110
 the psychologist 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.660
 efe the favor with celebrities 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.140

 every aspect medina its franco 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.740
 walk 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.120
 the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.290
 the national bread 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.130
 sd huesca have given 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.430
 I wish I could have 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.520
 it's sad 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.470
 I do not know what crimes worse 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.220
 yes i will speak that english 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.369
 choked tortured because what Mr. micheletti is doing 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.500
 is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.260
 outrage the tongue of 6 100 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.660
 or so wear that shirt 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.880
 abominable 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.150
 despicable I do not know what crimes but 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.020
 now micheletti session is not fluid 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.530
 the English language 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.050
 that they say look Miss reporter of the United States 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.620
 yole groin I do not speak bad enough 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.640
 your best let me speak spanish i compose a product 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.960
 because not all the presidents of the region speak English Alan Garcia not 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.319
 speaks English menem in his day did not speak English 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.290
 the kirchners do not speak English but no country no min or 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.879
 censored and male 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.399
 this lady bachelet I think so 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.309
 he lived in states or 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.859
 tabaré vázquez I do not know 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.400
 but pepe mujica who I think will win the second round in Uruguay 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.439
 that not to speak nourishes words together in English 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.839
 so this is a not a crime it's not a crime and it's against the 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.010
 constitution nor the chiles prevents 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.419
 be good or bad president 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.639
 the funny thing is that when someone does not speak English well 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.409
 let's pretend property 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.599
 that speaks English well because the truth that we realize that no 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.769
 in the case of the president of ecuador rafael strap that was sought in the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.759
 foreigner propose it whale in belgium 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.489
 you judge 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.720
 compare it with micheletti I think compared to micheletti it seems like a 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 simultaneous translator of united nations 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.239
 taxco advocated the company closed couso 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.059
 I remove the other day more without rectors 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.970
 gives 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.620
 and says left 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.669
 from all of this 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.449
 ask then his name 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.379
 chevron-texaco phillips 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.500
 moody's was a musical English was not English 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.929
 sensual cadenciosos is a slightly cacophonous English 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:34.870
 but he is an Englishman 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.799
 I think 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.909
 it seems to me 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.989
 better than micheletti's 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.739
 the micheletti 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 in half English half Honduran single child 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:49.129
 is a mixture tom texts promiscuity time is a mixture of the dialect 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.109
 Honduran 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.129
 Maya 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.919
 I entered American with English and I did not sell a language 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.919
 the front and probe constitution 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.309
 how important it is in stores and at the same time your compatriot I think a lot 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.879
 I get it 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.580
 it said moving happening it is that we can to English soft security 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.940
 poquet like 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.510
 Latin American and for 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.679
 to see who speaks better English 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.129
 it's all laughing 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.389
 the wall perez is exclusive of its support 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.559
 PD of responsibility and I do not 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:23.600
 disapproved 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.710
 disapproved 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.669
 no no is not an Englishman 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.669
 that sounds beautiful and that has the due fluidity 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.639
 mister uribe speaks an english it seems to me 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.990
 at least articulate 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.129
 that respects the syntax 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.759
 the accent 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.759
 it's not a perfect seat 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.849
 of a 3% vision 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.119
 I never felt much manual illusion but that edition 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.819
 ana alternatives 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.990
 who speaks best micheletti 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.830
 belt 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.389
 or Mr. Uribe 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.449
 I think the worst of all is micheletti 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.479
 to see if the first post your book runs to see again leader 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:09.180
 when the govern 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.159
 they continued whale pineapple 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.439
 titan egos and that gives us food feltre 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.029
 min 30 with tenacity cta sold food rally at the insistence 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.389
 good in the end at least 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.460
 speaks English lets itself be understood expresses 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.020
 the matter is a bit rough a bit like the belt but but so 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.990
 less is spoken not English and others that does not speak a word 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.759
 like Alan Garcia who says he's turning on his groin he speaks French
