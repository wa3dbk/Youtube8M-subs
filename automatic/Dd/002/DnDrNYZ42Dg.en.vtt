00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.120 
leading his men northward or the tracks
point<00:04:31.790> in<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.510> direction<00:04:32.680> but<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.740> can't

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
point in that direction but I can't

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.800 
point in that direction but I can't
understand<00:04:34.730> why<00:04:34.910> he<00:04:35.060> was<00:04:35.180> forced<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.570> leave

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
understand why he was forced to leave

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.890 
understand why he was forced to leave
here<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.530> when<00:04:36.950> was<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.280> fort<00:04:37.550> burned<00:04:37.970> my

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
here and when was the fort burned my

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.410 
here and when was the fort burned my
guess<00:04:39.200> is<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.890> it<00:04:40.010> was<00:04:40.100> burned<00:04:40.430> after<00:04:40.760> he

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
guess is that it was burned after he

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.020 
guess is that it was burned after he
left<00:04:41.830> there<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:42.980> not<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.460> slightest<00:04:43.850> bit<00:04:43.970> of

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
left there is not the slightest bit of

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.700 
left there is not the slightest bit of
evidence<00:04:44.480> that<00:04:44.780> there<00:04:44.930> was<00:04:45.020> any<00:04:45.290> sort<00:04:45.590> of

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
evidence that there was any sort of

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.020 
evidence that there was any sort of
conflict<00:04:46.100> Oh<00:04:46.520> bullet<00:04:47.360> holes<00:04:47.570> no<00:04:48.320> casualties

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
conflict Oh bullet holes no casualties

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.240 
conflict Oh bullet holes no casualties
nothing<00:04:50.030> well<00:04:50.570> someone<00:04:51.169> did<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.830> if<00:04:52.160> I

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
nothing well someone did it and if I

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.590 
nothing well someone did it and if I
hadn't<00:04:52.580> seen<00:04:52.730> Maggie<00:04:52.910> we'll<00:04:53.180> go<00:04:53.270> over<00:04:53.330> the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
hadn't seen Maggie we'll go over the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.090 
hadn't seen Maggie we'll go over the
edge<00:04:53.690> of<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:53.960> cliff<00:04:54.200> with<00:04:54.350> my<00:04:54.500> very<00:04:54.740> own<00:04:54.860> eyes

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
edge of that cliff with my very own eyes

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.850 
edge of that cliff with my very own eyes
I'd<00:04:55.550> easily<00:04:56.180> believe<00:04:56.450> he<00:04:56.660> burned<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.110> fort<00:04:57.350> it

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
I'd easily believe he burned the fort it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.980 
I'd easily believe he burned the fort it
could<00:04:58.010> also<00:04:58.220> been<00:04:58.520> burned<00:04:58.730> by<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:58.910> French<00:04:59.330> to

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
could also been burned by the French to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.600 
could also been burned by the French to
guarantee<00:05:00.410> our<00:05:00.530> British<00:05:00.890> forces<00:05:01.220> couldn't

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
guarantee our British forces couldn't

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.760 
guarantee our British forces couldn't
make<00:05:01.760> use<00:05:01.970> of<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.240> again<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:03.110> is<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.530> more

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
make use of it again that is a more

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.580 
make use of it again that is a more
practical<00:05:04.010> theory<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.910> think<00:05:05.840> our<00:05:06.169> friends<00:05:06.470> are

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
practical theory I think our friends are

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.900 
practical theory I think our friends are
back<00:05:08.800> there's<00:05:09.800> no<00:05:09.980> doubt<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.400> was<00:05:10.490> a<00:05:10.520> forced

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
back there's no doubt it was a forced

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.210 
back there's no doubt it was a forced
march<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.510> north<00:05:11.770> follow<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.950> tracks

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
march to the north follow the tracks

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.370 
march to the north follow the tracks
almost<00:05:13.610> five<00:05:13.880> miles<00:05:14.210> there<00:05:15.080> was<00:05:15.229> no

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
almost five miles there was no

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.840 
almost five miles there was no
indication<00:05:15.950> that<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.160> colonel<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.580> his<00:05:16.669> men

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
indication that the colonel and his men

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.969 
indication that the colonel and his men
had<00:05:16.970> even<00:05:17.180> stopped<00:05:17.450> for<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.690> rest<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.680> only

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
had even stopped for a rest the only

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.040 
had even stopped for a rest the only
trouble<00:05:19.250> is<00:05:19.700> that<00:05:19.940> we<00:05:20.060> don't<00:05:20.210> know<00:05:20.450> exactly

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
trouble is that we don't know exactly

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.590 
trouble is that we don't know exactly
where<00:05:21.410> they<00:05:21.740> are<00:05:21.830> heading<00:05:22.250> there<00:05:23.150> are<00:05:23.300> three

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
where they are heading there are three

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.570 
where they are heading there are three
or<00:05:23.810> four<00:05:23.840> British<00:05:24.530> forts<00:05:24.890> between<00:05:25.250> here<00:05:25.550> and

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
or four British forts between here and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.940 
or four British forts between here and
the<00:05:25.820> Canadian<00:05:26.330> border

if<00:05:27.950> I<00:05:28.130> were<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.370> hazard<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.760> guess<00:05:28.790> I'd<00:05:29.450> say<00:05:29.810> Fort

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
if I were to hazard a guess I'd say Fort

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.080 
if I were to hazard a guess I'd say Fort
Ticonderoga<00:05:30.860> on<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.550> end<00:05:31.790> of<00:05:31.910> Lake
