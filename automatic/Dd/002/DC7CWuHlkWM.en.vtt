00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.210
 of all the topics of interest alma ceuta 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.580
 ccoo highlights the subject considerably 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.590
 of drug interactions through 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.420
 of the studies done we know with 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.790
 quite detail the biochemistry of the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.340
 medicines with their absorption time 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.059
 Plasma protein binding half - life 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.010
 action time and ways of elimination 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.629
 however we do not know with the same 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.940
 depth of behavior and 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.340
 alterations that a drug suffers when 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.690
 is administered with other substances 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.020
 pharmacologically active or with 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.150
 foods that modify their kinetics 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.580
 in this situation we can not 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.040
 quantify the interactions more than 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.050
 for its results and for it our 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.420
 attitude should be to avoid them within 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.360
 possible and study its impact on 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.640
 established therapy 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.430
 It is for the pharmacist 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.220
 pharmacy office plans to detect 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.590
 inform and resolve the incidents that 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.080
 surround the dispensation of drugs the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.720
 ineffectiveness of many treatments 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.950
 they reside in details like drinking milk 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.950
 bicarbonate or schÃ¼mann and acid fruits 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.910
 with the prescribed medication and this does not 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.910
 You can ignore 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.090
 the drug interactions are not 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 necessarily synonymous with 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 incompatibility or antagonism but 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.080
 which are often used as 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.750
 reinforcement or synergism of the action 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.130
 therapeutic although the difference lies 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.260
 in which the synergy is used 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.240
 consciously and interactions 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.240
 they often go unnoticed 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.360
 in any case whatever the figure 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.849
 exact incidence of 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 interactions the most sensible thing is to put in 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.800
 practice the necessary knowledge 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.780
 to prevent it from occurring even though each 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.030
 one of the drugs used in 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.640
 human clinic has its particular 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.920
 mechanism of interaction what is certain is 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.980
 that there are certain mechanisms that 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.319
 Two or more drugs are common 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.300
 drugs can interact with each other in 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.550
 some of the processes proper to the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.340
 Pharmacokinetic phase interactions 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.170
 pharmacokinetics or in the mechanisms of 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.209
 action of the drug phase 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.470
 dynamic drug interactions 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.120
 dynamic 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.160
 the causes of interactions 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.730
 pharmacokinetics at the pharmacokinetic level 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.280
 they are inhibits the absorption changes in the ph 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.260
 of the middle of intestinal expenditure a 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.840
 Acid drug absorbs more easily the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.410
 medium acid and a basic drug in medium 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.800
 alkaline formation of complex changes 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.230
 in the motility gas destined 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.810
 competition for a transporter nest to 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.250
 distribution level displacements of 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.040
 drugs in their binding to proteins 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.300
 plasma transporters 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.430
 at the metabolism level 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.900
 by metabolic enzyme inducers 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.090
 hepatic 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.730
 which diminish the effect of others 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.819
 drugs 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.680
 or metabolism inhibitors these 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.990
 increase the effect of other drugs and 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.270
 There may even be adverse effects 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.730
 at registration level 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.440
 modifications of the binary ph a drug 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.240
 acid is more easily removed with the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.990
 alkaline urine and a basic drug with 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.760
 acid urine 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.020
 competition for the mechanisms of 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.770
 transportation in the process of execution 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.770
 tubular 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.209
 pharmacodynamic interactions are 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.579
 those that occur in places of 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.590
 action of drugs some of them 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.230
 they take place in the same receivers 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.939
 specific to the drug as it happens with 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.939
 the agonists and direct antagonists 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.859
 of the receiver but on many occasions 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.780
 the interactions are produced by the 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.209
 activations or inhibitions and systems 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.699
 physiological on the part of each of 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.049
 the drugs that interact with 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.330
 contrary to what this is and with the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.460
 pharmacokinetic interactions is very 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.199
 difficult to make a classification 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.020
 systematic type interactions 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.729
 dynamic drug due to its complexity 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.050
 and diversity 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.470
 therefore they are divided into two large 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.470
 sections 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.580
 and agonist interactions exist 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.400
 various terms to qualify the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.890
 overall result of this interaction 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.350
 synergy adding another infection and so on 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.120
 that the final result is never the 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.490
 simple sum of partial results 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.830
 of each drug although said result 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.420
 final is greater than the simple addition of 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.630
 the special effects of each drug 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.760
 however in clinic it is very difficult 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.290
 can quantify the final magnitude of 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.570
 overall effect obtained by the 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.640
 joint administration of more than one 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.210
 drug in relation to the extract 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.520
 individual of each of them 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.470
 that's why the term is preferable 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.330
 agonists to indicate that the 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.729
 simultaneous administration of two or more 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.530
 drugs provides a final effect of 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.470
 the same sense as that of drugs 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.440
 isolated in any case the result 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.660
 end can be both an additive effect 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.770
 beneficial as a major effect 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.870
 toxicity and therefore undesirable 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.850
 antagonistic interactions are those 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.670
 interactions between two or more drugs 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.620
 that lead to opposite effects by 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.380
 example oral anticoagulants 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.480
 they lose their effectiveness if the patient takes 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.060
 amounts of vitamin K higher than 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.280
 the usual diet in patients 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.620
 diabetics treated with hypoglycemic agents 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.060
 Oral can suffer hyperglycemia 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.310
 if they take glucocorticoids 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.290
 the pharmacological knowledge that 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.960
 we possess allow us and force us to 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.370
 bring a focus eminently 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.430
 medical treatments pharmacist 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.350
 the interactions of the drugs should 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.340
 be a topic for pharmacists 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.530
 essential in our exercise 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.630
 professional and flag in others 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.550
 knowledge through which 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.139
 We can show that the years of 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.970
 career that there is continuous training 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.930
 they have given us a social function 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.930
 essential
