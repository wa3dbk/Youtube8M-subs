00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.859
 with you today arthur on torus 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.930
 but you can just call me art 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.500
 these are lectures on art history where i am 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.199
 starring and here is my hand yes 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 where am I 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 somehow awkward when they look at you 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.420
 viewers around the world and I'm here as 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.340
 hands like this better today we 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.390
 let's talk about the art of mesopotamia 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.390
 and ancient egypt 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.739
 we set off five thousand years ago 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 to the region which the Greeks called 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.630
 mesopotamia which means land between 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.710
 rivers 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.060
 these rivers were called tiger and ephrates and 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.310
 formed together fertile 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.250
 crescent 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:54.110
 what is called the cradle of civilization 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:57.020
 very funny words mesopotamia 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.960
 denotes a region rather than a country in 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:08.930
 different times she spent sumer and akkad 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:11.119
 and Babylon are not Assyrians and Persians, they lived 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.250
 in harmony with nature and like that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:21.350
 the lion decorating the wall of the Ishtar gate 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:23.030
 portrayed animals very realistic but 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.150
 people are not very 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.310
 and instead 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.210
 and in ancient egypt body artists 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.520
 people portrayed stylized in 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.930
 mesopotamia was invented first 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.480
 writing which is called 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.490
 cuneiform she started pictograms 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.250
 which eventually transformed into 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.780
 more abstract symbols they also 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.380
 came up with cool names for their 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.830
 buildings 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 for example ziggurat in ur they built 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.760
 huge ziggurat to worship 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.870
 the gods 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.310
 ziggurat i like how it sounds 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.310
 ziggurat stood in the center of the capital 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.310
 we go further possible fashion for civilization 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.190
 originated in Mesopotamia 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.590
 and Egypt brought it to a new level 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.930
 Egypt depended on one great river 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.310
 cute and created a civilization which 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.800
 existed over 3000 years 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.810
 when 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.660
 jamon became the pharaoh of the great pyramids 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.760
 already caught up by thousands of years and still through 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.760
 a thousand years after that came to power 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.650
 Cleopatra Egyptologists invented witty 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.409
 the system of dividing Egyptian history into 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.489
 periods 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:42.209
 this is an ancient kingdom middle kingdom 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.640
 new kingdom and later kingdom as they 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.739
 before that they thought it was interesting 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.080
 art styles have not changed much 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.909
 over 3000 years 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.739
 the best artist was probably the one who 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.560
 most accurately copied classic 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:01.350
 style of the past that was good for hufu 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.600
 approached and Ramses exception was the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.060
 one brief period called lobster on 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.970
 when a pharaoh named them over he planted 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.290
 new style and new religion suddenly 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.320
 faces have become elongated 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.680
 attila streamlined and elongated thinness 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.960
 entered the fashion but when did not become akhnatona 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.960
 egypt quickly returned to normal 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.569
 this does not mean that the Egyptians were not 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.470
 creative people only look at 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.319
 their pantheon of gods 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.129
 they created a god with a jackal god head with 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.590
 falcon head 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.890
 goddess with a head lioness goddess with a head 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.890
 hippo oh mommy god with head 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.840
 crocodile and the ibis-headed god blessing 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.470
 not with the head of a cat, and you get the idea 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.530
 the picture of course the pharaohs themselves were considered 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.329
 Pharaohâ€™s earthly gods portrayed in 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.459
 according to certain rules 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.940
 established to emphasize them 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.230
 perfect and unchanging nature 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.030
 usually on these images 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.030
 some power symbols were present 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.520
 such as crown hook and shoulders as well 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.070
 false beard even female pharaoh 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.840
 Hatshepsut ordered her statues with 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.110
 false beard to emphasize your 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.110
 power 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:19.169
 her to face the Egyptians were the noise 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.109
 Nina death and the afterlife on the walls 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.050
 tombs are often depicted both or soul during 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.789
 time her wandering in the new world when 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.039
 Egyptian artist depicted a figure 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.930
 man, every part of the body he painted 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.150
