00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.360 

oh<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:34.610> can<00:03:34.819> make<00:03:34.939> this<00:03:35.090> bigger<00:03:36.939> 20<00:03:39.099> all<00:03:40.099> right

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
oh you can make this bigger 20 all right

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:55.630 
oh you can make this bigger 20 all right
you<00:03:41.060> can<00:03:41.120> change<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.720> far

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:06.170 

like<00:03:56.640> why<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:02.160> ok<00:04:03.380> so<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.710> get<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.940> this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
like why and ok so to get this so this

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.490 
like why and ok so to get this so this
is<00:04:06.330> how<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.570> looks<00:04:06.630> like<00:04:06.990> just<00:04:07.440> now<00:04:09.080> 100<00:04:10.080> so

is how it looks like just now 100 so
that's<00:04:10.710> how<00:04:10.860> old<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.170> can<00:04:13.470> say<00:04:13.680> that's

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
that's how old so I can say that's

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.370 
that's how old so I can say that's
pretty<00:04:14.070> good<00:04:14.280> farm<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.240> can<00:04:15.420> move<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.630> suggest

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
pretty good farm you can move to suggest

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.770 
pretty good farm you can move to suggest
it<00:04:16.680> was<00:04:16.799> shaped<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.760> hold<00:04:18.000> down<00:04:18.090> shift<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.630> it

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
it was shaped and hold down shift and it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.710 
it was shaped and hold down shift and it
will<00:04:18.900> be<00:04:19.049> like<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.040> don't<00:04:20.310> make<00:04:20.489> any

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
will be like so you don't make any

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.200 
will be like so you don't make any
mistakes<00:04:22.130> who<00:04:23.130> did<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.610> move<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:25.670> ok<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:26.970> then

add whatever you want so back then you
make<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.610> new<00:05:11.820> one<00:05:12.380> then<00:05:13.380> you<00:05:13.590> can<00:05:13.770> duplicate

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
make a new one then you can duplicate

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.590 
make a new one then you can duplicate
this<00:05:15.590> because<00:05:16.590> if<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.830> change<00:05:17.190> this<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:18.090> will

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
make this like this factions

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.450 
make this like this factions
get<00:05:28.689> change<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.169> colors<00:05:29.529> it<00:05:29.740> looks<00:05:29.919> cool<00:05:30.219> you

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.119 
get change the colors it looks cool you
can<00:05:30.639> make<00:05:30.759> it<00:05:30.939> like<00:05:33.150> with<00:05:34.150> some<00:05:34.330> bread<00:05:35.129> then

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
can make it like with some bread then

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:42.320 
can make it like with some bread then
you<00:05:36.219> hold<00:05:36.430> shift<00:05:37.110> then<00:05:38.789> like<00:05:39.789> this<00:05:40.889> hit<00:05:41.889> up

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
you hold shift then like this hit up

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:53.230 
you hold shift then like this hit up
command<00:05:43.330> C<00:05:43.659> and<00:05:43.990> leg<00:05:45.419> command<00:05:46.419> C<00:05:46.779> &amp;<00:05:47.080> dip<00:05:47.740> cookie

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.010 

suppose

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
