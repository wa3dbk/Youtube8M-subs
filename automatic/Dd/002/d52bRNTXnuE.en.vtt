00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.970
 jg ai pro video you already know that jg there 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.709
 you try the windows 10 channel in the 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.509
 which are we talking about all the aspects 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.209
 that we will be able to find in the 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.009
 Microsoft's new operating system with 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.710
 this one we will see in this video how 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.510
 change the default web browser 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.570
 default that comes in windows 10 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.820
 you know that microsoft wants everyone 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.740
 users use microsoft page is 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.470
 a new browser because it's a new 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.090
 much faster browser much better 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.980
 for your performance 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.350
 the design is completely renovated 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.930
 then you have several reasons microsoft 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.940
 to use microsoft age and I'll 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.860
 I recommend totally but if suddenly 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.550
 you need to use for example internet 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.860
 explorer if you're already in a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.600
 operating system for companies and not 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.059
 you want to use microsoft is by the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.309
 topic of group policies or that can 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.769
 you have to use x today in browser 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.050
 so let's see how to change this 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.050
 default browser that we have in 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.229
 windows 10 any webpage or link 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.080
 that I now with for example will cut me 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.850
 will open with microsoft age for example 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.009
 let's search here on the internet jg there 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.920
 We promise you to look for it on the internet and 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.710
 As you can see, I opened that link with 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 microsoft page that by default by 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.690
 default comes in windows 10 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.580
 so how do we change this 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.869
 link east of web browser the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.820
 predetermined 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.259
 let's go here to the menu part 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.479
 start let's go here in the part of 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.300
 configuration and here in configuration 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.369
 let's go to the system part here in 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.950
 system we are going to locate the part 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.899
 of predetermined applications and there 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.670
 we will choose and we will be able to change 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.130
 such as the mail application 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.229
 the default e map 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.200
 the music player and here we have 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.539
 that of 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.520
 web browser we click on there and 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.909
 let's select now internet 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.990
 explorer or the other browser that is already 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.119
 installed on the computer that detects it 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.600
 by default and we will be able to select 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.179
 for example firefox chrome or another that 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.560
 be of our liking in this case I go 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.239
 to select internet explorer to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.920
 do the test we see that here is already 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.349
 making the changes we close the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.170
 configuration and we will see again to 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.880
 look in our cortana or any 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.970
 link or any question that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.880
