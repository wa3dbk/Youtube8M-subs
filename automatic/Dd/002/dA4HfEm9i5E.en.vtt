00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
and the reason we do this is not going

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.449 
and the reason we do this is not going
to<00:02:28.329> help<00:02:28.540> ourselves<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.260> our<00:02:29.290> family<00:02:29.500> because

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
this is hard work but it really pays off

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.990
