00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.220
 go to the supermarket the idea 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.199
 trying to get that thing over alone 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.940

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.750

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890
 the last screw will take a look 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.690
 sit here so that goes in that we have to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.420

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.130

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:14.090
 try it out as a frisbee it can be a bit of a thing 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.800
