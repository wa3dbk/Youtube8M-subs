00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.890
 wellness and excel or competitive appointment 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.350
 I work with herbalife to help you

 achieve an active and healthy life 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.920
 I want to share an exercise that 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.350
 will prepare the body for movements of 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.810
 I turn sports like tennis and tennis 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.550
 baseball involve rotation and if your 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.320
 body is not prepared these 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.529
 spinning movements can cause 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.870
 injuries let me show you how to do 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.690
 a high and low turn and so prepare the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.100
 muscles for better performance 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.140
 it seems boiled with the feet the width of 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.739
 the shoulders put the arms up and 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.629
 turn your hips slightly to the right 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.190
 when lowering the arms out of the knee 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.230
 left turn the feet for the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 movement be fluid and controlled 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.230
 return to the starting position and repeat 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.999
 do not depend on impulse and control your 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.059
 movements throughout the entire 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.059
 exercise 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.579
 let me show you how you are going to use 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:13.560
 a medium ball to add 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.560
 resistance and develop strength 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.630
 it is important to maintain good posture and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.270
 alignment to make movements of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.620
 turn to avoid any tension 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.480
 unnecessary in the back the knees and 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.820
 the hips 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.320
 try to make 10 turns on one side and 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.320
 then repeat what in the other
