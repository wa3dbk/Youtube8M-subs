00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.840 

hey<00:00:00.780> everyone<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.380> few<00:00:01.829> days<00:00:02.010> ago<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.399> got<00:00:02.610> the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey everyone a few days ago I got the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.840 
hey everyone a few days ago I got the
silver<00:00:03.270> mirror<00:00:03.629> cube<00:00:03.870> now<00:00:04.770> unlike<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.190> 3x3

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
silver mirror cube now unlike a 3x3

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.030 
silver mirror cube now unlike a 3x3
where<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> different<00:00:07.290> set<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.589> colors

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
where you have a different set of colors

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.640 
where you have a different set of colors
for<00:00:08.280> each<00:00:08.460> piece<00:00:08.790> on<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.870> mirror<00:00:10.080> cube<00:00:10.170> you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
for each piece on the mirror cube you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.740 
for each piece on the mirror cube you
have<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.040> different<00:00:11.460> shape<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.059> that's

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
have a different shape and that's

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.900 
have a different shape and that's
basically<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> goal<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.920> cube<00:00:14.219> because

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
basically the goal of this cube because

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.689 
basically the goal of this cube because
it<00:00:15.120> changes<00:00:15.540> shape<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:16.529> every<00:00:16.830> move<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it changes shape with every move so the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.300 
it changes shape with every move so the
goal<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.359> back<00:00:18.510> into<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.869> cube<00:00:19.310> now

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
goal is to get it back into a cube now

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.679 
goal is to get it back into a cube now
there<00:00:20.520> are<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> few<00:00:20.760> unusual<00:00:21.300> things<00:00:21.510> about

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
there are a few unusual things about

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
there are a few unusual things about
this<00:00:21.960> silvermere<00:00:22.439> cube<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.430> first<00:00:23.640> thing

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
this silvermere cube and the first thing

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.679 
this silvermere cube and the first thing
I<00:00:23.850> want<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.060> show<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> flower<00:00:24.869> pattern

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.139 

there<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.810> go<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
there we go and you can see that all the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.660 
there we go and you can see that all the
Centers<00:00:33.570> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> stick<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.550> one

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
Centers kind of stick out well this one

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.150 
Centers kind of stick out well this one
is<00:00:35.760> pushed<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:37.350> looks<00:00:37.739> kind<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
is pushed in and that looks kind of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:47.779 
is pushed in and that looks kind of
awkward<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:45.770> then<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> next<00:00:47.250> pattern<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.640> want

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
awkward and then the next pattern I want

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.720 
awkward and then the next pattern I want
to<00:00:47.879> show<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> checkerboard<00:00:49.489> now<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to show you is the checkerboard now this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
to show you is the checkerboard now this
pattern<00:00:51.030> makes<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> cube<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.930> lot<00:00:52.230> bigger

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pattern makes the cube look a lot bigger

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.360 
pattern makes the cube look a lot bigger
because<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> edges<00:00:53.760> stick<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:58.370> so

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because all of the edges stick out so

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.470 
because all of the edges stick out so
yeah<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> cube<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
yeah this is the cube in the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
yeah this is the cube in the
checkerboard<00:01:00.870> pattern<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.370> looks

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
checkerboard pattern and it just looks

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.170 
checkerboard pattern and it just looks
massive<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.600> compared<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> 3x3<00:01:05.090> looks<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
massive like compared to the 3x3 looks a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.270 
massive like compared to the 3x3 looks a
lot<00:01:06.299> bigger

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.740 

the<00:01:14.280> third<00:01:14.520> unusual<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.450> cube

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the third unusual thing about this cube

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.590 
the third unusual thing about this cube
are<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:17.040> streaks<00:01:17.640> over<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.270> I'm

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
are these little streaks over here I'm

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.969 
are these little streaks over here I'm
not<00:01:19.020> sure<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.320> they're<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.590> supposed<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.920> be

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
not sure if they're all supposed to be

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.950 
not sure if they're all supposed to be
facing<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> same<00:01:20.729> way<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.659> now<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> don't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
facing the same way but for now I don't

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
facing the same way but for now I don't
care<00:01:22.820> there<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.909> also<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.180> golden<00:01:24.600> version<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
care there was also a golden version of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.390 
care there was also a golden version of
this<00:01:25.170> cube<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.799> got<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> silver

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
this cube but I just got the silver

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.649 
this cube but I just got the silver
version<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.119> thought<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.479> looked

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
version because I thought it looked

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.010 
version because I thought it looked
nicer<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.090> can<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.299> use<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> 3x3

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
nicer and you can just use the 3x3

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.219 
nicer and you can just use the 3x3
method<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> solve<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.570> because<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.930> may<00:01:34.170> be

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
method to solve it and because it may be

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.480 
method to solve it and because it may be
a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.560> hard<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.189> piece<00:01:35.460> goes

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
a little hard to know which piece goes

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
a little hard to know which piece goes
where<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> first<00:01:36.630> layer<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.650> solved

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
where on the first layer I just solved

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
where on the first layer I just solved
the<00:01:37.890> narrow<00:01:38.189> layer<00:01:38.400> first<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.299> find

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the narrow layer first because I find

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
the narrow layer first because I find
those<00:01:39.689> pieces<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.170> easier<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> look<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
those pieces is easier to look for and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.929 
those pieces is easier to look for and
overall<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.829> definitely<00:01:44.399> recommend<00:01:44.700> this

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
overall I definitely recommend this

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.649 
overall I definitely recommend this
puzzle<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.200> amazon.com<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.399> about

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
puzzle I got it on amazon.com for about

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
puzzle I got it on amazon.com for about
750<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:50.119> yeah<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.100> rest<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.520> video

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
750 and yeah so the rest of this video

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.219 
750 and yeah so the rest of this video
is<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.329> me<00:01:54.540> solving<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
is just going to be me solving the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
is just going to be me solving the
puzzle<00:01:58.009> one<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> best<00:01:59.399> parts<00:01:59.700> about<00:01:59.759> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
puzzle one of the best parts about this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.600 
puzzle one of the best parts about this
cube<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.689> actually<00:02:00.960> scrambling<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> because

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
cube is actually scrambling it because

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.289 
cube is actually scrambling it because
you<00:02:03.119> get<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> make<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:04.710> all<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.299> wacky

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you get to make it into all these wacky

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:17.009 
you get to make it into all these wacky
shapes

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.599 

I'm<00:02:18.019> still<00:02:18.319> getting<00:02:18.590> kind<00:02:18.829> of<00:02:18.920> used<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
I'm still getting kind of used to the

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.479 
I'm still getting kind of used to the
shapes<00:02:20.019> like<00:02:21.019> normally<00:02:21.500> on<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.739> 3x3<00:02:22.099> I<00:02:22.310> would

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
shapes like normally on the 3x3 I would

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.119 
shapes like normally on the 3x3 I would
just<00:02:22.640> look<00:02:22.760> for<00:02:22.969> a<00:02:23.000> color<00:02:23.500> but<00:02:24.500> now<00:02:24.739> here<00:02:25.099> I

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
just look for a color but now here I

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:40.559 
just look for a color but now here I
have<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.489> look<00:02:25.609> for<00:02:25.879> within<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.840> shape<00:02:27.049> okay

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.129 

let's<00:02:41.569> look<00:02:42.019> scrambled<00:02:42.500> enough<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:44.120> first<00:02:44.840> I

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
let's look scrambled enough so first I

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.410 
let's look scrambled enough so first I
always<00:02:45.230> look<00:02:45.829> for<00:02:46.069> an<00:02:46.129> piece<00:02:46.790> with<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.120> narrow

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
always look for an piece with the narrow

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.599 
always look for an piece with the narrow
layer<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.019> then<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:48.950> line<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.250> up<00:02:49.400> with

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
layer and then I just line it up with

00:02:49.609 --> 00:03:19.420 
layer and then I just line it up with
the<00:02:49.700> center<00:02:57.099> here's<00:02:58.099> one<00:02:58.430> oh<00:03:17.590> yeah<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.190> then<00:03:19.310> I

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the center here's one oh yeah so then I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.250 
the center here's one oh yeah so then I
know<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:19.639> this<00:03:20.060> piece<00:03:20.269> that<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:21.019> layer<00:03:21.229> is

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
know that this piece that this layer is

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.809 
know that this piece that this layer is
going<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.979> narrow<00:03:22.250> layer<00:03:22.489> when<00:03:22.669> it's

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
going to be the narrow layer when it's

00:03:22.819 --> 00:05:30.150 
going to be the narrow layer when it's
solved<00:03:23.209> because<00:03:23.629> this<00:03:23.989> is<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.290> narrow<00:03:24.560> side

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.290 

okay<00:05:31.210> finally<00:05:32.210> got<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:33.229> first<00:05:33.500> layer<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:35.060> as

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
okay finally got the first layer so as

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.960 
okay finally got the first layer so as
you<00:05:35.449> can<00:05:35.569> see<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.780> am<00:05:35.990> kind<00:05:36.289> of<00:05:36.440> slow<00:05:36.789> but<00:05:37.789> that's

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
you can see I am kind of slow but that's

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.129 
you can see I am kind of slow but that's
because<00:05:38.150> I'm<00:05:38.330> still<00:05:38.509> getting<00:05:38.780> these<00:05:38.900> two<00:05:39.050> the

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
because I'm still getting these two the

00:05:39.139 --> 00:06:49.170 
because I'm still getting these two the
shapes

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.999 

okay<00:06:50.180> now<00:06:50.479> we<00:06:50.539> have<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:51.169> first<00:06:51.409> two<00:06:51.770> layers

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.009 
okay now we have the first two layers

00:06:52.009 --> 00:07:58.580 
okay now we have the first two layers
we're<00:06:52.909> almost<00:06:53.060> there

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:58.590 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.429 

so<00:07:59.590> yeah<00:07:59.710> that's<00:07:59.949> the<00:08:00.129> salt<00:08:00.520> Mira<00:08:01.180> cube<00:08:01.479> thank

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:02.439 
so yeah that's the salt Mira cube thank

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:04.170 
so yeah that's the salt Mira cube thank
you<00:08:02.620> for<00:08:02.889> watching<00:08:03.310> and<00:08:03.580> I'll<00:08:03.759> provide<00:08:03.939> a<00:08:04.060> link
