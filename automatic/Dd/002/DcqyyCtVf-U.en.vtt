00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.780
 hello to all I am amazed of a 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.340
 bep cooking points like today I 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.890
 proposes to you to achieve together 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.960
 look at the little homemade burger 100% 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.310
 house the dough inside everything then 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.560
 you will see this recipe is great 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.060
 nice not complicated to do and it's ok 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.859
 treat your friends right away 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.769
 ingredients for the recipe for 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.430
 make bread dough for burgers 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.280
 you will need 500 g of flour 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.500
 here you will need 100 milliliters 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.000
 of the 150 milliliters of water an egg 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.760
 Here I have the sugar salt and yeast 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.890
 so a teaspoon of salt 3 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.370
 teaspoons of sugar and 2 spoons 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.600
 coffee dried baker's yeast 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.870
 also you will need 30 g of 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.910
 butter and seeds so here for for 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.520
 top the top of your buns to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.050
 broker I'm going to make bread dough 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.299
 so finally for burger 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.280
 I will use my robot so very 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.630
 easy you start by mixing all 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.770
 dry ingredients 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.470
 so you can make it the machine to 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.640
 bread or by hand also so hop the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.840
 yeast salt sugar we start to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.910
 change a little bit and then 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.210
 gradually I will meet but 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.210
 team 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.119
 so hyper important it is necessary that the water 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.770
 and the milk is a small n 1 then not 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.850
 unemployed so here is so 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:52.560
 quietly look i want to open 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:52.560
 and I'm going m so the bacilli the water 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.170
 and break the egg directly so not 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.969
 new 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.920
 ok and let's go I keep beating 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.619
 could just keep the soft butter that one 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.239
 will add a little bit later 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.649
 so there you go knead for 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.860
 a few minutes the time it takes 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:22.299
 a ball of dough that stand out 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:27.250
 edges I now add my butter 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:30.280
 so soft butter 1 that's it and I'm going 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.680
 continue kneading the dough again two 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 small minute ski we will let 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:45.519
 get up we get a ball of dough 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.310
 perfect that we will let it rise 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.760
 for a good hour here you have 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.669
 a large mass of pasta the a1 which is 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.590
 shapes well but you leave it to 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.190
 ambient temperature so we have it covers 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.900
 quite simply 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.370
 and you let her rise a little 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.989
 hour look after an hour daddy you 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.609
 have doubled in volume 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.669
 so that's perfect that's what I 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:14.680
 wanted to hop I flour a little bit the 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:16.720
 above by a passing element and this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.590
 concert is that we will flatten a small 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:26.019
 little like that with your fingers ok we're going 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:30.610
 I will go get all the dough 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.769
 ok I lay on me on my work 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.450
 that I also flour a little bit 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.970
 here and the idea you flat hoisted 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:47.319
 until she does like these to 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:52.220
 about 1 centimeter and a half high 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.390
 so my trick to provide the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.670
 burgers it's going to be using a 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:01.069
 cookie cutter like this and hop was coming 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.170
 press it quietly that's it 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.390
 stepped a burger while pretty 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.310
 round but that you have this on 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.610
 your board on a covered plate 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:15.650
 of a baking paper and it's gone 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:22.000
 second so we call it boys 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.000
 pictured to burger 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.820
 so for the example here I'm going to do 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.720
 six I'm backing them together so 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.330
 before putting our little bugs in the oven 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.120
 there will be a second stage of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.590
 lifting so we'll be raising our 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.670
 burgers still a little half an hour so 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.180
 you have time an hour it's 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.800
 even better so I'm going to show you 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.420
 so once you have to falls 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.810
 you can re form a ball etc and 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.310
 makes you as many bunt as you have 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.930
 two paws and I just wanted to show 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.850
 so before leaving the lock bugs this 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.760
 you're going to do then it's easy 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.340
 with a small brush or with a small 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.020
 soaked sopalin paper and water so 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.230
 you baste each burns each 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.230
 bread 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.889
 here is something 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.370
 and so we will cover with seeds 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.950
 so ben traditionally these seeds 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:39.580
 sesame 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:41.080
 so your overall dotted but you can 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.240
 also use other mixtures of dan 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.560
 for example poppy seeds here 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.840
 it's mixtures to put in the 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.280
 bread dough for example hockey and 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.040
 then with the palm of your hand you 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.720
 will become a little can flatten 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.300
 hudgens for your bread so that the 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.470
 seeds gets embedded in and then for 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.410
 flatten it a little bit you'll see 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.970
 anyway he is well inflated with 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:07.360
 this second lifting session which 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.760
 so can you cover your bread and 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.020
 you forget them I tell you small 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.490
 half an hour an hour at temperature 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.230
 ambient if you have the time it's 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.670
 even better and we will find ourselves all to 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.340
 the hour of one for the last step for 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.040
 europe 1 the thigh by discovering our 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.020
 rolls so that makes a little 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.400
 hour that I try them up to 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.040
 ambient temperature so this towel 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.200
 see they have inflated well they are 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.850
 ready to be cooked then to cook them 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.710
 your oven at 200 Â° with a filled plate 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.030
 of water for example in the bottom or bowl 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.800
 of water to create a humid atmosphere 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:44.200
 and hot and that's it 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.510
 see I put a plan below with 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.120
 the water where you see more too maybe 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.670
 with the steam and I 'm going right now 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.830
 the rolls 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:57.390
 to the wrong and we find ourselves from here a 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:59.580
 twenty minutes max and here are our 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.680
 buns then look at prints 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.080
 beautiful colors 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.540
 so I'll leave them on the grid 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.990
 cool a little bit before 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.680
 garnish 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.120
 so here they are very mellow and the 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.740
 top and crisp but you 'll see 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.730
 just now for meals will be at 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.730
 oven at the last moment 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.310
 m 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:31.330
 m 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.330
 m
