00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.539 
also do the same if you search okay
let's<00:01:35.950> start<00:01:36.490> should<00:01:36.850> be<00:01:36.939> with<00:01:37.119> this<00:01:37.210> watch<00:01:37.509> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
let's start should be with this watch so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
let's start should be with this watch so
what<00:01:39.549> all<00:01:39.670> things<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:40.149> can<00:01:40.180> seen<00:01:40.659> this<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
what all things you can seen this so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.810 
what all things you can seen this so
these<00:01:45.280> three<00:01:45.729> dials<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.770> one<00:01:48.009> is<00:01:48.189> 24<00:01:48.610> hours

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
these three dials this one is 24 hours

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.990 
these three dials this one is 24 hours
dial<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.189> I<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:53.020> it's<00:01:53.229> for

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
dial and this is I think it's for

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.429 
dial and this is I think it's for
chronograph<00:01:55.680> okay<00:01:56.680> these<00:01:56.890> two<00:01:57.329> dials<00:01:58.439> will

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
chronograph okay these two dials will

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.149 
chronograph okay these two dials will
work<00:01:59.649> only<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:02.049> press<00:02:02.350> this<00:02:02.619> button<00:02:02.680> I

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
work only when I press this button I

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.399 
work only when I press this button I
guess<00:02:03.340> yeah<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:04.329> started<00:02:04.780> running<00:02:04.899> right

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.770 

so<00:02:07.979> basically<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> chronograph

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
so basically this is again a chronograph

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.080 
so basically this is again a chronograph
watch<00:02:09.990> you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.490> timer

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
watch you can it's like a timer

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.199 
watch you can it's like a timer
stopwatch<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:14.040> when<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> start<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.150> one

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
stopwatch so when you start this one

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.260 
stopwatch so when you start this one
when<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.930> press<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.440> button<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:17.700> will

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
when you press this button this will

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.640 
when you press this button this will
start<00:02:18.720> running<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:20.450> once<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.720> completes<00:02:21.989> it's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
start running and once it completes it's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.240 
start running and once it completes it's
one<00:02:23.010> whole<00:02:23.910> round<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.170> completes<00:02:25.709> 60

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
one whole round like if it completes 60

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.470 
one whole round like if it completes 60
seconds<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.810> will<00:02:28.020> move<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.880> do

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
seconds so this will move so you can do

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.660 
seconds so this will move so you can do
a<00:02:30.510> calculation<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.410> when<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.770> when<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.520> are

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
a calculation like when you when you are

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.990 
a calculation like when you when you are
if<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.300> are<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.480> runner<00:02:34.310> or<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.850> doing

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
if you are a runner or if you are doing

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.330 
if you are a runner or if you are doing
some<00:02:36.300> work<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.230> want<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.500> calculate<00:02:38.040> how

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
some work if you want to calculate how

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.040 
some work if you want to calculate how
much<00:02:38.670> time<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.030> are<00:02:39.150> taking<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.630> finish<00:02:39.900> that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
much time you are taking to finish that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.470 
much time you are taking to finish that
job<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.010> can<00:02:41.310> use<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.790> watch<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.300> that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
job so you can use this watch for that

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.000 
job so you can use this watch for that
like<00:02:43.319> as<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> stopwatch<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:45.350> other<00:02:46.350> things<00:02:46.739> are

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
like as a stopwatch and other things are

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.199 
like as a stopwatch and other things are
like<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:48.510> has<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.660> pretty<00:02:48.989> look<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:50.030> it's<00:02:51.030> a

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.449 
dress and this knob again it has two
steps<00:03:02.299> like<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.690> change<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.290> date<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:05.220> I

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
steps like you can change the date if I

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.309 
steps like you can change the date if I
ll<00:03:05.880> let<00:03:06.810> me<00:03:06.989> pull<00:03:07.350> one<00:03:07.380> step<00:03:08.040> first<00:03:08.720> yes<00:03:09.720> first

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
ll let me pull one step first yes first

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.789 
ll let me pull one step first yes first
step<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.390> adjust<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:13.079> date<00:03:13.790> and

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
step is that you can adjust the date and

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.400 
step is that you can adjust the date and
this<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.190> pull<00:03:17.549> one<00:03:17.760> more<00:03:17.820> time<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:19.380> you

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
this if you pull one more time so you

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.710 
this if you pull one more time so you
can<00:03:19.769> adjust<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.380> clock<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:24.150> basically<00:03:24.480> when

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
can adjust the clock so basically when

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.259 
can adjust the clock so basically when
you<00:03:24.750> adjust<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.530> clock<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.640> also<00:03:26.880> see

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
you adjust this clock you can also see

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
resetting again so when you buy your

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.790 
resetting again so when you buy your
watch<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.300> can<00:05:34.509> simply<00:05:35.080> go<00:05:35.319> through<00:05:35.349> all

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
watch you can simply go through all

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.710 
watch you can simply go through all
these<00:05:36.129> steps<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:36.699> you<00:05:36.759> can<00:05:37.000> check<00:05:37.240> your<00:05:37.449> watch

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
whether it is working correctly or not I

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.830
