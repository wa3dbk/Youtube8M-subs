00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.229 
traveling right on top of the oil if you
can<00:04:18.510> see<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.810> oh<00:04:19.519> I<00:04:20.519> want<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.820> catch<00:04:20.970> fire<00:04:21.180> and

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
can see it oh I want to catch fire and

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.130 
can see it oh I want to catch fire and
it's<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:21.630> diagonal<00:04:22.169> peaceful<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:23.960> if<00:04:24.960> it

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
it's so diagonal peaceful and if it

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.560 
it's so diagonal peaceful and if it
works<00:04:25.500> right<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:26.100> still<00:04:26.640> white<00:04:26.880> stuff<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.360> fire

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
works right a still white stuff on fire

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.940 
works right a still white stuff on fire
so<00:04:27.930> let's<00:04:28.110> test<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:30.020> there<00:04:31.020> we<00:04:31.140> go<00:04:31.230> yep<00:04:31.590> works

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
so let's test that there we go yep works

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.860 
so let's test that there we go yep works
oh<00:04:33.110> stop<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.410> turn<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.340> off<00:04:35.430> too<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.930> lava

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
oh stop it turn it off too so the lava

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.060 
oh stop it turn it off too so the lava
not<00:04:39.870> while<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.230> fire<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.740> disappear<00:04:41.600> or<00:04:42.600> not

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.740 

all<00:04:47.070> right<00:04:47.160> turn<00:04:47.370> your<00:04:47.460> wall<00:04:47.610> Oh

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.690 

I<00:04:51.810> guess<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.950> doesn't<00:04:53.100> work<00:04:53.250> like<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.430> but

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
I guess it doesn't work like that but

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.690 
I guess it doesn't work like that but
game<00:04:54.000> where<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.240> oil<00:04:54.270> turns<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.900> all<00:04:55.550> if<00:04:56.550> I

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
game where the oil turns it all if I

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.520 
game where the oil turns it all if I
could<00:04:56.850> get<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.090> oh<00:04:57.210> well<00:04:57.420> i'll<00:04:58.110> show<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.470> how

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530

could get it oh well i'll show you how
to<00:04:58.620> make<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.860> grenade<00:04:59.250> now<00:05:00.410> they're<00:05:01.410> grenade<00:05:01.770> is

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
to make a grenade now they're grenade is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.060 
to make a grenade now they're grenade is
just<00:05:03.540> like<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.780> others<00:05:04.050> except<00:05:04.440> it's<00:05:04.740> just

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
just like the others except it's just

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:13.610 
just like the others except it's just
gunpowder<00:05:05.970> umm<00:05:08.060> Danah<00:05:09.800> when<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.920> go<00:05:11.040> iron<00:05:12.620> tub

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
gunpowder umm Danah when you go iron tub

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.260 
gunpowder umm Danah when you go iron tub
set<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:13.920> up<00:05:14.010> in<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.390> fire<00:05:15.390> in<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.660> hole<00:05:20.270> okay

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
set it up in a fire in the hole okay

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.130 
set it up in a fire in the hole okay
that's<00:05:21.750> not<00:05:22.170> a<00:05:22.230> good<00:05:22.440> idea<00:05:23.810> now<00:05:24.810> they<00:05:24.900> just<00:05:24.930> got

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
that's not a good idea now they just got

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.600 
that's not a good idea now they just got
to<00:05:25.200> look<00:05:25.290> for<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.470> giant<00:05:25.860> source<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.220> light<00:05:26.460> and

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
to look for a giant source of light and

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.490 
to look for a giant source of light and
that<00:05:26.730> should<00:05:26.880> be<00:05:27.000> my<00:05:27.150> camp<00:05:27.390> there<00:05:28.290> we<00:05:28.380> go

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
that should be my camp there we go

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.020 
that should be my camp there we go
that's<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.310> reason<00:05:29.490> why<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.610> lined<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:29.970> with

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
that's the reason why I lined it with

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.990 
that's the reason why I lined it with
torches<00:05:30.420> all<00:05:31.380> right<00:05:31.680> all<00:05:31.860> all<00:05:32.430> my<00:05:32.640> stuff

I'm hoping all the server that mean Zack
and<00:05:49.140> video<00:05:49.350> and<00:05:49.440> everyone<00:05:49.710> have<00:05:49.860> is<00:05:50.280> there's

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
and video and everyone have is there's

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.550 
and video and everyone have is there's
not<00:05:51.120> a<00:05:51.150> lot<00:05:51.330> of<00:05:51.360> nooks<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:52.260> gun<00:05:52.380> body

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
not a lot of nooks and the gun body

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.640 
not a lot of nooks and the gun body
isn't<00:05:52.770> working<00:05:53.040> at<00:05:53.160> to<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.370> server<00:05:53.580> anyway<00:05:53.910> so

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
isn't working at to the server anyway so

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.900 
isn't working at to the server anyway so
this<00:05:55.650> thing<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:55.890> think<00:05:56.100> will<00:05:56.250> conceal<00:05:56.520> at<00:05:56.670> five

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910
