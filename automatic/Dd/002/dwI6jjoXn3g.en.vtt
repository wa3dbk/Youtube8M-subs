00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 25 euros six months or even less than 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.740
 thirty euros a single month prices 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 anticrisis in this new gym javier 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 how are you going to do it so easy 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.609
 we have reduced costs at the level of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.590
 rental of premises and especially for a 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.359
 great turnover of the clients we have 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.279
 from a very large place so that between 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.040
 many people a gym in bilbao has 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.040
 closed its doors and you just the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380
 you are opening like this is if we know 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.780
 that other gyms are closing 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.660
 we have done a great study to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.910
 economic level and social level within 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 of the area we need some qualities 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 quite broad in terms of population and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.879
 as for meters and we have determined 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.770
 that this was a perfect place for it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.780
 and for all those who still say 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.360
 good are very affordable prices like 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.879
 the machines are second-hand no no 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 in no case all the facilities 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.390
 totally new there are people who have already 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.189
 asked if you have showers because of course 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.450
 the prices are so affordable if 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.219
 effectively disposes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.020
 we have individual showers as 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.850
 can show and fully equipped 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.740
 so that any user can 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.630
 fight in our facilities we have 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 also dryer for the girls that this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.140
 it is very important if we then have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.000
 plates also for you to put 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.979
 pretty, you have to pay something for the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 lockers not the lockers that are 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.610
 inside the locker rooms are of use 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.679
 there will be some lockers 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 interiors that are for rent for 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.340
 people who want to leave their objects 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.649
 personal throughout the month this room 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.500
 It's beautiful but it also has another 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.810
 novelty which yes the truth is that this 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.849
 now we see it in light but it can 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.039
 this is becoming practically 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.000
 a nightclub to be able to do sport 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.920
 better 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.229
 we have a screen for in the hours 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.209
 that there is not a face- to- face monitor there 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.189
 through our cycling monitors 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.750
 virtual or virtual collective classes 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.610
 This is one of the three largest wings 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.470
 what we have if this is the room more 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.590
 great that is what we are going to do 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.780
 aerobics or more urban activities like 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.239
 hip hop dances or another kind of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 activities one of the novelties is that 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.349
 the instructions of the machines come 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.850
 also in Basque we have done until the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.840
 stickers so they know how to 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.819
 do the exercises 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.640
 the languages with Spanish or in Basque 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.069
 finely and with these prices javier los 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.080
 three young entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.730
 you think to make money of course yes 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 especially also with the closing of the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.540
 fitness place has come to us 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.180
 people to ask for information in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.049
 English to describe in the local is 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.280
