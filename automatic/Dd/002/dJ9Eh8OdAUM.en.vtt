00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 John, we bring you a video. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.260
 today I show four games is well 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.510
 cool there for android and i believe that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 with the three of them running there 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 andrade simpler 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.410
 the first is the name of everyone again 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.810
 the apps will be in the description and I'll talk 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.200
 soon so as not to take too long 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.309
 enter a video by getting everything back or 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 A very cool game. 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:47.879
 the Baptist 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.440
 It's a really cool game because he 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.930
 uses the gravitational sensor of the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 The colors are pretty cool. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.559
 the use of spaces is very good at 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 gameplay at ease by moving the tone 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.379
 It's really cool app It brings news 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.240
 is that boring thing you do the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.970
 most well-known movements already in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.000
 android games and alex that is the time 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.159
 Do not know how to be happy here and now it's going 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.049
 pass on the other side and ready is a game 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.720
 cool, well addictive, well worth it 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.509
 You take a look, beauty, that's it. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.180
 even the game is limited to this but it is the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.330
 game is very popular because this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.290
 kind of gambling is very good very easy 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.119
 so everyone likes these apps and if 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.720
 is again or the application itself is the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.360
 hoverboard board 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.159
 It's a pretty cool game too because he 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 also uses the gravitational sensor of the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.200
 your device and it works on androids 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.530
 Simpler Hello, here you are. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.390
 this affection here and it you will have to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.439
 get cause it does not smudge 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.880
 it floats you're maneuvering 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.040
 while he is in the air 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.180
 Let's see if I can show it to you. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.009
 you 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.009
 I'm going to make a move that soon 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.950
 there is not really cool and is also 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.569
 so I think it works in 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.430
 androids simpler 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.290
 I also want to bring these sessions there 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.909
 for simpler android 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.709
 for who does not know if the device that is 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.440
 making this video here is samsung 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.440
 galaxy s 48 taquara 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:39.090
 when you make a new you get more 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:39.090
 Money, there is maneuvering is good. 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.739
 For you it earns a lot. 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.840
 This was the wheldon robot that is a game. 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.049
 well cool there it's worth you give a 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.260
 look at the nineteenth it next year to this one 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:03:01.239
 the city boy is a really cool game 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:18.639
 Are you galeto games? Are you twittering them? 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:20.109
 there have nintendo game play is beginning 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.419
 this here sums up 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.040
 but with time it gets very difficult 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:28.090
 the first 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.239
 the cloud died in the cloud then 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.160
 fun half stopped like this but for who 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.870
 has lower android 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.799
 It's a cool way to have fun because 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.500
 you do not stand there and do nothing 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.139
 watch out for the clouds with things 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.359
 buildings touching 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.090
 so you can use yes to play a 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:55.239
 touch a longer touch what 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.760
 the more you go further and back with the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.709
 time will appear more lumens will 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.859
 space for you to skip or 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.459
 Difficulty increasing is getting 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.709
 very difficult and increasingly cool that I 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.829
 I have to think more about the use of 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.720
 Thought is pretty cool, this is a game. 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.449
 well cool even if it's worth you 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.229
 take a look and it was kid city hall 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.690
 the next is a time ronan much Pollan 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.630
 is the multilaser 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.030
 This is a game producer too. 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.850
 this is a pretty cool game and very cool 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.850
 it's worth you take a look 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.520
 Hi, this is the very cool game. 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.390
 teams is lightweight so on android more 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.240
 simple 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.710
 so that way you can see that it works 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:49.790
 well cool even deviate and here you 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.790
 passes beneath the index passes below 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.630
 that's when someone issues with time 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.640
 it's getting harder for you than 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.970
 to divert things but a 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.970
 pet 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.030
 It's really cool, yes, guys, there when 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.940
 You fall, you put it so, that's it, folks. 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.680
 this was the interpol runner ours 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.870
 applications in the order will be in the 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.060
