00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:13.099
 I have always grown a theater curiel enrique and then adding Cáceres 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.320
 lope de vega the local squandered apples and also has 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.310
 brought this book 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.619
 these festivals of Moors and Christians 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.220
 in particular the one published by the editorial fund 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.419
 Candle the Catholic is welcome many thanks for being here 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.890
 important this these colloquia because they are carried out 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.899
 well I think they are very important 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.339
 because not only do they bring Latin American researchers together, 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.860
 they also allow Europeans to 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 let's share these experiences 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.830
 in that sense the fact that the University of Navarre 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.020
 and the sek catholic university this entity in this project so widely is 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.450
 allowing to share ideas and 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.790
 than in those that have been very fruitful for our 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.230
 research 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 Pedro in Mexico the issue of privatization 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.740
 yes now he moved the one that worked 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.990
 this scheme of work to Peru 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.880
 this discussed a lot of anything the theater is relative and happy 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.370
 It has been a long tunnel 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.880
 because in Mexico we have enough testimony of the use of cc 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.490
 behind 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.090
 it's mostly throughout the 16th century 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.160
 in Peru for the different political and social circumstances that 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.480
 exhibited in ribeira with the first stage 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.890
 we have less testimonials but decided 17 and we started to have 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.980
 especially texts in which to support us for a hundred reports of the chronicle 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.170
 in that sense 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.940
 and it seems that the use of theater was very important and that they are 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.310
 discovering new tests 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.270
 we are always fine 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.110
 in a very important decades in that sense 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.910
 for example today in some 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.940
 a 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.290
 to a thread that is to say I did theater 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.150
 xinhua some collective with 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.760
 what can happen the theater 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.400
 Puerto Rico 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.950
 well easy to use in the chaos 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 that what we could call an ugly quality technically and economically 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.709
 in Mexico as in Peru 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.540
 the problem is that in Peru we still do not have the specific testimonies 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.569
 that the cables 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.049
 these elements that in a more concrete way for example 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.099
 whole we have percent testimonials from the chroniclers that tell us about how 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.760
 the Indians used 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.489
 pigs i will 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.719
 I each attack the gold to make the sets 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.119
 in representation 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.149
 she still needs us little shortage still we find the testimonies 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.810
 of use of anthropomorphic characters' decorations per hundred 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.470
 of acting tradition 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.780
 who has taken 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.199
 and then to Christian representations 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.349
 we are still looking for that assets that kind of documentation that 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.130
 it has to emerge necessarily 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.549
 jorge tapia quality is typical of the people and has to be 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.909
 pyrite stressed of course 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.019
 well look here I'll tell you it's a purchase that was not referred to on the spot 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.680
 the presidents of the cameras that belongs to the discard team 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.859
 explain this way from the guild huamantanga that is done 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.149
 to work 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:14.919
 the presentation 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.739
 this path does not understand that his notebook is a picture as they advance guaman 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.659

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.879
 Aído to see the festival of Moors and Christians 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.509

 robert harting 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.809
 of what we have found now because back 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.559
 I think I found why 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:42.489
 in the white water 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.489
 which represents every year a festival of Moors and Christians 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.870
 this is the generic name 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.079
 this kind of proper representation 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.469
 there is a battle 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.929
 in which a group that closes milk production modes 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.009
 jonathan welcome for him two communities 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.709

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.959
 of which I am very 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.719
 il 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.909
 that we have found 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.909
 even the team basically formed by unjustified dismissal 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.710
 i found 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.789
 and the party veracity 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.119
 it's the same one that is actually represented the cost is that every year 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.069
 to commemorate the fall of the Muslim kingdom 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.090

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.830
 celebrate the holidays 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.620
 at the beginning of the 20th century 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.830
 however we according to the fx channel 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.360
 which one 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.890
 somehow 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.309
 what confebask 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.090
 if we Peruvians 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.039
 We have a kind of oil well 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.780
 we saw how the goal 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.759
 they are of tradition 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.180
 giralt and 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.200
 investigate collect cataloged 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.289
 it is a rich material we have saltine accounts of formentera 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.379
 ii council 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.700
 almost children that was born the consent of the people Moors and Christians 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.180
 the time of the planet 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.099
 that says 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.270
 of a war that years 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.289
 Spanish and Christians 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.969
 the group led 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.270
 it's almost an act 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.610
 and the other group led by letter 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.610
 and among guys who were the last the Muslim 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.299

 when dying poster that produces the street of the Moors 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.699
 and then the Peruvians 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.360
 we have needed to catch one more episode I can not apologize 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.009
 there is no intention to disqualify the fellows that a councilor 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.179
 and is that he firmly believes in what is one of the first things to do 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.759
 since then the why 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.569
 efe santiago matamoros maintained that it is something that represents or kills Indians and without 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:11.930
 embargo
