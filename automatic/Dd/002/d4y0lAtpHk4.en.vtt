00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
that we made it before and it has to be

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.599 
that we made it before and it has to be
an<00:00:18.150> OGG<00:00:18.660> file<00:00:19.109> nothing<00:00:19.800> else<00:00:19.949> works<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
an OGG file nothing else works with it

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.040 
an OGG file nothing else works with it
it's<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.480> don't<00:00:22.289> know<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.900> into

properties and you're going to add a new

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.319 
properties and you're going to add a new
jar<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> build<00:00:29.130> path<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:35.030> what<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.149> need

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
jar to the build path so what you need

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.200 
jar to the build path so what you need
is<00:00:36.390> j<00:00:37.110> LG<00:00:37.260> G<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.920> J<00:00:38.750> Orbis<00:00:40.219> click<00:00:41.219> add<00:00:41.399> text<00:00:42.120> or

going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.310> we're<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> affect<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
going to do is we're going to affect the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.960 
going to do is we're going to affect the
pitch<00:01:46.159> we're<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.280> gonna<00:01:47.430> affect<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.820> pitch

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
pitch we're not gonna affect the pitch

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.100 
pitch we're not gonna affect the pitch
but<00:01:48.119> we're<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> affect<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> volume

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
but we're going to affect the volume

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
but we're going to affect the volume
that's<00:01:49.860> pretty<00:01:50.369> loud<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:52.460> I'll<00:01:53.460> put<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:56.149> 1.1

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that's pretty loud so I'll put it to 1.1

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.870 
that's pretty loud so I'll put it to 1.1
it's<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.869> safe<00:01:58.159> and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it's to be safe and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.179 
it's to be safe and
now<00:02:01.880> if<00:02:02.179> you<00:02:02.359> want<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.719> to<00:02:02.990> loop<00:02:03.530> instead<00:02:03.920> of

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
now if you want it to loop instead of

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.309 
now if you want it to loop instead of
play<00:02:04.939> I<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:06.789> yet<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.030> instead<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.899> do<00:02:09.080> play

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
play I think yet the instead of do play

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.690 
play I think yet the instead of do play
you<00:02:09.560> do<00:02:09.709> loop<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.860> now<00:02:12.860> we're<00:02:13.069> gonna<00:02:13.190> try<00:02:13.459> that

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
you do loop so now we're gonna try that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.740 
you do loop so now we're gonna try that
on<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.569> little<00:02:14.989> pong<00:02:15.200> game<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:17.299> let's<00:02:17.480> see<00:02:17.629> what

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
on a little pong game and let's see what

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.830 
on a little pong game and let's see what
we<00:02:17.810> get<00:02:17.900> okay<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.760> always<00:02:20.299> run<00:02:20.720> in

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
we get okay you know and always run in

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.130 
we get okay you know and always run in
the<00:02:20.930> background<00:02:24.580> all<00:02:25.580> right<00:02:26.200> let<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.349> load<00:02:27.560> it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the background all right let it load it

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:47.770 
the background all right let it load it
is<00:02:30.140> loading<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.489> will<00:02:46.640> loop<00:02:46.849> just<00:02:47.569> play

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
is loading so it will loop just play

00:02:47.780 --> 00:03:08.080 
is loading so it will loop just play
once<00:02:58.510> volume<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.890> don't<00:03:00.890> know<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.790> i<00:03:04.970> will<00:03:07.090> i'll

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
once volume I don't know so i will i'll

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.460 
once volume I don't know so i will i'll
get<00:03:08.269> a<00:03:08.299> tune<00:03:08.989> up<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.170> pitch<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:10.209> three

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
get a tune up the pitch to like three

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.110 
get a tune up the pitch to like three
see<00:03:12.470> how<00:03:12.590> they<00:03:12.739> like<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.850> we're<00:03:14.000> gonna

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
see how they like it so we're gonna

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.599 
see how they like it so we're gonna
strut<00:03:14.389> this<00:03:14.510> again<00:03:14.750> I'm<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:15.739> always<00:03:15.980> running

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
strut this again I'm just always running

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.670 
strut this again I'm just always running
the<00:03:16.700> background<00:03:17.180> garsh<00:03:20.200> now<00:03:21.200> see<00:03:21.560> what

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
the background garsh now see what

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.840 
the background garsh now see what
