00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.010
 exercise also extension but 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.780
 now we also make the effort towards 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.780
 back right leg 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.420

 We can include as a preparation 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.630
 initial more active prior to the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.840
 work with the main part of 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.840

 back of our body 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.620
 to see if it's more 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.740

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.930
 enables greater illumination and a 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.870
 preparation than in another type 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.700
 stretch we do not emphasize or do not 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.230
 we give work to certain type of musicians 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.810
 also where security and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.610
 confidence that our body is 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.610
 ready for a greater effort
