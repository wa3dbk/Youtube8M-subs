00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:04.470
 it's a system that can avoid the worst when everything is played out in a few 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.930
 fractions of a second this is the test the control system 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.790
 electronic stability his uncle change according to the builders but on 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 effectiveness is proven to such an extent that it will become mandatory to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.390
 united states from 2009 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.440
 europe is leading a campaign with the help of mikel player hours she 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.150
 encourages motorists to choose a model equipped with respect 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.320
 the purchase of their next vehicle it must be said that the stake was large 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.949
 i hope europe would save what are we 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.810
 yes and save 120 wounded in france and 6 in may 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.020
 SGSS 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.900
 to measure the input of the mind to hate the system on the circuit of 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.700
 deadfontaine north of paris 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 and for that we took a professional pilot 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.950
 he is a trainer and knows the technology 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.910
 the first text is to avoid a 70-kilometer obstacle by 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.110
 example crate that falls off a truck here is what happens with the test 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.790
 I see 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.700
 I'm happy with my place 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.969
 on most so they need time 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.799
 we lose control of his actions now the text without success 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.320
 alassane ouattara 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.030
 valls formerly this lawsuit 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.030
 the difference is glaring so what happened 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.910
 while the car is ready but that does not mean 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.000
 bush all the Christian faith 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.450
 we see it even better with these images 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.690
 the sensor specialist who compares 25 times per second 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.190
 path 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.420
 in addition to the direction the driver will take the system acts 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.820
 then to brake too individually each wheel the children 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.810
 from the east is very fast 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.570
 another case on a country road here is what happens when we 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.550
 tackles a bit fast in turns 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.110
 the fact that the opposite of controlling the trajectory and the ephemeral 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.700
 it's very useful 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.330
 it's an editing 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.030
 to to react to emergencies and happy 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.180
 the ability to act fast gold this stele will react faster than the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.510
 driver to help him 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.750
 to get out of difficult situations or at worst to limit 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.989
 consequences 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.659
 I also took the wheel of his peugeot 207 rc a sporty version with it the 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:16.859
 knew 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.479
 justice and electric power steering so braking her into 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.519
 line like dementia is different on each side of the road 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.719
 as you see when braking the car stays at the right 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.319
 and if we look inside 19 to 12 and together we caught my attention 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.009
 meal of cars against aubrac in a natural way and I stop suddenly 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.699
 easy right but as an offline control 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.059
 it's a different story 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:45.219
 the function that will be generalized on the range of 107 brings a plus in 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.289
 security matter the gain 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.879
 was about to plead for its existence tides the ride by not ensuring 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.799
 not in addition its stability of the vehicle 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.809
 already very effective the sp2 still improve in the coming years 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.150
 he will get rich 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.309
 other functions 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.350
 it is damask and more efficient system 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.770
 it's the ability to add value-added features like 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.090
 example hill start help the ability to manage systems 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.530
 to avoid assignments not yet entered the caravan and finally less 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.509
 noise so more comfort 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.519
 the French are not yet very familiar with the electronic control of 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.499
 stability 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.409
 but once we have tried hard 200 passes
