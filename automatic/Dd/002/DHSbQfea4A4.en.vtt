00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
defense and why they win is their

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.440

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
good and the Steelers are a good team

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.470 
good and the Steelers are a good team
and<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.770> really<00:03:47.070> i'll<00:03:47.220> play<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.610> steelers<00:03:47.760> for

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and we really i'll play the steelers for

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.449 
and we really i'll play the steelers for
about<00:03:48.660> three<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.990> half<00:03:49.020> quarters<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.650> then

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
about three and a half quarters and then

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.170 
about three and a half quarters and then
we<00:03:51.030> let<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.660> get<00:03:51.810> away<00:03:51.959> from<00:03:52.080> us<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.820> end

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
we let it get away from us and the end

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.640 
we let it get away from us and the end
is<00:03:54.270> what<00:03:54.450> matters<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.810> what<00:03:55.020> happened<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.500> let

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
going to be on the road in the playoffs

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.729

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
be a low wild card seat so you have to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.680 
be a low wild card seat so you have to
win<00:04:24.510> games<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.960> this<00:04:25.140> and

win games like this and

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.160 
win games like this and
that<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:27.280> not<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.640> now<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.790> do<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:28.360> get<00:04:28.720> confidence
