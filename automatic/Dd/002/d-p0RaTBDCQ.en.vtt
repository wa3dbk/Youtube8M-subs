or<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> Challenger<00:00:53.610> pro<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:53.969> approach

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
or the Challenger pro I don't approach

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
or the Challenger pro I don't approach
to<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> extra<00:00:55.379> features<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:56.219> much

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to the extra features but it's not much

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.680 
to the extra features but it's not much
different<00:00:56.399> other<00:00:56.879> than<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.180> doesn't<00:00:57.570> come

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
different other than it doesn't come

with<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> carrying<00:00:58.109> case<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.820> but<00:00:59.820> i<00:01:00.000> guess<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
with a carrying case and but i guess the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.380 
with a carrying case and but i guess the
keys<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.899> backlit<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.030> big<00:01:03.059> yet

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to order through compusa which I do not

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
to order through compusa which I do not
suggest<00:01:40.430> it'll<00:01:41.430> take<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.610> while<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.090> there

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
suggest it'll take a while to get there
