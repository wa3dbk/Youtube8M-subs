it would be the type of intensity where

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.220 
it would be the type of intensity where
you're<00:03:49.069> like<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.519> can<00:03:49.730> only<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.569> hold<00:03:51.019> a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
conversation that's the intensity this

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.089 
conversation that's the intensity this
is<00:03:55.430> hard<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.180> might<00:03:56.390> do<00:03:57.010> two<00:03:58.120> times<00:04:00.099> 17

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
is hard you might do two times 17

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
middle so that five minutes give you a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.940
