showed<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> stem<00:00:14.009> cells<00:00:14.309> not<00:00:14.790> only

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
showed that the stem cells not only

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.180 
showed that the stem cells not only
traveled<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> site<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> fracture<00:00:16.800> but

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
traveled to the site of the fracture but

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.519

fractures ability to heal and what we

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.730 
fractures ability to heal and what we
