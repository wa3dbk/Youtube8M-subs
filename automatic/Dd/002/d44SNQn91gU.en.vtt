the cooling fan off of the water pump so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.479 
the cooling fan off of the water pump so
you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> water<00:00:45.480> pump<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.750> about<00:00:46.019> out

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
you can see the water pump is about out

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:55.819

like<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:49.579> five<00:00:50.579> 10<00:00:50.969> millimeter<00:00:51.390> bolts<00:00:54.829> right

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
like that five 10 millimeter bolts right

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.610 
like that five 10 millimeter bolts right
there<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> how<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> did<00:01:00.839> it<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.109> actually<00:01:01.469> took

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
there so how I did it is actually took

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.020 
there so how I did it is actually took
out<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.519> two<00:01:03.120> three<00:01:03.510> four<00:01:04.610> 15<00:01:05.610> millimeter

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
out the one two three four 15 millimeter

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.550 
out the one two three four 15 millimeter
bolts<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.510> hold<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.460> fan

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.820 

deal<00:01:16.159> right<00:01:16.490> there<00:01:18.430> fan<00:01:19.430> clutch<00:01:19.760> assembly

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
deal right there fan clutch assembly

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.230 
deal right there fan clutch assembly
it's<00:01:21.830> electronically<00:01:22.460> monitored<00:01:22.760> or

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's electronically monitored or

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.060 
it's electronically monitored or
controlled<00:01:23.720> there<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> just<00:01:24.409> unbolted<00:01:24.890> that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
controlled there so I just unbolted that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.370 
controlled there so I just unbolted that
and<00:01:25.850> I<00:01:25.940> didn't<00:01:26.180> use<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.140> screwdriver<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:29.380> kind

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
and I didn't use the screwdriver to kind

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.600 
and I didn't use the screwdriver to kind
of<00:01:30.500> pry<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:30.770> out<00:01:30.950> because<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:31.310> kind<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.490> a

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
of pry it out because it's kind of a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.070 
of pry it out because it's kind of a
tight<00:01:31.790> fit<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:32.149> there<00:01:32.300> but<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.509> did<00:01:32.659> pry<00:01:32.899> off<00:01:33.050> the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
tight fit in there but I did pry off the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.800 
tight fit in there but I did pry off the
fan<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.619> separate<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.159> gives<00:01:35.149> me<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.509> hole

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
fan and separate it gives me that hole

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.200 
fan and separate it gives me that hole
there<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.509> then<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.750> can<00:01:38.899> just<00:01:39.049> take<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
there and then you can just take the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.990 
there and then you can just take the
course<00:01:41.210> take<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.479> belt<00:01:41.720> off<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:43.790> belt

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
course take the belt off the belt

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
course take the belt off the belt
tension<00:01:44.390> right<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.700> just<00:01:46.790> need<00:01:46.940> to

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
tension right here and you just need to

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.800 
tension right here and you just need to
pry<00:01:48.020> down<00:01:53.679> just<00:01:54.679> 3/8<00:01:55.130> ratchet<00:01:55.940> goes<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.659> there

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
pry down just 3/8 ratchet goes in there

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.840

you need to get the water pump out again
the<00:02:30.829> shroud<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.130> was<00:02:31.400> having<00:02:31.579> no<00:02:32.209> luck<00:02:32.239> getting

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the shroud I was having no luck getting

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.650 
the shroud I was having no luck getting
the<00:02:32.930> shroud<00:02:33.200> around<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.940> upper<00:02:34.940> outlet<00:02:35.540> on

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
the shroud around the upper outlet on

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.000 
the shroud around the upper outlet on
the<00:02:35.780> radiator<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:38.329> can<00:02:38.510> see<00:02:38.660> there's<00:02:38.840> two

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the radiator you can see there's two

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.080 
the radiator you can see there's two
transmission<00:02:40.010> lines<00:02:41.950> right<00:02:42.950> there<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.970> other

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
transmission lines right there the other

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.170 
transmission lines right there the other
option<00:02:44.450> would<00:02:45.170> be<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.350> guess<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.850> disconnect

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
option would be I guess is to disconnect

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.370 
option would be I guess is to disconnect
them<00:02:47.359> from<00:02:47.420> underneath<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.140> radiator<00:02:49.989> or<00:02:50.989> I

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
them from underneath the radiator or I

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.990 
them from underneath the radiator or I
tried<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.950> they<00:02:52.310> snapped<00:02:52.609> out<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.910> their

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
tried and they snapped out of their

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.430 
tried and they snapped out of their
holders<00:02:53.390> there<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.989> could<00:02:54.140> not<00:02:54.260> get

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
holders there but I just could not get

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.470 
holders there but I just could not get
the<00:02:54.530> fan<00:02:54.739> shroud<00:02:54.980> out<00:02:55.340> seem<00:02:55.940> too<00:02:56.120> tight<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
the fan shroud out seem too tight of a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.449 
the fan shroud out seem too tight of a
fit<00:02:56.769> so<00:02:57.769> I'm<00:02:57.829> not<00:02:57.950> sure<00:02:58.130> if<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.280> was<00:02:58.370> doing

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
fit so I'm not sure if I was doing

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.009 
fit so I'm not sure if I was doing
something<00:02:58.579> wrong<00:02:58.940> or<00:02:59.120> what<00:02:59.269> but<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.720> found<00:02:59.900> this

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
something wrong or what but I found this

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.890 

the<00:04:02.180> nice<00:04:02.360> threads

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
the nice threads

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.190 
the nice threads
and<00:04:03.049> we'll<00:04:03.260> lift<00:04:03.769> up<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:06.579> clutch<00:04:07.579> assembly

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and we'll lift up the clutch assembly

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.850 
and we'll lift up the clutch assembly
and<00:04:10.690> we<00:04:11.690> get<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.959> started<00:04:12.290> down<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.590> threads

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
and we get it started down the threads

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.990 
and we get it started down the threads
there<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:17.320> was<00:04:18.320> able<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.530> reach<00:04:18.739> through<00:04:19.190> over

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
there I was able to reach through over

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.020 
there I was able to reach through over
here<00:04:20.239> between<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.380> fan<00:04:21.650> blade<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.729> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
here between the fan blade and the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.710 
here between the fan blade and the
shroud<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.840> lift<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.710> up<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:25.570> think<00:04:26.570> what's

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
shroud and lift it up I think what's

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.140 
shroud and lift it up I think what's
really<00:04:26.780> best<00:04:27.169> is<00:04:27.380> just<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.860> line<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.430> up<00:04:28.639> with

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
really best is just to line it up with

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.640 
really best is just to line it up with
the<00:04:29.360> bolt<00:04:29.570> holes<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:32.080> mount<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.169> back<00:04:33.410> down<00:04:33.620> to

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
the bolt holes and mount it back down to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.650 
the bolt holes and mount it back down to
the<00:04:33.830> fan<00:04:34.070> first<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.789> then<00:04:34.880> lastly<00:04:35.450> we'll

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
the fan first and then lastly we'll

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.600 
the fan first and then lastly we'll
mount<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:36.020> onto<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.380> water<00:04:37.100> pump<00:04:37.370> assembly

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
mount it onto the water pump assembly

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.010 
mount it onto the water pump assembly
after<00:04:38.510> we<00:04:38.990> put<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.520> water<00:04:40.520> pump<00:04:40.820> pulley<00:04:41.120> on<00:04:44.020> so

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
after we put the water pump pulley on so

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.650 
after we put the water pump pulley on so
we're<00:04:45.229> going<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.440> put<00:04:45.560> this<00:04:45.680> on<00:04:49.360> put<00:04:50.360> this<00:04:50.479> on

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
we're going to put this on put this on

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.690 
we're going to put this on put this on
next<00:04:51.020> which<00:04:51.830> means<00:04:52.039> we'll<00:04:52.190> have<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.340> move<00:04:52.490> this

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
next which means we'll have to move this

00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:04.360 
next which means we'll have to move this
out<00:04:53.030> of<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.270> way<00:04:53.389> a<00:04:53.419> little<00:04:53.510> bit<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:04.280> we'll

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
out of the way a little bit so we'll

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.879 
out of the way a little bit so we'll
mount<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:05.210> then<00:05:05.300> we'll<00:05:05.510> mount<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:08.889> fan

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
mount that and then we'll mount the fan

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.810 
mount that and then we'll mount the fan
clutch<00:05:10.190> assembly<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.789> fan<00:05:12.580> scene<00:05:13.580> see<00:05:13.729> we

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
clutch assembly to the fan scene see we

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.850 
clutch assembly to the fan scene see we
got<00:05:13.910> our<00:05:13.970> four<00:05:14.630> thirteen<00:05:15.260> millimeter<00:05:15.410> bolts

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
got our four thirteen millimeter bolts

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.730 
got our four thirteen millimeter bolts
started<00:05:16.160> in<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.280> water<00:05:16.460> pump<00:05:16.669> pulley<00:05:17.740> get

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
started in the water pump pulley get

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.980 
started in the water pump pulley get
this<00:05:18.919> back<00:05:19.160> in<00:05:19.370> place<00:05:19.780> we're<00:05:20.780> going<00:05:20.870> to

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
this back in place we're going to

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.129 
this back in place we're going to
pulling<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.680> with<00:05:22.520> one<00:05:22.729> hand<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.210> then

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
pulling this with one hand and then

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.650 
pulling this with one hand and then
starting<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:24.950> bolt<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.520> course<00:05:26.270> in<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.479> proper

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
starting a bolt of course in the proper

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.610 
starting a bolt of course in the proper
hole<00:05:27.430> be<00:05:28.430> aware<00:05:28.669> of<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:29.120> wire<00:05:29.810> like<00:05:30.410> those

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
hole be aware of the wire like those

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.190 
hole be aware of the wire like those
from<00:05:31.099> here<00:05:31.479> down<00:05:32.479> in<00:05:32.630> there<00:05:32.810> so<00:05:32.840> it's

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
from here down in there so it's

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.910 
from here down in there so it's
basically<00:05:34.039> where<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.280> needs<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.610> be

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
basically where it needs to be

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.810 
basically where it needs to be
it'll<00:05:36.920> probably<00:05:37.040> only<00:05:37.310> mount<00:05:37.520> in<00:05:37.640> one

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
it'll probably only mount in one

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.960 
it'll probably only mount in one
position<00:05:38.330> though<00:05:38.450> really<00:05:39.340> so<00:05:40.340> I'm<00:05:40.760> going<00:05:40.910> to

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
position though really so I'm going to

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.310 
position though really so I'm going to
hold<00:05:41.120> this<00:05:41.270> in<00:05:41.450> place<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.870> get<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:41.990> bolt

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
hold this in place and get a bolt
