00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.579
 never 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.890
 I don't think it's goojie I 'm not sure 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:37.550
 however it is the same milan gameplay 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.910
 raga because 89 ganz tricks to make 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.340
 in only abbasanta canines here anyway 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.350
 both the video today will last suisse and minutes 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.590
 and a half then we still have six minutes 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.030
 to speak today given meanwhile vi 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.070
 thank you for committing the other 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.000
 day he liked it enough then 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.740
 I wanted to bring you the second type of 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.410
 comment that I prefer because to me 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.940
 love to tell stories you are 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.549
 however involve the public 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.449
 above all, however, there are types of 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.400
 history 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.990
 in fact before I told you those a 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.930
 a little more fun maybe those with 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.450
 some questions to get you involved 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.300
 now, on the other hand, we move on to the themes of trouble 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.000
 a little cult is something quite sad 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.550
 if we can call it that it is ugly and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.270
 but I really know that he has many 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.040
 therefore they are interested in the story here a 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.920
 me the very ones are very interested 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.630
 things because I'm curious here they are 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.880
 curious to go and find out maybe 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.700
 secrets that are not disclosed not 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 hunter 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.610
 so the cia will close the channel here 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.439
 especially to me anyway let's start 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.630
 today I wanted to talk more today 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.909
 of the Russian sleep experiment 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.630
 many of you may already know it 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.729
 however, the same is not true 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.039
 they will know however it will be only one 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.039
 small slice of pole will only know god 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.579
 and maybe cesco I'm not sure though 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.849
 however, let's start immediately very much 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.010
 long ago in a remote era 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.150
 I don't know, here we are at the page 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:21.480
 front if I read it then I tell you here 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.480
 some Russian scientists kept civic 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.670
 in the forties both at the end of the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.569
 forty five awake men 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.370
 so guys wake up in one place 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.440
 limited so a hard apartment 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.160
 part 20 maximum with a couple of rooms 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.010
 in any case it is a place we say a 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.440
 one-room apartment here is for two 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.480
 weeks then awake five people 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.970
 in the same room wake up for two 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.519
 weeks so imagine what it means 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.500
 say do not sleep for two weeks 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.299
 awesome stuff goes extra 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.819
 always closed in the same place e 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:03.329
 rather ugly using a gas anyway 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.620
 experimental based on stimulants ie 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.170
 rather 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.900
 even uglier because it is not that them 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.680
 kept him awake in a natural way no 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.620
 but made them strive to force them to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.420
 stay awake with methods 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.640
 chemicals 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.819
 these are these guinea pigs 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.970
 prisoners were let's say gods 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.799
 political prisoners considered enemies 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.040
 of the state during the second war 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.760
 worldwide in the eco group is for i 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.370
 first days 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.200
 everything went well maybe first 5 6 days 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.959
 everything went well because with that anyway 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.540
 gas did not feel fatigue did not 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.720
 they were complaining anyway he had been 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.450
 promised we falsely say that 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:55.030
 would have been released here though 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.220
 we say that this was not the end to end 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.670
 project also because you will see it later 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.950
 that already have to speed me up here 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.760
 during the sixth seventh day the quarries 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.910
 they began to show behaviors 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.530
 and tell the stories of the 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.060
 strange behavior here and tell 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.910
 of their dramatic stories 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.789
 fair past has more or less everything 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.979
 quiet, however, their speeches 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:26.410
 became increasingly sad and 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:28.330
 melancholy then the scientists thought 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.000
 let the guinea pigs say we do it to him 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.340
 a little pain and then try to escape 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.500
 to the experiment and then they also assumed 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.020
 that it was a gas effect 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.880
 after 9 days one of them started a 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.389
 scream and therefore already makes the first signs of 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.400
 madness 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.470
 maybe for the room continuing the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.199
 do with the part hours in a row when 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.490
 bigger more able to scream continues 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.490
 to emit sporadic guttural sounds 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.070
 so the smart ones probably the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.580
 they burned 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.160
 it continues however to a three verses therefore 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:07.920
 you can only imagine the pain there 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:10.770
 they continued and these guinea pigs 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.740
 started or deliriously why 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.950
 during these last days 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.410
 think that apart from going crazy they succeeded 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.210
 a series of events like the guinea pigs before 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.050
 they read a lot can start another 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.080
 make the paper and attach it and glass from 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.940
 where they were spied using their feces 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.500
 and therefore a very ugly stuff 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.690
 that thought was in condition 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:39.300
 room then they started even more there 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.090
 still signs of much wider madness 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.580
 echo began to tear the stomach and 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.980
 Attract this guts folliero guts 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.230
 point then the scientists could not 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.970
 see nothing more those did not speak 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.010
 more because in any case they had the hill 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.890
 vocal consumed because after a while everyone 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.910
 they started screaming, that's why 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.590
 crazy 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.470
 then the scientists decided to 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.830
 talk to him through the phones in 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.820
 microphones are released to release them once 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.820
 out these 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.080
 they were upsetting maybe I leave you the 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.720
 link in dismissal of their images 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.120
 here I have to cut it short and they said that 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.020
 however it was they were now the 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.360
 result of their madness 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.789
 they had become addicted to that gas 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.039
 then they all really died 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.960
 badly that video is already running out now 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.430
 gavina command like for the gameplay is the 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.050
 comment tell me if this kind of 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.520
 comment you like 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.080
 tell me even if you are interested in 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.030
 this story went to the page 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.930
 facebook where we always take to the place 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.370
 all the videos to the clan paintings or that all 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.370
 see you at the next beautiful video 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:52.409
 no 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:55.999
 you don't like ige tft killed 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.999
 you wanted to let me pass
