00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.140 
teaching you how to solve the Siamese
cube<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.680> will<00:00:05.370> be<00:00:05.460> going<00:00:05.670> into<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.910> bit<00:00:06.120> more

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
cube I will be going into a bit more

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.210 
cube I will be going into a bit more
detail<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.990> how<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.410> Siamese<00:00:07.919> cube

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
detail about how the Siamese cube

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.549 
detail about how the Siamese cube
actually<00:00:08.730> works<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.360> minute<00:00:09.630> but<00:00:10.170> first<00:00:10.349> I

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
actually works in a minute but first I

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.049 
actually works in a minute but first I
would<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.860> say<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> Siamese<00:00:11.759> cube

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
would like to say that the Siamese cube

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.180 
would like to say that the Siamese cube
cannot<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.599> bought<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.900> stores<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.799> Siamese

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
cannot be bought in stores the Siamese

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.430 
cannot be bought in stores the Siamese
cube<00:00:14.429> must<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.759> created<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.230> easily

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
cube must be created it can be easily

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
cube must be created it can be easily
made<00:00:16.770> by<00:00:17.010> gluing<00:00:17.460> two<00:00:17.760> Rubik's<00:00:18.240> Cube<00:00:18.510> through

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
made by gluing two Rubik's Cube through

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.720 
made by gluing two Rubik's Cube through
by<00:00:18.869> 3's<00:00:19.170> together<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.130> let<00:00:20.279> me<00:00:20.310> quickly<00:00:20.520> show

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
by 3's together so let me quickly show

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
by 3's together so let me quickly show
you<00:00:20.880> how<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.390> first<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.439> need<00:00:22.560> two

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
you how to do that first you need two

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.769 
you how to do that first you need two
cubes<00:00:23.100> obviously<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.359> want<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> choose

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
cubes obviously then you want to choose

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.880 
cubes obviously then you want to choose
the<00:00:24.840> side<00:00:25.140> where<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.350> want<00:00:25.500> them<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> be

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the side where you want them to be

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.550 
the side where you want them to be
connected<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.359> row<00:00:27.599> now<00:00:28.439> if

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
connected and take a one row now if

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.769 
connected and take a one row now if
you'll<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.970> way<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> took<00:00:30.359> them

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you'll see here the way I took them

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
you'll see here the way I took them
apart<00:00:30.920> I'll<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> red<00:00:33.210> side

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
apart I'll have all of the red side

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.720 
apart I'll have all of the red side
still<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.170> only<00:00:34.649> six<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.190> red<00:00:35.399> here

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
still there and only six to the red here

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.170 
still there and only six to the red here
and<00:00:35.910> same<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.050> green<00:00:37.290> orange<00:00:38.250> blue<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and same with the green orange blue and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660 
and same with the green orange blue and
then<00:00:39.809> yellow<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:41.070> now<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> I've<00:00:41.489> done<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
then yellow so now that I've done that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.950 
then yellow so now that I've done that
when<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> put<00:00:42.719> them<00:00:42.870> together<00:00:44.239> when<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.270> glue

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
when I put them together when I glue

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.330 
when I put them together when I glue
right<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> pieces<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
right here on the pieces and on here and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.680 
right here on the pieces and on here and
all<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.430> need<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> glue<00:00:51.360> them<00:00:51.539> together

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
all I need to do is glue them together

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
all I need to do is glue them together
like<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.699> turn<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
like this and now I all I can turn to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.490 
like this and now I all I can turn to
these<00:00:54.360> rows<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> side<00:00:56.129> ones<00:00:56.340> here

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
these rows and then the side ones here

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.680 
these rows and then the side ones here
so<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> being<00:00:59.100> said<00:00:59.219> let<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.210> cut<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
so with that being said let me cut to a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
so with that being said let me cut to a
different<00:01:01.020> viewpoint<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> Siamese<00:01:02.340> cube

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
different viewpoint of the Siamese cube

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
different viewpoint of the Siamese cube
and<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.270> will<00:01:03.420> show<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.690> how<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.110> begin<00:01:04.409> solving

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and I will show you how to begin solving

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.030 
and I will show you how to begin solving
here<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:05.970> Siamese<00:01:06.570> cube<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> crudely<00:01:07.439> made<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
here my Siamese cube is crudely made it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.950 
here my Siamese cube is crudely made it
is<00:01:08.340> made<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:08.970> turtle<00:01:09.360> cubes<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
is made out of two turtle cubes a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440 
is made out of two turtle cubes a
store-bought<00:01:10.530> Rubik's<00:01:11.130> Cube<00:01:11.369> brand<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.909> then

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
store-bought Rubik's Cube brand and then

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.980 
store-bought Rubik's Cube brand and then
a<00:01:12.979> sports<00:01:13.979> cube<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.479> happened<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
a sports cube this one happened to be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.320 
a sports cube this one happened to be
from<00:01:16.110> Oklahoma<00:01:16.680> University<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.180> was

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
from Oklahoma University which I was

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690 
from Oklahoma University which I was
given<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> buy<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> friend<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> did

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
given to buy as a friend so all I did

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640 
given to buy as a friend so all I did
was<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.090> made<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.479> glue<00:01:21.689> joint<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
was I made the glue joint right here and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
was I made the glue joint right here and
I<00:01:22.799> stuck<00:01:23.070> them<00:01:23.220> together<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.330> every<00:01:24.689> face

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I stuck them together so now every face

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.249 
I stuck them together so now every face
you<00:01:25.049> look<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.890> same<00:01:26.070> color<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.259> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you look at is the same color and the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.749 
you look at is the same color and the
white<00:01:28.409> stickers<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.920> peeling<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.520> that's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
white stickers are peeling but that's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.730 
white stickers are peeling but that's
classic<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.479> these<00:01:30.600> brand<00:01:31.500> anyway<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> now

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
classic for these brand anyway so now

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
classic for these brand anyway so now
with<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> siamese<00:01:35.250> cube<00:01:35.549> glued<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.270> may

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
with the siamese cube glued you may

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
with the siamese cube glued you may
already<00:01:36.659> notice<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> can't<00:01:38.070> turn<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
already notice that you can't turn the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.649 
already notice that you can't turn the
front<00:01:38.909> face<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:40.200> down<00:01:40.530> face<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.030> back<00:01:42.329> face

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
front face the down face the back face

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899 
front face the down face the back face
and<00:01:43.020> turning<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> left<00:01:44.130> face<00:01:44.460> won't<00:01:44.670> do

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and turning the left face won't do

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.340 
and turning the left face won't do
anything<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> can't<00:01:45.960> turn<00:01:46.140> any

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
anything because then you can't turn any

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.550 
anything because then you can't turn any
other<00:01:46.560> layers<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.930> only<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> total

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
other layers so you can only do a total

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.090 
other layers so you can only do a total
of<00:01:49.649> four<00:01:49.920> moves<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.979> do

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
of four moves you can do are you can do

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.590 
of four moves you can do are you can do
small<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.450> do

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
small are you can do you and you can do

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.459 
small are you can do you and you can do
em<00:01:58.219> with<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.399> being<00:01:59.610> said<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.079> jet

basically solving the Rubik's Cube to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.289 
basically solving the Rubik's Cube to
gin<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:05.219> means<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.700> return<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> right

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
gin which means you can return the right

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.499 
gin which means you can return the right
and<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.659> sides<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.770> small<00:02:08.160> R<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> M<00:02:09.090> are

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and up sides the small R and the M are

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.969 
and up sides the small R and the M are
just<00:02:09.810> variations

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
just variations

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.119 
just variations
of<00:02:11.069> turning<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.730> right<00:02:11.909> side<00:02:12.379> so<00:02:13.379> let<00:02:14.099> me

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
of turning the right side so let me

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.710 
of turning the right side so let me
screw<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.430> my<00:02:14.580> cube<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.330> will<00:02:15.480> teach<00:02:15.659> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
screw up my cube and I will teach you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.559 
screw up my cube and I will teach you
the<00:02:15.989> first<00:02:16.260> step<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.680> solving<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.580> Siamese

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
the first step in solving the Siamese

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.570 
the first step in solving the Siamese
Rubik's<00:02:18.959> Cube<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.709> see<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.310> my

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
Rubik's Cube as you can see here my

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.149 
Rubik's Cube as you can see here my
Siamese<00:02:21.030> cube<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.450> scrambled<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.590> let<00:02:22.830> me<00:02:22.950> say

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
Siamese cube is scrambled so let me say

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.610 
Siamese cube is scrambled so let me say
that<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.730> first<00:02:24.150> step<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:25.110> solving<00:02:25.319> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
that the first step to solving the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.979 
that the first step to solving the
Siamese<00:02:26.010> cube<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.549> orienting<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.599> center's

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
Siamese cube is orienting the center's

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.460 
Siamese cube is orienting the center's
since<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.459> small<00:02:29.670> ours<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:31.230> means

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
since you can do small ours that means

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.830 
since you can do small ours that means
that<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.860> center's<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.549> move<00:02:32.790> around<00:02:33.090> this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that the center's do move around this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.770 
that the center's do move around this
side<00:02:34.200> center<00:02:34.680> will<00:02:34.830> always<00:02:35.160> stay<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.400> same

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
side center will always stay the same

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.319 
side center will always stay the same
because<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.930> always<00:02:37.200> opposite<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.890> Center

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
because it's always opposite this Center

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.479 
because it's always opposite this Center
but<00:02:39.329> if<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:40.019> look<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.319> these<00:02:40.440> two<00:02:40.680> pieces<00:02:40.920> no

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
but if you look at these two pieces no

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.860 
but if you look at these two pieces no
matter<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:41.909> do<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.720> never

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
matter what you do you can never

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.479 
matter what you do you can never
separate<00:02:43.410> them<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:43.890> move<00:02:44.099> them<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
separate them or move them to a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.339 
separate them or move them to a
different<00:02:44.760> part<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.060> cube<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.170> need

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
different part of the cube so you need

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.920 
different part of the cube so you need
to<00:02:46.560> move<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.980> blue<00:02:47.220> center<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:48.239> match<00:02:48.390> up<00:02:48.599> here

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
to move the blue center to match up here

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.839 
to move the blue center to match up here
and<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.799> blue<00:02:49.950> center<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.489> case<00:02:50.670> is

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
and the blue center in this case is

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.000 
and the blue center in this case is
right<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.900> all<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.079> need<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.349> do<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.709> do<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
right here so all you need to do is do a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.580 
right here so all you need to do is do a
small<00:02:53.310> R<00:02:53.549> prime<00:02:53.879> if<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.750> blue<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.079> down<00:02:55.260> here

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
small R prime if the blue is down here

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.890 
small R prime if the blue is down here
all<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.190> need<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> do<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.700> small<00:02:57.030> R<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.540> if

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
all you need to do is a small R and if

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710 
all you need to do is a small R and if
it<00:02:57.989> was<00:02:58.079> on<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.319> small<00:02:59.160> are<00:02:59.340> too<00:02:59.720> now

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it was on the back small are too now

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
it was on the back small are too now
that<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.989> have<00:03:01.019> your<00:03:01.170> centers<00:03:01.709> oriented<00:03:02.250> you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
that you have your centers oriented you

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.190 
that you have your centers oriented you

yellow and this is going to be green you
don't<00:03:11.790> need<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:11.970> worry<00:03:12.239> about<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.750> orange

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
don't need to worry about the orange

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.990 
don't need to worry about the orange
side<00:03:13.349> which<00:03:13.769> on<00:03:13.950> which<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.670> side<00:03:14.849> of

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
side which on which is on this side of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.150 
side which on which is on this side of
the<00:03:15.060> cube<00:03:15.269> because<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.169> is<00:03:16.349> completely<00:03:16.769> hidden

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
the cube because it is completely hidden

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.849 
the cube because it is completely hidden
by<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.730> other<00:03:17.940> cube<00:03:18.260> so<00:03:19.260> now<00:03:19.380> what<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.680> want

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
by this other cube so now what you want

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.339 
by this other cube so now what you want
to<00:03:19.919> do<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.250> make<00:03:20.430> your<00:03:20.849> pseudo<00:03:21.209> cross<00:03:21.510> which<00:03:22.139> is

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
to do is make your pseudo cross which is

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.680 
to do is make your pseudo cross which is
just<00:03:22.650> adding<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.220> these<00:03:23.639> three<00:03:24.000> pieces<00:03:24.209> and

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
just adding in these three pieces and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.110 
just adding in these three pieces and
since<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.739> know<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.190> side<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.459> white<00:03:26.849> I

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
since I know that this side is white I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.960 
since I know that this side is white I
need<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.690> add<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.530> white<00:03:28.829> blue<00:03:29.190> piece<00:03:29.519> here

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
need to add in the white blue piece here

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.229 
need to add in the white blue piece here

here<00:03:38.849> there's<00:03:39.389> two<00:03:39.720> cases<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.650> each<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:41.099> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
here there's two cases for each of the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.870 
here there's two cases for each of the
front<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.760> back<00:03:41.849> edge<00:03:43.069> cross<00:03:44.069> pieces<00:03:44.489> if

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
front and back edge cross pieces if

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.650 
front and back edge cross pieces if
white<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.230> side<00:03:46.609> not<00:03:47.609> on<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.910> top<00:03:48.120> you

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
white is on the side not on the top you

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.599 
white is on the side not on the top you
want<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.989> move<00:03:49.169> it<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> left<00:03:49.650> side<00:03:50.130> here<00:03:50.489> by

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
want to move it to the left side here by

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.300 
want to move it to the left side here by
doing<00:03:50.669> a<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.769> M<00:03:53.299> u<00:03:54.299> prime<00:03:54.720> M<00:03:55.099> Prime<00:03:56.099> and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
doing a you and M u prime M Prime and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.780 
doing a you and M u prime M Prime and
that<00:03:57.000> Wilson<00:03:57.389> cert<00:03:57.629> it<00:03:57.720> there<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.489> that

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that Wilson cert it there but if that

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.409 
that Wilson cert it there but if that
wasn't<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.239> case<00:04:01.190> if<00:04:02.190> white<00:04:02.760> was<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.209> top

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
wasn't the case if white was on the top

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.390 
wasn't the case if white was on the top
like<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.590> want<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.889> match<00:04:05.069> it<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:05.340> with

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
like this you want to match it up with

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.580 
like this you want to match it up with
the<00:04:05.700> front<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.209> then<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:06.959> an<00:04:07.079> mu2<00:04:07.620> M<00:04:08.609> Prime<00:04:09.299> and

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
the front and then do an mu2 M Prime and

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.680 
the front and then do an mu2 M Prime and
that<00:04:10.590> will<00:04:10.769> match<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:10.949> up<00:04:11.160> here<00:04:11.489> now<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.329> want

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that will match it up here now you want

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.680 
that will match it up here now you want
to<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.230> red<00:04:13.560> again<00:04:14.519> there's<00:04:14.940> two<00:04:15.269> cases

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
to do the red again there's two cases

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.839 
to do the red again there's two cases
for<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.019> but<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:16.859> time<00:04:17.130> since<00:04:17.489> it's<00:04:17.639> on<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
for it but this time since it's on the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.849 
for it but this time since it's on the
side<00:04:18.060> you're<00:04:18.510> going<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.690> have<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:19.049> mess<00:04:19.409> up<00:04:19.590> one

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
side you're going to have to mess up one

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.740 
side you're going to have to mess up one
of<00:04:19.979> these<00:04:20.130> two<00:04:20.400> spots<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:21.060> since<00:04:21.599> you've

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
of these two spots and since you've

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.100 
of these two spots and since you've
already<00:04:21.780> done<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.200> one<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.710> want<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:22.919> mess

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
already done this one you want to mess

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.219 
already done this one you want to mess
the<00:04:23.319> back<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> if<00:04:24.969> white<00:04:25.300> was<00:04:25.449> on<00:04:25.569> the<00:04:25.689> top<00:04:25.900> you

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
the back so if white was on the top you

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.869 
the back so if white was on the top you
could<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.650> match<00:04:26.860> up<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:27.099> reds<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.699> bring

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
could just match up the reds and bring

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.179 
could just match up the reds and bring
it<00:04:27.969> down<00:04:28.199> but<00:04:29.199> in<00:04:29.319> this<00:04:29.409> case<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.889> can't

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
it down but in this case you can't

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.580 
it down but in this case you can't
because<00:04:30.669> doesn't<00:04:31.030> work<00:04:31.229> so<00:04:32.229> you<00:04:32.289> want<00:04:32.500> to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
because doesn't work so you want to

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.709 
because doesn't work so you want to
match<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.919> up<00:04:32.979> over<00:04:33.159> the<00:04:33.370> back<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:34.360> want<00:04:34.509> to<00:04:34.629> do

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719 
match it up over the back you want to do

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:39.360 
match it up over the back you want to do
an<00:04:34.840> M<00:04:35.080> Prime<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:36.669> m<00:04:37.449> and<00:04:37.780> now<00:04:38.590> you'll<00:04:38.830> see<00:04:38.919> that

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
an M Prime you m and now you'll see that

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.189 
an M Prime you m and now you'll see that
white<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:39.639> on<00:04:39.849> the<00:04:39.969> top<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.449> red<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.870> on<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
white is on the top and red is on the

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.679 
white is on the top and red is on the
front<00:04:41.460> match<00:04:42.460> up<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.699> red<00:04:42.969> on<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.270> side<00:04:43.479> and

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
front match up the red on the side and

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.219 
front match up the red on the side and
then<00:04:44.379> just<00:04:44.620> do<00:04:44.770> an<00:04:44.860> r2<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.729> bring<00:04:45.909> it<00:04:46.000> down<00:04:46.229> now

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
then just do an r2 to bring it down now

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.929 
then just do an r2 to bring it down now
you<00:04:47.289> have<00:04:47.500> two<00:04:47.740> pieces<00:04:48.129> of<00:04:48.159> your<00:04:48.370> pseudo<00:04:48.699> cross

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
you have two pieces of your pseudo cross

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.119 
you have two pieces of your pseudo cross
now<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:49.960> look<00:04:50.199> for<00:04:50.379> your<00:04:50.439> last<00:04:50.680> piece<00:04:50.919> and

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
now you look for your last piece and

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.779 
now you look for your last piece and
back<00:04:51.729> here<00:04:52.120> just<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.169> same<00:04:53.349> as<00:04:53.469> the<00:04:53.560> front<00:04:53.830> see

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
back here just the same as the front see

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.240 
back here just the same as the front see
how<00:04:54.939> whites<00:04:55.210> on<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.539> top<00:04:55.719> so<00:04:56.560> you'll<00:04:57.009> turn

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
how whites on the top so you'll turn

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.369 
how whites on the top so you'll turn
your<00:04:57.520> whole<00:04:57.789> Siamese<00:04:58.330> cube<00:04:58.689> so<00:04:58.960> your<00:04:59.139> green

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
your whole Siamese cube so your green

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.249 
your whole Siamese cube so your green
size<00:04:59.650> on<00:04:59.860> the<00:04:59.919> front<00:05:00.159> and<00:05:00.719> you<00:05:01.719> batch<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.169> up

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
size on the front and you batch it up

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.080 
size on the front and you batch it up
like<00:05:02.439> this<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.889> then<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.370> do<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.699> exact<00:05:04.000> same

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
like this and then you do the exact same

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.820 
like this and then you do the exact same
on<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.539> up<00:05:04.629> as<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:05.050> did<00:05:05.199> on<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.349> other<00:05:05.439> side

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
on the up as you did on the other side

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.649 
on the up as you did on the other side
with<00:05:06.189> white<00:05:06.400> on<00:05:06.430> top<00:05:07.500> mu2<00:05:08.500> M<00:05:08.830> Prime<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:10.000> that

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
with white on top mu2 M Prime and that

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.510 
with white on top mu2 M Prime and that
will<00:05:10.840> solve<00:05:11.080> your<00:05:11.199> pseudo<00:05:11.590> cross<00:05:12.569> now<00:05:13.919> if<00:05:14.919> your

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
will solve your pseudo cross now if your

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.409 
will solve your pseudo cross now if your
cross<00:05:16.090> piece<00:05:16.680> happen<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.830> be<00:05:17.949> in<00:05:18.219> here<00:05:18.729> no

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
cross piece happen to be in here no

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.659 
cross piece happen to be in here no
matter<00:05:19.569> which<00:05:19.930> way<00:05:20.199> it<00:05:20.229> is<00:05:20.529> all<00:05:20.979> you<00:05:21.430> have<00:05:21.550> to

matter which way it is all you have to

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.929 
matter which way it is all you have to
do<00:05:21.819> is<00:05:22.090> an<00:05:22.270> R<00:05:22.479> u<00:05:23.080> R<00:05:23.409> prime<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:24.430> get<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.699> to<00:05:24.819> the

do is an R u R prime to get it to the

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.209 
do is an R u R prime to get it to the
top<00:05:25.090> layer<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:25.659> now<00:05:26.199> you<00:05:26.259> can<00:05:26.620> assess<00:05:26.949> which

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
top layer and now you can assess which

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.519 
top layer and now you can assess which
of<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.580> two<00:05:28.089> algorithms<00:05:28.300> for<00:05:28.870> each<00:05:29.050> piece<00:05:29.319> you

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
of the two algorithms for each piece you

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.469 
of the two algorithms for each piece you
need<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.860> use<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.339> then<00:05:30.879> insert<00:05:31.240> it<00:05:31.360> the

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
need to use and then insert it the

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.980 
need to use and then insert it the
normal<00:05:31.659> way<00:05:31.839> and<00:05:33.240> then<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.360> have<00:05:34.479> solved<00:05:34.870> your

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
normal way and then you have solved your

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.249 
normal way and then you have solved your
pseudo<00:05:35.379> cross<00:05:35.789> next<00:05:36.789> is<00:05:37.089> to<00:05:37.509> get<00:05:37.719> the<00:05:37.990> first

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
pseudo cross next is to get the first

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.490 
pseudo cross next is to get the first
layer<00:05:38.560> done<00:05:39.539> so<00:05:40.539> all<00:05:40.690> you<00:05:40.810> need<00:05:40.839> to<00:05:41.050> do<00:05:41.169> is<00:05:41.199> put

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
layer done so all you need to do is put

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.860 
layer done so all you need to do is put
in<00:05:41.620> these<00:05:41.800> two<00:05:42.069> corner<00:05:42.430> pieces<00:05:42.639> so<00:05:43.569> look<00:05:43.750> on

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
in these two corner pieces so look on

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.140 
in these two corner pieces so look on
your<00:05:43.960> top<00:05:44.169> layer<00:05:44.469> and<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:45.520> is<00:05:45.699> the<00:05:45.819> exact

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
your top layer and this is the exact

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.240 
your top layer and this is the exact
same<00:05:46.419> as<00:05:46.690> solving<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.229> rubik's<00:05:47.620> cube<00:05:47.860> 3<00:05:48.099> by<00:05:48.219> 3

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
same as solving the rubik's cube 3 by 3

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.519 
same as solving the rubik's cube 3 by 3
so<00:05:49.000> if<00:05:49.060> you<00:05:49.210> know<00:05:49.330> how<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:49.479> solve<00:05:49.719> that<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.319> will

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
so if you know how to solve that it will

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.429 
so if you know how to solve that it will
greatly<00:05:50.710> help<00:05:50.949> this<00:05:51.629> there<00:05:52.629> are<00:05:52.750> three<00:05:52.990> cases

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:53.439 
greatly help this there are three cases

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.890 
greatly help this there are three cases
for<00:05:53.770> each<00:05:53.949> corner<00:05:54.279> first<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.419> position<00:05:55.870> it

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
for each corner first you position it

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.779 
for each corner first you position it
above<00:05:56.169> where<00:05:56.319> it<00:05:56.349> needs<00:05:56.529> to<00:05:56.620> go<00:05:56.740> see<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.550> have

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
above where it needs to go see I have

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.140 
above where it needs to go see I have
white<00:05:58.089> and<00:05:58.330> white<00:05:58.889> blue<00:05:59.889> and<00:05:59.919> blue<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:00.669> red

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
white and white blue and blue and red

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.540 
white and white blue and blue and red
and<00:06:01.210> red<00:06:01.629> so<00:06:02.199> this<00:06:02.409> piece<00:06:02.680> needs<00:06:03.099> to<00:06:03.279> go<00:06:03.370> down

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
and red so this piece needs to go down

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.329 
and red so this piece needs to go down
here<00:06:03.939> now<00:06:04.839> I<00:06:04.870> see<00:06:05.289> that<00:06:05.529> white<00:06:05.979> is<00:06:06.009> on<00:06:06.219> the

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:06.339 
here now I see that white is on the

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.050 
here now I see that white is on the
right<00:06:06.550> side<00:06:06.879> so<00:06:07.779> I<00:06:07.810> want<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.289> do<00:06:08.409> an<00:06:08.529> R<00:06:08.860> u<00:06:09.699> R

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
right side so I want to do an R u R

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.769 
right side so I want to do an R u R
Prime<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.139> that<00:06:12.009> will<00:06:12.159> match<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.339> up<00:06:12.550> here<00:06:12.849> but

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
Prime and that will match it up here but

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.320 
Prime and that will match it up here but
let's<00:06:13.960> say<00:06:14.139> it<00:06:14.259> wasn't<00:06:14.439> like<00:06:14.680> that<00:06:15.150> let's<00:06:16.150> say

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
let's say it wasn't like that let's say

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.779 
let's say it wasn't like that let's say
it<00:06:16.449> was<00:06:16.569> on<00:06:16.689> the<00:06:16.870> left<00:06:17.080> side<00:06:17.319> or<00:06:17.979> the<00:06:18.219> front<00:06:18.610> in

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
it was on the left side or the front in

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.899 
it was on the left side or the front in
this<00:06:18.909> case<00:06:19.150> what<00:06:20.050> you<00:06:20.199> want<00:06:20.349> to<00:06:20.500> do<00:06:20.650> is<00:06:20.860> a<00:06:20.919> you

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
this case what you want to do is a you

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:26.640 
this case what you want to do is a you

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
are u prime R Prime and that one started

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.300 
are u prime R Prime and that one started
here<00:06:27.159> and<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:28.180> last<00:06:28.419> case<00:06:28.719> is<00:06:28.990> if<00:06:29.770> white<00:06:30.039> is<00:06:30.069> on

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
here and the last case is if white is on

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.079 
here and the last case is if white is on
the<00:06:30.460> top<00:06:30.699> what<00:06:31.599> you<00:06:31.719> want<00:06:31.870> to<00:06:31.990> do<00:06:32.110> is<00:06:32.349> an<00:06:32.770> R<00:06:33.089> u

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089 
the top what you want to do is an R u

and<00:06:36.229> now<00:06:36.560> your<00:06:36.800> pieces<00:06:37.009> back<00:06:37.280> here<00:06:37.639> put<00:06:38.479> it<00:06:38.569> on

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
and now your pieces back here put it on

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.570 
and now your pieces back here put it on
top<00:06:38.870> of<00:06:38.930> where<00:06:39.139> it<00:06:39.229> goes<00:06:39.379> and<00:06:39.680> you'll<00:06:40.129> see<00:06:40.340> that

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
top of where it goes and you'll see that

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.159 
top of where it goes and you'll see that
wipes<00:06:40.819> on<00:06:41.030> the<00:06:41.060> right<00:06:41.270> so<00:06:41.539> you<00:06:41.629> can<00:06:41.780> do<00:06:41.870> an<00:06:41.990> are

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
wipes on the right so you can do an are

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.429 
wipes on the right so you can do an are
you<00:06:42.560> are<00:06:42.800> prime<00:06:43.159> to<00:06:43.580> insert<00:06:43.939> it<00:06:44.110> now<00:06:45.110> you<00:06:45.169> want

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:45.439 
you are prime to insert it now you want

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.890 
you are prime to insert it now you want
to<00:06:45.529> insert<00:06:45.770> this<00:06:45.979> piece<00:06:46.249> back<00:06:46.490> here<00:06:46.819> so<00:06:47.449> turn

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
to insert this piece back here so turn

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.350 
to insert this piece back here so turn
the<00:06:48.080> whole<00:06:48.319> Siamese<00:06:48.830> cube<00:06:49.159> put<00:06:49.909> the<00:06:50.029> corner

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
the whole Siamese cube put the corner

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.719 
the whole Siamese cube put the corner
above<00:06:50.449> where<00:06:50.870> it<00:06:50.900> needs<00:06:51.080> to<00:06:51.199> go<00:06:51.289> and<00:06:51.729> you'll

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
above where it needs to go and you'll

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.719 
above where it needs to go and you'll
see<00:06:52.969> that<00:06:53.509> that<00:06:54.139> white<00:06:54.349> is<00:06:54.379> on<00:06:54.590> the<00:06:54.740> left<00:06:54.949> so

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
see that that white is on the left so

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.730 
see that that white is on the left so
you'll<00:06:55.909> do<00:06:56.029> the<00:06:56.060> same<00:06:56.180> basic<00:06:56.900> concept<00:06:56.930> as<00:06:57.590> you

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
you'll do the same basic concept as you

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.640 
you'll do the same basic concept as you
did<00:06:57.979> when<00:06:58.340> it<00:06:58.400> was<00:06:58.520> on<00:06:58.639> the<00:06:59.180> front<00:06:59.449> here<00:06:59.599> as<00:07:00.050> you

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
did when it was on the front here as you

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.450 
did when it was on the front here as you

do an L prime u prime L and that will

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.269 
do an L prime u prime L and that will
match<00:07:04.639> it<00:07:04.669> up<00:07:04.879> here<00:07:05.439> next<00:07:06.439> if<00:07:06.800> it's<00:07:07.099> on<00:07:07.249> the

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:20.890 
match it up in here now in the last case
just<00:07:18.949> as<00:07:19.069> I<00:07:19.159> showed<00:07:19.340> you<00:07:19.370> before<00:07:19.610> if<00:07:20.060> white<00:07:20.870> is

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
just as I showed you before if white is

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.010 
just as I showed you before if white is
on<00:07:21.110> the<00:07:21.259> top<00:07:21.500> what<00:07:22.460> you<00:07:22.580> want<00:07:22.729> to<00:07:22.819> do<00:07:22.969> is<00:07:23.210> an<00:07:23.719> l

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
on the top what you want to do is an l

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.110 
on the top what you want to do is an l
prime<00:07:24.379> u<00:07:25.250> L<00:07:26.029> now<00:07:26.930> your<00:07:27.139> paces<00:07:27.500> back<00:07:27.680> here<00:07:28.120> bring

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
prime u L now your paces back here bring

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.279 
prime u L now your paces back here bring
it<00:07:29.240> on<00:07:29.330> top<00:07:29.599> of<00:07:29.779> where<00:07:29.839> it's<00:07:29.960> supposed<00:07:30.020> to<00:07:30.229> go

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:30.289 
it on top of where it's supposed to go

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:31.659 
it on top of where it's supposed to go
and<00:07:30.620> now<00:07:30.740> you'll<00:07:30.949> see<00:07:30.979> that<00:07:31.159> it's<00:07:31.279> on<00:07:31.370> the<00:07:31.490> left

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669 
and now you'll see that it's on the left

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:35.649 
and now you'll see that it's on the left
so<00:07:32.240> you<00:07:32.330> can<00:07:32.479> do<00:07:32.569> the<00:07:32.599> same<00:07:32.870> thing<00:07:33.169> l<00:07:33.860> prime<00:07:34.339> u<00:07:34.909> l

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:35.659 
so you can do the same thing l prime u l

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:38.920 
so you can do the same thing l prime u l
and<00:07:36.189> now<00:07:37.189> you<00:07:37.249> have<00:07:37.400> solved<00:07:37.909> the<00:07:38.210> first<00:07:38.479> layer

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930 
and now you have solved the first layer

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.709 
and now you have solved the first layer
of<00:07:39.169> one<00:07:39.620> of<00:07:39.740> your<00:07:39.860> Siamese<00:07:40.250> cubes<00:07:40.639> what<00:07:41.629> you

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:41.719 
of one of your Siamese cubes what you

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:43.899 
of one of your Siamese cubes what you
can<00:07:41.930> do<00:07:42.110> now<00:07:42.319> is<00:07:42.349> you<00:07:42.740> can<00:07:42.889> either<00:07:42.979> go<00:07:43.250> on<00:07:43.460> to

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:43.909 
can do now is you can either go on to

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:47.320 
can do now is you can either go on to
solving<00:07:44.270> this<00:07:44.389> whole<00:07:44.659> cube<00:07:44.990> or<00:07:45.789> you<00:07:46.789> can<00:07:47.000> start

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.330 
solving this whole cube or you can start

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.600 
solving this whole cube or you can start
over<00:07:47.539> and<00:07:47.870> solve<00:07:48.379> the<00:07:48.740> first<00:07:48.979> layer<00:07:49.219> on<00:07:49.400> this

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610 
over and solve the first layer on this

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.730 
over and solve the first layer on this
cube<00:07:49.909> I<00:07:50.120> would<00:07:50.839> recommend<00:07:51.110> completely

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:51.740 
cube I would recommend completely

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.050 
cube I would recommend completely
solving<00:07:52.039> this<00:07:52.159> one<00:07:52.339> first<00:07:52.580> but<00:07:52.909> it's

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.060 
solving this one first but it's

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.329 
solving this one first but it's
completely<00:07:53.509> up<00:07:53.629> to<00:07:53.659> you<00:07:53.870> so<00:07:54.649> find<00:07:54.949> the<00:07:55.069> link<00:07:55.279> in
