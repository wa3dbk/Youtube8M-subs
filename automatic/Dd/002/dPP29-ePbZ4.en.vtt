00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

I<00:00:00.359> think<00:00:01.110> it's<00:00:01.199> about<00:00:01.410> time<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.680> test<00:00:02.310> out<00:00:02.520> this

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
I think it's about time to test out this

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:11.419 
I think it's about time to test out this
jury<00:00:07.340> I<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:09.290> do<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.469> before<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.950> rains<00:00:11.160> but

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
jury I can do this before it rains but

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.240 
jury I can do this before it rains but
we'll<00:00:11.580> see

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.890 

see<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.340> she<00:00:17.460> starts<00:00:17.790> first

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.230 

like<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> champ<00:00:22.520> all<00:00:23.520> right<00:00:23.670> I'll<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:23.910> her<00:00:24.029> into

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
like a champ all right I'll get her into

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
like a champ all right I'll get her into
position<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> here's<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:26.580> gonna<00:00:26.670> try

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
position and here's what we're gonna try

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.960 
position and here's what we're gonna try
to<00:00:26.970> lift<00:00:27.270> I<00:00:27.950> need<00:00:28.950> to<00:00:29.039> get<00:00:29.189> my<00:00:29.310> jack<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.759> from

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
to lift I need to get my jack on from

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
to lift I need to get my jack on from
underneath<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.779> we're<00:00:31.200> gonna<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.529> if

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
underneath there so we're gonna see if

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
underneath there so we're gonna see if
this<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.890> pick<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> up<00:00:32.279> enough<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.780> at<00:00:33.780> least

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
this can pick it up enough to at least

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.340 
this can pick it up enough to at least
get<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.260> jack<00:00:34.500> off<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.520> my<00:00:35.730> F<00:00:36.350> but

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
get my jack off I don't have my F but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.170 
get my jack off I don't have my F but
little<00:00:37.559> pegs<00:00:37.800> put<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.220> yet<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.670> don't<00:00:38.970> have

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
little pegs put on yet I don't have

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
little pegs put on yet I don't have
they're<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.510> done<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.080> I<00:00:40.559> can't<00:00:41.280> put<00:00:41.430> those<00:00:41.550> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
they're not done so I can't put those in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.369 
they're not done so I can't put those in
and<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.059> suspension<00:00:42.570> will<00:00:42.660> probably<00:00:43.110> squat

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and the suspension will probably squat

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.140 
and the suspension will probably squat
quite<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> bit<00:00:43.980> before<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.370> goes<00:00:44.489> anywhere<00:00:44.790> but

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
quite a bit before it goes anywhere but

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.450 
quite a bit before it goes anywhere but
we'll<00:00:46.110> give<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.440> try<00:00:46.589> hopefully<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.400> get

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
we'll give it a try hopefully we get

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:38.980 
we'll give it a try hopefully we get
this<00:00:47.640> done<00:00:47.850> before<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.180> rains

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.040 

and<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.050> course<00:01:40.260> no<00:01:41.150> rain

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
and of course no rain

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.359 
and of course no rain
put<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.920> camera<00:01:44.130> away<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.910> works<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:46.369> think

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
put the camera away but it works I think

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
put the camera away but it works I think
once<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.530> pigs<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.950> we'll

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
once I get my my little pigs in we'll

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
once I get my my little pigs in we'll
try<00:01:50.390> lifting<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> whole<00:01:51.780> thing<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> way

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
try lifting the whole thing all the way

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.450 
try lifting the whole thing all the way

how well apples once I put her in
four-wheel<00:03:41.230> drive<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:43.060> just<00:03:43.269> went<00:03:43.480> oh<00:03:45.480> like

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
four-wheel drive it it just went oh like

four-wheel drive it it just went oh like
it<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.379> not<00:03:47.500> it's<00:03:47.980> not<00:03:48.129> close<00:03:48.310> enough<00:03:48.519> to

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
it and it's not it's not close enough to

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.390 
it and it's not it's not close enough to
the<00:03:48.730> back<00:03:48.909> where<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.209> hits<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.510> either<00:03:49.629> so<00:03:50.400> yeah

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
the back where it hits it either so yeah

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.580 
the back where it hits it either so yeah
this<00:03:51.849> is<00:03:51.909> good<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.180> got<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.480> think<00:03:53.379> I'm<00:03:53.439> going<00:03:53.560> to

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
this is good I got a think I'm going to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.979 
this is good I got a think I'm going to
move<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.889> truck<00:03:54.239> I'm<00:03:55.239> gonna<00:03:55.359> put<00:03:55.599> this<00:03:55.750> thing

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
move that truck I'm gonna put this thing

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.800 
move that truck I'm gonna put this thing
right<00:03:56.909> right<00:03:57.909> kind<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.120> where<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.389> truck<00:03:58.599> is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
right right kind of where the truck is

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.119 
right right kind of where the truck is
if<00:03:58.989> we<00:03:59.109> kind<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.409> out<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.650> way<00:03:59.769> there<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.129> I

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
if we kind of out of the way there so I

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.500 
if we kind of out of the way there so I
guess<00:04:03.129> I'm<00:04:03.579> gonna<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.939> get<00:04:04.060> out<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.329> fire

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
guess I'm gonna have to get out and fire

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.399
