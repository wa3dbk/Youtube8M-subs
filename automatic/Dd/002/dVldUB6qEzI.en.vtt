00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
going to show you some of the tools that

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.100 
going to show you some of the tools that
we<00:00:16.340> have<00:00:16.369> at<00:00:16.790> our<00:00:16.820> disposal<00:00:16.940> at<00:00:17.540> General

we have at our disposal at General
Motors<00:00:18.610> this<00:00:19.610> is<00:00:19.790> a<00:00:19.820> piece<00:00:20.630> of<00:00:20.660> software

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
Motors this is a piece of software

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.140 
Motors this is a piece of software
called<00:00:21.170> auto<00:00:21.830> studio<00:00:22.280> that's<00:00:22.550> made<00:00:22.760> by<00:00:22.790> what

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
called auto studio that's made by what

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.140 
called auto studio that's made by what
it<00:00:23.240> is<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:24.740> is<00:00:24.800> basically<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.580> software

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
it is and this is basically the software

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150 
it is and this is basically the software
that<00:00:26.180> we<00:00:26.450> use<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.869> do<00:00:27.020> do<00:00:27.440> all<00:00:27.590> our<00:00:27.800> digital

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
that we use to do do all our digital

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.100 
that we use to do do all our digital
sketching<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:29.660> sculpting<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:31.369> it's<00:00:32.149> a<00:00:32.300> it's

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
sketching and sculpting and it's a it's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.640 
sketching and sculpting and it's a it's
a<00:00:33.260> huge<00:00:33.800> part<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.280> design<00:00:34.400> process<00:00:35.650> that

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
a huge part of the design process that

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.830 
a huge part of the design process that
enables<00:00:36.829> us<00:00:37.130> to<00:00:37.190> translate<00:00:37.700> them<00:00:38.300> from<00:00:38.720> the

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
enables us to translate them from the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.479 
enables us to translate them from the
initial<00:00:38.960> sketch<00:00:39.410> straight<00:00:39.980> into<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.220> 3d

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
initial sketch straight into the 3d

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.310 
initial sketch straight into the 3d
model<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.390> I'll<00:00:41.480> just<00:00:41.540> do<00:00:41.780> some<00:00:41.960> sketching

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
model so I'll just do some sketching

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.260 
model so I'll just do some sketching
just<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:42.560> show<00:00:42.739> you<00:00:42.770> how<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.040> works

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
just to show you how it works

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.710 
just to show you how it works
the<00:00:44.840> equipment<00:00:45.200> is<00:00:45.230> basically<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.730> cintiq

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
the equipment is basically a cintiq

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.850 
the equipment is basically a cintiq
which<00:00:47.930> is<00:00:48.080> a<00:00:48.670> pressure-sensitive<00:00:50.260> tablet<00:00:51.260> so

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
which is a pressure-sensitive tablet so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.100 
which is a pressure-sensitive tablet so
it<00:00:52.220> enables<00:00:52.460> us<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.790> sketch<00:00:53.180> directly<00:00:53.930> onto

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
it enables us to sketch directly onto

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.820 
it enables us to sketch directly onto
the<00:00:54.350> screen<00:00:54.670> just<00:00:55.670> as<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.720> were<00:00:57.170> if<00:00:57.530> we<00:00:57.710> were

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
the screen just as it were if we were

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.210 
the screen just as it were if we were
sketching<00:00:58.250> on<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.610> a<00:00:59.420> pad<00:01:00.070> paper<00:01:01.070> with<00:01:01.220> a<00:01:01.250> pen

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
sketching on to a pad paper with a pen

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.310 
sketching on to a pad paper with a pen
what<00:01:02.880> flight

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.260 

and<00:01:08.500> we<00:01:08.860> can<00:01:09.240> consume<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:10.510> and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
and we can consume in and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.830 
and we can consume in and
get<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.659> closer<00:01:11.930> look

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.560 

down<00:01:17.079> for<00:01:17.320> us

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.200 

and<00:01:24.470> then<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.710> know<00:01:24.830> we<00:01:24.980> can<00:01:25.159> have<00:01:26.060> all<00:01:26.180> sorts

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
and then you know we can have all sorts

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.710 
and then you know we can have all sorts
of<00:01:26.510> tools<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.080> can<00:01:27.110> use<00:01:27.640> at<00:01:28.640> color<00:01:29.479> and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
of tools that we can use at color and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.399 
of tools that we can use at color and
realism<00:01:30.050> to<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.350> design

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
realism to the design

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.359 
realism to the design
air<00:01:32.859> brush<00:01:33.100> tools

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.280 

when<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.520> sketch<00:01:40.760> them<00:01:40.909> right<00:01:41.090> now<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:42.110> is

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
when we sketch them right now this is

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.000 
when we sketch them right now this is
just<00:01:42.320> a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
just a

00:01:44.010 --> 00:02:02.130 
just a
a<00:01:44.040> porthole<00:01:44.700> detail

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:16.010 

because<00:02:02.740> there's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.350 

so<00:02:16.890> light<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.130> his<00:02:17.340> twenties

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360

your<00:02:20.510> ear<00:02:20.960> age<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.560> be<00:02:21.680> working<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.610> this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
your ear age to be working on in this

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.110 
your ear age to be working on in this
program

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.690 

typically<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.390> depends<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.980> know<00:02:31.010> how<00:02:31.370> happy

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
typically it depends you know how happy

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.190 
typically it depends you know how happy
we<00:02:31.849> are<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.300> design<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.870> how<00:02:33.020> it's

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
we are with the design and how it's

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.320 
we are with the design and how it's
progressing<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.790> once<00:02:35.030> we're<00:02:35.209> satisfied

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
progressing and once we're satisfied

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.000 
progressing and once we're satisfied
with<00:02:35.840> how<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.050> looks<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.380> truth<00:02:36.680> then

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
with how it looks on the truth then

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.400 
with how it looks on the truth then
we'll<00:02:37.220> decide<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.790> take<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.260> next

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
we'll decide to take it to the next

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.900 
we'll decide to take it to the next
stage<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.099> actually<00:02:40.400> milling<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> clay

depends on how how smoothly everything

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.370 
depends on how how smoothly everything
goes<00:02:49.730> during<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.150> process

the<00:02:55.670> invicta<00:02:56.030> concept<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:57.500> developed<00:02:57.950> that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the invicta concept we we developed that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.660 
the invicta concept we we developed that
relatively<00:02:58.579> quickly<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:01.010> actual<00:03:01.310> design

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
relatively quickly the actual design

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.660 
relatively quickly the actual design
phase<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.900> spent<00:03:03.680> about<00:03:03.799> ten<00:03:04.189> weeks<00:03:04.400> on<00:03:04.579> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
phase we spent about ten weeks on the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.940 
phase we spent about ten weeks on the
design<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:06.079> that<00:03:06.260> was<00:03:06.409> from<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.769> initial

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
design and that was from the initial

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.089 
design and that was from the initial
concept<00:03:07.670> sketch<00:03:07.969> right<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:09.019> until<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
concept sketch right up until the the

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.059 
concept sketch right up until the the
final<00:03:10.519> map<00:03:10.969> that<00:03:11.269> we<00:03:11.359> use<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.590> mill<00:03:12.829> and

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
final map that we use to to mill and

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.699 
final map that we use to to mill and
validate<00:03:13.489> our<00:03:13.519> surfaces<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.540> will<00:03:15.439> then

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
validate our surfaces that we will then

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.520 
validate our surfaces that we will then
use<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.189> actually<00:03:16.310> build<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.269> car<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:18.319> we're

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
use to actually build the car now we're

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.009 
use to actually build the car now we're
going<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.769> seeing<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.849> working<00:03:20.329> model<00:03:20.750> or

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
going to be seeing in working model or

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.600 
going to be seeing in working model or
just<00:03:21.260> yes<00:03:21.439> it'll<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:21.829> full<00:03:22.040> run

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
just yes it'll be a full run

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.810 
just yes it'll be a full run
thank<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.420> for<00:03:24.660> dinner
