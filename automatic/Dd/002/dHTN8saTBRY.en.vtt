00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.920 
this is the stargazer white and pressed
powder<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.549> I'm<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.849> use<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.090> really<00:02:35.450> huge

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
powder so I'm going to use a really huge

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.080 
powder so I'm going to use a really huge
powered<00:02:36.860> brush<00:02:37.129> for<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.760> make<00:02:37.849> it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
powered brush for that and just make it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:47.809 
powered brush for that and just make it
all<00:02:38.390> look<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.110> bit<00:02:39.260> more<00:02:39.409> even

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:59.910

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.010 

don't<00:03:00.730> worry<00:03:00.910> too<00:03:01.090> much<00:03:01.120> about<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.569> area

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
don't worry too much about the area

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.000 
don't worry too much about the area
around<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.319> eye<00:03:02.350> because<00:03:02.740> we're<00:03:02.860> barely

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
around the eye because we're barely

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.830 
around the eye because we're barely
making<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.490> black<00:03:03.670> anyway<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:04.420> I'm<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.780> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
to do isn't first time to do the eyes so

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.270 
to do isn't first time to do the eyes so
what<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:17.530> gonna<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:18.130> kind<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.670> go<00:03:18.940> from

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
what I'm gonna do is kind of go from

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.530 
what I'm gonna do is kind of go from
here<00:03:21.280> up<00:03:22.020> over<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.140> brow<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.740> round<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:25.240> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
here up over the brow and round to a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.750 
here up over the brow and round to a
circle<00:03:26.050> like<00:03:26.380> that<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:27.220> it's<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.489> big

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
circle like that so it's like a big

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.670 
circle like that so it's like a big
black<00:03:28.030> circle<00:03:28.480> my<00:03:28.570> world<00:03:28.780> apparently<00:03:29.050> started

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
black circle my world apparently started

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:40.780 
black circle my world apparently started
here<00:03:29.800> so<00:03:30.250> follow<00:03:31.180> my<00:03:31.330> lead<00:03:31.360> with<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.260> eyes

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:57.920 

you

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.679 

take<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.950> slimmer<00:03:59.370> black<00:03:59.790> eyeliner<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.390> line

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
take a slimmer black eyeliner to line

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.179 
take a slimmer black eyeliner to line
the<00:04:01.140> waterline<00:04:01.469> just<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.799> make<00:04:01.950> sure<00:04:01.980> that

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
the waterline just to make sure that

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.559 
the waterline just to make sure that
it's<00:04:02.400> all<00:04:02.519> very<00:04:02.849> very<00:04:03.180> black

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.479 

try<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.290> make<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.500> circle<00:04:07.650> as<00:04:07.890> precise<00:04:08.280> as

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
try and make the circle as precise as

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.949 
try and make the circle as precise as
you<00:04:08.579> can<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:08.909> don't<00:04:08.969> worry<00:04:09.360> if<00:04:09.510> it's<00:04:09.689> slightly

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
you can but don't worry if it's slightly

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.929 
you can but don't worry if it's slightly
wonky<00:04:10.409> because<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.769> whole<00:04:10.920> thing<00:04:11.159> about<00:04:11.370> Jax

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
wonky because the whole thing about Jax

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.849 
wonky because the whole thing about Jax
guns<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.390> Izzy's<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:12.629> bit<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:13.140> one<00:04:13.439> key<00:04:13.680> in<00:04:13.769> a

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
guns and Izzy's a bit like one key in a

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.029 
guns and Izzy's a bit like one key in a
bit<00:04:14.040> kind<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.519> ragged<00:04:15.120> in<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.359> way<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.590> mean

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
bit kind of ragged in a way so I mean

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.340 
bit kind of ragged in a way so I mean
I've<00:04:17.130> done<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:17.750> circular<00:04:18.750> as<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.870> can<00:04:19.109> but

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
I've done it as circular as I can but

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.379 
I've done it as circular as I can but
don't<00:04:19.500> don't<00:04:19.949> panic<00:04:20.400> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.669> can't<00:04:20.880> get<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.120> in

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
don't don't panic if you can't get it in

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.629 
don't don't panic if you can't get it in
a<00:04:21.479> perfect<00:04:21.720> circle<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:22.620> I'm<00:04:23.160> going<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.340> go<00:04:23.490> off

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
a perfect circle so I'm going to go off

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.550 
a perfect circle so I'm going to go off
and<00:04:23.880> do<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.180> other<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.360> go<00:04:24.870> try<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.199> match<00:04:25.380> as

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and do the other I go try and match as

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.980 
and do the other I go try and match as
closely<00:04:25.650> as<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.550> can<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.690> at<00:04:27.840> different

closely as I can and but at different

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.420 
closely as I can and but at different
times<00:04:28.380> in<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.560> film<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:28.919> I<00:04:29.039> have<00:04:29.250> slightly

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.070 
times in the film and I have slightly
different<00:04:29.850> shapes<00:04:30.030> anyway<00:04:30.389> they'll<00:04:30.840> try<00:04:31.050> and

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
different shapes anyway they'll try and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.499 
different shapes anyway they'll try and
get<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:31.289> as<00:04:31.320> even<00:04:31.650> as<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:32.180> okay<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.240> I'm

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509
