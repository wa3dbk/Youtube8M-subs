00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
there's one problem during gameplay well

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.629 
there's one problem during gameplay well
not<00:04:46.479> exactly<00:04:46.779> this<00:04:47.439> guy's<00:04:47.680> fault<00:04:48.039> because

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
not exactly this guy's fault because

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.869 
not exactly this guy's fault because
it's<00:04:48.849> a<00:04:48.909> small<00:04:49.240> device<00:04:49.839> and<00:04:50.490> I'm<00:04:51.490> kind<00:04:51.729> of<00:04:51.819> used

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
it's a small device and I'm kind of used

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:56.519 
it's a small device and I'm kind of used
to<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:53.050> big<00:04:53.259> screen<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:54.279> this<00:04:55.529> controls

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.529 
to the big screen so this controls

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.100 
to the big screen so this controls
become<00:04:56.889> that<00:04:57.069> much<00:04:57.389> smaller<00:04:58.389> so<00:04:58.659> it<00:04:58.809> kind<00:04:59.050> of

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
become that much smaller so it kind of

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.829 
become that much smaller so it kind of
at<00:04:59.379> times<00:04:59.909> it's<00:05:00.909> difficult<00:05:00.969> because<00:05:01.479> you<00:05:01.689> do

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:01.839 
at times it's difficult because you do

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.219 
at times it's difficult because you do
not<00:05:01.960> find<00:05:02.259> them<00:05:02.819> you<00:05:03.819> know<00:05:03.939> that<00:05:04.360> will<00:05:04.809> space

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
not find them you know that will space

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.040 
not find them you know that will space
the<00:05:05.439> party<00:05:05.740> do<00:05:05.949> not<00:05:06.069> find<00:05:06.370> them<00:05:06.539> that<00:05:07.539> big<00:05:07.809> so

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
the party do not find them that big so

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.049 
the party do not find them that big so
you<00:05:08.080> kind<00:05:08.409> of<00:05:08.469> at<00:05:08.740> times<00:05:09.009> tend<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.610> hunt<00:05:09.879> them

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:10.059 
you kind of at times tend to hunt them

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:29.120 
you kind of at times tend to hunt them
but<00:05:10.210> you'll<00:05:10.330> get<00:05:10.509> used<00:05:10.569> to<00:05:10.870> those

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.660 

see

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:51.930 

so<00:05:35.670> overall<00:05:36.030> smooth<00:05:36.870> gameplay<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.500> suppose

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
extended period of time the heat builds

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.950 
extended period of time the heat builds
up<00:06:03.860> here<00:06:04.130> but<00:06:04.370> never<00:06:04.670> to<00:06:04.940> an<00:06:05.030> uncomfortable

level<00:06:06.620> as<00:06:06.950> a<00:06:07.010> good<00:06:07.370> thing<00:06:07.640> that<00:06:07.820> this<00:06:08.600> is<00:06:08.660> you

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
level as a good thing that this is you

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.620 
level as a good thing that this is you
know<00:06:09.770> heating<00:06:10.130> up<00:06:10.250> because<00:06:10.400> of<00:06:10.580> this<00:06:10.910> glass

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
know heating up because of this glass

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.590 
know heating up because of this glass
break<00:06:11.900> it<00:06:12.110> kind<00:06:12.350> of<00:06:12.550> lets<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.790> heat<00:06:14.000> go<00:06:14.510> out

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600
