predicament here a previous character
Dante<00:00:54.090> who<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.420> introduced<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.199> earlier

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
Dante who was introduced in a earlier

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.439 
Dante who was introduced in a earlier
demo<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.399> done<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:57.899> also<00:00:58.320> missing

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
demo that we have done is also missing

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.880 
demo that we have done is also missing
and<00:01:00.449> somehow<00:01:00.780> they're<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.320> wrapped<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.739> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and somehow they're all wrapped up in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.340 
and somehow they're all wrapped up in
this<00:01:02.039> Dante's<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.000> trouble<00:01:03.359> they're<00:01:03.960> both<00:01:04.110> in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this Dante's in trouble they're both in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.640 
this Dante's in trouble they're both in
trouble<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:07.020> also<00:01:07.140> learn<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:09.650> chase

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
trouble you also learn here that chase

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
trouble you also learn here that chase
chase<00:01:11.220> doesn't<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.729> guns<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:14.030> it's<00:01:15.030> it's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
chase doesn't do guns and so it's it's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.999 
chase doesn't do guns and so it's it's
finding<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.020> what's<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> story<00:01:16.560> behind<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
finding out what's the story behind that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.540 
finding out what's the story behind that
what's<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> issue<00:01:17.850> there

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.730 

so<00:01:23.550> here<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:24.020> because<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.380> he<00:01:25.620> had

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
so here we are because because he had

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
so here we are because because he had
just<00:01:26.000> worked<00:01:27.000> his<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.240> through<00:01:27.390> this

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
just worked his way through this

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.240 
just worked his way through this
building<00:01:28.110> he<00:01:28.230> doesn't<00:01:28.530> Drake<00:01:28.860> doesn't<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
building he doesn't Drake doesn't have a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.550 
building he doesn't Drake doesn't have a
weapon<00:01:29.660> so<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:33.060> introduce<00:01:33.480> our<00:01:34.050> melee

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
weapon so we introduce our melee

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.370 
weapon so we introduce our melee
mechanics<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.880> particular<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.870> still<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
mechanics and in particular and still so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.850 
mechanics and in particular and still so
I<00:01:37.620> can<00:01:37.890> run<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> brush<00:01:38.580> up<00:01:38.760> not<00:01:39.030> alert<00:01:39.330> him

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
I can run it brush up not alert him

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.170 
I can run it brush up not alert him
doesn't<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.070> take<00:01:41.910> him<00:01:42.060> down

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.940 

which<00:01:45.180> plays<00:01:45.450> further<00:01:45.780> into<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.170> level<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.680> if

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
which plays further into the level so if

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.160 
which plays further into the level so if
I<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.250> maintain<00:01:47.490> stealth<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.870> help<00:01:49.020> me

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
I can maintain stealth that will help me

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.740 
I can maintain stealth that will help me
get<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> here's<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> case<00:01:51.360> where<00:01:51.390> we've

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
get through so here's a case where we've

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.860 
get through so here's a case where we've
introduced<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.890> gesture<00:01:53.670> system<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
introduced a gesture system so in this

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.910 
introduced a gesture system so in this
case<00:01:55.140> Drake's<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.210> lift<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.540> beam<00:01:57.920> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
case Drake's got a lift up this beam and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
case Drake's got a lift up this beam and
I<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.220> do<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.340> by<00:01:59.550> just<00:01:59.580> mimicking<00:02:00.510> in<00:02:00.690> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
I can do it by just mimicking in the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:13.180 
I can do it by just mimicking in the
gesture<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.350> saw<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.740> screen

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.100 

so<00:02:13.790> I'm<00:02:13.940> particularly<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.630> level<00:02:14.870> it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
so I'm particularly in this level it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.620 
so I'm particularly in this level it
introduces<00:02:15.590> some<00:02:15.740> combat<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.940> again<00:02:17.450> what's

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
introduces some combat and again what's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.600 
introduces some combat and again what's
really<00:02:18.020> important<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.100> note<00:02:19.310> here<00:02:19.580> is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
really important that the note here is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.660 
really important that the note here is
if<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.780> maintain<00:02:21.260> stealth<00:02:21.650> it'll<00:02:22.040> maintain<00:02:22.280> all

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
if I maintain stealth it'll maintain all

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.390 
if I maintain stealth it'll maintain all
the<00:02:22.790> way<00:02:22.910> through

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.699 

if<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.329> then<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.780> level<00:02:31.620> will

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
if I don't then the level will

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.580 
if I don't then the level will
dynamically<00:02:32.280> change

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.080 

and<00:02:37.590> again<00:02:37.860> sort<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.310> Buddy<00:02:38.520> climb<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and again sort of the Buddy climb the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.510 
and again sort of the Buddy climb the
traditional<00:02:39.870> buddy<00:02:40.050> climb<00:02:40.380> now<00:02:40.620> allows<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
traditional buddy climb now allows you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.900 
traditional buddy climb now allows you
to<00:02:41.640> actually<00:02:41.730> interact<00:02:42.210> directly<00:02:43.700> lift<00:02:44.700> chase

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
to actually interact directly lift chase

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.350 
to actually interact directly lift chase
up

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.110 

and<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.440> like<00:02:53.830> earlier<00:02:54.220> i<00:02:54.280> was<00:02:54.400> showing<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
and so like earlier i was showing in the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.390 
and so like earlier i was showing in the
previous<00:02:55.510> level<00:02:56.020> here<00:02:56.680> we<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.040> machete

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
previous level here we have the machete

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.100 
previous level here we have the machete
Drake's<00:02:57.790> always<00:02:58.060> got<00:02:58.210> his<00:02:58.300> machete<00:02:58.630> with<00:02:58.930> them

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
Drake's always got his machete with them

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.380 
Drake's always got his machete with them
so<00:02:59.710> I<00:02:59.770> can<00:02:59.800> just<00:03:00.070> simply<00:03:00.610> tap<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.000> machete

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
so I can just simply tap on the machete

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.990 
so I can just simply tap on the machete
and<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.710> brings<00:03:02.890> up<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.190> gesture<00:03:03.550> seasons

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
and it brings up the gesture seasons

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.360 
and it brings up the gesture seasons
this<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.390> sequence<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.930> gestures<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:05.590> can

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
this is sequence of gestures that can

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.070 
this is sequence of gestures that can
perform<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.740> again<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.580> opens<00:03:09.940> up<00:03:10.090> secret

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
perform and again this opens up secret

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.010 
perform and again this opens up secret
areas<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:11.950> level<00:03:12.280> or<00:03:12.730> pathways<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.840> he's

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
areas in the level or pathways that he's

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:26.840 
areas in the level or pathways that he's
gotta<00:03:14.260> get<00:03:14.890> through

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.030 

so<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:27.660> again<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:28.860> maintain

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
so here again I can I can maintain

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.320 
so here again I can I can maintain
stealth<00:03:29.610> or<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.290> mix<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.650> up<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.890> little<00:03:31.920> bit

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
stealth or I can mix it up a little bit

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.870 
stealth or I can mix it up a little bit
alert<00:03:33.330> these<00:03:33.540> guys<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.160> then<00:03:35.160> go<00:03:35.460> directly

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
alert these guys and then go directly

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.170 
alert these guys and then go directly
into<00:03:36.230> regular<00:03:37.230> combat<00:03:37.890> we've<00:03:38.400> got<00:03:38.580> explodable

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
into regular combat we've got explodable

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.820 
into regular combat we've got explodable
that<00:03:39.480> we<00:03:39.570> can<00:03:39.720> take<00:03:39.900> advantage<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:42.830> and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
that we can take advantage of and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.920 
that we can take advantage of and
another<00:03:44.400> interesting<00:03:44.910> feature<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.810> we've

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
another interesting feature that we've

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.180 
another interesting feature that we've
added<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:47.780> regular<00:03:48.780> aim<00:03:48.930> on<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.230> sticks<00:03:49.500> but

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
added is regular aim on the sticks but

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.710 
added is regular aim on the sticks but
then<00:03:50.340> we<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.580> use<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:51.000> actual<00:03:51.180> motion

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
then we can use the actual motion

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.800 
then we can use the actual motion
control<00:03:52.110> for<00:03:52.920> fine-tuning<00:03:53.390> so<00:03:54.390> it's<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.660> little

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
control for fine-tuning so it's a little

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.200 
control for fine-tuning so it's a little
bit<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.200> mix<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.710> both<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.730> gives<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.030> just

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
bit of a mix of both and gives you just

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:26.470 
bit of a mix of both and gives you just
a<00:03:57.390> little<00:03:57.750> bit<00:03:57.870> more<00:03:58.200> control<00:03:58.560> over<00:03:58.710> that<00:03:59.160> aim

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.830 

so<00:04:27.050> as<00:04:27.380> well<00:04:27.650> as<00:04:28.030> regular<00:04:29.030> combat<00:04:29.570> we<00:04:29.720> have

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
so as well as regular combat we have

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.740 
so as well as regular combat we have
melee<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:31.100> again<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.580> can<00:04:32.060> interact<00:04:32.330> directly

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
melee so again you can interact directly

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.870 
melee so again you can interact directly
with<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.290> enemies<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:36.440> then<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.430> introduces

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
with the enemies and then it introduces

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.400 
with the enemies and then it introduces
the<00:04:38.180> gesture<00:04:38.540> system<00:04:38.900> for<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.080> finishing

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
the gesture system for the finishing

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:58.950 
the gesture system for the finishing
moves

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.510 

and<00:04:59.500> you'll<00:04:59.620> find<00:04:59.800> events<00:05:00.069> like<00:05:00.340> this

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
and you'll find events like this

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.700 
and you'll find events like this
throughout<00:05:00.789> which<00:05:01.750> again<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.289> know<00:05:02.380> sort<00:05:02.560> of

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
throughout which again you know sort of

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.010 
throughout which again you know sort of
pushes<00:05:03.009> Drake<00:05:03.250> into<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.580> new<00:05:03.789> direction<00:05:04.020> he's

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
pushes Drake into a new direction he's

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.570 
pushes Drake into a new direction he's
got<00:05:05.199> to<00:05:05.289> find<00:05:05.500> his<00:05:05.650> way<00:05:05.680> out<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:06.069> a<00:05:06.250> predicament

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
got to find his way out of a predicament

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:23.940 
got to find his way out of a predicament
as<00:05:07.319> always

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.920 

so<00:05:24.950> here<00:05:25.280> Here<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.610> am<00:05:25.730> great<00:05:26.120> climbing<00:05:26.630> up<00:05:26.720> here

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
so here Here I am great climbing up here

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.900 
so here Here I am great climbing up here
finding<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.410> new<00:05:27.530> way<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:28.280> this<00:05:28.400> is<00:05:28.550> again

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
finding a new way so this is again

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.150 
finding a new way so this is again
another<00:05:29.210> element<00:05:29.810> that<00:05:29.900> we've<00:05:30.080> added<00:05:30.230> taking

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
another element that we've added taking

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.520 
another element that we've added taking
advantage<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:31.760> motion<00:05:31.910> control<00:05:32.420> so<00:05:33.290> here

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
advantage of the motion control so here

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.270 
advantage of the motion control so here
here<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.370> actually<00:05:34.580> use<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.240> tilt<00:05:35.980> to<00:05:36.980> try<00:05:37.160> and

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
here I actually use the tilt to try and

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.950 
here I actually use the tilt to try and
prevent<00:05:37.490> him<00:05:37.610> from<00:05:37.760> falling<00:05:38.090> if<00:05:38.480> I<00:05:38.570> don't<00:05:38.630> like

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
prevent him from falling if I don't like

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.740 
prevent him from falling if I don't like
you<00:05:39.020> saw<00:05:39.290> there<00:05:39.560> I'll<00:05:39.980> fall<00:05:40.460> off<00:05:40.670> then<00:05:41.510> I<00:05:41.600> can

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
you saw there I'll fall off then I can

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:52.500 
you saw there I'll fall off then I can
try<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.200> bring<00:05:42.740> up<00:05:42.860> and<00:05:43.730> continue

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.510 

to<00:05:52.540> be<00:05:52.690> something

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.740
