00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.440 
a lot of straight line wind damage and
along<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.439> line<00:01:46.740> you're<00:01:47.430> talking<00:01:47.880> winds<00:01:48.119> in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
along this line you're talking winds in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.170 
along this line you're talking winds in
excess<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:49.100> 80<00:01:50.100> miles<00:01:50.430> an<00:01:50.640> hour<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:51.000> times

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
excess of 80 miles an hour at times

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
excess of 80 miles an hour at times
that's<00:01:51.600> weak<00:01:51.930> EF<00:01:52.409> 0<00:01:52.740> EF<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.280> tornado<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that's weak EF 0 EF one tornado so you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
that's weak EF 0 EF one tornado so you
need<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> treat<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.740> weak

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
need to treat this as if it's a weak

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.440 
need to treat this as if it's a weak
tornado<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> difference<00:01:57.119> between<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
tornado and the difference between a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
tornado and the difference between a
tornado<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.009> tornadoes<00:01:59.490> only

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
tornado and this is tornadoes only

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.179 
tornado and this is tornadoes only
affect<00:02:00.180> very<00:02:00.420> tiny<00:02:00.750> areas<00:02:01.229> whereas<00:02:02.070> you're

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
affect very tiny areas whereas you're

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.010 
affect very tiny areas whereas you're
looking<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.090> possibility<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.810> this

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
looking at the possibility of this

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.280 
looking at the possibility of this
impacting<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.210> wide<00:02:06.210> swath<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.990> mean<00:02:07.110> when<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
impacting a wide swath I mean when I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.309 
impacting a wide swath I mean when I
talk<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:08.090> I'm<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.330> draw<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
talk about this I'm going to draw the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.240 
talk about this I'm going to draw the
storm<00:02:10.860> line<00:02:11.069> extends<00:02:11.700> like

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
storm line extends like

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.190 
storm line extends like
this<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.030> moves<00:02:13.240> across<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.750> area

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
this and if it moves across the area

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.100 
this and if it moves across the area
like<00:02:15.100> so<00:02:15.430> you're<00:02:15.940> talking<00:02:16.120> about<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.450> swath<00:02:16.840> of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
like so you're talking about a swath of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.350 
like so you're talking about a swath of
the<00:02:17.230> least<00:02:17.410> 58<00:02:17.980> miles<00:02:18.310> an<00:02:18.550> hour<00:02:18.640> higher<00:02:19.000> winds

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the least 58 miles an hour higher winds

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.930 
the least 58 miles an hour higher winds
up<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.840> 80<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.290> spots<00:02:20.620> across<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.610> entire<00:02:21.910> area

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
up to 80 in spots across the entire area

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.380 
up to 80 in spots across the entire area
that's<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.600> much<00:02:22.810> broader<00:02:23.230> area<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.490> severe

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
that's a much broader area of severe

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.290 
that's a much broader area of severe
weather<00:02:25.420> than<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.350> normally<00:02:26.560> get<00:02:27.130> in<00:02:27.370> pop<00:02:28.060> up

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
weather than we normally get in pop up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.810 
weather than we normally get in pop up
or<00:02:28.540> isolated<00:02:29.050> severe<00:02:29.350> events<00:02:29.560> oh<00:02:29.770> please<00:02:30.010> even

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.980 
or isolated severe events oh please even
though<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.940> hear<00:02:31.180> severe<00:02:31.510> thunderstorm

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
though you hear severe thunderstorm

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.190 
though you hear severe thunderstorm
watch<00:02:32.440> or<00:02:32.770> warning<00:02:33.160> today<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:34.570> may<00:02:34.840> even<00:02:34.870> be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
watch or warning today it may even be

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.110 
watch or warning today it may even be
one<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.560> those<00:02:35.650> pdf's<00:02:36.190> situations<00:02:36.850> where<00:02:37.030> they

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
one of those pdf's situations where they

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.970 
one of those pdf's situations where they
issue<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.450> particularly<00:02:37.959> dangerous<00:02:38.110> situation

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
issue a particularly dangerous situation

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.650 
issue a particularly dangerous situation
so<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.490> people<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.150> heightened<00:02:40.540> awareness

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
so that people have heightened awareness

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.170 
so that people have heightened awareness
for<00:02:41.590> what's<00:02:41.830> going<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.580> timing<00:02:42.970> right<00:02:43.000> now

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
for what's going on the timing right now

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.180 
for what's going on the timing right now
if<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:44.050> were<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.260> time<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.650> out<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.100> it's

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
if I were to time this out and it's

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.770 
if I were to time this out and it's
actually<00:02:45.340> that's<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.239> one<00:02:46.390> good<00:02:46.420> thing<00:02:46.630> about

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
actually that's the one good thing about

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.479 
actually that's the one good thing about
this<00:02:47.140> system<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.590> been<00:02:47.739> pretty<00:02:48.010> easy<00:02:48.250> to

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
this system it's been pretty easy to

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.630 
this system it's been pretty easy to
time<00:02:48.760> I'd<00:02:49.480> say<00:02:49.900> by<00:02:50.200> two<00:02:50.260> o'clock<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.280> line<00:02:51.459> is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
time I'd say by two o'clock the line is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.110 
time I'd say by two o'clock the line is
going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.820> be<00:02:51.970> right<00:02:52.209> here<00:02:53.670> roughly<00:02:54.670> could<00:02:54.970> be

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
going to be right here roughly could be

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.720 
going to be right here roughly could be
a<00:02:55.150> little<00:02:55.360> bit<00:02:55.540> further<00:02:55.780> west<00:02:56.140> by<00:02:56.770> about<00:02:57.130> four

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
a little bit further west by about four

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.630 
a little bit further west by about four
o'clock<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:58.480> going<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.750> be<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.020> here<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.709> by

o'clock it's going to be in here and by

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.420 
o'clock it's going to be in here and by
five<00:03:01.480> six<00:03:01.959> seven<00:03:02.320> o'clock<00:03:02.800> it's<00:03:03.070> going<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.280> be

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
five six seven o'clock it's going to be

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.910 
five six seven o'clock it's going to be
in<00:03:03.550> here<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.180> by<00:03:04.720> eight<00:03:04.989> nine<00:03:05.290> ten<00:03:05.680> o'clock
