00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.379 

all<00:00:06.000> right<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.150> talked<00:00:06.600> about<00:00:06.720> how<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
all right I talked about how the the

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.030 
all right I talked about how the the
linear<00:00:09.389> pull<00:00:09.570> brakes<00:00:09.630> pads<00:00:10.170> our<00:00:10.530> side

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
linear pull brakes pads our side

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.879 
linear pull brakes pads our side
specific<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:13.170> want<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> side<00:00:13.650> that's

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
specific so you want the side that's

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.369 
specific so you want the side that's
longer<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.210> your<00:00:15.450> trailing<00:00:15.960> side<00:00:16.170> so

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
longer to be it's your trailing side so

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.510 
longer to be it's your trailing side so
it's<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> back<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:18.500> your<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.010> arrow<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it's in the back and your the arrow is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.759 
it's in the back and your the arrow is
pointing<00:00:20.550> forward<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.390> bike<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.810> these<00:00:22.350> if

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
pointing forward on the bike so these if

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
pointing forward on the bike so these if
these<00:00:22.949> brakes<00:00:23.340> were<00:00:23.550> front<00:00:23.910> mounted<00:00:24.300> then

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
these brakes were front mounted then

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.070 
these brakes were front mounted then
we're<00:00:24.960> good<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:25.830> they're<00:00:25.980> rear<00:00:26.189> mounted

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
we're good but if they're rear mounted

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.599 
we're good but if they're rear mounted
the<00:00:28.080> brakes<00:00:28.349> are<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> wrong<00:00:28.769> side<00:00:28.830> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
the brakes are on the wrong side so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.950 
the brakes are on the wrong side so
we're<00:00:29.730> gonna<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> switch<00:00:30.420> these<00:00:30.660> pads

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
we're gonna have to switch these pads

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
we're gonna have to switch these pads
put<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.590> brake<00:00:31.859> pad<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.969> arm<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
put this brake pad on this arm and this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.040 
put this brake pad on this arm and this
pad<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.590> remove<00:00:39.050> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
pad on this one so just go in remove the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.220 
pad on this one so just go in remove the

mounting nut in the pad and just line
everything<00:00:43.680> back<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.280> very<00:00:44.340> important

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
everything back up it's very important

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.660 
everything back up it's very important
that<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.090> are<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> correct<00:00:45.719> order

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
that these are in the correct order

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.729 
that these are in the correct order
you've<00:00:47.670> got<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.510> wide<00:00:48.780> nut<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.559> wide

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you've got your your wide nut your wide

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.610 
you've got your your wide nut your wide
washer<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:51.059> conical<00:00:51.620> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
washer and then your your conical so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.660 
washer and then your your conical so
this<00:00:52.920> conical<00:00:53.340> spacer<00:00:54.230> can<00:00:55.230> shift<00:00:55.670> around

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this conical spacer can shift around

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
this conical spacer can shift around
that<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:57.899> gives<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.620> what

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that and this is what gives this is what

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.389 
that and this is what gives this is what
allows<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.219> brake<00:00:59.460> pad<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.120> rotate<00:01:01.399> another

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
allows your brake pad to rotate another

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
allows your brake pad to rotate another
conical<00:01:03.149> facing<00:01:03.930> away<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.589> each<00:01:04.680> other

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
conical facing away from each other

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.940 
conical facing away from each other
your<00:01:05.700> concave<00:01:06.150> washer<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.840> flat<00:01:07.320> washer<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
your concave washer a flat washer and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.620 
your concave washer a flat washer and
then<00:01:09.080> your<00:01:10.080> fixing<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:11.210> go<00:01:12.210> ahead<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.450> take

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
then your fixing that go ahead and take

then your fixing that go ahead and take
off<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> second<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:16.640> again<00:01:17.640> keep<00:01:17.880> everything

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
off the second one again keep everything

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
off the second one again keep everything
in<00:01:18.509> order<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:19.259> important<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.460> slap<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
in order it's very important and slap it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.880 
in order it's very important and slap it
all<00:01:23.759> back<00:01:24.000> together

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:40.420 

I'll<00:01:31.490> tighten<00:01:31.820> up<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.210> fixing<00:01:32.660> now

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:53.260 

back<00:01:41.430> together

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.980 

now<00:01:53.810> when<00:01:54.170> we're<00:01:54.350> mounted<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.890> back<00:01:55.990> those

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
now when we're mounted on the back those

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.410 
now when we're mounted on the back those
areas<00:01:57.350> are<00:01:57.500> still<00:01:57.710> pointing<00:01:57.950> forward<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.549> we

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
areas are still pointing forward and we

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.080 
areas are still pointing forward and we
just<00:01:59.600> need<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.840> adjust<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.290> pad<00:02:00.909> like<00:02:01.909> we're

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
just need to adjust the pad like we're

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.470 
just need to adjust the pad like we're
done<00:02:02.210> on<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.390> front<00:02:02.750> didn't<00:02:03.350> go
