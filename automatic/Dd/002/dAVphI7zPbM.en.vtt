to gauge that mood of the fish nothing's
happening<00:01:55.740> speed<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:56.909> bit<00:01:57.829> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
happening speed it up a little bit and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
happening speed it up a little bit and
slow<00:01:59.069> it<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.219> again<00:01:59.639> just<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.719> looking

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
slow it down again just really looking

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.270 
slow it down again just really looking
for<00:02:01.200> something<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:02.039> going<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
for something that that's going to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.170 
for something that that's going to
trigger<00:02:02.459> those<00:02:02.639> fish

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.550 

another<00:02:07.180> technique<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.840> love<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.170> use<00:02:08.350> is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
another technique that I love to use is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.290 
another technique that I love to use is
just<00:02:08.740> incorporating<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.610> series<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:09.940> sweeps

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
just incorporating a series of sweeps

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.840 
just incorporating a series of sweeps
and<00:02:10.479> retrieve<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.260> like<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.040> do<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:12.340> do<00:02:12.670> one

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
and retrieve I like to do is just do one

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.350 
and retrieve I like to do is just do one
big<00:02:13.030> long<00:02:13.240> sweep<00:02:13.600> mix<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.709> up<00:02:14.970> throw<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> two<00:02:16.180> in

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
big long sweep mix it up throw a two in

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.790 
big long sweep mix it up throw a two in
there

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
there
