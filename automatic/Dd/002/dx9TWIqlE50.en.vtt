 Hello friends 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.010
 Today I'm going to teach you how to 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.330
 how to configure it 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.310
 microphone for windows xp good what 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 first you have to see is if it is 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 all very well connected 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.010
 the green with the green and the pink with the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.500
 pink 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.920
 but once that's where they go where 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.010
 is that the volume and is next 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.579
 from windows 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.579
 they give him 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.540
 right button opens the volume control 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.750
 center this good and here you have to 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.490
 tell volume by factory default 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.590
 comes from volume of new volume of 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.690
 microphone but for you to know 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.560
 is the microphone volume already 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.770
 so 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.490
 here if you do not have the volume here 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.910
 they go in properties options 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.360
 in my case is this one has to go to 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.360
 recording 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240
 the important microphone volume 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.570
 you have to also put the mixture of 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570
 stereo 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:29.719
 it's for those who are this 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.719
 this what does not have does not happen anymore 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.350
 here where I made volume d 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.140
 they have to tighten control options 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.320
 advanced and here in volume below 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.159
 advanced is going to come out this 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.159
