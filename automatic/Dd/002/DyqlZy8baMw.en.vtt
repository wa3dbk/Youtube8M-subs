00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
that's actually oh it's it's a hundred

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.670 
that's actually oh it's it's a hundred
percent<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:32.650> it's<00:03:32.769> probably<00:03:34.650> 95<00:03:35.650> percent

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
percent but it's probably 95 percent

percent but it's probably 95 percent
repaired<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.849> it<00:03:36.910> took<00:03:37.030> about<00:03:37.150> two<00:03:37.510> weeks<00:03:37.540> or

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
so to get that back on track so again

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.400 
so to get that back on track so again
guys<00:03:40.419> it's<00:03:40.599> really<00:03:40.810> important<00:03:41.169> to<00:03:41.260> use

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410

quality based products use stuff that's

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.009 
quality based products use stuff that's
organic<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.769> makes<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.069> biggest<00:03:45.190> difference

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
organic it makes the biggest difference
