currently<00:00:05.160> elementary<00:00:06.029> level<00:00:06.299> math<00:00:06.480> test<00:00:06.899> we

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
currently elementary level math test we

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.780 
currently elementary level math test we
take<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.710> students<00:00:08.010> entire<00:00:08.370> body<00:00:08.670> of

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
take the students entire body of

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
take the students entire body of
knowledge<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.510> math<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.019> condense<00:00:10.440> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
knowledge and math and we condense it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.680 
knowledge and math and we condense it
down<00:00:10.620> into<00:00:10.950> one<00:00:11.219> exam<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.240> place<00:00:12.509> them

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
down into one exam and we place them

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.839 
down into one exam and we place them
according<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.500> exam<00:00:13.860> what<00:00:14.490> early

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
according to that one exam what early

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.340 
according to that one exam what early
start<00:00:15.150> affords<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> students<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.230> an

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
start affords the students is an

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.370 
start affords the students is an
opportunity<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.609> contest<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.420> placement<00:00:18.930> in

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
opportunity to contest that placement in

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.990 
opportunity to contest that placement in
an<00:00:19.619> authentic<00:00:19.980> way<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.820> way<00:00:20.970> that

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
an authentic way in a way that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.580 
an authentic way in a way that
demonstrates<00:00:21.720> their<00:00:21.960> knowledge<00:00:22.380> through

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
demonstrates their knowledge through

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.929 
demonstrates their knowledge through
their<00:00:22.980> work

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.159 

we<00:00:28.939> found<00:00:29.150> that<00:00:29.240> early<00:00:29.509> start<00:00:29.689> is<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.990> right

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
we found that early start is the right

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.749 
we found that early start is the right
thing<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.560> do<00:00:30.710> it's<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.160> right<00:00:31.279> thing<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.669> do

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
thing to do it's the right thing to do

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.900 
thing to do it's the right thing to do
for<00:00:31.970> two<00:00:32.090> reasons<00:00:32.509> one<00:00:32.809> is<00:00:33.230> because<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:33.649> works

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
for two reasons one is because it works

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.880 
for two reasons one is because it works
students<00:00:34.910> do<00:00:35.120> well<00:00:35.329> they<00:00:35.690> pass<00:00:35.989> up<00:00:36.320> one<00:00:36.559> level

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
students do well they pass up one level

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.740 
students do well they pass up one level
when<00:00:37.250> they<00:00:37.399> take<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.760> full<00:00:38.030> three<00:00:38.300> unit<00:00:38.629> class

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
when they take the full three unit class

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.530 
when they take the full three unit class
or<00:00:39.140> if<00:00:39.649> they<00:00:39.769> take<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.040> one<00:00:40.220> unit<00:00:40.519> class<00:00:40.790> they

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
or if they take the one unit class they

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.420 
or if they take the one unit class they
are<00:00:42.110> better<00:00:42.410> prepared<00:00:42.500> for<00:00:43.100> their<00:00:43.220> fall

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
are better prepared for their fall

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.240 
are better prepared for their fall
classes<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.600> other<00:00:44.720> reason<00:00:45.079> why<00:00:45.320> I<00:00:45.769> view

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
classes but the other reason why I view

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.829 
classes but the other reason why I view
it<00:00:46.280> as<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.610> right<00:00:46.820> thing<00:00:47.089> to<00:00:47.210> do<00:00:47.329> is<00:00:47.540> because

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
it as the right thing to do is because

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.290 
it as the right thing to do is because
it's<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.110> fair<00:00:48.350> thing<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.680> do<00:00:48.949> I<00:00:49.190> came<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:50.150> here

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
it's the fair thing to do I came in here

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.270 
it's the fair thing to do I came in here
I'd<00:00:50.449> do<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:50.720> matriculation<00:00:50.960> test<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.890> I

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
I'd do the matriculation test and I

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.700 
I'd do the matriculation test and I
didn't<00:00:53.150> do<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:53.809> well<00:00:53.839> on<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.260> matriculation

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
didn't do so well on the matriculation

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.780 
didn't do so well on the matriculation
so<00:00:55.190> they<00:00:55.640> offered<00:00:56.480> me<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:56.659> early<00:00:57.409> start<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.860> I

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
so they offered me a early start and I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.029 
so they offered me a early start and I
decided<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.989> was<00:01:00.140> like<00:01:00.289> I'm<00:01:00.530> gonna<00:01:00.680> do<00:01:00.859> that

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
decided I was like I'm gonna do that

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.860 
decided I was like I'm gonna do that
just<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.670> learn<00:01:01.820> math<00:01:02.059> refresh<00:01:02.510> your<00:01:02.660> memory

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
just to learn math refresh your memory

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.420 
just to learn math refresh your memory
about<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.379> at<00:01:04.009> first<00:01:04.039> I<00:01:04.280> was<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.399> little

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
about it and at first I was a little

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.520 
about it and at first I was a little
skeptical<00:01:04.789> I<00:01:04.970> was<00:01:05.089> like<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.449> don't<00:01:06.259> want<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.440> do

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
skeptical I was like I don't want to do

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.779 
skeptical I was like I don't want to do
this<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:06.800> gonna<00:01:06.920> waste<00:01:07.130> my<00:01:07.310> summer<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.700> know

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
this it's gonna waste my summer you know

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.550 
this it's gonna waste my summer you know
I<00:01:07.850> don't<00:01:08.030> want<00:01:08.149> to<00:01:08.240> be<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.810> doing<00:01:08.929> that<00:01:09.200> but

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
I don't want to be just doing that but

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.210 
I don't want to be just doing that but
honestly<00:01:10.399> it<00:01:10.729> really<00:01:11.060> did<00:01:11.240> help<00:01:11.420> me<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.660> lot<00:01:11.869> I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
honestly it really did help me a lot I

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.680 
honestly it really did help me a lot I
definitely<00:01:13.220> would<00:01:13.310> have<00:01:13.340> been<00:01:13.460> here<00:01:13.729> today

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
definitely would have been here today

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.080 
definitely would have been here today
doing<00:01:15.140> what<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.560> can<00:01:15.830> do<00:01:16.009> in<00:01:16.130> math<00:01:16.310> if<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:16.700> did<00:01:16.940> not

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
doing what I can do in math if I did not

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.359 
doing what I can do in math if I did not
take<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.200> very<00:01:18.470> good<00:01:18.710> process

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
take that so it's a very good process

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.999 
take that so it's a very good process
and<00:01:19.820> I'm<00:01:19.910> definitely<00:01:20.539> glad<00:01:20.869> I<00:01:20.990> took<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.380> well

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and I'm definitely glad I took it well

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.510 
and I'm definitely glad I took it well
on<00:01:22.220> 92<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:22.729> took<00:01:23.030> an<00:01:23.240> online<00:01:23.539> course<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:25.399> was

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
on 92 I took an online course so it was

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.279 
on 92 I took an online course so it was
basically<00:01:25.820> just<00:01:25.909> at<00:01:26.210> home<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.659> at<00:01:26.899> the

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
basically just at home and that at the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.649 
basically just at home and that at the
at<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.830> very<00:01:28.009> end<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.340> have<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.490> come<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.330> CSUN

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
at the very end you have to come to CSUN

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.870 
at the very end you have to come to CSUN
and<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:29.960> take<00:01:30.170> your<00:01:30.350> final<00:01:30.530> test<00:01:30.830> so<00:01:31.520> it's

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
and then take your final test so it's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.669 
and then take your final test so it's
definitely<00:01:32.539> helpful<00:01:32.840> taking<00:01:33.289> it<00:01:33.349> because<00:01:33.590> it

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
definitely helpful taking it because it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.680 
definitely helpful taking it because it
helps<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.039> like<00:01:34.250> get<00:01:34.459> on<00:01:34.550> track<00:01:34.819> or<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.270> even

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
helps you like get on track or like even

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.800 
helps you like get on track or like even
go<00:01:35.989> further<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:37.119> achieve<00:01:38.119> your<00:01:38.270> goals<00:01:38.479> faster

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
go further and achieve your goals faster

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.570 
go further and achieve your goals faster
because<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:39.410> can<00:01:39.560> take<00:01:39.679> other<00:01:39.860> classes<00:01:40.340> like

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
because you can take other classes like

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.790 
because you can take other classes like
if<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.209> hadn't<00:01:41.599> take<00:01:41.840> taken<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:42.470> wouldn't

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
if I hadn't take taken that I wouldn't

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.710 
if I hadn't take taken that I wouldn't
be<00:01:43.039> in<00:01:43.069> chem<00:01:43.369> right<00:01:43.550> now<00:01:43.670> I'm<00:01:43.940> just<00:01:44.239> thankful

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
be in chem right now I'm just thankful

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.389 
be in chem right now I'm just thankful
to<00:01:44.899> literally<00:01:45.140> start<00:01:45.440> because<00:01:45.770> if<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.009> didn't

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
to literally start because if I didn't

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.240 
to literally start because if I didn't
take<00:01:46.819> this<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.360> would<00:01:48.050> still<00:01:48.289> be<00:01:48.500> like<00:01:48.950> falling

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
take this I would still be like falling

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.620 
take this I would still be like falling
behind<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.580> my<00:01:49.700> classes<00:01:50.090> because<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.509> would

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
behind in my classes because I would

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.900 
behind in my classes because I would
have<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.750> take<00:01:50.899> classes<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.289> I<00:01:51.410> don't<00:01:51.619> need

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
have to take classes that I don't need

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.339 
have to take classes that I don't need

at<00:02:01.369> Cal<00:02:01.550> State<00:02:01.580> Northridge<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.989> a<00:02:03.020> student<00:02:03.470> can

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
at Cal State Northridge so a student can

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.440 
at Cal State Northridge so a student can
come<00:02:03.649> in<00:02:03.979> requiring<00:02:04.340> either<00:02:04.640> one<00:02:04.970> or<00:02:05.149> two

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
semesters of developmental math work so

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.359 
semesters of developmental math work so
in<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.599> summer<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:09.410> can<00:02:09.440> get<00:02:10.009> students

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
in the summer we can get students

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.830 
depending on which flavor of early start
they<00:02:15.140> take<00:02:15.440> even<00:02:15.830> students<00:02:16.459> who<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:17.270> did<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
they take even students who just did the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.400 
they take even students who just did the
required<00:02:18.290> progress<00:02:19.599> outperformed<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:21.020> other

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
Cal State Northridge program helped me

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.509 
Cal State Northridge program helped me
to<00:02:27.080> improve<00:02:27.500> those<00:02:27.680> small<00:02:28.010> mistakes<00:02:28.400> that

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
to improve those small mistakes that

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.339 
to improve those small mistakes that
were<00:02:28.640> core<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.150> math<00:02:29.360> because<00:02:29.900> really<00:02:30.200> their

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
were core in math because really their

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.589 
were core in math because really their
basic<00:02:30.980> knowledge<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.060> need<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.390> know<00:02:32.540> to

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
basic knowledge that you need to know to

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.770 
basic knowledge that you need to know to
build<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.200> math<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.090> being<00:02:35.090> able<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.300> improve

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
build on math and being able to improve

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.970 
build on math and being able to improve
that<00:02:35.990> helped<00:02:36.650> me<00:02:36.860> realize<00:02:37.700> such<00:02:38.710> silly<00:02:39.710> little

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
that helped me realize such silly little

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.040 
that helped me realize such silly little
mistakes<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.460> I<00:02:40.520> made<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.820> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
mistakes that I made in the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.910 
mistakes that I made in the
ass<00:02:41.460> but<00:02:42.460> are<00:02:42.640> now<00:02:43.020> really<00:02:44.020> important<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.770> me
