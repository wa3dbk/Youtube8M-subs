00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.850
 since the appearance of the first 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.160
 huge flat-screen TVs 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.180
 progress has been made 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.690
 firstly on consumption 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.370
 of energy a current led screen consumes 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.230
 on average three times less 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.810
 of electricity that a plasma screen of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.310
 first generation and this despite 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.980
 permanent increase in sizes 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.560
 you will find today 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 easily TVs with a label 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.140
 energetic a + and even double more 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.810
 secondly progress on fluidity 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.970
 of the image the fluidity of the image and the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.650
 capacity that a television has 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.080
 display moving images of 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.590
 clean and precise way for you there 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.300
 find 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.550
 manufacturers as unique for each 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.780
 TV a fluidity index of 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.300
 the image 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.030
 this index is measured in hertz by 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.360
 example a TV 50 hertz diffuse 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.340
 50 frames per second as the signal from 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.530
 television between years is only 50 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.530
 hertz TVs with an index 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.690
 greater than 50 will analyze the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 images in 30 to create images 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.820
 additional intermediate for 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.590
 improve the comfort of vision in 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.810
 constantly improve and algorithms the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.999
 image processing processor 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.429
 some current TVs displays 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:18.280
 melt flow index greater than 1000 r 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.140
 you an ideal choice to view 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.619
 sports programs or movies 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.630
 of action the resolution also made 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.030
 leaps forward a high TV 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.189
 definition allows to broadcast images 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.579
 with a resolution of just over one 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.729
 million pixels in 2013 a new 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.710
 standard has appeared the uhd for 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.950
 ultra high definition 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 also called 4 as a TV 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.409
 hd allows a resolution of over 8 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 millions of pixels 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.789
 this new technology offers you 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.679
 a finesse of the details a depth 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.459
 image and color shades 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.770
 unequaled thanks to the precision of the uhd 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.259
 you can equip yourself with a bigger 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.259
 TV without increasing the recoil 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.170
 necessary for a comfortable vision 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.299
 you are immersed in the image of others 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.090
 innovations make it possible to improve 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.670
 comfort of vision as for example 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.930
 the curved screen televisions as 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.090
 the edges of the screen are close to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.250
 you are practically enveloped 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.629
 in the picture and dive in the middle of 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.680
 the action 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.680
 just like in the movies
