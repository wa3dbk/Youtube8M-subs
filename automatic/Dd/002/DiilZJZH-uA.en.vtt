00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 As promised, let's resume contact. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.950
 with luiz carlos junior direct then to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.570
 the maracanã are already luiz and the edinho or 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.019
 pass on to us this amazing 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 draw of flamengo with bolívar luís o 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.680
 edict saying that at no time 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 planet was able to impose itself as a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.570
 home with the team that should be the favorite 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.359
 night again higher much 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.310
 I really do remember the following, tell me. 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 You barreto who saw the game you have 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.170
 some defense of kenya tough defense 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.360
 none the goalkeeper of the Bolivian team did 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.309
 no difficult defense is what prompted 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.840
 appear in luis ball meals 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.730
 defense even if it requires it was not 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.760
 exactly a lot of ball back to him is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 a speedy guy he runs and gets out of the big 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.469
 area before the hernanes now arrives at 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 defense he did not once in the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.719
 best moments here at sportv news 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.399
 marcelo barreto and edinho participating 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.309
 at this time of the sportv news best 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 moments of a flamengo who played 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.850
 You hardly ever say that Flemish 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.379
 played poorly here on maracanã 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.030
 I thought you played poorly I think he 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.380
 could have a better reading of the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.510
 It is not forced to start but this is the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.400
 idea was this everyone thought that the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.619
 Flamengo is arriving on matchday 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.299
 was to completely pressure the team 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.820
 of bolivia that came with that thought 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.770
 also comes with the tactical scheme 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 closing all with three 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.799
 Defenders 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.590
 with the player giving up a 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.479
 centerpiece and want reference throwing 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.329
 numerical superiority in the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.579
 and the Flemish accepted this type of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.350
 The situation accepted the bolivar 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.329
 who soon liked the match 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 liked the game and played non 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.590
 it's the best moments first time 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.479
 where the goalkeeper looks who waited for the ball 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.250
 It's kicked that you just saw 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.149
 ernani had this butt that passed 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.340
 close 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.259
 the crowd gave a show and the defense in the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.729
 request was more complicated the dollar may 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.899
 have been on top of it the ball varied 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.119
 quite ne 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.860
 and he palmed into the goal the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.719
 Flemish even sketched some 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.930
 speed as is characteristic of this 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.149
 staff but no time was the staff 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.099
 of other matches it is clear that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.670
 play with three heads daily castro 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.500
 to delay 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.680
 the elan that no longer has that dynamic 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.930
 fast transition system can not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.540
 the connection was very strong in the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.610
 stopped balls but today was not a 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.709
 important player for the team IPHAN 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.310
 paulinho joined as a right back 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.810
 good 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.360
 I thought it was very good I thought 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.650
 could be there would be a move to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 the flamengo team 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
 and there the bolivar goal and that sevilla 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.500
 that the ward requested a lack that there was no 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.239
 photo even more on the liberators of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.180
 america this type of situation the habit 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.090
 will not score Bolivia made 1 to 0 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.480
 Flemish was quick to respond and did not 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.549
 it took him to score his goal soon after 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.069
 everton tied the game and then in that 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.069
 everton moment not only to score as 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.980
 completely burned the twisted 12th 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.950
 player came on the pitch the Flemish came 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.330
 to top tied and turned the game with two 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.920
 everton goals 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.959
 we are seeing the first goal and 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.959
 It could not have been at a better time. 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.489
 and if part of flamengo was a ball 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.310
 that you were barred from classes as you well 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.730
 highlighted the ball in the second ball 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.410
 player to bolivar player entered 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.109
 of soft body in the flamengo game 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.329
 anticipated fell right foot everton 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.790
 that is not the right super reported his foot 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.920
 Preferred and I'm able to touch the corner 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.500
 left taking the goalie and tying 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.010
 raising the crowd but only after the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.680
 Flemish could not sustain this 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.230
 and was unable to press the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.390
 Bolivar's team 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.230
 now the Paulista very well by the way 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.000
 I was Jaime himself would leave the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.040
 more offensive and would put 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.230
 someone to cover it with something there 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.319
 happened during the second half 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.739
 everton of new Flemish in front and there 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.329
 in this case al was right in what 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.549
 He said after the game he understood the 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.989
 flamengo should administer from 2 to 1 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.180
 He thinks the Flemish departed. 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.459
 conscious to seek the third goal and 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.459
 became vulnerable behind you agree 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.299
 or do not agree the Flemish time all the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.760
 The entire party remained 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.640
 separated from each other and today in football 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.870
 Current is this, it 's very bad, right? 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.790
 opponent can 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.130
 is to occupy these spaces was what 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.860
 happened there was the bob and adriel 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.110
 bobo dodô pedriel who entered the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.030
 second time the player and reference 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.280
 tomás costa do joão paulo that was not 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.350
 concentrated when he noticed the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.419
 player had caught the front dominated the 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.430
 ball and in front of the goalkeeper Felipe 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.020
 could do the same in that situation 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.850
 Flemish needs results 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.850
 out of the house I
