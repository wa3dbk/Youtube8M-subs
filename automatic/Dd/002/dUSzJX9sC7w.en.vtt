 force the search for updates under 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 windows 8 using a computer 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.309
 so why do that while 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.540
 windows 8 does it automatically it's 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.600
 to say that they search regularly 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.430
 and automatically installs them 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.090
 updated itself by restarting 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.070
 the computer either by stopping it and well 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.400
 simply if you noticed 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 that there is a new update 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.180
 available and who has not yet 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.620
 detected well you can force this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 update or rather and it'll be in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.840

 you re installing the computer under 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.780
 windows 8 is fine instead of waiting 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 that windows detects new bets 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 up to date and you install them small to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 small and well you can force this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.579
 research 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.750
