00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.744
 They do not know if it's night, 

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.389
 Whether it is day or vice versa 

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.924

 to the beat of the eighth notes 

00:01:32.764 --> 00:01:34.310
 that square music 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.979

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:00.182
 Over there they walk 

00:03:00.182 --> 00:03:00.966
 between the blood that 

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:03.015
