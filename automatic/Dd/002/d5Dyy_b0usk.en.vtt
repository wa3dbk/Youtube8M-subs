must<00:00:23.300> see<00:00:23.689> sunshine<00:00:24.050> it's<00:00:25.009> very<00:00:25.310> important

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
must see sunshine it's very important

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.820 
must see sunshine it's very important
that<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.179> gets<00:00:26.300> Sun<00:00:26.630> for<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.900> good<00:00:27.349> part<00:00:27.619> of<00:00:27.740> the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
that it gets Sun for a good part of the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.620 
that it gets Sun for a good part of the
day<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.250> we<00:00:29.179> need<00:00:29.660> either<00:00:29.869> south-facing<00:00:30.519> or<00:00:31.519> a

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
day so we need either south-facing or a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.440 
day so we need either south-facing or a
Southwest<00:00:32.630> facing<00:00:33.080> sight<00:00:33.940> that's<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.180> first

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
Southwest facing sight that's the first

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.270 
Southwest facing sight that's the first
thing<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.980> second<00:00:37.340> thing<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.940> soil<00:00:39.280> they

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
thing the second thing is the soil they

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.890 
thing the second thing is the soil they
do<00:00:40.340> need<00:00:40.640> well-drained<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:41.450> they<00:00:41.510> don't<00:00:41.780> like

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
do need well-drained so they don't like

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.660 
do need well-drained so they don't like
heavy<00:00:42.170> clay<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:42.950> if<00:00:43.040> you're<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.430> put

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
heavy clay so if you're going to put

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
heavy clay so if you're going to put
them<00:00:43.820> in<00:00:44.110> heavier<00:00:45.110> soil<00:00:45.530> then<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:45.920> need<00:00:46.160> to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
them in heavier soil then you need to

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.750 
them in heavier soil then you need to
use<00:00:47.690> grits<00:00:48.140> in<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.560> bottom<00:00:48.890> of<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.190> whole<00:00:49.400> mix

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
use grits in the bottom of the whole mix

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.000 
use grits in the bottom of the whole mix
that<00:00:49.970> have<00:00:50.090> grit<00:00:50.390> up<00:00:50.600> with<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.200> bit<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.560> compost

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
that have grit up with a bit of compost

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.790 
that have grit up with a bit of compost
and<00:00:52.280> your<00:00:52.550> own<00:00:52.700> soil<00:00:53.000> don't<00:00:53.960> make<00:00:54.170> mistake<00:00:54.620> of

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
and your own soil don't make mistake of

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.520 
and your own soil don't make mistake of
putting<00:00:55.010> them<00:00:55.880> in<00:00:56.060> just<00:00:56.930> digging<00:00:57.260> a<00:00:57.350> hole

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
putting them in just digging a hole

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.770 
putting them in just digging a hole
underneath<00:00:57.920> where<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.000> grapes<00:00:59.240> going<00:00:59.600> and

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
underneath where the grapes going and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.770 
underneath where the grapes going and
putting<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.440> lot<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.240> gravel<00:01:02.240> or<00:01:02.270> rubble

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
putting in a lot of gravel or rubble

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780 
putting in a lot of gravel or rubble
because<00:01:03.470> that<00:01:03.710> would<00:01:03.860> just<00:01:03.890> act<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.549> soak

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
because that would just act to the soak

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.789 
because that would just act to the soak
away<00:01:04.939> will<00:01:05.269> collect<00:01:05.570> water<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.679> the

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
away will collect water and have the

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.120 
away will collect water and have the
opposite<00:01:07.189> effect<00:01:07.899> now<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:08.960> third<00:01:09.439> thing<00:01:09.469> you

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
opposite effect now the third thing you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.419 
opposite effect now the third thing you
really<00:01:10.399> must<00:01:10.700> have<00:01:10.789> is<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.810> grape<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:13.009> a<00:01:13.039> vine

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
really must have is a grape is a vine

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.139 
really must have is a grape is a vine
and<00:01:13.789> so<00:01:14.689> we<00:01:15.170> need<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.530> have<00:01:15.710> support<00:01:16.250> now<00:01:17.090> we

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
and so we need to have support now we

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.450 
and so we need to have support now we
can<00:01:17.390> see<00:01:17.570> from<00:01:17.810> most<00:01:18.439> of<00:01:18.619> orders<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.189> people

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
can see from most of orders that people

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.969 
can see from most of orders that people
only<00:01:19.579> order<00:01:19.939> two<00:01:20.119> or<00:01:20.149> three<00:01:20.299> at<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.689> time<00:01:20.719> and<00:01:21.229> so

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
only order two or three at a time and so

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.889 
only order two or three at a time and so
people<00:01:22.460> probably<00:01:22.759> aren't<00:01:22.999> making<00:01:23.210> vineyards

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
people probably aren't making vineyards

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.959 
people probably aren't making vineyards
has<00:01:24.020> just<00:01:24.259> use<00:01:24.439> them<00:01:24.649> in<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> garden<00:01:25.310> just

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
has just use them in the garden just

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.489 
has just use them in the garden just
because<00:01:26.299> they're<00:01:26.450> all<00:01:26.570> amento<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.200> obviously

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
because they're all amento and obviously

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.609 
because they're all amento and obviously
they<00:01:28.100> serve<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.520> purpose<00:01:28.670> during<00:01:29.359> the<00:01:29.659> turn<00:01:30.530> the

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
they serve a purpose during the turn the

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.929 
they serve a purpose during the turn the
autumn<00:01:30.920> because<00:01:31.189> you<00:01:31.310> get<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.549> fruit<00:01:31.759> from

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
autumn because you get the fruit from

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.450 
autumn because you get the fruit from
them<00:01:32.590> they<00:01:33.590> can<00:01:33.740> look<00:01:33.859> for<00:01:33.920> their<00:01:34.130> own<00:01:34.249> food

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
them they can look for their own food

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.239 
them they can look for their own food
because<00:01:34.789> they<00:01:34.880> are<00:01:35.319> they<00:01:36.319> are<00:01:36.350> climbers<00:01:37.039> so

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
because they are they are climbers so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.340 
because they are they are climbers so
the<00:01:37.850> rigs<00:01:38.030> would<00:01:38.240> go<00:01:38.390> searching<00:01:38.749> for<00:01:38.960> food

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
the rigs would go searching for food

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.380 
the rigs would go searching for food
underneath<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.549> roots<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.789> go<00:01:40.969> as<00:01:41.119> far

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
underneath and the roots that go as far

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.989 
underneath and the roots that go as far
under<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.380> ground<00:01:42.590> as<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.310> growth<00:01:43.520> above<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
under the ground as the growth above the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.870 
under the ground as the growth above the
ground<00:01:44.240> will<00:01:44.420> go<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.770> anyway<00:01:46.130> let's<00:01:46.399> first<00:01:46.700> of

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
ground will go so anyway let's first of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.959 
ground will go so anyway let's first of
all<00:01:47.200> put<00:01:48.200> up<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> bit<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.710> support<00:01:48.859> and<00:01:49.759> we're

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
all put up a bit of support and we're

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.489 
all put up a bit of support and we're
going<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.119> do<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.420> by<00:01:50.659> having<00:01:50.840> galvanized

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
going to do that by having galvanized

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.499 
going to do that by having galvanized
wire<00:01:53.590> it's<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.679> straining<00:01:55.039> wires<00:01:55.509> galvanized

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
wire it's a straining wires galvanized

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.050 
wire it's a straining wires galvanized
wire<00:01:56.749> this<00:01:57.469> is<00:01:57.649> 30<00:01:57.920> meters<00:01:58.340> depends<00:01:58.670> how<00:01:58.880> much

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
wire this is 30 meters depends how much

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.539 
wire this is 30 meters depends how much
you<00:01:59.240> want<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.770> other<00:02:00.889> thing<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:01.399> all

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
you want and the other thing you all

old-fashioned type where you see you
thread<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> wire<00:02:24.890> through<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:27.350> first<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.950> all

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
thread the wire through so first of all

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.410 
thread the wire through so first of all
let's<00:02:28.280> um<00:02:28.610> let's<00:02:28.970> put<00:02:29.930> some<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.320> these<00:02:30.500> in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
let's um let's put some of these in

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.370 
let's um let's put some of these in
you'll<00:02:32.420> need<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:34.630> probably<00:02:35.630> about<00:02:35.720> three

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
you'll need to have probably about three

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.670 
you'll need to have probably about three
lengths<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.430> wire<00:02:37.640> going<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.440> first

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
lengths of wire going in so the first

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.770 
lengths of wire going in so the first
one<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.070> want<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.310> start<00:02:40.610> off<00:02:40.760> about<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:41.750> a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
one we want to start off about but a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.470 
one we want to start off about but a
foot<00:02:42.110> off<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> ground<00:02:45.220> let's<00:02:46.220> make<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.490> make

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
foot off of the ground let's make a make

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.130 
foot off of the ground let's make a make
a<00:02:47.510> start<00:02:47.990> there<00:02:48.520> with<00:02:49.520> my<00:02:49.760> knife

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.160 

get<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.980> vine<00:02:55.220> iron<00:02:55.670> now<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.570> see<00:02:56.810> those<00:02:57.020> are

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
get the vine iron now you see those are

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.320 
get the vine iron now you see those are
quite<00:02:57.410> long<00:02:57.740> because<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.820> don't<00:02:59.060> want<00:02:59.210> the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
quite long because you don't want the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.870 
quite long because you don't want the
vine<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.870> right<00:03:00.110> up<00:03:00.320> against<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.980> fence<00:03:01.250> he

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
vine to be right up against the fence he

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.520 
vine to be right up against the fence he
wanted<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.300> enough<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.990> little<00:03:03.170> bit<00:03:03.410> of

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
wanted it enough to have a little bit of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.100 
wanted it enough to have a little bit of
air<00:03:03.800> movement<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.210> Sun<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.480> surround

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
air movement and so the Sun can surround

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.440 
air movement and so the Sun can surround
the<00:03:06.320> berries<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:06.860> well<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.820> we're<00:03:08.000> purposely

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
the berries as well so we're purposely

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.670 
the berries as well so we're purposely
leaving<00:03:08.960> about<00:03:09.230> three<00:03:09.620> inches<00:03:10.460> off<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:12.260> fence

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
leaving about three inches off the fence

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.800 
leaving about three inches off the fence
for<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.040> reason<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:14.000> other<00:03:14.090> reason<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.630> they

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
for that reason the other reason is they

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.280 
for that reason the other reason is they
will<00:03:14.960> get<00:03:15.170> mildew<00:03:15.620> off<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.860> airs<00:03:16.010> too<00:03:16.190> still

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
will get mildew off the airs too still

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.790 
will get mildew off the airs too still
so<00:03:18.290> there's<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.650> first<00:03:18.860> one<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.290> attach

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
so there's the first one we just attach

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.730 
so there's the first one we just attach
the<00:03:22.040> wire<00:03:22.280> around<00:03:22.400> here

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.940 

get<00:03:29.740> it<00:03:29.860> nice<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.100> tight<00:03:31.350> then<00:03:32.350> we're<00:03:32.620> stretch

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
get it nice and tight then we're stretch

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.950 
get it nice and tight then we're stretch
it<00:03:33.100> off<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:34.000> another<00:03:34.090> one<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.690> I'm<00:03:34.810> gonna

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
it off to another one that I'm gonna

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.390 
it off to another one that I'm gonna
make<00:03:35.200> over<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> other<00:03:35.770> side<00:03:38.040> okay<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.100> that's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
make over the other side okay so that's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.850 
make over the other side okay so that's
the<00:03:39.520> wires<00:03:39.760> in<00:03:40.000> place<00:03:40.270> now<00:03:41.200> we<00:03:41.260> need<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.650> take

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
the wires in place now we need to take

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.880 
the wires in place now we need to take
our<00:03:42.210> grapevine<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:43.959> Doon<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.500> dormant

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
our grapevine and Doon the dormant

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.530 
our grapevine and Doon the dormant
season<00:03:45.100> that's<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.790> season<00:03:46.150> when<00:03:46.240> it's<00:03:46.390> got

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
season that's the season when it's got

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.020 
season that's the season when it's got
no<00:03:46.780> leaves<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:47.680> at<00:03:47.830> all<00:03:48.040> during<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.760> winter

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
no leaves on at all during the winter

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.360 
no leaves on at all during the winter
time<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.570> can<00:03:49.990> tease<00:03:50.440> these<00:03:50.680> roots<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.160> did<00:03:51.340> a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
time you can tease these roots I did a

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.770 
time you can tease these roots I did a
little<00:03:51.520> bit<00:03:51.670> help<00:03:51.880> them<00:03:52.060> get<00:03:52.209> away

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
little bit help them get away

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.010 
little bit help them get away
I've<00:03:53.350> been<00:03:53.920> grown<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.550> pot<00:03:54.790> if<00:03:55.600> it's<00:03:55.810> during

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
I've been grown in a pot if it's during

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.660 
I've been grown in a pot if it's during
the<00:03:56.140> summer<00:03:56.380> time<00:03:56.680> if<00:03:56.920> you're<00:03:57.070> planted<00:03:57.520> in<00:03:57.610> the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
the summer time if you're planted in the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.760 
the summer time if you're planted in the
summertime<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:58.990> better<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.380> leave<00:03:59.560> the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
summertime and it's better to leave the

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.010 
summertime and it's better to leave the
roots<00:04:00.030> alone<00:04:01.030> because<00:04:01.300> your<00:04:01.420> disturb<00:04:01.810> them

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
roots alone because your disturb them

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.540 
roots alone because your disturb them
and<00:04:02.170> set<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.560> set<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.550> growth<00:04:04.120> back<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:06.340> there

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
and set the set the growth back so there

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.290 
and set the set the growth back so there
we<00:04:06.670> are<00:04:06.700> that's<00:04:07.209> good<00:04:07.510> enough<00:04:07.630> there<00:04:08.790> now<00:04:09.850> the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
we are that's good enough there now the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.380 
we are that's good enough there now the
other<00:04:10.420> consideration<00:04:10.810> really<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:12.390> whether

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
other consideration really is whether

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.030 
other consideration really is whether
you're<00:04:13.570> going<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.780> grow<00:04:13.930> them<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.620> make<00:04:14.770> wine

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
you're going to grow them to make wine

didn't have the ground cover then you

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.940 
didn't have the ground cover then you
could<00:06:15.220> use<00:06:15.700> a<00:06:15.730> mulch<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.450> I<00:06:16.950> recommended
