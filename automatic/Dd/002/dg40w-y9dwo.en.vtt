00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.800
 Let's continue with those roxette roxette 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.240
 that is a training principle which i 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.429
 Definitely explain again and again 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.900
 MUST go in this drinking principle 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.669
 by several sentences but only by one 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 sentence about this sentence you pull in almost 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.590
 the length usually is the rate of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.080
 last set of a training session 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 muscle group for example here at the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.190
 squat my last all set me 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 pack a maximum weight again 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.340
 I repeat here to do on 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.530
 the on the pole and then go 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 when I finish this mission 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 I have one weight each time 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 make plate per side down again 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.210
 ten twelve repetitions, the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
 snake back in again weight 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 down to make another 10 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.050
 repetition usually exists 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.040
 roxette of three single sentences without 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.870
 a break 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.860
 so and now I'll show you something like that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.860
 whole works in practice 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.710
 Let's go 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.939
 Franconia 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.990
 a 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.060
 Danger 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.790
 O 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.890
 the classic if you want you can 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.470
 now another training 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.170
 replace principle with these last jobs 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.980
 and that would be my jumps, for example 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.980
 which then look like this 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.409
 do it all with 20 kilos before 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.829
 chest 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:05.790
 that does not show now again 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.829
 I have an indirect here today 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.650
 through all the many people a lot of grass 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:15.109
 smoked so hard hard into the mark 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.940
 please give me a quick thumbs up and 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.829
 subscribe to the channel if you have more 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.060
 query posting this please under the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:29.580
 tutorial among the videos we do not care 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:33.320
 know where I have something of my shirt 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.320
 admission costs or 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.139
 or what I ate lunch today 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.169
 have fun marry klindworth 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.450
 can do exercises from what 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.890
 probably the 100 exercises already 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.390
 are completely sufficient 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.100
 I'll show you my favorites here 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.280
 Exercise directly on with the heaviest 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:07.950
 exercises of the shoulder exercise 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.760
 For this I hang my foot in here 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.760
 second with this
