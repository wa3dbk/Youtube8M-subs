00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
up to one of these export our SBS you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
up to one of these export our SBS you
would<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.500> an<00:00:41.250> export<00:00:41.579> RS<00:00:41.910> be

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
would have to have an export RS be

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.569 
would have to have an export RS be
connected<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> an<00:00:43.500> inverter<00:00:44.420> connected<00:00:45.420> to

your flight controller but with a Sparky

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
your flight controller but with a Sparky
because<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> better<00:00:51.539> processor

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
because it's got the better processor

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
because it's got the better processor
and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.340> processor<00:00:53.370> supports<00:00:54.329> serial<00:00:55.050> port

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and the processor supports serial port

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.220 
and the processor supports serial port
inversion<00:00:56.539> because<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:57.930> f3

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
inversion because this is an f3

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
inversion because this is an f3
processor<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:58.859> not<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> f1<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.120> means<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
processor or not the f1 it means you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
processor or not the f1 it means you
don't<00:01:00.570> need<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> inverter<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
don't need to have the inverter which is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.690 
don't need to have the inverter which is
awesome<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.960> also<00:01:04.170> has<00:01:04.500> three<00:01:04.920> serial<00:01:05.280> ports

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
awesome it also has three serial ports

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
awesome it also has three serial ports
all<00:01:06.060> working<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:06.990> same<00:01:07.229> time<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.130> if

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
all working at the same time here so if

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.100 
all working at the same time here so if
you<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> quick<00:01:09.330> look<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.630> screen<00:01:09.930> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you have a quick look at my screen you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600 
you have a quick look at my screen you
can<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.380> I've<00:01:10.470> got<00:01:10.560> two<00:01:10.770> instances<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
can see I've got two instances of the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.820 
can see I've got two instances of the
configurator<00:01:12.240> open<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.290> they're<00:01:13.409> both<00:01:13.530> using

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
configurator open and they're both using

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.499 
configurator open and they're both using
different<00:01:14.280> serial<00:01:14.640> ports<00:01:14.970> 27<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> 9<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:17.509> so

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
different serial ports 27 and 9 there so

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.410 
different serial ports 27 and 9 there so
for<00:01:18.930> example<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.070> palm<00:01:20.670> 9<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.240> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
for example the palm 9 which is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.179 
for example the palm 9 which is
currently<00:01:21.869> connected<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> USB<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
currently connected to the USB you are I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.289 
currently connected to the USB you are I
doubt<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.759> connected<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.210> your

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
doubt it could be connected to your

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.600 
doubt it could be connected to your
bluetooth<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.080> OS<00:01:25.200> D<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> can

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
bluetooth for your OS D and you can

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.450 
bluetooth for your OS D and you can
still<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> USB<00:01:27.420> port<00:01:27.900> independently<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
still use the USB port independently to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
still use the USB port independently to
connect<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> configure<00:01:30.750> things<00:01:30.960> from

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
connect up and configure things from

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
connect up and configure things from
your<00:01:31.320> computer<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
your computer you can see that the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.069 
your computer you can see that the
receiver<00:01:33.780> tab<00:01:34.079> over<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:35.329> is<00:01:36.329> working<00:01:36.720> fine

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
receiver tab over here is working fine

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
receiver tab over here is working fine
with<00:01:37.320> lots<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> channels<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.280> you've<00:01:38.430> got

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
with lots of channels so you've got

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.330 
with lots of channels so you've got
sixteen<00:01:39.060> channels<00:01:39.299> over<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.829> working

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
sixteen channels over here all working

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.469 
sixteen channels over here all working
just<00:01:41.820> fine

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
just fine

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.749 
just fine

and I've got pots I've got three

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.730 
and I've got pots I've got three
positions<00:01:45.240> which<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.840> I've<00:01:46.079> got<00:01:46.229> all<00:01:46.380> kinds<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
positions which is I've got all kinds of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.249 
positions which is I've got all kinds of
things<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.070> I've<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.579> sliders<00:01:48.259> this

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
things so I've got a little sliders this
