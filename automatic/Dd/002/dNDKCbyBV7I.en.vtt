can see you just got the lock fly in the
corner<00:01:55.479> of<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.600> month<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.080> put<00:01:56.320> them<00:01:56.440> back<00:01:56.590> so

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
corner of the month so put them back so

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.859 
corner of the month so put them back so
what<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.400> want<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.670> try<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:58.150> is<00:01:58.299> let<00:01:58.600> the

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
what you want to try to do is let the

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.950 
what you want to try to do is let the
float<00:01:59.380> drift<00:02:00.369> with<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.759> stream<00:02:01.090> as<00:02:01.360> naturally

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
float drift with the stream as naturally

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.320 
float drift with the stream as naturally
as<00:02:01.990> possible<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:03.190> those<00:02:03.400> flies<00:02:03.790> are<00:02:04.090> stripped

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
as possible so those flies are stripped

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.389 
as possible so those flies are stripped
along<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.780> same<00:02:04.990> pace<00:02:05.560> as<00:02:05.860> everything<00:02:06.280> else

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
along the same pace as everything else

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.920 
along the same pace as everything else
they'll<00:02:06.700> be<00:02:06.820> coming<00:02:07.119> by<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.330> trout<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
they'll be coming by the trout in the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.080 
they'll be coming by the trout in the
stream<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.440> looks<00:02:08.619> natural<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.789> kind

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
stream so it looks natural so you kind

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.520 
stream so it looks natural so you kind
of<00:02:10.209> have<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.390> watch<00:02:10.840> your<00:02:11.020> line

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
of have to watch your line

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.740 
of have to watch your line
don't<00:02:11.709> let<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> bar<00:02:12.160> get<00:02:12.459> hung<00:02:13.030> up<00:02:13.180> or<00:02:13.450> drag

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
don't let the bar get hung up or drag

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.860 
don't let the bar get hung up or drag
along<00:02:14.230> at<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> slower<00:02:15.130> pace<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.430> uh<00:02:15.880> streamers

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
along at a slower pace and uh streamers

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.570 
along at a slower pace and uh streamers
actually<00:02:17.230> movie<00:02:17.530> actually<00:02:17.680> ups<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.340> stuff

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
actually movie actually ups it the stuff

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.490 
actually movie actually ups it the stuff
move<00:02:18.850> at<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.060> same<00:02:19.239> speed<00:02:19.300> as<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.810> water

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.410 

there<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.070> go<00:02:28.250> what's<00:02:28.820> up<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.960> one
