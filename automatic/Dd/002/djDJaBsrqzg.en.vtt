hi<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:06.930> karena<00:00:07.259> goodrich<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.130> with

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
hi it's karena goodrich here and with

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.400 
hi it's karena goodrich here and with
this<00:00:08.730> video<00:00:09.090> we're<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.660> do<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> simple

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
this video we're going to do a simple

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.799 
this video we're going to do a simple
assessment<00:00:11.250> for<00:00:11.849> whether<00:00:12.150> or<00:00:12.330> not<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.630> have

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
assessment for whether or not you have

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.169 
assessment for whether or not you have
fusion<00:00:13.139> now<00:00:13.530> fusion<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.519> when<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> two<00:00:15.000> eyes

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
fusion now fusion is when the two eyes

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.840 
fusion now fusion is when the two eyes
are<00:00:15.389> working<00:00:15.719> together<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:17.220> brain<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
are working together and the brain is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.730 
are working together and the brain is
taking<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> images<00:00:18.779> from<00:00:18.990> both<00:00:19.230> eyes<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
taking the images from both eyes and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.010 
taking the images from both eyes and
fusing<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.609> together<00:00:20.760> into<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.390> complete

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
fusing it together into one complete

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.170 
fusing it together into one complete
picture<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.130> use<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.609> go<00:00:23.939> about

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
picture that you can use to go about

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.380 
picture that you can use to go about
your<00:00:24.359> daily<00:00:24.539> activities<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:25.550> now<00:00:26.550> fusion<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
your daily activities with now fusion is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.000 
your daily activities with now fusion is
very<00:00:27.599> important<00:00:28.140> because<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.500> provides<00:00:28.830> us

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
very important because it provides us

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.679 
very important because it provides us
with<00:00:29.070> three-dimensional<00:00:29.760> vision<00:00:30.539> which

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
with three-dimensional vision which

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.139 
with three-dimensional vision which
gives<00:00:30.960> us<00:00:31.140> our<00:00:31.320> depth<00:00:31.590> perception<00:00:32.309> some

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
gives us our depth perception some

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
gives us our depth perception some
people<00:00:33.510> may<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.140> fusion<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.800> their

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
people may not have fusion and their

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
people may not have fusion and their
eyes<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.820> brain<00:00:36.030> may<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.329> compensating<00:00:37.079> for

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
eyes and brain may be compensating for

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
eyes and brain may be compensating for
this<00:00:37.350> very<00:00:37.620> well<00:00:37.920> other<00:00:38.610> people<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:39.180> have

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this very well other people do have

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.170 
this very well other people do have
fusion<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.040> enhanced<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
fusion and this can be enhanced and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.690 
fusion and this can be enhanced and
increased<00:00:42.750> no<00:00:43.260> matter<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.280> vision<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
increased no matter what your vision is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
increased no matter what your vision is
like<00:00:44.969> even<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.930> perfectly<00:00:46.469> good

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
like even if you have perfectly good

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.700 
like even if you have perfectly good
vision<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.340> order<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> improve<00:00:48.710> detailed

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
vision in order to improve detailed

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.180 
vision in order to improve detailed
perception<00:00:50.340> color<00:00:50.820> perception<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.530> basic

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
perception color perception and a basic

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.049 
perception color perception and a basic
enjoyment<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.270> visual<00:00:54.690> acuity<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
enjoyment of your visual acuity so this

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
enjoyment of your visual acuity so this
assessment<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.840> called<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> gate<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.820> we're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
assessment is called the gate and we're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
assessment is called the gate and we're
going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.239> use<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.690> single<00:01:00.989> finger<00:01:01.410> held<00:01:01.800> in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
going to use a single finger held in

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
going to use a single finger held in
front<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> us<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.210> whether<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.140> can

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
front of us to see whether or not we can

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.920 
front of us to see whether or not we can
determine<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.400> fusion<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.689> start

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
determine if we have fusion so we start

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.620 
determine if we have fusion so we start
out<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.770> taking<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.340> finger<00:01:08.700> place<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> on

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
out by taking the finger place it on

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.120 
out by taking the finger place it on
your<00:01:09.659> nose<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.350> bring<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> away<00:01:10.890> from

two fingers there now both fingers are
going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.689> blurry<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.619> fuzzy<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.820> there

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
going to be blurry and fuzzy but there

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
going to be blurry and fuzzy but there
will<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.240> two<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.810> them<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.369> you'll<00:01:38.369> notice

will be two of them there you'll notice

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
will be two of them there you'll notice
if<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.060> bring<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.479> guys<00:01:39.659> back<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.200> look<00:01:40.350> at

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
if you bring you guys back to look at

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.859 
if you bring you guys back to look at
the<00:01:40.799> finger<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.549> resolve<00:01:41.970> into<00:01:42.329> one

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the finger it will resolve into one

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
the finger it will resolve into one
finger<00:01:43.320> again<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.640> may<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.060> may<00:01:45.210> not

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
finger again and it may or may not

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
finger again and it may or may not
become<00:01:45.600> clear<00:01:46.140> depending<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.799> what<00:01:47.009> your

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
become clear depending on what your

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.240 
become clear depending on what your
vision<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.090> distance<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.890> if

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
vision is like at this distance so if

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.969 
vision is like at this distance so if
you're<00:01:50.850> only<00:01:51.329> seeing<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.049> finger<00:01:52.680> make

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you're only seeing one finger make

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
you're only seeing one finger make
absolutely<00:01:53.640> certain<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.479> you're<00:01:54.960> looking

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
absolutely certain that you're looking

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.920 
absolutely certain that you're looking
off<00:01:55.409> into<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.430> distance<00:01:56.520> past<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.570> finger

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
off into the distance past your finger

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.190 
off into the distance past your finger
and<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> de<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.810> you're<00:02:00.810> still

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and not actually a de if you're still
