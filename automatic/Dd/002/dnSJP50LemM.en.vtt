 the usb memory in which we have 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.240

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.990
 directly to the tlax wifi folder and 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.640

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.390
 the version that is does not matter and it 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.400
 will begin to copy to our usb memory 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 let's wait for it to be copied and once 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.050
 well then once the copy has been copied 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.900
 module that is this that this one comes here 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.760

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.160
 try it or start my computer and 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.680
 I will run business lax from my 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.300
 usb memory for it because as I have already 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.040

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.410
 good guys good girls then once 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.270
 that we are already in the operating system 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.340
 let's see if it is installed for it 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.350

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.990
 internet as you see here we have it I have 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.410
 and see 8 ok we open it and go for a 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.680
 bit 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.510
 ok tells us to accept the terms 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.610
 of the license as we accept them 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.440
 and perfect as you see it starts 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.630
 correctly here we have what it would be 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.580
 our idea of computer and our 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.760
 password now what I'm going to do is going to 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.770
 be to try it connect my samsung 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.500

 waiting for a valid authentication is 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.210
 because my mobile is connecting to the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.410
