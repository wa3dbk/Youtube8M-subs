00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
was the most difficult thing to shoot

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.080 
was the most difficult thing to shoot
for<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.049> know<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.769> was<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.310> don't<00:02:56.610> know<00:02:56.879> if<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
for you know it was I don't know if it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.729 
for you know it was I don't know if it
was<00:02:57.209> easy<00:02:57.769> but<00:02:59.480> that<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:01.140> underwater

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
was easy but that that underwater

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.009 
was easy but that that underwater
sequence<00:03:02.459> was<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.530> demanding<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:06.030> shoot<00:03:06.239> and

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
sequence was so demanding to shoot and

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.229 
sequence was so demanding to shoot and
so<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.680> took<00:03:07.829> about<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.400> think<00:03:08.639> Matthew<00:03:08.880> said

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
so it took about I think Matthew said

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.729 
so it took about I think Matthew said
all<00:03:09.389> in<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.690> took<00:03:09.840> about<00:03:09.959> 11<00:03:10.380> days<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.709> shoot<00:03:10.920> oh

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
all in it took about 11 days to shoot oh
