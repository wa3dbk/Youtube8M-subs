00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.850

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.070
 cole portals who help you create 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.200
 very convenient teleportation system on 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.580
 your server 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.680
 now in front of me is the portal of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.290
 red wool 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.420
 the exact same is in the snow biome 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.080
 to teleport we have to go 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.440
 into this portal and click on the button and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:39.930
 wore ported snow biome here 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.640
 now here is the portal now 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.400
 teleport back I tell you right now 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 how to build it and so for us 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 and pressure plate 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 first we build a foundation of wool ears in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:08.600
 cave like a normal portal after that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 put a sign on the top block 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.810
 we write the title of contentment any i 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.259
 I will write a test and the portal channel is any 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.920
 number in my opinion up to a hundred well, let's say 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.640
 the port 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.079
 Channel 10 would create and in the chat will be 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.710

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.469
 yellow portal on channel 10 and the same we 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.250

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.219
