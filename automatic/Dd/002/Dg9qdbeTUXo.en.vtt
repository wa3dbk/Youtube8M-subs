00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Ah 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.630
 What is the first night auction application 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.450
 Hi 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:20.750
 A subscription to the net to learn about as we look at the case with you live 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:23.090
 If you borrow or lend money, you may enter the premises 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.840
 Things can happen 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:31.369
 Even if you do not approach the auction for investment purposes 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.899
 It would be a big help to know just enough auction orders to protect your property. 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.719
 I think 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.190
 Do not think that auction is difficult. 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:44.449
 Okay, we'll find it fun and easy. 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.329
 What is the first thing you need to know about an auction? 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.359
 What is my auction? 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.499
 We should start knowing what the auction is. 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:59.239
 Next, the procedure of the auction and simply the rights analysis 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:02.809
 And how to identify the basic documents you need to know about an auction 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.320
 I know I'll go to the bidders and create a bid table . 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.890
 Transfer of ownership after payment 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.770
 And I will look into brightness with you. 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.939
 Let's get started. 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:22.670
 First, let's look at what an auction is. 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:28.189
 If the debtor can not pay back the creditor, 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.609
 The process of recovering the bonds after the sale of the auction by analogy to the sale of the court 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.609
 Says 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:40.479
 Let's take an example. Debtor Kim Sam-Soon gave creditor Hong Kil-dong 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.310
 If you borrow money from a house where you live, you can not use it. 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.320
 Occurred 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:50.200
 What if creditor Hong Kil-dong is called and I can not get the money 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.909
 At first, talk good to pay the money. 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:00.299
 This configuration coming and going in the end would come by the end of suggesting the law 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.299
 As a rule, the auction begins here. 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:12.750
 Creditor Hong Kil-dong lent money to the body doctor in the court and did not receive it. 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:19.260
 I am going to apply for an auction at the court to get the money I borrowed. 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:23.070
 The court will immediately initiate the auction process if it determines that it is legitimate 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:28.500
 So , what would be the object of an auction? 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:33.090
 There is a real estate liquid property in the real estate 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:40.260
 Real estate refers to the land we generally know and the corresponding 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.300
 After such an apartment house plant forest land and set up a re-Sat geunjeodanggwon 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.489
 You can go ahead with an auction. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:52.489
 If you lived in the shallow water pulls apply for the auction can not be returned to jeonsegeum round 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.489
 Most of the auction proceeds are real estate. 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:03.250
 Another is that you gave line jungbudong estate unfamiliar term hasijyo 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.740
 Zoom Real estate is not visible to the nature Registration ah me in management positions 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.910
 It means the inevitability of registration 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:15.640
 By Jung garden stuff typically has a car 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:19.810
 Like I said a while back, the car is powered by the car registrar. 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.010
 Like the one thing you must be registered can apply for Auction 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:29.560
 So what is the one thing that you register besides the car ? 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:35.020
 Yes, it is. There is no aircraft ship or mining right. 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.510
 All of them are registered by means of aircraft, etc. 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:44.269
 Term of auction target 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.890
 If you look at the TV drama for reference, there are many cases where you put a red tag on household items 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:51.230
 You would have seen it. 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.849
 In this case the auction is not against a lot of liquids in the court auction 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.920
 We are proceeding. 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.819
 A detailed list and how you can view from the garden See naohni Facilities 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.819
 I will. 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:07.819
 I'm sure you've found out what auction is up to now. 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:12.769
 Understanding the procedure for an auction 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:17.239
 There are many parts that require specialized knowledge such as right analysis brightness. 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.859
 But everyone can know the auction. 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.360
 If you are with toxicity 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.250
 We promise to provide you with useful auction information and you can study more easily. 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.370

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.729
 Thank you for watching . See you next time. 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.729
 Goodbye
