00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 spend more fans back with a 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 new test for this lenovo k 920 in 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.919
 this time we will measure the power of your 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.919
 speaker let's see her 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.350
 in this video I will compare the power 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.840
 of the speaker of lenovo k 920 with the 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.140
 speaker power of iphone 6 plus and 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.119
 of the minute s mono a while ago serious 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.100
 to that speaker comparison between the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.169
 minute and iphone 6 plus and it turned out 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.760
 winner the minute anyway I'm going to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.070
 make a montage so you can see it 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.629
 also in this video and we'll see how it 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.550
 unwraps in it again and what 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.960
 power has I say the same as I said in 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.570
 your day you can not trust the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.000
 numbering but if we can see which 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.949
 has more power that is to say in its day the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.530
 minute of a power if I do not remember 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.809
 bad of 85 decibels but I say no 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.940
 fies of the 85 decibels but the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.309
 decibel difference between 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.379
 iphone 6 for example and the minute there 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.420
 we can see which one has more power like this 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.330
 that you notice the power and not the 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.729
 numbering in terms of sharpness there yes 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.930
 you can see something better in the video 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.970
 although good is not going to appreciate 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.130
 as well as you can appreciate the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.200
 reality but well you can also 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.570
 make an idea of which one has more sharpness 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.020
 in a sound that so nothing we're going to 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.969
 see the comparison and we see how it goes 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.770
 each of them and which has greater 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.280
 power 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.280
 ah 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.300
 virtual 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.820
 First 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.110
 good the maximum result on iphone 6 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.200
 plus has been 80 decibels as you see 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.200
 there 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.640
 Y 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.640
 d 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 may 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.740
 which it's 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.980
 Huesca 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.420
 the result of this hay mouth 920 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.519
 have been 85 decibels as you can 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.939
 see there we play the video in the 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.939
 minute 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.169
 the result in the minute has been 85 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.029
 decibels there you can see it 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.240
 as you can see the result of 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:58.599
 lenovo k 920 has been 85 decibels what 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.189
 same as he did in his day the minute in 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.439
 about iphone 6 plus as you have 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.879
 been able to see have been 80 decibels with 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.009
 which the power of these two 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.319
 devices of both the lenovo and the 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.590
 seom and is quite higher than in the 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:14.020
 that the iphone 6 plus if we talk about what 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.050
 which will be emitted and clarity in the sound 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.509
 the truth that they are very equipping all 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.550
 and the truth is that the sound is very good 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.550
 in the in the three devices but I 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.469
 I've seen what I'm going to repeat in power 85 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.860
 decibels both the wolf as the 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:31.360
 sioni and iphone 6 plus in 80 so 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.289
 nothing here the video and see you in 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.289
 the next one until then
