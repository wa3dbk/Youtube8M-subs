00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 good dreams I have the guards for 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.140
 teach you how to do another achievement of the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.660
 island 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.559
 I'm not going to teach achievement of sheltering 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.139
 which is an achievement of missions of pandaria 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.490
 and before we start we remind you that if 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.560
 you want me to make a video about 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 anything from the egg ask me in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.449
 the comments of the videos or me 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 you send a message and we already talk like 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.580
 I will do good to protect what 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.519
 asks us is to kill a bug with a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.960
 perimeter guard now sonatrach 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.000
 to sun in the alliance attributes good I 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.000
 I'm going to do it with a bug of these 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.329
 it will not happen nor god 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.310
 well now when I find a bug 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.310
 valid I keep recording 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:17.289
 where is the common bug here in 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.289
 straight 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.219
 well then once we've seen 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.710
 Exactly I will be loading the receipt 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.590
 so that it goes hitting rays when it is 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.939
 big is loaded 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.939
 the only thing you have to do is 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.990
 the visual ray 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.570
 and that they're going to kill him both 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 it's a very easy achievement I did not even know that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.560
 there was going to an achievement that was 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 very easy this is not valid for Wednesday 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.170
 nothing if he 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.390
 the achievement I did not know existed I was looking for 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.479
 how to do it I think the video serves 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.939
 goodbye like it like and nothing to remember tomorrow 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.659
 Thursday morning I will make a video of 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.009
 addons and we see what I do because it goes 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.460
 more or less almost all that I use 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.110
 I'll look for some pretty useful try and 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.110
 nothing see you tomorrow maybe
