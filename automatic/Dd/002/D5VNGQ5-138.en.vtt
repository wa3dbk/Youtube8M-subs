found it necessary to do to have such an

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.569 
found it necessary to do to have such an
opening<00:00:57.149> an<00:00:57.530> interesting<00:00:58.530> process<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
opening an interesting process because I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
opening an interesting process because I
personally<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.140> having<00:01:01.559> my

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
personally think that just having my

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.700 
personally think that just having my
opinion<00:01:02.160> every<00:01:02.489> single<00:01:02.820> picture<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.710> good

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
opinion every single picture is not good

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.030 
opinion every single picture is not good
enough<00:01:05.060> it<00:01:06.060> doesn't<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:07.049> cut<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
enough it doesn't really cut it so I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
enough it doesn't really cut it so I
just<00:01:08.430> pulled<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> people<00:01:09.270> together<00:01:09.450> usually

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
just pulled the people together usually

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.950 
just pulled the people together usually
helping<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.040> videos<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.760> weren't<00:01:12.030> by<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
helping with videos and weren't by the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.719

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
