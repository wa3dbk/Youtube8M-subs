 the biggest and best in the republic 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.260
 Chuvash is the place where I was born as 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.899
 I was told by my parents of such detachments 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.840
 across Russia very much and they all 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.609
 united by three letters rc o 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.850
 I don't know yet what it means but 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.920
 probably this is something big and strong in 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.039
 my camp is resting a lot of children 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.500
 the same as me from all of Russia in this 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.140
 shift came to us more than a thousand 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.390

 I can count 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.689

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.840

 arrived at sea 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.679
 because we all went to school 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.319
 for counselors there we were told that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.080
 counselor is not a profession about vocation 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.720
