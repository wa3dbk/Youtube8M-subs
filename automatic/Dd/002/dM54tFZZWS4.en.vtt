like a small competition everybody's
gonna<00:00:34.020> make<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> plane<00:00:34.440> Anna<00:00:34.680> will<00:00:35.010> let<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
gonna make a plane Anna will let all of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.490 
gonna make a plane Anna will let all of
you<00:00:35.579> viewers<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.180> judge<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.350> like

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
you viewers of judge which one you like

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
you viewers of judge which one you like
the<00:00:37.530> best<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.700> basically<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> video<00:00:39.510> on

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the best so basically this is a video on

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
the best so basically this is a video on
the<00:00:40.050> plane<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.500> kind<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> threw<00:00:41.219> together

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the plane that I kind of threw together

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.889 
the plane that I kind of threw together
this<00:00:41.579> weekend<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.510> been<00:00:42.690> away<00:00:42.870> in

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this weekend I've been away in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.660 
this weekend I've been away in
California<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.530> vacation<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.250> kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> had

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
California on vacation so I kind of had

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.029 
California on vacation so I kind of had
a<00:00:44.700> rush<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.510> together<00:00:45.829> but<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
a rush to get one together but this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.560 
a rush to get one together but this
plane<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.309> based<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:47.789> idea<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.329> kind<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
plane is based on an idea that I kind of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
plane is based on an idea that I kind of
had<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.899> head<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> little<00:00:49.410> while<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
had in my head for a little while it's a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.209 
had in my head for a little while it's a
kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> lifting<00:00:51.270> body<00:00:51.300> type<00:00:51.930> design<00:00:52.289> kind

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
kind of a lifting body type design kind

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
kind of a lifting body type design kind
of<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> flying<00:00:53.760> wing<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.980> almost<00:00:55.980> looks

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
of like a flying wing or almost looks

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
of like a flying wing or almost looks
like<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.340> spaceship<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:56.969> basically<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:57.989> get

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
like a spaceship but basically we get

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.779 
like a spaceship but basically we get
into<00:00:58.379> take<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> look<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> plane<00:00:59.280> I'll<00:00:59.609> show

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
into take a look at the plane I'll show

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
into take a look at the plane I'll show
you<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> build<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> where<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.500> now

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you the build and where I'm at right now

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
you the build and where I'm at right now
at<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> plane<00:01:02.780> okay<00:01:03.780> everyone<00:01:04.049> here's<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
at the plane okay everyone here's a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
at the plane okay everyone here's a
quick<00:01:04.439> look<00:01:04.920> at<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> concept<00:01:05.640> drawing<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
quick look at the concept drawing that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
quick look at the concept drawing that
originally<00:01:06.420> came<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.380> EDF

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
originally came up with for this EDF

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.859 
originally came up with for this EDF
plane<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.909> has<00:01:09.030> been<00:01:09.180> rebuilt<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> foam

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
plane this has been rebuilt that a foam

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.200 
plane this has been rebuilt that a foam
board<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> did<00:01:10.619> mention<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
board like I did mention but I kind of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
board like I did mention but I kind of
wanted<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.479> try<00:01:12.689> something<00:01:12.960> different<00:01:13.070> I'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
wanted to try something different I'm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.990 
wanted to try something different I'm
not<00:01:14.189> totally<00:01:14.369> sure<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
not totally sure if this is going to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060 
not totally sure if this is going to
work<00:01:15.030> yet<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.170> basically<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
work yet or not but basically this is a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.510 
work yet or not but basically this is a
kind<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> lifting<00:01:18.360> body<00:01:18.390> type<00:01:18.840> design<00:01:19.520> got

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
kind of a lifting body type design got

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
kind of a lifting body type design got
the<00:01:20.640> fatter<00:01:20.880> nose<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.420> front<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.380> not

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the fatter nose up front and this is not

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.190 
the fatter nose up front and this is not
gonna<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> flat<00:01:23.159> foam<00:01:23.759> board<00:01:24.030> plane<00:01:24.869> I'm

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
gonna be a flat foam board plane I'm

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
gonna be a flat foam board plane I'm
actually<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.830> using<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.430> top<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
actually going to be using a top and a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.090 
actually going to be using a top and a
bottom<00:01:27.390> layer<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> foam<00:01:28.259> board<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.979> going

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
bottom layer a foam board and I'm going

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
bottom layer a foam board and I'm going
to<00:01:29.130> try<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.490> make<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:29.970> shape<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.720> an

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to try and make it more shape like an

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.280 
to try and make it more shape like an
actual<00:01:31.229> airfoil<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> we'll<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
actual airfoil so we'll see how this

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
actual airfoil so we'll see how this
comes<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.979> let's<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.520> into<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> build

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
comes out so let's get into the build

00:01:36.000 --> 00:02:33.850 
comes out so let's get into the build
and<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:36.869> I'll<00:01:37.020> win

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.260 

okay<00:02:34.860> guys<00:02:35.070> here's<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.700> look<00:02:35.850> at<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> plane

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
okay guys here's a look at the plane

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.350 
okay guys here's a look at the plane
I've<00:02:36.450> got<00:02:36.600> about<00:02:36.810> 99%<00:02:37.440> done<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.610> only<00:02:38.910> got<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.150> few

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
I've got about 99% done I only got a few

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
I've got about 99% done I only got a few
minor<00:02:39.570> things<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.080> I'd<00:02:40.380> set<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> put<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
minor things to do I'd set to put the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.710 
minor things to do I'd set to put the
magnets<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.550> canopy<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.060> hold<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.330> down

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
magnets on the canopy to hold it down

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.020 
magnets on the canopy to hold it down
and<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.590> may<00:02:43.830> or<00:02:44.040> may<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.190> put<00:02:44.550> some<00:02:44.670> landing

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
and I may or may not put some landing

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.820 
and I may or may not put some landing
gear<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.600> I'm<00:02:45.690> deciding<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.290> how<00:02:46.680> I'm

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
gear on it and I'm deciding on how I'm

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.330 
gear on it and I'm deciding on how I'm
gonna<00:02:46.980> actually<00:02:47.700> take<00:02:48.239> off<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.630> plane

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
gonna actually take off of this plane

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.289 
gonna actually take off of this plane
basically<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.459> was<00:02:50.519> actually<00:02:51.000> pretty<00:02:51.180> happy

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
basically I was actually pretty happy

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.449 
basically I was actually pretty happy
with<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.750> way<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.900> came<00:02:52.080> out<00:02:52.220> I'm<00:02:53.220> really

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
with the way it came out I'm really

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.600 
with the way it came out I'm really
happy<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.940> way<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> wing<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.690> airfoil

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
happy with the way the wing and airfoil

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.550 
happy with the way the wing and airfoil
came<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:56.970> got<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.120> nice<00:02:57.330> kind<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.320> shape

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
came out it's got a nice kind of shape

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.960 
came out it's got a nice kind of shape
to<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.280> actually<00:02:59.489> like<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> regular

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
to it and it's actually like a regular

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
to it and it's actually like a regular
airfoil<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:02.420> did<00:03:03.420> probably<00:03:03.870> need<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.080> put<00:03:04.260> one

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
airfoil I did probably need to put one

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.640 
airfoil I did probably need to put one
other<00:03:05.269> bulkhead<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> wing<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:07.290> not<00:03:07.500> as

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
other bulkhead in the wing it's not as

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.590 
other bulkhead in the wing it's not as
rigid<00:03:07.860> as<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.310> wanted<00:03:08.610> but<00:03:08.850> we're<00:03:09.299> gonna<00:03:09.390> try

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
rigid as I wanted but we're gonna try

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.590 
rigid as I wanted but we're gonna try
run<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.170> see<00:03:10.230> what<00:03:10.500> happens<00:03:10.799> as<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.600> but

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
run it and see what happens as it is but

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.940 
run it and see what happens as it is but
basically<00:03:12.930> that's<00:03:13.080> first<00:03:13.380> glimpse<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.769> that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
basically that's first glimpse is that

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.490 
basically that's first glimpse is that
it<00:03:14.330> okay<00:03:15.330> as<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.600> mentioned<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:15.959> not<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.350> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
it okay as I mentioned I do not have the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.440 
it okay as I mentioned I do not have the
Magnus<00:03:16.799> yet<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.190> canopy<00:03:17.580> it's<00:03:18.299> just

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Magnus yet on the canopy it's just

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.150 
Magnus yet on the canopy it's just
sitting<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.720> there<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.709> basically<00:03:19.950> that's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
sitting on there but basically that's

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.610 
sitting on there but basically that's
where<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> battery's<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.440> all<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
where the battery's going to go all the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.570 
where the battery's going to go all the
wires<00:03:22.799> pretty<00:03:23.100> much<00:03:23.250> tuck<00:03:23.459> underneath<00:03:24.290> so

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
wires pretty much tuck underneath so

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.780 
wires pretty much tuck underneath so
pull<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.670> out<00:03:26.850> here<00:03:27.709> okay<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.640> wires

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
pull this out here okay so all the wires

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.880 
pull this out here okay so all the wires
are<00:03:29.880> going<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.090> go<00:03:30.209> totally<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.870> inside<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.830> it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
are going to go totally on inside so it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.350 
are going to go totally on inside so it
makes<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.549> nice<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.700> clean<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.820> ESC<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:36.000> also

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
makes it nice and clean the ESC is also

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.390 
makes it nice and clean the ESC is also
underneath<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.019> top<00:03:37.200> layer<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:38.010> between<00:03:38.070> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
underneath the top layer in between the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.030 
underneath the top layer in between the
two<00:03:38.580> layers<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:40.019> top<00:03:40.230> bottom<00:03:40.620> foam<00:03:40.799> board

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
two layers of the top bottom foam board

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.830 
two layers of the top bottom foam board
pieces<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:42.030> it's<00:03:42.180> kind<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.360> tucked<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.690> there

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
pieces so it's kind of tucked in there

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.870 
pieces so it's kind of tucked in there
hopefully<00:03:43.110> get<00:03:43.380> some<00:03:43.530> air<00:03:43.769> from<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.579> section

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
hopefully get some air from the section

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.280 
hopefully get some air from the section
of<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> EDF<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:47.459> that's<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:48.079> get<00:03:49.079> all<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
of the EDF so that's that get all the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
of the EDF so that's that get all the
servos<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.650> everything's<00:03:50.549> ready<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.820> go<00:03:50.910> so

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
servos in everything's ready to go so

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.199 
servos in everything's ready to go so
basically<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.549> probably<00:03:53.730> would<00:03:53.910> get<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> chance

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
basically I probably would get a chance

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.089 
basically I probably would get a chance
to<00:03:54.360> fly<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.599> until<00:03:54.989> next<00:03:55.110> weekend<00:03:55.620> or<00:03:55.800> this

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
to fly this until next weekend or this

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.530 
to fly this until next weekend or this
coming<00:03:56.310> weekend<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.640> mean<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.120> hopefully<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.510> can

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
coming weekend I mean so hopefully I can

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.990 
coming weekend I mean so hopefully I can
get<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.750> done<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.260> posted<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.310> part<00:03:59.550> two

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
get it done and I posted as a part two

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.050 
get it done and I posted as a part two
this<00:04:00.420> jet<00:04:00.860> ok<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.010> EVF<00:04:02.340> unit<00:04:02.610> on<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.880> plane

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
this jet ok the EVF unit on this plane

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.420 
this jet ok the EVF unit on this plane
is<00:04:03.210> a<00:04:03.240> hobbyking<00:04:03.750> EDF<00:04:04.160> basically<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
is a hobbyking EDF basically it's the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.820 
is a hobbyking EDF basically it's the
type<00:04:05.730> 'text<00:04:06.030> kind<00:04:06.210> of<00:04:06.270> in<00:04:06.660> reverse<00:04:06.960> mode<00:04:07.260> it's

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
type 'text kind of in reverse mode it's

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.100 
type 'text kind of in reverse mode it's
got<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.070> motor<00:04:08.280> up<00:04:08.460> front<00:04:08.790> with<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.780> fan<00:04:09.930> at

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
got the motor up front with the fan at

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.260 
got the motor up front with the fan at
the<00:04:10.200> back<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.620> EDF<00:04:11.000> hopefully<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.150> will

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
the back of the EDF hopefully this will

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.880 
the back of the EDF hopefully this will
keep<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.840> motor<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.110> little<00:04:13.350> cooler<00:04:13.530> since<00:04:13.740> is

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
keep the motor a little cooler since is

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.080 
keep the motor a little cooler since is
up<00:04:14.010> front<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.550> actually<00:04:14.820> supposed<00:04:14.970> to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
up front and it's actually supposed to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.740 
up front and it's actually supposed to
be<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.290> better<00:04:16.290> more<00:04:16.500> efficient<00:04:17.010> EDF<00:04:17.760> design<00:04:18.269> so

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
be a better more efficient EDF design so

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.970 
be a better more efficient EDF design so
we'll<00:04:18.900> give<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.140> try<00:04:19.260> hopefully<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:19.859> going

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
we'll give it a try hopefully just going

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.890 
we'll give it a try hopefully just going
to<00:04:20.040> put<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.280> enough<00:04:20.459> power<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.480> plane<00:04:21.750> is

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
to put out enough power on this plane is

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.480 
to put out enough power on this plane is
a<00:04:21.930> little<00:04:22.200> bit<00:04:22.290> heavier<00:04:22.530> now<00:04:22.680> yeah<00:04:22.950> originally

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
a little bit heavier now yeah originally

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.360 
a little bit heavier now yeah originally
anticipated<00:04:23.690> it's<00:04:24.690> uh<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:25.230> 20<00:04:25.620> ounces<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
anticipated it's uh over 20 ounces so I

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.520 
anticipated it's uh over 20 ounces so I
hope<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.850> ETF<00:04:27.360> puts<00:04:27.570> out<00:04:27.660> enough<00:04:27.750> juice<00:04:28.500> to

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
hope that ETF puts out enough juice to

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.850 
hope that ETF puts out enough juice to
get<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.700> flying<00:04:30.290> okay<00:04:31.290> I'm<00:04:31.380> gonna<00:04:31.530> see

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
get this in flying okay I'm gonna see

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.770 
get this in flying okay I'm gonna see

vertical<00:04:44.520> stabilizers<00:04:45.210> as<00:04:45.390> you<00:04:45.480> see<00:04:45.630> from<00:04:45.780> the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
vertical stabilizers as you see from the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.200 
vertical stabilizers as you see from the
top<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:47.010> two<00:04:47.160> on<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.340> edges<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.030> wings

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
top the two on the edges of the wings

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.240 
top the two on the edges of the wings
they<00:04:48.390> do<00:04:48.450> drop<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.840> little<00:04:49.140> bit<00:04:49.260> below<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:50.070> main

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
they do drop a little bit below the main

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.950 
they do drop a little bit below the main
wing<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:51.500> don't<00:04:52.500> even<00:04:52.590> see<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.890> here<00:04:53.330> but<00:04:54.330> uh<00:04:54.390> you

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
wing I don't even see it here but uh you

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.170 
wing I don't even see it here but uh you
can<00:04:55.110> kind<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.620> see<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.950> airfoil<00:04:56.430> shape<00:04:56.730> it's

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
can kind of see the airfoil shape it's

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.140 
can kind of see the airfoil shape it's
definitely<00:04:57.570> not<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.720> flat<00:04:58.760> piece<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.940> foamboard

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
definitely not a flat piece of foamboard

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.270 
definitely not a flat piece of foamboard
so<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.020> kind<00:05:01.290> of<00:05:01.380> angled<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.890> front<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.220> the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
so I kind of angled the front of the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.340 
so I kind of angled the front of the
wing<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.580> then<00:05:02.669> bent<00:05:03.030> down<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.480> around<00:05:03.930> to

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
wing and then bent down and around to

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.990 
wing and then bent down and around to
give<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> airfoil<00:05:04.950> shape<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:05.850> hopefully

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
give it a airfoil shape so hopefully

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.790 
give it a airfoil shape so hopefully
that<00:05:06.210> Acree<00:05:06.419> a<00:05:06.450> little<00:05:06.660> more<00:05:06.780> lift<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.229> helped

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
that Acree a little more lift and helped

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
that Acree a little more lift and helped
me<00:05:07.860> out<00:05:07.890> with<00:05:08.040> this<00:05:08.130> extra<00:05:08.460> weight<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.640> the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
me out with this extra weight of the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.969 
me out with this extra weight of the
plane<00:05:10.190> now<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.220> went<00:05:11.430> with<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.669> US<00:05:11.910> air<00:05:12.270> force

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
plane now I went with the US air force

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.530 
plane now I went with the US air force
paint<00:05:13.979> scheme<00:05:14.280> or<00:05:14.520> sticker<00:05:14.729> steam<00:05:15.000> what<00:05:15.479> are

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
paint scheme or sticker steam what are

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.230 
paint scheme or sticker steam what are
you<00:05:15.600> want<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.750> call<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:17.010> it's<00:05:17.550> basically

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
you want to call it and it's basically

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.280 
you want to call it and it's basically
got<00:05:18.390> a<00:05:18.450> red<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.020> black<00:05:19.890> on<00:05:20.250> top<00:05:21.229> here's<00:05:22.229> a

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
got a red and black on top here's a

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.450 
got a red and black on top here's a
quick<00:05:22.470> look<00:05:22.650> at<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.800> bottom<00:05:23.100> side<00:05:23.280> of<00:05:23.400> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
quick look at the bottom side of the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.870 
quick look at the bottom side of the
plane

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
plane

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.670 
plane
as<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.450> can<00:05:24.540> see<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.780> EDF<00:05:25.080> here<00:05:25.229> is<00:05:25.410> also

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
as you can see the EDF here is also

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.560 
as you can see the EDF here is also
exposed<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:26.280> on<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.430> bottom<00:05:26.610> hopefully

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
exposed so on the bottom hopefully

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.090 
exposed so on the bottom hopefully
that'll<00:05:27.690> allow<00:05:27.900> enough<00:05:28.229> air<00:05:28.440> to<00:05:28.620> get<00:05:28.740> into<00:05:28.979> it

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
that'll allow enough air to get into it

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.300 
that'll allow enough air to get into it
and<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.729> did<00:05:29.970> create<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.570> thrust<00:05:31.260> cone<00:05:31.500> basically

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
and I did create a thrust cone basically

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.430 
and I did create a thrust cone basically

kind of a bright orange that kind of

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.790 
kind of a bright orange that kind of
should<00:05:39.780> give<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.080> cool<00:05:40.260> accent<00:05:40.710> on<00:05:40.919> a<00:05:40.950> spline

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
should give it a cool accent on a spline

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.060 
should give it a cool accent on a spline
like<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:43.979> have<00:05:44.250> slots<00:05:44.729> cut<00:05:44.970> out<00:05:45.090> for<00:05:46.070> the

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
like you have slots cut out for the

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.580 
like you have slots cut out for the
landing<00:05:47.400> here<00:05:47.550> if<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:47.729> decided<00:05:48.030> to<00:05:48.120> go<00:05:48.210> with<00:05:48.240> it

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
landing here if I decided to go with it

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.110 
landing here if I decided to go with it
I'm<00:05:49.590> just<00:05:49.800> I'm<00:05:50.130> not<00:05:50.190> totally<00:05:50.700> sure<00:05:50.760> if<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:50.970> want

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
I'm just I'm not totally sure if I want

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.969 
I'm just I'm not totally sure if I want
to<00:05:51.180> do<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.390> probably<00:05:51.690> will<00:05:52.020> so<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:52.740> can<00:05:52.860> get

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
to do it I probably will so I can get

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.480 
to do it I probably will so I can get
some<00:05:53.190> ground<00:05:53.970> speed<00:05:54.270> up<00:05:54.450> before<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:54.840> take<00:05:54.930> off

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
some ground speed up before I take off

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.469 
some ground speed up before I take off
because<00:05:56.490> EDF<00:05:56.880> usually<00:05:57.120> don't<00:05:57.270> put<00:05:57.360> out<00:05:57.450> a

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
because EDF usually don't put out a

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.900 
because EDF usually don't put out a
whole<00:05:57.720> lot<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.020> thrust<00:05:58.200> right<00:05:58.410> off<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.620> bat<00:05:58.910> so

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
whole lot of thrust right off the bat so

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.310 
whole lot of thrust right off the bat so
let<00:06:00.030> me<00:06:00.120> put<00:06:00.479> the<00:06:00.570> landing<00:06:00.840> gear<00:06:00.990> in<00:06:01.140> and<00:06:01.260> I'll

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
let me put the landing gear in and I'll

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
let me put the landing gear in and I'll
show<00:06:01.470> you<00:06:01.560> kind<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.770> how<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:01.950> looks<00:06:02.130> with<00:06:02.310> that

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
show you kind of how it looks with that

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.310 
show you kind of how it looks with that
okay<00:06:03.270> guys<00:06:03.450> here's<00:06:03.660> a<00:06:03.720> look<00:06:03.870> at<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:03.990> landing

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
okay guys here's a look at the landing

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.890 
okay guys here's a look at the landing
gear<00:06:04.530> that<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:04.830> put<00:06:05.010> on<00:06:05.070> a<00:06:05.100> plane<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:06.030> probably<00:06:06.690> am

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
gear that I put on a plane I probably am

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.150 
gear that I put on a plane I probably am
going<00:06:07.080> to<00:06:07.140> do<00:06:07.260> that<00:06:07.410> I<00:06:07.440> think<00:06:07.710> on<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:07.890> initial

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
going to do that I think on the initial

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.290 
going to do that I think on the initial
flight<00:06:08.340> I'm<00:06:08.490> probably<00:06:08.669> gonna<00:06:08.849> use<00:06:08.970> landing

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
flight I'm probably gonna use landing

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.690 
flight I'm probably gonna use landing
gear<00:06:09.510> this<00:06:10.470> landing<00:06:10.770> gear<00:06:10.919> I<00:06:10.950> got<00:06:11.190> off<00:06:11.400> of<00:06:11.580> one

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
gear this landing gear I got off of one

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.830 
gear this landing gear I got off of one
of<00:06:11.729> the<00:06:11.880> mini

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
of the mini

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.379 
of the mini
yes<00:06:12.990> I<00:06:13.139> had<00:06:13.380> it<00:06:13.650> was<00:06:14.070> from<00:06:14.340> what<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.120> heck<00:06:15.240> was

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
yes I had it was from what the heck was

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.210 
yes I had it was from what the heck was
that<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.660> was<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.870> mini<00:06:16.290> f18<00:06:16.860> that<00:06:17.010> I<00:06:17.040> have

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
that it was the mini f18 that I have

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.189 
that it was the mini f18 that I have
from<00:06:17.400> hobbyking<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.090> didn't<00:06:18.660> use<00:06:18.780> them<00:06:18.930> on<00:06:19.020> that

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
from hobbyking I didn't use them on that

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.560 
from hobbyking I didn't use them on that
so<00:06:19.440> I<00:06:19.470> had<00:06:19.770> them<00:06:19.830> left<00:06:20.010> over<00:06:20.310> I<00:06:20.490> did<00:06:21.120> have<00:06:21.389> to

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
so I had them left over I did have to

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.180 
so I had them left over I did have to
bend<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:22.139> landing<00:06:22.590> gear<00:06:22.710> low<00:06:22.860> to<00:06:22.919> get<00:06:23.100> the

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
bend the landing gear low to get the

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.860 
bend the landing gear low to get the
back<00:06:23.370> end<00:06:23.400> to<00:06:23.729> sit<00:06:23.910> down<00:06:24.000> otherwise<00:06:24.479> the<00:06:24.690> nose

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
back end to sit down otherwise the nose

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.280 
back end to sit down otherwise the nose
would<00:06:25.020> be<00:06:25.169> lower<00:06:25.410> than<00:06:26.160> the<00:06:26.340> back<00:06:26.660> so<00:06:27.660> I<00:06:27.690> still

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
would be lower than the back so I still

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.780 
would be lower than the back so I still
got<00:06:28.350> to<00:06:28.470> probably<00:06:28.620> realign<00:06:29.340> them<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:29.580> little

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
got to probably realign them a little

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.100 
got to probably realign them a little
bit<00:06:29.910> better<00:06:30.090> to<00:06:30.570> make<00:06:30.690> sure<00:06:30.810> it<00:06:30.900> goes<00:06:31.020> straight

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
bit better to make sure it goes straight

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.320 
bit better to make sure it goes straight
this<00:06:31.560> isn't<00:06:31.919> it's<00:06:32.460> terrible<00:06:32.850> front<00:06:33.060> landing

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
this isn't it's terrible front landing

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.700 
this isn't it's terrible front landing
gear<00:06:33.540> so<00:06:33.840> I<00:06:33.870> got<00:06:34.139> to<00:06:34.229> make<00:06:34.320> sure<00:06:34.380> it's<00:06:34.620> as

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
gear so I got to make sure it's as

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.950 
gear so I got to make sure it's as
straight<00:06:34.919> as<00:06:34.979> possible<00:06:35.600> so<00:06:36.600> I<00:06:36.630> can<00:06:36.780> get<00:06:36.870> up

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
straight as possible so I can get up

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.530 
straight as possible so I can get up
nice<00:06:37.169> straight<00:06:37.470> run<00:06:37.650> on<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:37.889> takeoff<00:06:38.540> okay

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
nice straight run on the takeoff okay

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.730 
nice straight run on the takeoff okay
everyone<00:06:39.810> that'll<00:06:40.110> pretty<00:06:40.260> much<00:06:40.350> finished<00:06:40.650> up

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
everyone that'll pretty much finished up

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.840 
everyone that'll pretty much finished up
looking<00:06:40.949> at<00:06:41.040> the<00:06:41.130> plane<00:06:41.340> that<00:06:41.520> I<00:06:41.550> have<00:06:41.699> for

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
looking at the plane that I have for

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.730 
looking at the plane that I have for
Jake's<00:06:42.060> EDF<00:06:42.419> challenge<00:06:42.840> hope<00:06:43.290> you<00:06:43.380> guys<00:06:43.500> like

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
the plane and I hope that it turns out

the plane and I hope that it turns out
the<00:06:46.470> fly<00:06:46.650> good<00:06:46.919> hopefully<00:06:47.190> it's<00:06:47.430> not<00:06:47.550> a<00:06:47.610> total

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
the fly good hopefully it's not a total

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.350 
the fly good hopefully it's not a total

when I get out to the airfield and try
to<00:06:50.340> fly<00:06:50.580> it<00:06:50.630> but<00:06:51.630> basically<00:06:51.720> this<00:06:51.990> is<00:06:52.139> the

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
to fly it but basically this is the
