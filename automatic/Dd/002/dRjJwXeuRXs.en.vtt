00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.670
 summer episode of dinners and blood 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.319
 me because there is a back there 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.059
 air conditioner so we heard the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.460
 background noise in these is that in 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.000
 because it's hot and I don't want to die of 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.280
 hot 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.849
 then let's start immediately and how many questions 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.849
 of this week 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.650
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:36.190
 closes in the sunday we start today with the 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.910
 informatic videos application writing 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.890
 hello andrea no rumor on the new ipads 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.250
 at the moment, nothing is known at the moment 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.000
 more only we know that apple seems 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.710
 be more careful on the new ipad mini 4 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.160
 that could have the same 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.230
 features of ipad 2 or almost 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.270
 while the ipad and 3 are not mentioned 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.420
 practically nothing about ipad cross though 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.800
 he always speaks very little, no one knows if 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.449
 in the end this and goes to process or 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.940
 still less we still have this doubt 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.500
 in October we will know more 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.020
 because in October they will be presented 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.820
 almost certainly the new ipad dragon rom 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.250
 what a soul apple knows of the existence of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.770
 site and channel of and with italy then 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.290
 apple surely knows of existence 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.990
 of the channel for more than one reason we have 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.729
 evidence about it but above all us 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 we are in touch like so many other sites 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.340
 so with the apple press office 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.220
 the apple press office knows itself 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 great but i think apple too 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.119
 central know us for a matter 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.010
 that interested us in the past and yes 15 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.080
 they undoubtedly know Francis 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.790
 super cool 6 with we know if it will be the same 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.560
 we hypothesize from with iphone si buckets 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.850
 could say they have 6 I know maybe 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.090
 the processor will change those things by 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.409
 never strangely will be equal no apple has 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.850
 always tried to avoid this 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.670
 problem otherwise I could sell a 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 iphone 6 as a 6 if many do not 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.420
 instead they would always know they are there 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.700
 been some differences between the models s and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.119
 the models without age for example the 3g e 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.060
 3gs were identical but 3gs had on 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.119
 backside the inscription iphone 3gs 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.459
 all brands in 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.610
 let's say like the current ones like this 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.180
 shimmering while on 3g they were not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.739
 sorry they weren't shiny but they were 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.900
 let's say a color and dish I don't know how 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.000
 say the different however the writing 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.709
 iphone 4 iphone 4s had like 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.140
 differences to the bands here 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.299
 iphone 4s had one two three and four 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.239
 and with four I know that only two are left 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.730
 plus one above here exactly yes then 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.510
 were three black bands on the frame for 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.950
 the 4 against 4 for the 4s iphone 5 5s 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.170
 choice you have those differences 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.209
 iphone 6 consent according to me there will be 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.609
 some similar differences such as gods 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.959
 volume keys redesigned or not 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.790
 I know what some difference though 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.650
 surely there will be just to avoid 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.019
 that may be iphone confusion 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.239
 seco is not a director of fabio patimo 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.159
 tunis according to the iphone 5 se with ios 9 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.280
 it will be fine not just giving a second 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.489
 I'm sure because iphone 5 if 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.170
 it holds ios 9 almost as well as it does 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.720
 holds up well iphone 6 so you're on 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.840
 absolutely quiet iphone 6 iphone 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.970
 5 s with ios 9 really will be will be a 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.440
 great update not the performances 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.849
 in fact they may fall 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.400
 some improvement both in fluidity 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.169
 both of battery alessio of cig occhioni 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.139
 andrea believe that apple watch 2 will have a 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.579
 headphone jack and / or camera 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.319
 then the headphone jack please 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.970
 no, imagine yourself going with the 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.489
 earpiece here in the ear than if 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.950
 move the arm off that is 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.640
 a thing that unfortunately I tried with 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.300
 the sixth-generation ipod nano that 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.910
 I used to watch and it was very uncomfortable 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.739
 boys was really uncomfortable then the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.060
 I really don't think jack will wear it 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.360
 also because inserting a jack 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.060
 it would reduce the resistance 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.760
 with the contact of apple liquids 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.050
 watch while the camera does 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.730
 probably but one speaks of one 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.190
 end facetime camera a camera 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.640
 front put on the front of the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.290
 watch to make video calls that you can 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.930
 also make sense is not something that 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.519
 maybe you will change your life because you see 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.579
 a small little person are tabs 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.380
 a small child is not great though 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.239
 that could be a camera 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.919
 let's say to take pictures I see myself less 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.359
 plausible and just an application 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.460
 camera even if apple watch does not 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.870
 i think alex masterson will come andria 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.820
 I would like to know if on an ios device 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.320
 puts off the jailbreak ne many times 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.910
 performance could be affected and 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.620
 especially the battery gets worse like 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.960
 often happens on android when you 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.860
 often changes Roma 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.689
 no no basically nothing changes 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.129
 battery deterioration can 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.750
 maybe due to a major 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.689
 battery expenditure in December 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.629
 therefore a reduction in cycles cycles 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.039
 top-up which will then take you to have 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.039
 let's say a battery that ages first 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.650
 which therefore will last less with the passing 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.669
 of the time but not from the point of view 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.810
 performance does not change 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.180
 absolutely nothing I tell you 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.199
 sleep soundly no no no camp 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.490
 it shouldn't have to change 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.080
 very important even if you are every day 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.759
 to remove and put the of the break but 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.439
 just keep the next iphone in your opinion 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.879
 it will be waterproof we have it 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.860
 talked so much about waterproofing in the 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.259
 last three months according to me no it will not be 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.770
 will not be a nurse of 6 s never perhaps the 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.529
 7 but maybe 6 and if I don't think so 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.729
 berta in apple watch the feedback action 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.650
 what a distinctive attic is not used for 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.810
 very clear by default it is disabled 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.310
 you need it practically if I didn't understand it 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.199
 because it is actually not a function 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.699
 pretty clear when we receive one 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.889
 notification how it got into this 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.020
 moment if I feel my wrist down 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:41.129
 first vibrate for a second then when 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.750
 raise the notification and reproduced yellow and 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.930
 among other things there should be a 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.210
 distinctive haptic feedback ie between a 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.610
 message and a reminder notification 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.710
 on the pos the vibration is slightly 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.210
 different this is the distinction but 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.310
 above all the fact is that the notification 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.690
 arrives slightly before to make us 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.699
 understand that a notification has arrived and then 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.819
 raise your wrist when in reality the 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.169
 notification is displayed on the watch 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:07.110
 cones jean michaelle I can upgrade 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:10.080
 an iphone 4s with ios 6 ad ios 7 pur 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.449
 since ios 8 no because all the 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.539
 ios 7 versions also many all 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.279
 pretty much in between 8.4 ASP 8 years 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.229
 the signatures blocked therefore in the moment in 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:23.819
 which you also download an update to 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.740
 iphone 4s firmware with ios 7.1.2 ad 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:29.339
 example and you go to install it on yours 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.800
 iphone 4s the moment you do this 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:33.180
 the phone will almost give you iTunes 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.279
 an error says it can't install 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.960
 that movie because it checks with i 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.909
 apple server has failed and so no not 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.379
 you can do game power in hi 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:42.000
 andrea you could make a video where to do 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.099
 see how to remove silvio or 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.100
 could you explain anything more to me 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:48.650
 simple you simply need to do a 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.210
 trissino in the device not from the 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.340
 device itself 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.290
 but through itunes maybe doing so 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.290
 starting the indexes are all the guides 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.180
 to do it on iphoneitalia.com remove 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.100
 every stage every trace of the jailbreak 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.810
 including cydia so all the tweaks is 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.820
 installed christine throws a version 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.490
 punished by ios and it is as if the jailbreak 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.950
 I never did it well guys 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.570
 so this more and I end up here 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.780
 now i think i'm going to throw overboard 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.250
 because but a hot dog less bad 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.980
 precisely for the air conditioning but if 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.170
 look at the overtime you see the sun 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.780
 burning to the skins of us beings 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.880
 therefore common mortals of southern Italy 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.800
 I'm going to throw myself into the water a good end to 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.390
 Sunday indeed indeed if I do 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.950
 jet in the water I threw myself into the water 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.580
 this morning compared to you who have 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.010
 seen the video 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.750
 this evening good end of good Sunday 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.350
 start of week and good bath to me 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.350
 Hello
