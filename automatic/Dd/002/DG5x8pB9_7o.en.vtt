one the curveball grip is very much the

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.120 
one the curveball grip is very much the
same<00:00:09.330> though<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.380> thumb<00:00:10.559> may<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.769> held<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
little further under the ball but the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.230 
little further under the ball but the
release<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> curveball<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.730> entirely

which with a quick break of the wrist

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.710 
which with a quick break of the wrist

both<00:00:35.309> when<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.579> bring<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> pitching<00:00:36.329> arm

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
both when you bring the pitching arm

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.970 
both when you bring the pitching arm
backward<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:38.270> forward<00:00:39.440> give<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> swing

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
backward and forward give you a swing

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.729 
backward and forward give you a swing
motion<00:00:41.219> which<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.670> bring<00:00:41.850> more<00:00:42.120> flexibility

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.130 

wrist<00:00:51.399> action<00:00:51.790> is<00:00:51.879> extremely<00:00:52.510> important<00:00:53.020> for

wrist action is extremely important for
putting<00:00:53.410> speed<00:00:53.710> on<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.950> fastball<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:55.320> for

putting speed on the fastball and for

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.939 
putting speed on the fastball and for
getting<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.739> break<00:00:56.980> into<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.760> curveball<00:00:58.949> but

getting the break into the curveball but

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.860 
getting the break into the curveball but
work<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.399> just<00:01:00.699> as<00:01:00.970> important<00:01:01.510> as<00:01:01.629> any<00:01:01.750> other

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
work is just as important as any other
