00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
melting moments first we will need to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.209 
melting moments first we will need to
set<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.550> oven<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.030> 160<00:00:40.020> degrees<00:00:40.050> celsius<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
then at the bottle and some thermal like

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.200 
then at the bottle and some thermal like
strip<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.440> matter<00:00:46.649> ball<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.489> put

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
strip and just in the matter ball we put

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.779 
strip and just in the matter ball we put
in<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> dry<00:00:49.649> ingredients<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
in all of the dry ingredients so that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.029 
in all of the dry ingredients so that
will<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> flower<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.930> icing<00:00:52.410> sugar<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
will be the flower the icing sugar and

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
will be the flower the icing sugar and
the<00:00:53.250> carpet<00:00:53.789> powder<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.800> trying

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the carpet powder and we're just trying

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.849 
the carpet powder and we're just trying
to<00:00:56.340> mix<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.910> all<00:00:57.030> together<00:00:57.270> nicely<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.620> well

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to mix them all together nicely and well

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.039 
to mix them all together nicely and well
and<00:00:59.449> then<00:01:00.449> 48<00:01:01.109> them<00:01:01.609> into<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.969> prada<00:01:03.239> mixture

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
and then 48 them into the prada mixture

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.469 
and then 48 them into the prada mixture
and<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.830> mix<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> well<00:01:07.580> once<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.000> mixture<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and just mix it well once the mixture is

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.370 
and just mix it well once the mixture is
done<00:01:10.070> transfer<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.159> into<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.549> piping<00:01:12.180> bag<00:01:12.380> this

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
done transfer it into a piping bag this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.640 
done transfer it into a piping bag this
is<00:01:13.590> definitely<00:01:13.890> optional<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.110> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
is definitely optional but for me I like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980 
is definitely optional but for me I like
to<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.100> piping<00:01:17.640> bag<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.330> way<00:01:18.750> i<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to use piping bag so that way i can

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.980 
to use piping bag so that way i can
divide<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.920> dough<00:01:20.189> evenly<00:01:20.630> when<00:01:21.630> i'm<00:01:21.810> making

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
divide the dough evenly when i'm making

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.030 
divide the dough evenly when i'm making
the<00:01:22.439> dot<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.610> i<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.689> some<00:01:25.170> people<00:01:25.799> just

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the dot but i do know some people just

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.310 
the dot but i do know some people just
roll<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.549> door<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.390> flatten<00:01:27.900> them<00:01:28.049> by

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
roll the door and then flatten them by

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
roll the door and then flatten them by
the<00:01:28.380> end<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:30.509> baking<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the end of the baking so this is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
the end of the baking so this is
definitely<00:01:33.840> optional<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.799> guys<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
definitely optional for you guys and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.840 
definitely optional for you guys and
then<00:01:36.210> once<00:01:36.479> you're<00:01:36.810> done<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.409> i<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.520> use

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
then once you're done with it i just use

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
then once you're done with it i just use
the<00:01:39.090> back<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> fork<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the back of the fork to do that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.090 
the back of the fork to do that
signature<00:01:41.820> line<00:01:42.750> thing<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> melting

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
signature line thing for the melting

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.290 
signature line thing for the melting
moments

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
moments

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.560 
moments
and<00:01:45.620> then<00:01:46.620> we'll<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.790> bake<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.030> for

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and then we'll just have to bake it for

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.490 
and then we'll just have to bake it for
about<00:01:49.290> 15<00:01:50.160> minutes<00:01:50.960> once<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.200> baked

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
about 15 minutes once it's baked

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.040 
about 15 minutes once it's baked
properly<00:01:53.160> take<00:01:53.580> them<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:54.030> from<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.600> oven<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
properly take them out from the oven and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.560 
properly take them out from the oven and
we'll<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.520> wait<00:01:56.670> until<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.420> are

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
we'll just have to wait until they are

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.680 
we'll just have to wait until they are
properly<00:01:58.020> cooled<00:01:58.320> down<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:59.240> while<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.480> wait

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
properly cooled down now while we wait

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.070 
properly cooled down now while we wait
let's<00:02:01.290> make<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.890> icing<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.900> we<00:02:04.050> have

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
let's make the icing so here we have

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.370 
let's make the icing so here we have
butter<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:08.850> just<00:02:09.030> start<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.510> whisk<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
butter and I just start to whisk it and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.550 
butter and I just start to whisk it and
then<00:02:10.800> slowly<00:02:11.160> add<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.610> icing<00:02:12.030> sugar<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:13.170> top

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
then slowly add the icing sugar on top

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.810 
then slowly add the icing sugar on top
of<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.930> one<00:02:15.930> teaspoon<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:17.160> lemon<00:02:17.580> juice

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
of it and one teaspoon of lemon juice

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.340 
of it and one teaspoon of lemon juice
and<00:02:19.100> just<00:02:20.100> keep<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.790> wisdom<00:02:21.060> until<00:02:21.840> everything

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
and just keep on wisdom until everything

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.730 
and just keep on wisdom until everything
is<00:02:22.530> incorporated<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:25.080> transfer<00:02:25.380> it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
is incorporated and then transfer it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.370 
is incorporated and then transfer it
into<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.520> piping<00:02:27.030> bag<00:02:27.090> again<00:02:27.750> definitely

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
into a piping bag again definitely
