that<00:00:50.140> is<00:00:50.379> just<00:00:51.220> it's<00:00:51.610> just<00:00:51.699> like<00:00:51.940> any<00:00:52.180> line

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
that is just it's just like any line

that is just it's just like any line
through<00:00:52.720> bait<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:53.170> is<00:00:53.350> not<00:00:53.500> specifically<00:00:54.129> a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
line through this is a what would be

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.049 
line through this is a what would be
classified<00:00:56.769> I<00:00:56.920> guess<00:00:57.250> is<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.489> line<00:00:57.820> through

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
classified I guess is a line through

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.259 
classified I guess is a line through

belly you see that it's coming out that
belly<00:01:46.560> slit<00:01:47.000> okay<00:01:48.000> let<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.670> we've

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
belly slit okay let me get that we've

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.200 
belly slit okay let me get that we've
designed<00:01:51.090> an<00:01:51.420> insert<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.080> sits<00:01:52.650> inside<00:01:53.580> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
designed an insert that sits inside that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.730 
designed an insert that sits inside that
rubber<00:01:54.450> right<00:01:54.660> there<00:01:54.870> inside<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.230> plastic

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
rubber right there inside the plastic

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.120 
rubber right there inside the plastic
that<00:01:56.330> allows<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:58.200> protects<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> bait<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.010> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that allows it protects the bait and it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
that allows it protects the bait and it
actually<00:01:59.430> allows<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.850> hook<00:02:00.000> guy<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.180> travel

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
actually allows the hook guy to travel

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660 
actually allows the hook guy to travel
through<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> insert<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> hook<00:02:01.770> set<00:02:02.010> to

now<00:02:31.750> at<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.080> point<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.950> hook<00:02:33.130> eye<00:02:33.280> is

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
now at this point the hook eye is

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.400 
now at this point the hook eye is
resting<00:02:34.120> at<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.569> base<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.019> insert<00:02:35.380> you

the insert right here and push up and

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.250 
the insert right here and push up and
then<00:03:01.440> stead<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:02.829> that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
then stead of just like that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.530 
then stead of just like that
now<00:03:05.310> what<00:03:06.310> happens<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:06.910> hook<00:03:07.090> set<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.420> is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
now what happens on the hook set this is

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.600 
now what happens on the hook set this is
probably<00:03:07.750> my<00:03:07.870> favorite<00:03:07.900> part<00:03:08.260> is<00:03:08.709> when<00:03:09.280> is

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
probably my favorite part is when is

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.289 
probably my favorite part is when is
when<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:10.030> when<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.040> pull<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.220> hook<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.579> after

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
when you when you pull this hook I after

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.940 
when you when you pull this hook I after
when<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.540> pull<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.410> hook<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.739> going<00:03:14.860> to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
when you pull the hook I is going to

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.580 
when you pull the hook I is going to
come<00:03:15.099> through<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.549> that's<00:03:15.819> going<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.030> expose

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
come through and that's going to expose

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.349 
come through and that's going to expose
the<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.620> hook<00:03:17.950> point<00:03:18.220> right<00:03:18.400> there<00:03:18.430> plenty<00:03:19.239> of

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
the the hook point right there plenty of

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.509 
the the hook point right there plenty of
room<00:03:19.569> for<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:20.019> good<00:03:20.709> hook<00:03:20.920> set<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.310> you're<00:03:21.430> not

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
room for a good hook set so you're not

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.520 
room for a good hook set so you're not
going<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.760> lose<00:03:21.880> fish<00:03:22.239> what's<00:03:23.200> interesting

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.620 
going to lose fish what's interesting
about<00:03:23.799> these<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.430> what's<00:03:24.730> very<00:03:24.910> important<00:03:25.420> is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
about these and what's very important is

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.690 
about these and what's very important is
it's<00:03:26.260> not<00:03:26.470> going<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.799> require<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.430> big

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
it's not going to require that big

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.479 
it's not going to require that big
