00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
remove focus from the barbarians because

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.230

the<00:01:34.960> archer<00:01:35.230> tower<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.740> then<00:01:35.890> go<00:01:36.040> directly

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
the archer tower and then go directly

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.040 
the archer tower and then go directly
for<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.700> balloons<00:01:36.970> whereas<00:01:37.330> if<00:01:37.510> you<00:01:37.600> throw<00:01:37.870> in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
for the balloons whereas if you throw in

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.530 
for the balloons whereas if you throw in
archers<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.830> that<00:01:39.490> Archer<00:01:39.790> tower<00:01:40.030> then

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
archers on that Archer tower then

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.090 
archers on that Archer tower then
because<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.170> archers<00:01:41.470> are<00:01:41.590> attacking<00:01:41.920> the

because the archers are attacking the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.340 
because the archers are attacking the
archer<00:01:42.400> tower<00:01:42.610> then<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.360> remains<00:01:43.510> focused<00:01:43.930> on

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
archer tower then it remains focused on

balloon has time to go in and take the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.060 
balloon has time to go in and take the
base<00:01:48.160> so<00:01:48.700> that's<00:01:49.510> that's<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.230> I<00:01:50.260> know<00:01:50.410> I<00:01:50.500> even

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
base so that's that's it I know I even

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.070 
base so that's that's it I know I even
slowed<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.460> down<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.640> was<00:01:51.940> still<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.480> lot<00:01:53.050> to
