00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 What people call my minute cover art 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.010
 benny de boer networks meinberg too 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.260
 a new video here on a channel 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.269
 today my first look at two 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.769
 gameplay on the entire channel which 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.540
 what I have ever given 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 you have to have the game because 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.850
 I share a fan before the previous one 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 I'm not and I think that diana the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.109
 best are 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 and yes I have extremely healed players 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.510
 before 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 I was only for one at gamescom 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.990
 tags what he spontaneously there most 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.480
 spectators did not know anything about me 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 some of it though I am there so i 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 have met a lot of you very much 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.739
 very very very very very very many 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 and yes I was there and had the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.890
 possibility synonymous first thanks to the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.760
 community manager 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 markus the possibility of the game too 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.370
 play and record so many thanks 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 many thanks 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.699
 It was sooo happy because I thought 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.079
 at the same time has no chance 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.149
 normally it was no longer allowed 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.699
 but I still got the chance 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.710
 because I recognized him and I have her 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.090
 Call of duty fights picked up five 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.500
 piece I added the total 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 I will upload 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
 but you can see that there is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.439
 a problem with it and not a single one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.460
 game player full of sound and I would have 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.070
 times I was in the moment just like that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 fixed on the game and it was not 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.650
 on me is probably an elgato 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 does not bother the somehow plug 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.900
 was right 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.580
 and yes, he did not record anything 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.409
 a bit too bad i would have that downstairs 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.780
 guardian I am easy to see 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.340
 got up 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.979
 but I saw you and now it is 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.780
 stop without sound so sorry because I am 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.130
 a little bit because that's for me 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 I have to be very very important 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.409
 honest times say so and whatever 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.080
 I have the game played and to me 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.880
 a 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.110
 thing especially noticed and indeed 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.150
 you see her here this aptilo me 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.370
 love that well that's so damn 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.480
 horny so damn horny and his extreme 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.340
 noticed and when I think about it 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.190
 what maps I liked 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.230
 in complete cd and people asked what in 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.250
 the favorite fruit cod most say 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.060
 say most highlights hijack say 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.460
 most 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.750
 I say the side of the best maps has to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.010
 I honestly say that I'm so horny 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.900
 I find the map and so the maps geil 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.460
 As we've noticed, that's it 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.590
 are all three ways and that is how it is 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.970
 that both teams offered the other 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.709
 Genes have their sport and yes you can 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.180
 between 3 through the middle aisle 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.760
 go left and which one can go 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.380
 and then there are so small heights 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.020
 deep differences how can go up 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.630
 us a little something 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.400
 to provide variety so tories can 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.450
 do not speak at the moment I'm up 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.060
 Gestand just wanted to make a video 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.810
 I do not care if in case that 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.880
 a two way maps is such a way 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.780
 it is so the maps were really on you 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.360
 best were 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.860
 and I really think that's really cool 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.560
 that there are more like these maps 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.660
 high tech like this one this time 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.580
 an ultra big fun and then too 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.760
 medium also should moderate as 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.989
 be for me personally because yes you are 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.239
 stays were not so long or wait 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.370
 etc should be action packed somewhere 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.800
 its not how battlefield will be 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.430
 probably the reality what 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.209
 noted by is the storm it is 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.130
 will probably one or the other 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.780
 I do not know, I have big ones 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.489
 I almost all of a sudden I died 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.680
 not nearly all maps played 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.280
 I've played two three matches 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.120
 now all maps looked really good 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.070
 his team 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.070
 So it really is so much fun 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.140
 it is incredible what you do 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.360
 say to the game the weapons I would 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.670
 this falls on the balance so until of the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.700
 what I played so far that was 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.410
 no idea what was going on but the weapons 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.730
 are damn hurt now i have that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.370
 feel like I have such a kind of vector 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.460
 taken and the recall is the recoil 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.070
 so damn high 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.690
 In contrast, the economy in the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.240
 office medium high and there is so 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.530
 a kind ak here the game I will 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.660
 also play in the other game player 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.670
 should have been on it has one 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.370
 very little kickback can do what he does 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.320
 ok i wanted something to the ratings a2 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.520
 I often believe me for a long time 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.530
 it has been noticed that one can seem very 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.580
 very long because of it all the time 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.790
 I dont know 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.080
 then it can be very long and yes 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.790
 You can also see each other casually and 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.530
 because I have a very big disadvantage 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.420
 So for the people who think that 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.700
 see and think that's the way around on 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.110
 Of course, it's almost as much as about 2 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.030
 for that is 1000 times better 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.980
 I have to do that a lot too 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.020
 slower as well as black ops 2 just do it 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.940
 is so slow you see that that 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.380
 Gameplay is slow for me too 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.230
 about 2 face is slow when I think about it 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.060
 think 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.120
 and yes the game itself so much better 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.250
 as incredible as fun is me 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.500
 I do not want to say too much because I have 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.630
 now played about eight rounds because 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.950
 my first money at 37 5 which is pretty 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.360
 I had to be quite heavy 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.920
 honestly but I only have 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.810
 go press people I say played 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.600
 that means they were not like that now 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.050
 good and therefore could his 75th 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.610
 Afford 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.110
 Unfortunately I have to say that 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.150
 I could take the first light 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.849
 I said but I was in the wrong 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:14.719
 dom and the recording and sherman 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.800
 yes finally public is actually 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.449
 really not worse you pay 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.020
 I learned to choose for a long time 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:24.830
 most times just so ok on everyone 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.709
 ok boss says everything okay 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.119
 Do not worry I would gamble 

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.349
 but that this time all viktor first 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.539
 do not record the gameplay 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.770
 but that was my fourth gameplay was 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.080
 But I'm the same in the first song 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.159
 played games and then the day I was 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.569
 already ran on the gamescom and 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.119
 of course the call of duty manager and 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.740
 he says so and i said haye age can 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.499
 I record or has he then with 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.659
 the creator said yes 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:49.039
 Youth record and me totally the many 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.689
 thanks a lot thanks a lot 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.580
 I 'll be so happy at the moment 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:55.149
 Do not you believe my first game? 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.740
 now here on youtube at 10 25 10 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:59.479
 and yes I 'm content with that 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.529
 So that was a lot 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.389
 it does not sound like it annoys me 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.089
 personal but what should I 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.439
 make it too late because the beta off 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.050
 then you will have sound as well as he will 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.759
 can not breathe and know 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.949
 could speak no idea 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.360
 but I would imagine many are 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.990
 passers-by look if you liked 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.819
 he shows how to battle selection videos 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.060
 do not vocalize and subscribe 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.270
 I will not see you again 21 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.760
 they mean 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.660
 the 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.660
 Max 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.199
 and 10 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.199
 wag
