00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.490 
moisturizing and it's great it does feel
a<00:02:36.190> little<00:02:36.340> bit<00:02:36.670> drying<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.209> lips<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:38.380> it's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
a little bit drying on lips but it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.850 
a little bit drying on lips but it's
okay<00:02:39.040> because<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.580> think<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.000> if<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.290> want

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
okay because I think that if you want

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.620 
okay because I think that if you want
some<00:02:42.190> lipstick<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.060> gonna<00:02:43.420> stay

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
some lipstick that's gonna stay

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.420 
some lipstick that's gonna stay
throughout<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.170> day<00:02:44.380> then<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:45.160> sort<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.340> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
throughout the day then it's sort of a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.199 
throughout the day then it's sort of a
trade-off<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.299> have<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.630> make

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
trade-off that you have to make

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.179 
trade-off that you have to make
like<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.049> wanted<00:02:48.469> let's<00:02:48.769> take<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.040> day
