00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
Avast it has to do with tornado so

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.419 
Avast it has to do with tornado so

from any elementary here's is my was a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.370 
from any elementary here's is my was a
question<00:00:16.619> what<00:00:17.340> causes<00:00:17.820> tornadoes<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> has

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
question what causes tornadoes and has

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.750 
question what causes tornadoes and has
there<00:00:20.070> been<00:00:20.430> any<00:00:20.820> invoices<00:00:22.039> great<00:00:23.039> question

there been any invoices great question
there<00:00:23.910> Mitch<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.210> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.480> people<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.779> been

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
there Mitch a lot of people have been

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.300 
there Mitch a lot of people have been
asking<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.470> causes<00:00:25.890> tornado<00:00:26.220> doesn't

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
asking that what causes tornado doesn't

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.040 
asking that what causes tornado doesn't
have<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> vet<00:00:26.820> any<00:00:27.000> invoice<00:00:27.269> let's<00:00:27.660> first<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
have the vet any invoice let's first of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.750 
have the vet any invoice let's first of
all<00:00:28.140> take<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> look<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:28.650> does<00:00:29.039> cause<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
all take a look at what does cause a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.820 
all take a look at what does cause a
tornado<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.689> form<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.320> typically<00:00:31.590> what's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
tornado to form and typically what's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
tornado to form and typically what's
happening<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.279> took<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.489> long<00:00:32.669> time<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.450> really

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
happening it took a long time to really

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
happening it took a long time to really
understand<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> science<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
understand this and the science of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.950 
understand this and the science of
tornadoes<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.239> still<00:00:36.450> gathering<00:00:36.750> more

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
tornadoes was still gathering more

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.630 
tornadoes was still gathering more
information<00:00:37.140> we've<00:00:37.559> learned<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> lot<00:00:37.950> over<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
information we've learned a lot over the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459 
information we've learned a lot over the
last<00:00:38.670> 10<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.120> 15<00:00:39.239> years<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> all

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
last 10 to 15 years that we have and all

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.250 
last 10 to 15 years that we have and all
the<00:00:40.770> years<00:00:40.950> prior<00:00:41.309> than<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.930> mid-level<00:00:42.930> jets

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the years prior than that mid-level jets

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
the years prior than that mid-level jets
gene<00:00:43.500> causes<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> rolling<00:00:44.550> motion<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> air

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
gene causes a rolling motion in the air

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
gene causes a rolling motion in the air
basically<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.500> winds<00:00:46.770> gonna<00:00:47.039> call

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
basically to have as if winds gonna call

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.580 
basically to have as if winds gonna call
wind<00:00:47.670> shear<00:00:47.940> opposite<00:00:48.719> direction<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.410> speed

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
wind shear opposite direction or speed

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
wind shear opposite direction or speed
at<00:00:49.920> different<00:00:50.250> elevations<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.180> when

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
at different elevations you have when

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720 
at different elevations you have when
doing<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.410> causes<00:00:52.730> basically

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
doing this and so it causes basically

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.720 
doing this and so it causes basically
you<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.180> cylinder<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.199> ver<00:00:55.649> rotating<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you get this cylinder a ver rotating and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
you get this cylinder a ver rotating and
with<00:00:56.850> thunderstorms<00:00:57.210> everything<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> being

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
with thunderstorms everything is being

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
with thunderstorms everything is being
drawn<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:59.010> into<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.309> thunderstorm<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
drawn up into a thunderstorm so to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
drawn up into a thunderstorm so to
actually<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.750> rotated<00:01:01.320> column<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
actually get that rotated column of the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
actually get that rotated column of the
air<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:02.879> turn<00:01:03.180> vertical<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
air to then turn vertical now the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
air to then turn vertical now the
thunderstorm<00:01:05.250> starts<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> rotate<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.390> much

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
thunderstorm starts to rotate it much

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.910 
thunderstorm starts to rotate it much
like<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.110> water<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
like when you see water going down a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.460 
like when you see water going down a
sink<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.670> causes<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.299> funnel<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.990> form<00:01:10.290> here

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
sink it causes this funnel to form here

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
sink it causes this funnel to form here
so<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> storm<00:01:10.950> alters<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> plane<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
so the storm alters the plane of that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.969 
so the storm alters the plane of that
rotating<00:01:12.750> air<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.960> other<00:01:13.049> words<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.320> stands<00:01:13.830> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
rotating air in other words it stands it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.590 
rotating air in other words it stands it
up<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> tornado<00:01:15.450> will

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
up like this and then the tornado will

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
up like this and then the tornado will
then<00:01:15.720> drop<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> cloud<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
then drop out of the cloud here and you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
then drop out of the cloud here and you
don't<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.600> cloud<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> way

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
don't have to see this cloud all the way

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.660 
don't have to see this cloud all the way
down<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> ground<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> just

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
down to the ground here this is just

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.880 
down to the ground here this is just
condensed<00:01:21.290> basically<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> cloud<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.740> you've

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
condensed basically a cloud so you've

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
condensed basically a cloud so you've
got<00:01:22.920> water<00:01:23.280> vapor<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> times

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
got water vapor here but a lot of times

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.910 
got water vapor here but a lot of times
it's<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.659> column<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.080> air<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> see

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it's just a column of air you can see

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.160 
it's just a column of air you can see
dust<00:01:26.189> at<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> bottom<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.420> tornado<00:01:27.659> there

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
dust at the bottom of the tornado there

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
dust at the bottom of the tornado there
and<00:01:28.380> you're<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.799> necessarily<00:01:29.250> even<00:01:29.579> getting

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
and you're not necessarily even getting

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
and you're not necessarily even getting
what<00:01:30.270> appears<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> full<00:01:31.049> tornado<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
what appears to be a full tornado but it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
what appears to be a full tornado but it
is<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> peak<00:01:33.090> months<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
is there so here are the peak months of
