of<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.660> Bose<00:00:12.929> Bluetooth<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:14.250> think<00:00:15.240> that's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
of the Bose Bluetooth I think that's

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.060 
of the Bose Bluetooth I think that's
pretty<00:00:15.599> much<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.170> called<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.830> balls

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
pretty much what it's called the balls

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.170 
pretty much what it's called the balls
bluetooth<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:19.010> there<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.130> two<00:00:20.580> versions<00:00:20.880> of

this I believe there is series 1 in
series<00:00:24.330> 2<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.130> differences<00:00:26.130> between<00:00:26.279> series

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

1<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.119> series<00:00:27.150> 2<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> series<00:00:28.410> 1<00:00:28.680> only

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
