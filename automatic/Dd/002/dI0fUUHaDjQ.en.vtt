SEC<00:00:02.790> 300<00:00:03.920> I've<00:00:04.920> adjusted<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:06.710> right<00:00:07.710> here<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
SEC 300 I've adjusted this right here a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.600 
SEC 300 I've adjusted this right here a
couple<00:00:08.220> times<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:09.480> where<00:00:10.099> there's<00:00:11.099> tension<00:00:11.370> on

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
couple times so where there's tension on

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.200 
couple times so where there's tension on
the<00:00:11.820> lever<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> actuator<00:00:14.219> arm<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.849> it's

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
the lever and the actuator arm and it's

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.540 
the lever and the actuator arm and it's
the<00:00:15.360> stop<00:00:15.599> right<00:00:15.809> there<00:00:15.990> just<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.550> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the stop right there just like that and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.640 
the stop right there just like that and
I<00:00:17.640> still<00:00:17.850> get<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.090> annoying<00:00:18.900> annoying<00:00:19.410> power

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
I still get this annoying annoying power

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.830 
I still get this annoying annoying power
valve<00:00:19.859> rattle<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.369> deceleration<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.660> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
valve rattle on deceleration and it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.200 
valve rattle on deceleration and it
doesn't<00:00:22.199> really<00:00:22.350> sound<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:22.939> I'm<00:00:23.939> gonna<00:00:24.029> put

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
doesn't really sound like I'm gonna put

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
doesn't really sound like I'm gonna put
my<00:00:24.300> finger<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> cylinder<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:26.220> doesn't

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
my finger in the cylinder it doesn't

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.240 
my finger in the cylinder it doesn't
really<00:00:26.550> sound<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:28.010> that's<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> power

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
really sound like that that's the power

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.679 
really sound like that that's the power
valve<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.640> side<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> side<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.599> down

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
valve one side to side and up and down

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.350 
valve one side to side and up and down
rattling<00:00:31.109> around<00:00:32.180> there's<00:00:33.180> some

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
rattling around there's some

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.450 
rattling around there's some
side-to-side<00:00:33.630> play<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.200> take<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
side-to-side play I can take out what it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.389 
side-to-side play I can take out what it
did<00:00:35.670> sound<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.070> messing<00:00:38.280> with

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
did sound like was as I was messing with

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.270 
did sound like was as I was messing with
the<00:00:38.520> mechanism<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.059> Bell<00:00:39.360> crank<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the mechanism this Bell crank here and I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.959 
the mechanism this Bell crank here and I
hope<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.520> comes<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:44.040> Bell<00:00:44.370> crank<00:00:44.640> here

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
hope this comes out this Bell crank here

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660 
hope this comes out this Bell crank here
was<00:00:45.719> actually<00:00:46.020> hitting<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:47.100> inside<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
was actually hitting the inside of the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.290 
was actually hitting the inside of the
case<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.910> see<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
case right here and see if I can get a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.680 
case right here and see if I can get a
light<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:53.329> might<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.480> able<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> see

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.770 

so<00:01:02.410> let's<00:01:02.590> hitting<00:01:02.950> right<00:01:03.190> here<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.600> leaving

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
so let's hitting right here and leaving

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.490 
so let's hitting right here and leaving
a<00:01:04.930> mark<00:01:05.140> right<00:01:05.320> there<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.660> when<00:01:07.660> I<00:01:07.690> took<00:01:08.320> this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
a mark right there and when I took this

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.120 
a mark right there and when I took this
apart<00:01:08.860> took<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.520> off<00:01:09.729> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.650> move<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
apart took this off and then move the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.280 
apart took this off and then move the
bell<00:01:12.250> crank<00:01:12.490> up<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.760> down<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.900> sounds<00:01:14.110> like

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
bell crank up and down it sounds like

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.390 
bell crank up and down it sounds like
the<00:01:14.380> Bell<00:01:14.530> cranks<00:01:14.710> hitting<00:01:15.040> right<00:01:15.160> there<00:01:15.220> and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
the Bell cranks hitting right there and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.490 
the Bell cranks hitting right there and
that<00:01:15.490> sounds<00:01:15.729> like<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.970> exact<00:01:16.330> noise<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:17.380> my

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
that sounds like the exact noise that my

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.030 
that sounds like the exact noise that my
bike's<00:01:17.710> been<00:01:17.920> making<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.510> took<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.780> risk<00:01:20.040> took

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
bike's been making so I took a risk took

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.850 
bike's been making so I took a risk took
the<00:01:21.160> bell<00:01:21.310> cranked<00:01:21.520> off<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.960> can<00:01:23.080> see<00:01:23.290> it's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
the bell cranked off you can see it's

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.230 
the bell cranked off you can see it's
not<00:01:23.979> straight<00:01:24.340> anymore<00:01:24.369> there's<00:01:24.910> a<00:01:24.970> bend

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
not straight anymore there's a bend

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.600 
not straight anymore there's a bend
toward<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.750> back<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.140> bike<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.369> that<00:01:27.520> it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
toward the back of the bike so that it

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.990 
toward the back of the bike so that it
doesn't<00:01:27.880> hit<00:01:28.030> here<00:01:30.570> okay<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.700> there's<00:01:33.850> some

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
doesn't hit here okay so there's some

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.980 
doesn't hit here okay so there's some
space<00:01:34.210> right<00:01:34.300> there<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.820> I<00:01:37.149> just<00:01:37.600> put<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:37.930> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
space right there so I just put in the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.540 
space right there so I just put in the
vise<00:01:38.110> heated<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.800> put<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.070> little<00:01:39.220> bend<00:01:39.430> in

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
vise heated it and put a little bend in

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.969 
vise heated it and put a little bend in
it<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.990> keep<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.500> Bell<00:01:41.649> crank<00:01:41.860> from

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
it and to keep the Bell crank from

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.130 
it and to keep the Bell crank from
hitting<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:43.330> actually<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.660> little<00:01:43.750> stud<00:01:44.020> on

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
hitting it's actually the little stud on

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.570 
hitting it's actually the little stud on
the<00:01:44.170> Bell<00:01:44.380> crank<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:44.830> holds<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> actuator

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
the Bell crank that holds the actuator

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:54.029 
the Bell crank that holds the actuator
arm<00:01:48.539> put<00:01:49.539> it<00:01:49.660> back<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:50.250> doesn't<00:01:51.250> hit<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:53.039> didn't

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
arm put it back on doesn't hit it didn't

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.350 
arm put it back on doesn't hit it didn't
make<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:55.720> actuator<00:01:56.170> arm<00:01:56.350> bind<00:01:57.340> here<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:58.240> what

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
make the actuator arm bind here but what

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.770 
make the actuator arm bind here but what
it<00:01:58.450> did<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.289> by<00:01:59.530> twisting<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.070> Bell<00:02:00.220> crank

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it did do is by twisting the Bell crank

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.969 
it did do is by twisting the Bell crank
from<00:02:01.780> straight<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.350> back<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
from straight to back like that it

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.070 
from straight to back like that it
effectively<00:02:06.789> took<00:02:07.060> this<00:02:07.300> plane<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.899> this

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
effectively took this plane that this

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.620 
effectively took this plane that this
the<00:02:08.740> top<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.160> actuator<00:02:09.819> arm<00:02:10.000> sits<00:02:10.300> in<00:02:10.450> and

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the top of the actuator arm sits in and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.750 
the top of the actuator arm sits in and
rotated<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.380> like<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.680> which<00:02:12.340> caused<00:02:12.610> some

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
rotated it like that which caused some

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.980 
rotated it like that which caused some
binding<00:02:13.090> up<00:02:13.240> here<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> had<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.910> put<00:02:15.910> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
binding up here so I had to put a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.589 
binding up here so I had to put a
backward<00:02:16.990> Bend<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.770> now

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
backward Bend to get this now

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.330 
backward Bend to get this now
perpendicular<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.770> bend<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.040> put<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
perpendicular to the bend I put in the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.199 
perpendicular to the bend I put in the
bell<00:02:21.459> crank<00:02:21.730> if<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.900> makes<00:02:23.080> sense<00:02:23.970> okay<00:02:24.970> and

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
bell crank if that makes sense okay and

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.790 
bell crank if that makes sense okay and
then<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.780> only<00:02:25.959> other<00:02:26.110> issue<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.319> ran<00:02:26.530> into<00:02:26.680> you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
then the only other issue I ran into you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.960 
then the only other issue I ran into you
was<00:02:26.950> as<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.640> rotates<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:29.580> had<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.640> put<00:02:30.790> another

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
was as it rotates I had to put another

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.610 
was as it rotates I had to put another
little<00:02:31.150> bend<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:31.599> here<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.380> part

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
little bend right here because this part

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.500 
little bend right here because this part
of<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.739> arm<00:02:32.920> was<00:02:33.130> hitting<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:34.060> part<00:02:34.360> right

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
of the arm was hitting this part right

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.589 
of the arm was hitting this part right
here<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.200> actuator<00:02:35.590> plate<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:37.209> actually

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
here of the actuator plate as actually

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.120 
here of the actuator plate as actually
to<00:02:37.690> play<00:02:37.810> rotate<00:02:38.110> around<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.800> just<00:02:38.980> put<00:02:39.099> it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
to play rotate around so just put it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.010 
to play rotate around so just put it
through<00:02:39.400> its<00:02:39.550> motions<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.090> make<00:02:40.900> sure

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
through its motions and make sure

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.170 
through its motions and make sure
nothing<00:02:41.290> binds<00:02:41.500> everything's<00:02:42.040> fine<00:02:42.250> now<00:02:42.430> so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
nothing binds everything's fine now so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.330 
nothing binds everything's fine now so
you<00:02:43.239> can<00:02:43.330> push<00:02:43.480> down<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.810> governor<00:02:44.110> here

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you can push down on the governor here

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
you can push down on the governor here
everything<00:02:45.340> rotates<00:02:45.520> up<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.910> around<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.180> can't

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
everything rotates up and around I can't

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.400 
everything rotates up and around I can't
push<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.510> hard<00:02:46.720> enough<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> rotate<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.349> all

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
push it hard enough to rotate it all

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.970 
push it hard enough to rotate it all
around<00:02:47.739> oh<00:02:47.860> hey<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:49.660> close<00:02:50.670> so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
around oh hey that's close so

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.530 
around oh hey that's close so
everything's<00:02:53.980> tightened<00:02:54.220> back<00:02:54.370> down<00:02:54.580> nothing

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
everything's tightened back down nothing

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.000 
everything's tightened back down nothing
seems<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.900> binding<00:02:56.110> everything<00:02:56.470> rotates

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
seems to be binding everything rotates

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.100 
seems to be binding everything rotates
my<00:02:57.340> hand<00:02:57.550> fine<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:58.390> only<00:02:58.540> other<00:02:58.690> concern<00:02:58.870> I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
my hand fine the only other concern I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.420 
my hand fine the only other concern I
had<00:02:59.349> was<00:02:59.379> make<00:02:59.739> sure<00:02:59.770> there's<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.129> little<00:03:00.250> bit

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
had was make sure there's a little bit

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.020 
had was make sure there's a little bit
of<00:03:00.520> play<00:03:00.730> here<00:03:01.650> side<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.800> side<00:03:03.099> in<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.730> shaft

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
of play here side to side in the shaft

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.300 
of play here side to side in the shaft
that<00:03:04.239> goes<00:03:04.360> across<00:03:04.480> here<00:03:05.310> because<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.190> have

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
that goes across here because so I have

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.940 
that goes across here because so I have
a<00:03:09.340> tiny<00:03:09.610> bit<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.850> play<00:03:09.970> there<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.560> little

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
a tiny bit of play there this little

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.860 
a tiny bit of play there this little
stud<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:12.970> sticks<00:03:13.270> out

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
stud that sticks out

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.090 
stud that sticks out
to<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.960> left<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.320> this<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.530> can't<00:03:16.740> see<00:03:16.800> at<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
to the left of this you can't see at the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.500 
to the left of this you can't see at the
part<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.430> goes<00:03:17.580> inside<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.030> slot<00:03:18.270> here

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
part that goes inside the slot here

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.390 
part that goes inside the slot here
behind<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.840> governor<00:03:19.170> has<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.950> little<00:03:20.220> edge

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
behind the governor has a little edge

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400 
behind the governor has a little edge
that<00:03:20.430> sticks<00:03:20.910> out<00:03:21.030> here<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.200> looks<00:03:22.350> like

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
that sticks out here and it looks like

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.380 
that sticks out here and it looks like
you<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.740> bind<00:03:22.950> there<00:03:23.130> if<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.310> get<00:03:23.460> this<00:03:24.090> and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
you can bind there if you get this and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.450 
you can bind there if you get this and
this<00:03:24.510> too<00:03:24.750> tight<00:03:24.960> so<00:03:25.950> when<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.130> tighten<00:03:26.430> down

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
this too tight so when you tighten down

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.770 
this too tight so when you tighten down
this<00:03:26.700> nut<00:03:26.940> just<00:03:27.120> make<00:03:27.270> sure<00:03:27.360> there's<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> little

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
this nut just make sure there's a little

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.880 
this nut just make sure there's a little
bit<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.930> space<00:03:28.110> there<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.440> then<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.620> doesn't

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
bit of space there and then it doesn't

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.780 
bit of space there and then it doesn't
bind<00:03:29.040> there<00:03:30.770> so<00:03:31.770> mine<00:03:31.950> doesn't<00:03:32.130> bind<00:03:32.370> now<00:03:32.460> so

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
bind there so mine doesn't bind now so

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.410 
bind there so mine doesn't bind now so
I'm<00:03:33.000> happy<00:03:33.240> with<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:34.940> okay<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.120> else<00:03:36.150> on

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
I'm happy with that okay what else on

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.780 
I'm happy with that okay what else on
this<00:03:36.770> so<00:03:37.770> I'll<00:03:37.890> fire<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.100> up<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.520> if<00:03:38.700> it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
this so I'll fire it up and see if it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.680 
this so I'll fire it up and see if it
works<00:03:38.970> see<00:03:39.450> if<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.600> take<00:03:39.720> out<00:03:39.900> my<00:03:40.080> annoying

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
works see if I take out my annoying

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.900 
works see if I take out my annoying
power<00:03:42.690> valve<00:03:42.840> rattle<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.200> deceleration<00:03:43.910> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
power valve rattle on deceleration and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.660 
power valve rattle on deceleration and
if<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.300> does<00:03:45.450> I'll<00:03:45.630> post<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.680> hopefully<00:03:47.400> I

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
if it does I'll post it and hopefully I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.050 
if it does I'll post it and hopefully I
didn't<00:03:48.090> screw<00:03:48.990> anything<00:03:49.050> else<00:03:49.440> up

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
didn't screw anything else up

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.780 
didn't screw anything else up
looks<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.330> bearings<00:03:51.690> inside<00:03:51.840> here<00:03:52.790> tiny

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
looks like the bearings inside here tiny

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.940 
looks like the bearings inside here tiny
bit<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.090> play<00:03:54.240> in<00:03:54.270> them<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:55.410> contributing

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
bit of play in them that's contributing

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.350 
bit of play in them that's contributing
to<00:03:55.980> some<00:03:56.280> noise<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.730> have<00:03:56.910> some<00:03:57.090> side-to-side

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
to some noise I have some side-to-side

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.150 
to some noise I have some side-to-side
playing<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.900> power<00:03:58.140> valve<00:03:58.350> when<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:58.980> put<00:03:59.130> my

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
playing the power valve when I put my

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.770 
playing the power valve when I put my
hand<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.610> arcing<00:03:59.850> wood<00:03:59.970> lit<00:04:00.090> side-to-side

I'm<00:04:00.959> sure<00:04:01.170> that's<00:04:01.350> contributing<00:04:01.800> some<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.190> you

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
I'm sure that's contributing some to you

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.040 
I'm sure that's contributing some to you
there's<00:04:02.910> also<00:04:03.120> some<00:04:03.390> up-and-down<00:04:03.750> playing
