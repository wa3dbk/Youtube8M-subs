00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.750

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 in fact there was a tweet that is called ay 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.189
 cleaner but this version is newer and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.270
 works much better what basically 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.790
 What does this tweet do? 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.370
 here we will clean all the caches 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.490
 all those files when 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.790
 download we get to pages things 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.790
 A) Yes 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.890
 that adhere to and occupy a part of 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.750

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.760

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.960
