recap of anything and everything that
I've<00:00:27.739> been<00:00:27.860> doing<00:00:28.009> when<00:00:28.849> it<00:00:28.880> comes<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.270> gaming

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
happened I don't really know if it will

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.650 
happened I don't really know if it will
but<00:01:33.890> yeah<00:01:34.370> it's<00:01:34.520> kind<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.760> just<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.180> case<00:01:35.360> and

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
but yeah it's kind of just in case and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.110 
but yeah it's kind of just in case and
then<00:01:36.350> also<00:01:36.560> stain<00:01:36.980> will<00:01:37.160> drop<00:01:37.370> sparta<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.910> think
