00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.060
 this tutorial is for the right hand of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.950
 one of the techniques is not so easy 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.670
 but when you do it 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.349
 driving is pretty nice so in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.290
 the classic guitar as a train sounds 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.710
 good so the tremolo is repeated many 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.449
 sharp notes and bring the melody or 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.960
 accompaniment with the serious ones are not 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.960
 ready 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.129
 and leaving like the repentant oceans 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.960
 and the ends are usually there 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.469
 several of us have the beautiful ones that I 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.750
 I advise you to listen to that dream of 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.159
 AgustÃ­n bar forest that is a 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.259
 impressive term to touch it and what 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.020
 I tell him the important thing is to get 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.670
 that the one that the sound and let's say the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.740
 tremolo the repetition of the note be 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.299
 constant and do not cut yourself and it does not sound like 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.299
 at a gallop that are not these 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.190
 it is a constant thing always always 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190
 same 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 then how crazy how to start 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.900
 touch us and then it would be a note that 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.610
 it is a serious accompaniment that can be 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.260
 on any of the strings and 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.060
 usually most of the tremolo 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.060
 they touch on the first string this does not 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.860
 to work it, what I would propose to you 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.450
 would start instead of the first 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.780
 string because he usually plays in the first 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.570
 rope I can come with the ring would be 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.840
 thumb what you touch first ring 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.270
 higher index yes that is the tremolo 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.590
 flamenco I added the index first is 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.720
 harder the theme the flamengo has 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.720
 has five notes actually this 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.670
 it's much harder, we're not going to tackle it 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.800
 in another in another video but this extreme 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.550
 the classic thumb 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.230
 annular greater index and thumb ring 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.240
 higher index 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.250
 if I play, it's still on the same string as 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.800
 you will see or I can see and know or from 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.030
 any place or from a distance and is 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.320
 what serves us because when you see 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.590
 some guitarists who take who do 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.590
 this does not 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.120
 do not lose control of the hand if 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.830
 the ideal would be to exercise it slowly as if 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:08.560
 eighteenth notes in this 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:14.989
 case accident on the second rope to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:18.709
 the four do not get the second string in the 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:26.860
 third after working with our 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.860
 go slowly accelerating little by little 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.030
 in the fourth 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.750
 and then you can try for example with 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.750
 the first string and playing some chord 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.540
 then the same in the second 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.190
 how 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.270
 another cute subject that also they were 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.370
 are the most striking are the 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.739
 out there when you listen to my tower 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.739
 Classic souvenir of the Alhambra is called 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.770
 have you notice that you have three flights but 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 as long as they are suitable 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.460
 do not 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.870
 that would be in the technical question 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:55.660
 patience start very slow that the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:58.520
 four are equal the four friends 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.890
 I have that is not the first 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.960
 rope and that I have the need to 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:08.360
 play short cuts or the movement of 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:13.640
 the four fingers were cut and this is going 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.260
 limit to be able to play fast because I 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.520
 the first one I'm free to play from 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:24.130
 down everything I want here 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:24.130
 no longer once the speed 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.650
 thank you very much we will see you in the 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.650
 next tutorial
