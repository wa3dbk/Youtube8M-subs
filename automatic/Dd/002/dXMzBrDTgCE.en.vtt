00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
playing planetside 2 I actually found it

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.110 
playing planetside 2 I actually found it
in<00:00:09.510> another<00:00:09.900> video<00:00:10.400> or<00:00:11.400> maybe<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.849> forum

somewhere buried but something that has

somewhere buried but something that has
been<00:00:14.340> helping<00:00:14.639> me<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> lot<00:00:15.360> better<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.049> air

how<00:00:21.029> others<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.630> pull<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> maneuvers

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
how others can pull off the maneuvers

that I never seem to be able to and it

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.220 
that I never seem to be able to and it
all<00:00:25.470> comes<00:00:25.680> down<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.310> key<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.779> open<00:00:28.109> up

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
all comes down to one key if you open up

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.750 
all comes down to one key if you open up
your<00:00:28.320> settings<00:00:28.500> menu<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.099> check<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> key

bindings<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.359> aircraft<00:00:30.779> you'll<00:00:31.050> find<00:00:31.260> that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
bindings for aircraft you'll find that

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.620 
bindings for aircraft you'll find that
there's<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.890> left<00:00:32.340> unbound<00:00:32.940> by<00:00:33.239> default

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
there's one left unbound by default

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.229 
there's one left unbound by default
called<00:00:34.380> throttle<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> I've<00:00:35.880> seen<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.149> in

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
called throttle and I've seen this in

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.270 
called throttle and I've seen this in
the<00:00:36.270> past<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> think<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.469> throttle<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the past but when I think of throttle I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.639 
the past but when I think of throttle I
think<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.700> full<00:00:39.210> throttle<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.170> throttle

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
think of full throttle or the throttle

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
think of full throttle or the throttle
of<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.829> motorcycle<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.450> think

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
of a motorcycle then what I don't think

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.970 
of a motorcycle then what I don't think
of<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.020> completely<00:00:43.559> cutting<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.920> your

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
of is completely cutting off your

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.520 
of is completely cutting off your
engines<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:45.090> Ford<00:00:45.390> momentum<00:00:45.899> but

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
engines and your Ford momentum but

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.080 
engines and your Ford momentum but
that's<00:00:46.710> exactly<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.610> key<00:00:47.820> actually

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that's exactly what this key actually

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.319 
that's exactly what this key actually
does<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.559> want<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> bind<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.789> key<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
does so we want to bind this key to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.010 
does so we want to bind this key to
something<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.170> use<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.370> letter<00:00:53.670> G<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.840> some

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
something I use the letter G but some

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.260 
something I use the letter G but some
people<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> replace<00:00:55.980> their<00:00:56.250> S<00:00:56.430> key<00:00:57.030> or

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
people like to replace their S key or

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
people like to replace their S key or
their<00:00:57.420> decelerate<00:00:57.960> key<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> throttle

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
their decelerate key with the throttle

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
their decelerate key with the throttle
the<00:00:59.550> difference<00:01:00.239> between<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> throttle<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the difference between the throttle and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.939 
the difference between the throttle and
the<00:01:01.559> S<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> decelerate<00:01:02.910> key<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
the S or the decelerate key is that

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.990 
the S or the decelerate key is that
throttle<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> slow<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:05.640> very

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
throttle is going to slow you down very

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.219 
throttle is going to slow you down very
very<00:01:06.150> quickly<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> slow<00:01:07.170> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
very quickly and it's going to slow you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
very quickly and it's going to slow you
down<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.799> than<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> decelerate<00:01:09.150> key<00:01:09.360> does

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
down more than the decelerate key does

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.109 
down more than the decelerate key does
but<00:01:10.290> both<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.920> definitely<00:01:11.460> useful<00:01:11.640> which<00:01:12.000> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
but both are definitely useful which is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.350 
but both are definitely useful which is
why<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.689> having<00:01:12.930> both<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> keys

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
why I like having both of the keys

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
why I like having both of the keys
available<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.710> use<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> throttle

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
available to me and to use the throttle

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
available to me and to use the throttle
key<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> tap<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.119> once<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.869> hold<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
key you tap it once you don't hold it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.039 
key you tap it once you don't hold it
like<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> decelerate<00:01:20.790> key<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> said

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
like the decelerate key and that said

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.660 
like the decelerate key and that said
there<00:01:22.200> are<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> couple<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.799> tricky<00:01:23.189> things<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
there are a couple of tricky things that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.910 
there are a couple of tricky things that
happen<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.110> throttle<00:01:25.409> key<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
happen with the throttle key that I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
happen with the throttle key that I
would<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> make<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> aware<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
would like to make you aware of the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.260 
would like to make you aware of the
first<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.460> overrides<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.790> current

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
first is that it overrides your current

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.109 
first is that it overrides your current
momentum<00:01:30.479> key<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.259> holding<00:01:31.380> your

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
momentum key so if you're holding your

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.940 
momentum key so if you're holding your
accelerate<00:01:33.119> key<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> W<00:01:34.079> by<00:01:34.229> default<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
accelerate key which is W by default and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.069 
accelerate key which is W by default and
you<00:01:35.250> hit<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.400> throttle<00:01:35.939> you'll<00:01:36.810> need<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
you hit your throttle you'll need to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
you hit your throttle you'll need to
press<00:01:37.259> W<00:01:37.680> again<00:01:37.799> after<00:01:38.400> letting<00:01:38.610> off<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
press W again after letting off of the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630 
press W again after letting off of the
throttle<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:40.020> start<00:01:40.259> accelerating<00:01:40.829> again<00:01:40.920> in

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
throttle to start accelerating again in

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460 
throttle to start accelerating again in
other<00:01:41.759> words<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> doesn't<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.659> reset<00:01:43.110> your

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
other words it doesn't just reset your

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
other words it doesn't just reset your
speed<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> zero<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.579> start<00:01:44.880> ticking<00:01:45.240> up

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
speed to zero and then start ticking up

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.300 
speed to zero and then start ticking up
again<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.439> still<00:01:46.590> holding<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> W

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
again because you're still holding the W

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.010 
again because you're still holding the W
I<00:01:47.610> kind<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I kind of like you think it would you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.249 
I kind of like you think it would you
actually<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.430> press<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> W<00:01:51.869> key<00:01:52.079> or

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
actually have to to press the W key or

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.870 
actually have to to press the W key or
the<00:01:52.380> accelerate<00:01:52.799> key<00:01:52.950> or<00:01:53.100> whatever<00:01:53.399> direction

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the accelerate key or whatever direction

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.310 
the accelerate key or whatever direction
again<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.890> momentum<00:01:56.430> started<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
again to get that momentum started and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
again to get that momentum started and
the<00:01:58.320> second<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.890> after<00:01:59.490> hitting<00:01:59.729> your

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the second is that after hitting your

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.730 
the second is that after hitting your
throttle<00:02:00.360> gaining<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.320> forward<00:02:01.590> momentum

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
throttle gaining that forward momentum

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
throttle gaining that forward momentum
back<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:02.549> pretty<00:02:02.729> difficult<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.420> do

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
back is actually pretty difficult to do

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.969 
back is actually pretty difficult to do
unless<00:02:03.930> you're<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> middle<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
unless you're in the middle of a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.649 
unless you're in the middle of a
maneuver<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> you're<00:02:06.000> using<00:02:06.149> gravity<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
maneuver and you're using gravity to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.680 
maneuver and you're using gravity to
help<00:02:06.990> keep<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:08.250> also<00:02:08.670> using<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
help keep you going or also using the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.570 
help keep you going or also using the
afterburners<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.979> seems<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
afterburners and that seems to be the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.910 
afterburners and that seems to be the
main<00:02:11.790> use<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.360> key<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.170> aid<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
main use of this key it's to aid you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
main use of this key it's to aid you
in<00:02:14.010> your<00:02:14.460> turning<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.120> you're<00:02:15.330> more

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
in your turning and you're more

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.620 
in your turning and you're more
complicated<00:02:16.410> maneuvers<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:18.000> here<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.450> some

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
complicated maneuvers so here are some

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.870 
complicated maneuvers so here are some
examples<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> throttle<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.040> use<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.550> I'm

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
examples of the throttle and use and I'm

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.400 
examples of the throttle and use and I'm
not<00:02:21.030> going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.209> go<00:02:21.300> deep<00:02:21.569> into<00:02:21.840> maneuvers

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
not going to go deep into maneuvers

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.740 
not going to go deep into maneuvers
because<00:02:22.560> frankly<00:02:23.160> I'm<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> novice<00:02:23.790> pilot<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.569> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
because frankly I'm a novice pilot and I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.780 
because frankly I'm a novice pilot and I
don't<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> lot<00:02:25.350> about<00:02:25.380> them<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.730> do

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
don't know a lot about them but I do

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.540 
don't know a lot about them but I do
know<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.480> key<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.930> pretty<00:02:28.380> awesome<00:02:28.830> but

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
know that this key is pretty awesome but

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.340 
know that this key is pretty awesome but
you're<00:02:29.670> going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.880> primarily<00:02:30.060> see<00:02:30.570> me<00:02:30.780> being

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
you're going to primarily see me being

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.130 
you're going to primarily see me being
able<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.650> do<00:02:31.800> turns<00:02:32.459> very<00:02:32.850> very<00:02:33.120> quickly<00:02:33.390> from

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
able to do turns very very quickly from

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.020 
able to do turns very very quickly from
practically<00:02:34.650> any<00:02:34.830> speed<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.490> even<00:02:35.820> if<00:02:35.940> I'm

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
practically any speed so even if I'm

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.150 
practically any speed so even if I'm
after<00:02:36.360> burning<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.470> very<00:02:38.100> very

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
after burning I can just very very

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.890 
after burning I can just very very
quickly<00:02:38.490> slow<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.420> kind<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.690> make<00:02:39.870> a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
quickly slow down and kind of make a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.180 
quickly slow down and kind of make a
helicopter<00:02:40.440> motion<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:42.300> then<00:02:42.510> turn<00:02:42.690> around

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
helicopter motion and then turn around

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.949 
helicopter motion and then turn around
the<00:02:44.190> gameplay<00:02:44.550> isn't<00:02:44.760> very<00:02:45.000> good<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
the gameplay isn't very good but it

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.750 
the gameplay isn't very good but it
should<00:02:46.140> at<00:02:46.230> least<00:02:46.350> demonstrate<00:02:46.739> or<00:02:47.280> help

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
should at least demonstrate or help

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
should at least demonstrate or help
demonstrate<00:02:48.300> how<00:02:48.570> ceasing<00:02:49.560> your<00:02:49.680> momentum

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
demonstrate how ceasing your momentum

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.940 
demonstrate how ceasing your momentum
can<00:02:50.459> help<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.790> keep<00:02:51.120> control<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.840> your<00:02:52.200> ESF<00:02:52.739> or

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
can help you keep control of your ESF or

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.320 
can help you keep control of your ESF or
of<00:02:53.070> your<00:02:53.190> Liberator<00:02:53.580> without<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> normal

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
of your Liberator without the normal

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.030 
of your Liberator without the normal
floundering<00:02:54.959> around<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> air<00:02:55.800> that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
floundering around in the air that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.580 
floundering around in the air that
inexperienced<00:02:56.700> pilots<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.269> myself<00:02:57.510> tend<00:02:58.410> to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
inexperienced pilots like myself tend to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.990 
inexperienced pilots like myself tend to
do

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.460 

but<00:03:05.000> that's<00:03:05.240> pretty<00:03:05.450> much<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.990> may<00:03:06.140> do<00:03:06.200> some

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
but that's pretty much it I may do some

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.050 
but that's pretty much it I may do some
videos<00:03:06.710> in<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:07.100> future<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.820> break<00:03:08.030> down

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
videos in the future that break down

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.300 
videos in the future that break down
specific<00:03:08.810> manoeuvres<00:03:09.320> I'm<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.010> only<00:03:10.160> one

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
specific manoeuvres I'm the only one

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.440 
specific manoeuvres I'm the only one
that<00:03:10.460> I've<00:03:10.550> ever<00:03:10.580> done<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.330> reverse

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
that I've ever done is on the reverse

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.650 
that I've ever done is on the reverse
maneuver<00:03:12.140> which<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:13.700> still<00:03:14.210> very<00:03:14.480> viable

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
maneuver which it's still very viable

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.000 
maneuver which it's still very viable
and<00:03:14.960> this<00:03:15.140> key<00:03:15.320> actually<00:03:15.470> makes<00:03:15.740> it<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.920> lot

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
and this key actually makes it a lot

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.190 
and this key actually makes it a lot
easier<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.670> pull<00:03:16.820> off<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> purpose<00:03:18.080> of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
easier to pull off but the purpose of

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.990 
easier to pull off but the purpose of
this<00:03:18.350> video<00:03:18.680> was<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.220> make<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.580> aware<00:03:19.940> of

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
this video was to just make you aware of

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.670 
this video was to just make you aware of
