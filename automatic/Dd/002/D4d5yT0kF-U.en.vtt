now<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.900> for<00:04:22.200> purposes<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:23.810> explanation

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
now just for purposes of explanation

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.090 
now just for purposes of explanation
let's<00:04:25.050> say<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:26.040> they<00:04:26.419> cut<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.660> deck<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.140> you

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
let's say that they cut the deck and you

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.060 
let's say that they cut the deck and you
see<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.700> there's<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.270> five<00:04:30.690> on<00:04:30.720> top<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.890> see

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
see that there's a five on top you see

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.860 
see that there's a five on top you see
it's<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.370> clubs<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.820> know<00:04:33.090> it's<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> five<00:04:33.600> at

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
it's the clubs you know it's the five at

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.720 
it's the clubs you know it's the five at
this<00:04:34.080> point<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.530> can<00:04:34.680> use<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:35.010> information

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
this point you can use this information

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.000 
this point you can use this information
and<00:04:35.940> their<00:04:36.180> card<00:04:36.450> would<00:04:36.660> be<00:04:36.840> one<00:04:37.140> two<00:04:37.590> three

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
and their card would be one two three

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.110 
and their card would be one two three
four<00:04:38.720> five<00:04:39.720> from<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.860> top<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.640> works<00:04:41.820> for

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
four five from the top and it works for

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.240 
four five from the top and it works for
every<00:04:42.660> number<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:43.289> your<00:04:43.710> suit

so that's basic secret

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.650 
so that's basic secret
to<00:04:46.020> this<00:04:46.500> simple<00:04:47.160> self<00:04:47.490> working<00:04:47.880> card<00:04:48.120> trick<00:04:48.419> I
