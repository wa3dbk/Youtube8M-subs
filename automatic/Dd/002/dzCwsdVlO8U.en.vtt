getting to the to the pocket anyway
sometimes<00:03:17.560> carry<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.100> little<00:03:18.310> tough<00:03:18.520> we'll<00:03:19.120> see

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
sometimes carry a little tough we'll see

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.080 
sometimes carry a little tough we'll see
what<00:03:19.390> he<00:03:19.480> does<00:03:19.600> in<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.780> third<00:03:20.080> oh<00:03:20.940> four<00:03:21.940> but

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
what he does in the third oh four but

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.780 
what he does in the third oh four but
the<00:03:22.180> nine<00:03:22.360> stands<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:24.580> think

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
the nine stands and I really think

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.150 
the nine stands and I really think
that's<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.120> result<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.750> coming<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.800> light<00:03:27.040> and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
that's a result of coming in light and

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.500 
that's a result of coming in light and
the<00:03:27.250> first<00:03:27.490> couple<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.880> frames<00:03:28.090> makes<00:03:28.390> a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
the first couple of frames makes a

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.030 
the first couple of frames makes a
little<00:03:28.720> bit<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.960> an<00:03:29.050> over<00:03:29.290> adjustment<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:29.950> you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
little bit of an over adjustment and you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.040 
little bit of an over adjustment and you
saw<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.340> pin<00:03:30.670> roll<00:03:30.910> over<00:03:31.210> into<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.540> 9-pin

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
saw the pin roll over into the 9-pin

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.710 
saw the pin roll over into the 9-pin
look<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.280> might<00:03:33.430> topple<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.940> over<00:03:34.060> these

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
look like it might topple it over these

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.750 
look like it might topple it over these
are<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.020> three<00:03:35.230> pound<00:03:35.470> 10<00:03:35.710> ounce<00:03:35.920> pins<00:03:36.310> didn't

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760

quite<00:03:36.940> get<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.270> as<00:03:37.360> we<00:03:37.480> take<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> look<00:03:37.960> at<00:03:38.080> a

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
quite get it as we take a look at a

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.740 
quite get it as we take a look at a
replay<00:03:38.350> of<00:03:38.770> Steve<00:03:39.370> Jairus<00:03:39.820> really<00:03:40.270> throws<00:03:40.570> the
