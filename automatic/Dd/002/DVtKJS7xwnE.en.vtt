photographs<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.560> two<00:01:34.679> different<00:01:34.830> reasons

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
photographs for two different reasons

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.460 
photographs for two different reasons

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
one is for texture source we also have

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.930 
one is for texture source we also have
to<00:01:37.560> rebuild<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> shape<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.429> cases<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.789> we

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
to rebuild the shape in cases that we

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.669 
to rebuild the shape in cases that we
couldn't<00:01:39.179> scan<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> car<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:40.440> have<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
couldn't scan the car we have to

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.800 
couldn't scan the car we have to
recreate<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.190> 3d<00:01:41.490> shape<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.940> car<00:01:42.149> out<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
recreate the 3d shape of the car out of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.499 
recreate the 3d shape of the car out of
photos<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.250> take<00:01:44.759> photos<00:01:45.060> from<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.270> lot<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
photos so you take photos from a lot of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
photos so you take photos from a lot of
different<00:01:45.750> angles<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> lay<00:01:47.099> those

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
different angles and then we lay those

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
different angles and then we lay those
photos<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.970> behind<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.840> geometry<00:01:49.349> as<00:01:49.440> we're

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
photos in behind the geometry as we're

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.529 
photos in behind the geometry as we're
building<00:01:49.770> them<00:01:50.129> so<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.640> actually<00:01:50.759> match<00:01:51.179> the

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
building them so we actually match the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.270 
building them so we actually match the
geometry<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.349> photo<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.860> viewport

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.770

there and rev a car in neutral the
engine<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.900> sounds<00:02:43.290> ok<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.340> doesn't<00:02:44.610> sound

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
engine it sounds ok but it doesn't sound

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.979 
engine it sounds ok but it doesn't sound
like<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:45.000> does<00:02:45.090> when<00:02:45.269> it's<00:02:45.390> under<00:02:45.569> load<00:02:45.750> when

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
like it does when it's under load when

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.449 
like it does when it's under load when
it's<00:02:46.110> being<00:02:46.290> stressed<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.799> we<00:02:46.890> actually<00:02:47.010> strap

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
it's being stressed so we actually strap

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.100 
it's being stressed so we actually strap
a<00:02:47.489> car<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.910> dynamometer<00:02:48.360> which<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> way<00:02:49.049> to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
a car to a dynamometer which is a way to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.839 
a car to a dynamometer which is a way to
measure<00:02:49.290> horsepower<00:02:49.829> but<00:02:50.400> what<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.579> does<00:02:50.700> is

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
measure horsepower but what it does is

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.880 
measure horsepower but what it does is
it<00:02:51.000> simulates<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.660> static<00:02:52.019> environment<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
it simulates in a static environment the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.890 
it simulates in a static environment the
engine<00:02:53.280> being<00:02:53.610> under<00:02:53.819> load<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.569> we<00:02:54.690> run<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
engine being under load so we run the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.210 
engine being under load so we run the
car<00:02:55.170> through<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.410> gears<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.829> we<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> very

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
car through the gears and we get a very

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.839 
car through the gears and we get a very

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
are what the sounds are that really

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.059 
are what the sounds are that really
captured<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.359> sound<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.719> that<00:03:10.900> car<00:03:11.139> and<00:03:11.409> then

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
captured the sound of that car and then

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.069 
captured the sound of that car and then
we'll<00:03:12.249> position<00:03:12.430> multiple<00:03:13.180> microphones<00:03:13.389> on
