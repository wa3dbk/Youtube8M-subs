00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:14.100
 fs a750 as well as e with and 740 fs a750 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.070
 is a complex 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.900
 device based on a mobile 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.880
 racks but instead of personal 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:27.080
 computer to control the measuring 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.080
 fs a750 uses ccc 670
