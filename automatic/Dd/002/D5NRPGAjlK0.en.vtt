00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.880
 Hello, comrades, how are you waiting? 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.950
 you are fucking mother here we are 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.340
 new in war fÃ¡nder and today I'm going to 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.740
 teach how to get premium money what 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.380
 that would be the free gold eels 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.000
 completely free but I want that 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.230
 you notice a lot in this box every time 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.939
 that we connect to war thunder 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.980
 gentleman we connect we are going to give 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.730
 a box a day after day after day after 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.180
 day and the more consecutive days we 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.320
 let's settle before we'll get to this box 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.629
 this is the most important box of all 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.520
 because let's see what it can contain 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.829
 can contain here has the golden ones 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.899
 that already looks there we could get 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.480
 although the golden ones directly though 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.270
 As will be explained later, it does not compensate 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.280
 can contain a million lions of 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.570
 silver me the truth that I do not have any 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.170
 economic problem with the ions of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.730
 Silver are not premium money for me 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.640
 it is very easy to get it by asking 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.159
 why do I have premium account and then 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.270
 the question is the most important bet 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.729
 golden battles good this is 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.560
 translated that way to the best 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.020
 then translate it and put another name 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.710
 but this the most important the third and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.780
 the third is usually European 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.690
 to me whenever he has opened a box of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.670
 this has tripped me the third 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.729
 charles and I call him the gourd of gold 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.979
 the guaje of the premium money the guaje 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.070
 we usually call it okay I'm going to open 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.070
 box 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.159
 It's time to see what's playing today 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.290
 Shitty 10% experience but 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.270
 well let's what you want to explain 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.240
 is when this what that box and this that 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 is the guaje if you go inventory you go to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.630
 see what is that this is exactly this 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.259
 or yesterday I'll explain how to activate 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.560
 a roll of these so that you know 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.619
 how to get good premium money 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.250
 This is the gaming of bet battles 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.590
 golden that you have to earn 20 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.170
 victories really do games 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.420
 followed and in each game you have to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.880
 kill at least one player to destroy 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.550
 an enemy vehicle of a player not of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.010
 a bot you already have to win and have 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.530
 killed in that game a player 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.120
 all right 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.130
 that said you have to earn 20 in a row 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.900
 20 in a row getting this be 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.650
 getting the victory and having 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.140
 managed to kill at least one player and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.420
 You can only fail three times is , 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.400
 you can do it often images that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.550
 you get five followed and you fail the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.940
 sixth good because a failure would accumulate 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.580
 if you get up to three the guaje is over and 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.709
 you would stay by the number where where 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.540
 you 're staying but if you stay twelve 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.700
 victories then you would get 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.959
 four hundred 'golden eagles' yes 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.850
 cohesion are already 16,656 you reach 3 100 and 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.959
 then he likes to unify 20 who are 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.680
 1000 is what some more or less are about 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.650
 66 euros about 7 dollars out there six 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.140
 euros 7 american dollars well 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.390
 as active this I'm going to take one of 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.150
 these because I have left now that I'm 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 Well for you to see I'm not going to activate 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.959
 this obviously now because we are going to 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.790
 go a shit but for example imagine 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.600
 you just have to give it to activate puts 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.600
 fill and sixth 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.450
 good to the operation I'm uploading a 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.080
 asked so I go and here below says 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.650
 activating in rolls activated by the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.700
 name of gua ger and exposes 0 of 10 and 0 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.610
 of 30 of 10 in the guaje of the 'eagles 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.950
 golden ' remember that there are 20 victories 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.510
 consecutive so if at 0 of 20 and 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.280
 then 0 out of 3 in sutton 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.460
 these are the failures or you have to 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.900
 complete this before you get here 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.390
 before completing this because if 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.430
 complete the failures it's over and that's it or 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.760
 that is the way there is for 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.040
 get golden areas well my 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.980
 advice this is a piece of advice 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.470
 I would probably give you earlier when the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.480
 Guaje they just put it and this wants 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.360
 mess with four friends who were very 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.610
 good and crush in the games and do 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.210
 games to win the games by 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.580
 beatings that happens now with the method that 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.990
 has wars under the match if 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.690
 you get with a game of 4 a 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.790
 stateless 4 players usually you 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.449
 is going to mess with another enemy patrol of 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.509
 4 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.889
 then to release it evidently 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.050
 so 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.330
 there is the crux of the matter to compensate 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.939
 to get alone or mess with a group 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.129
 still, I think it's worth it to mess with 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:54.699
 a group that does try to get the 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:59.590
 better qualified people by the way 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:02.860
 true very important you have to be 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:07.509
 Guaje only works for vehicles of 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.300
 rank 3 for like that to 5 diego 3 to 4 forgiveness 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.819
 from 3 to 4 or you have to play at least 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.810
 with what would be tier 3 with a plane 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.240
 tier 3 to 4 my advice take the planes 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.580
 you lose the worst ones the most 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.069
 Well the worst ones have the least 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.349
 battle ratio have but that they are 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.389
 good so that they seem to 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.789
 other planes debating a small team 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.639
 And normally, people who are 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.319
 is here to beat the team in certain 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.180
 expectations matera team came down again 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.469
 it's people who have started that by 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.279
 otherwise if you go directly to 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:43.839
 tier 4 where there is much more level those 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.120
 would be the my advice to get 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.350
 the 'golden eagles' and if that and only 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.110
 you have to do that 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.660
 I will tell you with more experience 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.220
 taking with the roll of the guaje with more 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.120
 games that go casting with charles and 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.920
 let's get patrols and I'll tell you 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.080
 some tricks to get more 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.450
 performance to this go down since that what 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.520
 we have thrown three or four and we have good 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.170
 got in the first I think that 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.290
 we managed to get to 12 the second the 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.390
 16 and the other 10 the last one was a shit 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.760
 so one comrades I hope that I have 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.950
 liked the video and nothing to give like if 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.250
 has served you and see you in the next 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.250
 video
