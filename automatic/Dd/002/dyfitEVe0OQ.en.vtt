00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it's definitely good enough so let's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
it's definitely good enough so let's
take<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.430> look<00:02:35.730> at<00:02:36.000> how<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.600> would<00:02:36.780> fed<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
take a look at how we would fed to the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.930 
take a look at how we would fed to the
teeth<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.740> might<00:02:37.920> be<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> bit<00:02:38.550> surprised

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.210 
teeth and you might be a bit surprised
to<00:02:38.970> see<00:02:39.150> how<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:40.020> he<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.890> start

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
to see how I think he would so start

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.980 
to see how I think he would so start
with<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.640> defense<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.420> coffee<00:02:42.630> but

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
with the defense and coffee but

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.020 
with the defense and coffee but
obviously<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.530> reefs<00:02:43.740> it's<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.550> best<00:02:44.760> keeper

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
obviously the reefs it's the best keeper
