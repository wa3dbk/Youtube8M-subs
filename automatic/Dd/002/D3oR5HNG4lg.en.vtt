because senior C sharp second D now we

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.940 
because senior C sharp second D now we
can<00:01:34.610> do<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.000> same<00:01:35.150> exercise<00:01:35.210> on<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:36.020> g<00:01:36.320> string

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
can do the same exercise on the g string

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.060 
can do the same exercise on the g string
start<00:01:37.460> off<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.700> G<00:01:38.030> harmonic<00:01:38.630> top<00:01:39.380> now

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
start off the G harmonic top now

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.750 
start off the G harmonic top now
transfer<00:01:40.850> thumb<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.930> g<00:01:42.500> string<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.160> we'll

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
transfer thumb to the g string and we'll

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:52.930 
transfer thumb to the g string and we'll
talk<00:01:44.540> will<00:01:44.840> touch<00:01:45.140> also<00:01:45.470> district<00:01:51.940> can

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
talk will touch also district can

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.300 
talk will touch also district can
transfer<00:01:52.970> your<00:01:53.869> thumb<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.410> C<00:01:54.710> Street<00:01:55.070> so

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
transfer your thumb to the C Street so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:04.060 
transfer your thumb to the C Street so
now<00:01:55.520> thumb<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.570> on<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.900> C<00:01:57.290> energy<00:01:58.220> stream<00:02:03.070> so

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
now thumb is on a C energy stream so

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.300 
now thumb is on a C energy stream so
this<00:02:04.400> was<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> thumb<00:02:05.030> position<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.950> D
