00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello friends welcome again 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.990
 grip behind is potent and now kitchen 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.910
 I have new ones in the process and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.800
 ultimately a little monologue about the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.240
 kept cheap and that the milk so 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.130
 is unhealthy and there are many many 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.439
 many many have gotten ridiculous 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 yes what should you do if I can 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.250
 can not use yes if I am yes 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.670
 so to speak when cooking in many 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.650
 things in it just a little tip from me 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.060
 if you like that molli then 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.690
 you can have freshly squeezed juice 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.160
 take or buy some apple juice good 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.520
 You can do that too 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.559
 But there are situations where 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.579
 they say it has to be milk 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.300
 and there is a very good substitute for that - 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.520
 milk or almond milk 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.160
 and i want to tell you now it is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.320
 not just a substitute but the nut 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.750
 milk or almond milk is the normal 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.280
 cow milk in all respects superior in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.449
 the first time we have none 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.010
 animal fats in there we have 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.560
 vegetable fats this vegetable 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.510
 greases are not hardened so that means 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.130
 we against the latent danger of transports 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.530
 outside and so on and so on 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.549
 from the interior and all sorts of things 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.790
 I do not want to talk 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.189
 I 've prepared something and now 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.200
 Although I hope I can do that 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.090
 sees a glass of almonds soaked 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.340
 if you look at the glass then it was 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 about the almond to here and then 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.210
 I have in neuss up to the top 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
 The almonds are then filled with water 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.970
 I swam around for a night 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.450
 let stand and now is the whole 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.729
 glass full of almonds up to the top 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.979
 they do not have water 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.259
 sucked when her other purchases 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.740
 or even nuts buys and enjoys milk 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.540
 then please pay attention to that 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 the pack of almond or nut 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.729
 not the word roasted on it 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.250
 i have the experience that if 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.439
 The word does not appear on that expected 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.020
 they are actually retooled that way 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.650
 that means we take our almonds 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.720
 and here I have a glass with unfair 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.820
 the hazelnuts they have too 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.830
 Already fully sucked the weight almost 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.940
 doubled but who take 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.400
 otherwise always on top 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.620
 Of course you can also cashew kernels 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.060
 to take 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.190
 that is your imagination are none 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.470
 borders set what I here today 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.260
 and now show it is absolute basis 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.200
 recipe for maniche or nut milk or 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.690
 kesha not absolute base but i say 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.540
 I have something else right now so I have 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.850
 let the almond in overnight 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.340
 I'll dump that over a sieve now 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.240
 water away for you and feel the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.140
 change briefly with clean water 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:57.590
 then the almonds are already in the mixer 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:00.290
 and now I'll take one out with it 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.550
 important is how big you become 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.650
 how beautiful with water 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.900
 has soaked that is a giant 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.060
 Mandl pretty thick you know that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.800
 handy much smaller actually and 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.130
 which I already saw correctly 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 is 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.470
 I read the skin on the lacking 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.940
 You can also make her skin down 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.890
 then you have to do that, though 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.570
 we do not want the machines and that 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.200
 we want to record everything 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:29.900
 then we take to Bavarian 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.700
 Oktoberfest culture under water and you 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.310
 See that's not quite 1 liter that is 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.230
 maximum 0 95 as well as has the Bavarian 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.150
 beer are served at the Oktoberfest since 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.300
 must indeed be happy if you're doing 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.519
 Do you think you can take it with you? 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:58.750
 Almost every minute you know 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:58.750
 on it so thick and then mixa on 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.330
 the mixa that's what your mixa is all about 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.400
 Let's get it for a minute now 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.160
 So let the others really nice 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.390
 make three 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:18.940
 so now we take a normal one 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:23.290
 Coffee filters make that ours too 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:27.790
 tube filter in and step like 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.930
 you go through the top and leave the beautiful 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.930
 go through slowly 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.590
 and while they stop me now 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.480
 Go through explains what if 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.640
 you want to drink the milk as it is 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.320
 then you can of course sweet 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.240
 either with honey or with full 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.910
 sugar and maybe a pinch of salt 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.800
 Do rows and then it tastes too 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.160
 right from the state I really the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.870
 Well 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.520
 you can hardly do it with it either 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.590
 no problem you can spice up 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.050
 yes, I have allowed this here 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.060
 is because we want the almond milk too 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.500
 is hernehmen to a boil and cook the 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.350
 it as the hottest sugar to score a goal 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.630
 or salt does it taste good though 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.580
 a little more after me so to speak it 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.990
 are used to but it also affects 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.050
 the food for that reason we leave the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.510
 Change me as she is in this position 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.980
 so friends admittedly so 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.170
 Took a little while to get it 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.350
 coffee filter has passed though 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.270
 does not bother us we have time so 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:31.600
 we do that now on the side 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:33.930
 here and then we see what that has you 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.930
 at times 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:47.350
 nice fresh change not so and the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.670
 I have it now because I want 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.890
 Now finally cook something where I can 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.830
 I hope I but I enjoy it 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.720
 made to watch 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.860
 we see that it is very easy for us 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.190
 See you next time 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.190
 ciao
