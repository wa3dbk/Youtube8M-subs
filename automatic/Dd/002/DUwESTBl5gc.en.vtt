 fit and raw foodman he prepares the way from 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:29.840
 nuts carrots dates honey and 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.159
 orange peel to start we need 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:45.889
 grind cashews and almonds in the main 

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:48.859
 to make such nut flour for 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:51.350
 so that the flour was the same 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:01:05.900
 shake consistency a little blender 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:07.930
 and run again ready with us 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.000
 turned out nut flour 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.460
 pretty small it will be convenient 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.880
 mix it with dates to 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.490
 grind them you need first what 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.530
 clean and for this we cut them 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.530
 in half we take out the bone and it's in 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.140
 plate for pits and set aside in 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.240
 I will do the same manipulation 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.110
 with all the other dates 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.110
 do not forget about 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.650
 our dates are now happy for the nose 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:51.930
 condition we have to grind them 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:56.080
 multiply and just like that boldly 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.770
 we begin to cut them maybe there 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.790
 some more pretty name and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:15.459
 schihsya pasting method for the knife I had more 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:17.650
 not developed therefore I cut like we do not 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.280
 began to put them in a blender because they 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:28.920
 there may get stuck not very 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:33.340
 ok our goal is to connect dates and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:41.470
 nuts so that they become something 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:44.820
 similar to the whole after 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.430
 mixing we got such here 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.810
 plastic nut date dough 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.470
 which we will now lay out ourselves 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:59.980
 in a bowl on which will be a spoon we 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.329

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.579
 to tell 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.280
