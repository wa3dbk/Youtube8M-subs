00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.879
 arm 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.760
 so if we start with 100 grams of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.040
 butter formed 4 eggs we are going to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.670

 a pot of natural yogurt 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.460
 if you do not have yogurt a little bit that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.989
 it was good 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.340
 similar to an idiomatic and rich cake 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.740
