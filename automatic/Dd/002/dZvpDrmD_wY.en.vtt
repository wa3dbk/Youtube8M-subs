was<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> nest<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.479> tables<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
was going to get a nest of tables I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.270 
was going to get a nest of tables I
think<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> chunkier

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
think I'm now going to get a chunkier

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
think I'm now going to get a chunkier
table<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> something<00:01:12.630> else<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> upcycle

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
table and something else and upcycle

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.230 
table and something else and upcycle
them<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.460> don't<00:01:14.790> think<00:01:15.000> he's<00:01:15.150> gonna

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240 
them so I don't think he's gonna
recognize<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:15.990> anyway<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> end<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250

actually an Indian carved wooden core

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.080 
actually an Indian carved wooden core
ball<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.850> usually<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> core<00:03:20.110> ball<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.970> made<00:03:21.970> out

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
ball I usually a core ball is made out

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.490 
ball I usually a core ball is made out
of<00:03:22.209> stone<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.720> juts<00:03:22.930> out<00:03:23.050> of<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> water

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
of stone it juts out of the water

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.560

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
talents to good use and create a stencil

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.170

for<00:03:37.480> Dan's<00:03:37.690> reclaimed<00:03:38.200> pew<00:03:38.760> right<00:03:39.760> here<00:03:40.060> you

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
for Dan's reclaimed pew right here you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.000 
for Dan's reclaimed pew right here you
can<00:03:40.360> see<00:03:40.600> I've<00:03:40.870> joined<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.230> outline<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.560> a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
can see I've joined the outline of a

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.979 
can see I've joined the outline of a
damaged<00:03:42.430> print<00:03:42.760> I've<00:03:43.030> only<00:03:43.150> done<00:03:43.360> half<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.810> it

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
damaged print I've only done half of it

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.020 
damaged print I've only done half of it
because<00:03:44.260> when<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.500> open<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.950> up<00:03:45.069> it's<00:03:45.910> gonna

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
because when you open it up it's gonna

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.870 
because when you open it up it's gonna
be<00:03:46.150> symmetrical<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.350> I'm<00:03:47.860> now<00:03:48.040> gonna<00:03:48.280> cut<00:03:48.610> out

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
be symmetrical so I'm now gonna cut out

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.270 
be symmetrical so I'm now gonna cut out
all<00:03:49.209> these<00:03:49.390> areas<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.900> set<00:03:50.350> up<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.709> can<00:03:50.950> use

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
all these areas and set up I can use

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.680 
all these areas and set up I can use
that<00:03:51.430> as<00:03:51.579> a<00:03:51.610> stencil<00:03:51.880> for<00:03:52.120> it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.090 

but<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.230> careful<00:04:01.260> because<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.920> knife

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
but be really careful because this knife

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.760 
but be really careful because this knife
is<00:04:02.340> really<00:04:02.580> sharp<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:04.110> don't<00:04:04.320> want<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.560> mess

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
is really sharp and I don't want to mess

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.100 
is really sharp and I don't want to mess
up<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.980> lines<00:04:08.360> there<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.450> go<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.720> pops<00:04:09.930> out

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
up the lines there you go that pops out

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.720 
up the lines there you go that pops out
and<00:04:10.440> obviously<00:04:10.650> if<00:04:10.980> you've<00:04:11.160> got<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.400> lay<00:04:11.550> of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
and obviously if you've got the lay of

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.850 
and obviously if you've got the lay of
the<00:04:11.820> other<00:04:11.970> side<00:04:12.300> all<00:04:13.080> that<00:04:13.260> one's<00:04:13.410> coming<00:04:13.740> out

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
the other side all that one's coming out

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.920 
the other side all that one's coming out
too

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
too

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.660 
too
it's<00:04:15.930> good<00:04:16.230> I<00:04:16.590> thought<00:04:17.310> I'd<00:04:17.430> take<00:04:17.580> this

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
it's good I thought I'd take this

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.370 
it's good I thought I'd take this
opportunity<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:18.300> come<00:04:18.510> out<00:04:18.630> in<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.930> sunshine

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
opportunity to come out in the sunshine

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.920 
opportunity to come out in the sunshine
and<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> go<00:04:20.580> at<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:20.790> table<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.660> what<00:04:21.810> I'm

so I'm gonna get my safety equipment on
it's<00:04:47.640> been<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:47.820> rumor<00:04:48.000> here

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.250 

now<00:04:55.420> we're<00:04:55.600> looking

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.590 

I<00:05:00.320> put<00:05:00.830> together<00:05:00.950> a<00:05:01.460> few<00:05:01.730> pictures<00:05:01.970> here<00:05:02.420> to

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
I put together a few pictures here to

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.510 
I put together a few pictures here to
give<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:02.840> an<00:05:02.960> idea<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.560> what<00:05:03.680> I'm<00:05:03.800> thinking

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
give you an idea of what I'm thinking

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.000 
give you an idea of what I'm thinking
I<00:05:04.550> think<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.120> start<00:05:05.390> with<00:05:05.630> maybe<00:05:06.380> a<00:05:06.500> natural

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
I think to start with maybe a natural

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.920 
I think to start with maybe a natural
stone<00:05:07.250> tie<00:05:07.610> or<00:05:07.880> so<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.180> brings<00:05:08.390> that<00:05:08.510> warmth

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
stone tie or so it brings that warmth

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.120 
stone tie or so it brings that warmth
into<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.350> room<00:05:09.530> because<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.830> don't<00:05:09.950> want<00:05:10.070> it

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
into the room because you don't want it

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.310 
into the room because you don't want it
to<00:05:10.220> be<00:05:10.310> Union<00:05:10.640> you<00:05:10.760> know<00:05:10.850> clinical<00:05:11.450> then

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
to be Union you know clinical then

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.750 
to be Union you know clinical then
obviously<00:05:12.800> you've<00:05:12.980> got<00:05:13.040> your<00:05:13.340> big<00:05:13.490> walking

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
obviously you've got your big walking

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.850 
obviously you've got your big walking
shower<00:05:14.240> which<00:05:14.540> is<00:05:14.570> your<00:05:14.900> main<00:05:15.110> point<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.710> you

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
shower which is your main point that you

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.730 
shower which is your main point that you
you<00:05:16.340> really<00:05:16.370> need<00:05:16.640> so<00:05:17.570> what<00:05:17.690> I'm<00:05:17.870> thinking<00:05:18.440> is
