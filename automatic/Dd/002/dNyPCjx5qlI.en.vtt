00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
of where all that we all are

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.530 
of where all that we all are
and<00:03:26.190> here's<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:28.540> got<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.930> match<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.290> stripe

if you notice for instance at the stripe

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.330 
if you notice for instance at the stripe
the<00:03:36.340> match<00:03:36.580> here<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:37.870> they<00:03:38.349> don't<00:03:38.650> match<00:03:38.980> on

the match here but they don't match on
the<00:03:39.580> top<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:40.450> cannot<00:03:40.720> be<00:03:40.989> done<00:03:41.230> because<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
the top you cannot be done because the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
the top you cannot be done because the
front<00:03:43.510> has<00:03:43.930> two<00:03:44.260> darts<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.880> shape<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.870> shape

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
front has two darts to shape to shape

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.339 
front has two darts to shape to shape
the<00:03:47.440> suit<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.330> got<00:03:49.569> to<00:03:49.690> put<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.019> dart

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
the suit so you got to put this dart

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.890 
the suit so you got to put this dart
into<00:03:50.620> shape<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:51.760> doing<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.630> cannot

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
into shape so in doing that you cannot

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.680 
into shape so in doing that you cannot
match<00:03:53.319> because<00:03:53.769> it's<00:03:54.160> not<00:03:54.430> one<00:03:54.910> one<00:03:55.269> piece<00:03:55.450> of

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
match because it's not one one piece of

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.140 
match because it's not one one piece of
of<00:03:56.080> fabric<00:03:57.299> how<00:03:58.739> we<00:03:59.739> did<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.010> pocket<00:04:00.610> first<00:04:00.940> we

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
of fabric how we did a pocket first we

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.530 
of fabric how we did a pocket first we
had<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.360> sewing<00:04:01.870> all<00:04:02.079> around<00:04:02.739> perhaps<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:04.390> a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
had the sewing all around perhaps it's a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.890 
had the sewing all around perhaps it's a
hard<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:06.010> visualize<00:04:06.579> now<00:04:06.910> but<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.750> will

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
hard to to visualize now but you will

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.089 
hard to to visualize now but you will
see<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.319> a<00:04:08.349> few<00:04:08.410> minutes

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
see in a few minutes

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.759 
see in a few minutes
you<00:04:09.459> will<00:04:09.610> see<00:04:09.849> these<00:04:10.030> pockets<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:11.349> finished

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
you will see these pockets the finished

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.789 
you will see these pockets the finished
product<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.750> wanted<00:04:13.750> for<00:04:14.019> people<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.650> are

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
product I wanted for people that are

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.240 
product I wanted for people that are
interesting<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.880> see<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:17.380> job<00:04:17.829> how<00:04:18.190> the

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
interesting to see this job how the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.440 
interesting to see this job how the
pocket<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.359> made<00:04:19.959> or<00:04:20.320> other<00:04:20.709> things<00:04:21.220> but<00:04:22.120> I

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
pocket is is made or other things but I

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.940 
pocket is is made or other things but I
think<00:04:22.840> it's<00:04:23.289> good<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.770> know<00:04:23.950> for<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.340> fact<00:04:24.720> a

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
think it's good to know for the fact a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.340 
think it's good to know for the fact a
person<00:04:26.950> a<00:04:27.310> client<00:04:27.820> can<00:04:28.060> realize<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:29.080> amount

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
person a client can realize the amount

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.090 
person a client can realize the amount
of<00:04:29.680> work<00:04:29.950> which<00:04:30.460> goes<00:04:30.820> into<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.870> into<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.680> suit

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
of work which goes into a into a suit

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.190 
of work which goes into a into a suit
it's<00:04:33.760> an<00:04:33.820> amazing<00:04:34.270> amount<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.539> leukemia

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
it's an amazing amount of leukemia

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.110 
it's an amazing amount of leukemia
so<00:04:35.740> how<00:04:35.860> many<00:04:35.919> layers<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.490> fabric<00:04:36.820> are<00:04:36.970> you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
so how many layers of fabric are you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.850 
so how many layers of fabric are you
keeping<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.840> hat<00:04:37.990> right<00:04:38.860> now<00:04:38.889> they<00:04:39.610> are<00:04:39.639> one<00:04:40.180> two

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
keeping a hat right now they are one two

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.170 
keeping a hat right now they are one two
three<00:04:42.180> from<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.210> fabric<00:04:43.740> one<00:04:44.740> interfacing<00:04:45.610> to

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
three from the fabric one interfacing to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.790 
three from the fabric one interfacing to
interfacing<00:04:47.080> right<00:04:47.500> now<00:04:47.770> on<00:04:48.370> that<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.800> this

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
interfacing right now on that so this

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.760 
interfacing right now on that so this
this<00:04:51.760> pocket<00:04:52.120> should<00:04:52.600> be<00:04:52.840> good<00:04:53.050> for<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.320> hundred

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
this pocket should be good for a hundred

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.700 
this pocket should be good for a hundred
years

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
