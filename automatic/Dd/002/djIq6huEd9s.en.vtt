after all the water evaporates from the
wood<00:00:35.250> chips<00:00:35.489> they'll<00:00:36.030> begin<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.420> smoke<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
wood chips they'll begin to smoke and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
wood chips they'll begin to smoke and
what<00:00:37.739> we'll<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.340> allow<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
what we'll want to do is allow this to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.840 
what we'll want to do is allow this to
create<00:00:40.680> smoke<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.250> about<00:00:41.280> five<00:00:41.579> minutes

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
create smoke for about five minutes

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
create smoke for about five minutes
first<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.050> usually<00:00:43.320> thinks<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.590> an<00:00:43.680> hour

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
first and usually thinks about an hour

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.680 
first and usually thinks about an hour
and<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> half<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> flavored<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and a half to put a flavored it with a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.840 
and a half to put a flavored it with a
bullet<00:00:45.870> penetrate<00:00:46.410> what's<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.430> guy's<00:00:47.640> done

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
bullet penetrate what's this guy's done

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.540 
bullet penetrate what's this guy's done
we'll<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> don't<00:00:49.230> cure<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> all

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
we'll going on it don't cure it all

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
we'll going on it don't cure it all
right<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.149> second<00:00:51.780> process<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
right so the second process of the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
right so the second process of the
smoked<00:00:53.370> tofu<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:54.149> been<00:00:54.300> smoked<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.660> about

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
smoked tofu it's been smoked for about

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
smoked tofu it's been smoked for about
an<00:00:54.870> hour<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.140> half<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.949> we're<00:00:56.520> going

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
an hour and a half and then we're going

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
an hour and a half and then we're going
to<00:00:56.670> puree<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.239> ordinarily<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.050> would

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to puree it and ordinarily we would

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.660 
to puree it and ordinarily we would
actually<00:00:58.199> use<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.530> blender<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.340> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
actually use a blender for this but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.689 
actually use a blender for this but
since<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:01.070> wearing<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> food

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
since I got this wearing a food

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
since I got this wearing a food
processor<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.629> actually<00:01:04.140> works<00:01:04.439> much

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
processor this actually works much

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.690 
processor this actually works much
better

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
better

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.910 
better
so<00:01:06.700> we're<00:01:06.820> literally<00:01:07.000> just<00:01:07.240> going<00:01:07.480> to<00:01:07.920> pick

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
so we're literally just going to pick

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
so we're literally just going to pick
this<00:01:09.070> up

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.180 

since<00:01:17.940> I've<00:01:18.060> letting<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.450> guy<00:01:18.890> break<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:20.160> a

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
since I've letting this guy break down a

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.120 
since I've letting this guy break down a
little<00:01:20.340> bit

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
little bit

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.500 
little bit
blades<00:01:22.759> on<00:01:22.939> this<00:01:23.090> are<00:01:23.270> really<00:01:23.689> sure

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.230 

once<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.260> is<00:01:28.440> broken<00:01:28.800> down<00:01:29.150> we're<00:01:30.150> actually

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
once this is broken down we're actually

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.200 
once this is broken down we're actually
going<00:01:30.480> to<00:01:30.570> add<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.410> combination<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.280> white<00:01:32.910> soy

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
going to add a combination of white soy

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:46.150 
going to add a combination of white soy
rice<00:01:34.170> wine<00:01:34.380> vinegar<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.920> virgin<00:01:35.310> peanut<00:01:35.580> oil

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.010 

scrape<00:01:47.160> down<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.370> sides<00:01:47.750> we're<00:01:48.750> basically

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
scrape down the sides we're basically

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.650 
scrape down the sides we're basically
going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.440> just<00:01:49.860> blend<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> minute

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
going to just blend this about a minute

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.600 
going to just blend this about a minute
or<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:51.780> until<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.530> gets<00:01:52.650> completely<00:01:52.830> smooth

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
or two until it gets completely smooth

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.690 
or two until it gets completely smooth
then<00:01:54.510> we'll<00:01:54.720> pass<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.530> through<00:01:55.740> xinhua<00:01:58.700> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
then we'll pass it through xinhua this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.310 
then we'll pass it through xinhua this
is<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.910> friction<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.420> mixers<00:02:00.780> actually

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is a friction of the mixers actually

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.420 
is a friction of the mixers actually
getting<00:02:01.470> feet<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:01.890> become<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> lot<00:02:02.400> more

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
getting feet up to become a lot more

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:16.370 
getting feet up to become a lot more
liquid<00:02:02.990> then<00:02:03.990> once<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.290> cools<00:02:04.410> down<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> little

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.600 

so<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.410> think<00:02:17.500> we're<00:02:17.650> pretty<00:02:17.680> good<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:20.610> it's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
so I think we're pretty good here it's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.180 
so I think we're pretty good here it's
fairly<00:02:21.970> smooth<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.599> fairly<00:02:22.780> soft<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.980> again

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
fairly smooth it's fairly soft and again

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.130 
fairly smooth it's fairly soft and again
this<00:02:24.280> will<00:02:24.489> tighten<00:02:24.700> up<00:02:24.880> once<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.780> gets<00:02:25.930> cold

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
this will tighten up once it gets cold

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.229 
this will tighten up once it gets cold
and<00:02:26.830> we're<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.069> going<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.310> strain<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
and we're just going to strain this and

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.030 
and we're just going to strain this and
dress<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> piping<00:02:29.380> bag<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.830> we'll

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
dress this to a piping bag and we'll

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.699 
dress this to a piping bag and we'll
finish<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.459> rest<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.760> dish<00:02:30.910> these<00:02:31.450> are

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
finish the rest of the dish these are

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.460 
finish the rest of the dish these are
biodynamic<00:02:32.709> leaks<00:02:32.980> baby<00:02:33.580> leeks<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:35.170> we've

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
biodynamic leaks baby leeks that we've

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.380 
biodynamic leaks baby leeks that we've
just<00:02:35.500> blanched<00:02:36.040> briefly<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.940> salted<00:02:37.360> water

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
just blanched briefly in salted water

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.410 
just blanched briefly in salted water
I'm<00:02:38.110> just<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.470> see<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.160> side

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420
