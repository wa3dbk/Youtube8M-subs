00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
explain our truss rod system first of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.759 
explain our truss rod system first of
all<00:00:10.620> our<00:00:11.400> neck<00:00:11.639> blank<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.360> frizzy<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.469> feed

all our neck blank is frizzy and feed

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.250 
all our neck blank is frizzy and feed
from<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.219> rectangular<00:00:15.030> play<00:00:15.299> give<00:00:15.809> your<00:00:16.049> rough

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
from a rectangular play give your rough

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.510 
from a rectangular play give your rough
shape<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:16.910> allowed<00:00:17.910> to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.200 

then<00:00:22.060> we<00:00:22.270> run<00:00:22.540> a<00:00:22.920> CNC<00:00:23.920> cut<00:00:24.310> which<00:00:24.730> we<00:00:24.970> call

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
then we run a CNC cut which we call

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.500 
then we run a CNC cut which we call
stage<00:00:25.720> one<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.650> if<00:00:27.220> you<00:00:27.460> can<00:00:27.670> see<00:00:27.970> this<00:00:28.240> is<00:00:28.480> a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
stage one and if you can see this is a

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.350 
stage one and if you can see this is a
slot<00:00:29.200> within<00:00:29.980> that<00:00:30.190> neck<00:00:30.490> blank<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.210> that's

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
slot within that neck blank and that's

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.010 
slot within that neck blank and that's
what<00:00:31.630> carries<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.200> truss<00:00:32.830> rod<00:00:33.330> our<00:00:34.330> trust<00:00:34.720> rod

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
what carries the truss rod our trust rod

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.340 
what carries the truss rod our trust rod
is<00:00:35.290> testa<00:00:35.770> made<00:00:36.010> for<00:00:36.400> us<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.850> it's<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.350> special

just to straight the neck or to totally
reinforce<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.340> but<00:00:48.550> it<00:00:48.670> adjusts<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.809> neck<00:00:50.290> to

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
reinforce it but it adjusts the neck to

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.240 
reinforce it but it adjusts the neck to
avoid<00:00:51.460> Esper's<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:54.010> are<00:00:54.220> two

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
avoid Esper's and what you have are two

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.600 
avoid Esper's and what you have are two
reverse<00:00:54.820> threaded<00:00:55.360> nuts<00:00:55.780> on<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.140> ride<00:00:56.560> so<00:00:57.340> that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
reverse threaded nuts on a ride so that

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.000 
reverse threaded nuts on a ride so that
when<00:00:57.880> you<00:00:58.030> turn<00:00:58.270> it<00:00:58.300> one<00:00:58.660> way<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.230> poses<00:00:59.620> the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
when you turn it one way it poses the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.760 
when you turn it one way it poses the
neck<00:01:00.250> up<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:01.060> turn<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.780> opposite<00:01:02.380> way<00:01:02.440> it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
neck up and turn it the opposite way it

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.660 
neck up and turn it the opposite way it
posed<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.280> make<00:01:03.489> down<00:01:04.259> so<00:01:05.259> this<00:01:05.500> rod<00:01:05.830> would<00:01:06.340> fit

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
posed to make down so this rod would fit

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.460 
posed to make down so this rod would fit
into<00:01:07.479> this<00:01:07.840> fly<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.910> nuts<00:01:10.149> in<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.869> two

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470

into this fly with the nuts in the two
nut<00:01:11.770> cavity<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.600> it's<00:01:14.020> set<00:01:14.440> in<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.340> then<00:01:16.330> we

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
nut cavity but it's set in and then we

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.550 
nut cavity but it's set in and then we
use<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:17.310> mahogany<00:01:18.310> insert<00:01:19.149> stick<00:01:19.750> that's<00:01:20.200> made

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
use a mahogany insert stick that's made

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.230 
use a mahogany insert stick that's made
to<00:01:20.740> fit<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.850> it's<00:01:22.149> pressed<00:01:22.570> in<00:01:22.899> on<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:24.240> arbor

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
to fit and it's pressed in on this arbor

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.760 
to fit and it's pressed in on this arbor
press<00:01:25.479> here<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:27.130> we

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
press here and we

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.190 
press here and we
first<00:01:27.950> apply<00:01:28.310> glue<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.939> set<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:30.289> make

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.000 

what<00:01:33.469> this<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:34.039> is

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.020 

it<00:01:37.220> would<00:01:37.400> look<00:01:37.610> like<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:38.800> this<00:01:39.800> is<00:01:40.070> input<00:01:40.670> in

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
it would look like this this is input in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.680 
it would look like this this is input in
a<00:01:41.890> humanik<00:01:42.890> press<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.030> left<00:01:44.270> overnight

to drive and I if you can see we have

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.380 
to drive and I if you can see we have
it's<00:01:49.370> like<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.610> fire<00:01:49.970> hose<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:51.200> inflates

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
it's like a fire hose and it inflates

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.450 
it's like a fire hose and it inflates
less<00:01:53.390> pressing<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.800> holding<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.250> in

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.020 
put a fret board on so actually when the
fretboard<00:02:52.230> goes<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.160> back<00:02:53.370> side<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.849> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
fretboard goes on the back side of the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.339 
fretboard goes on the back side of the
neck<00:02:54.239> looks<00:02:54.569> like<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.239> prep<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
neck looks like this so the prep the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.649 
neck looks like this so the prep the
neck<00:02:58.379> itself<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.879> fretboard<00:03:00.150> have

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
neck itself and the fretboard have

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.979 
neck itself and the fretboard have
matching<00:03:01.200> pinholes<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.849> use<00:03:03.090> three

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
matching pinholes and we use three

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.059 
matching pinholes and we use three
aluminum<00:03:04.950> pins<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:06.629> align<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.200> fretboard<00:03:07.500> so

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
aluminum pins to align the fretboard so

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.509 
aluminum pins to align the fretboard so
it<00:03:08.220> doesn't<00:03:08.579> move<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.150> alignment<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:11.099> we

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it doesn't move out of alignment and we

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.920 
it doesn't move out of alignment and we
use<00:03:11.760> an<00:03:12.569> epoxy<00:03:13.760> mixture<00:03:14.760> here<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.420> glue<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
use an epoxy mixture here to glue the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.620 
use an epoxy mixture here to glue the
fretboard<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.709> with<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.730> permanent

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
fretboard on with the permanent

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:28.809 
fretboard on with the permanent
this<00:03:20.630> is<00:03:21.080> then<00:03:21.590> also<00:03:22.660> is

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.510 

til<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.940> glue<00:03:29.970> cures
