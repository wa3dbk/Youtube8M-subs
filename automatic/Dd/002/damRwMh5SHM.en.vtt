00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.069
 I bring to your attention perhaps already 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.650
 1000 times look one more for one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.799
 optical mouse wireless option 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.299
 here sent in such a package with each 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.260
 every year all sorts of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.930
 mice change options different versions 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.869
 different let's open let's see what 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.119
 mouse sent this time old already 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.240
 went into disrepair has fallen into disrepair and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.610
 I ordered a new wireless one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.719
 the mouse here is something I watch sent someone 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.149
 the colors of red or something oh well 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.640
 in principle, what's the difference here and here they are 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.610
 pack this this mouse will 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.760
 nice enough 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 mother of pearl is such a mouse here that we 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.570
 we see from this side man in china 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.510
 and so on as usual and that we 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.570
 here how many batteries and here for two 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.010
 penlight batteries but small and you 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 now i will put see how she is 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.920
 will work in general nothing special well 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.939
 Here is such a mouse so the manufacturer 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.820
 writes that these batteries are not enough and not 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.619
 these particular batteries in general 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.770
 the work of this mouse with batteries is enough 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.460
 for a long time is not described for how long well 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:40.610
 maybe 5 months to 6 can our year 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.610
 even see now we put it like this 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.160
 that's all she sees as she is flat 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:56.830
 interesting and of course the mouse is pretty 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:02:00.650
 well now we have it so here on black 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:06.490
 of course, the red rug looks 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:12.320
 not bad but now we have it all for them 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:17.690
 defined so now turn on the mouse 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:26.630
 there is a small switch 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:29.300
 so you can see the cursor running on here on 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.180
 in the cinema and in the shadow store there is here 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.080
 such a version of this version 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.459
 mice, too, of various colors practically 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.400
 It looks like a flat one too , at a price of 161 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.060
 ruble today can be ordered 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.500
 I'll give a reference later 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.489
 they are so soft 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.050
 In general, it is audible that but it clicks 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.760
 there is another button you can see this 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:05.030
 we probably speed 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:07.370
 the cursor and yes it is so well, that's not 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.630
 I know it turns off or not 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.530
 wait see if there is a shutdown 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.769
 after a certain time there may be 30 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.810
 15 seconds you can see it all flashes 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.170
 by itself if you see now 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.800
 closer here and so did see no she 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.489
 blinking 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:34.550
 Now let's see at least one minute. 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:36.500
 let's wait well 1 minute has passed mouse 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.800
 still not flashing that is she constantly 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.400
 works probably have to be turned off 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.890
 use this switch 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.390
 which she has although not very comfortable 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.220
 made by no button 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.490
 so turning it off is not very convenient 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.520
 should in theory be turned off but 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:05.620
 okay practice will show there will be seen 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:09.190
 how much is enough of it in work again 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.110
 I say that I can leave a reference on this 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.770
 Well, who cares? 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.130
 look all thank you for your attention everyone 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.130
 good luck
