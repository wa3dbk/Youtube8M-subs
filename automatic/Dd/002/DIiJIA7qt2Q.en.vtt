00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
you explain to me what high-altitude

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.559 
you explain to me what high-altitude
training<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:31.039> all<00:01:31.189> about<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.670> why<00:01:31.939> it

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
training is all about and why it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.870 
training is all about and why it
improves<00:01:32.990> swimming<00:01:33.560> ability<00:01:33.920> your<00:01:34.640> body

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
improves swimming ability your body

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.919 
improves swimming ability your body
responds<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.909> change<00:01:37.909> in<00:01:38.179> atmospheric

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
responds to the change in atmospheric

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.279 
responds to the change in atmospheric
pressure<00:01:39.579> to<00:01:40.579> produce<00:01:41.119> more<00:01:41.539> red<00:01:41.780> blood<00:01:41.810> cells

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
pressure to produce more red blood cells

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.309 
pressure to produce more red blood cells
we<00:01:42.770> get<00:01:42.979> all<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.580> extra<00:01:44.149> oxygen<00:01:44.420> carrying

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
we get all this extra oxygen carrying

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.100 
we get all this extra oxygen carrying
capacity<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:46.369> stays<00:01:46.819> with<00:01:46.849> you<00:01:47.329> when<00:01:48.020> you

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
capacity that stays with you when you

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.670 
capacity that stays with you when you
leave<00:01:48.159> altitude<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.429> that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
leave altitude and that

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.230 
leave altitude and that
swim<00:01:51.680> faster<00:01:52.250> for<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> longer<00:01:52.700> period<00:01:52.969> of<00:01:53.180> time

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
swim faster for a longer period of time

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.850 
swim faster for a longer period of time
do<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.869> notice<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.259> difference<00:01:54.560> when<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.740> go

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
do you notice the difference when you go

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.020 
do you notice the difference when you go
out<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.159> training<00:01:55.840> definitely<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:58.520> makes<00:01:58.759> huge

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
out to training definitely it makes huge

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.730 
out to training definitely it makes huge
difference<00:01:59.420> in<00:01:59.539> their<00:01:59.659> down<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.049> sea<00:02:00.380> level

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
difference in their down that sea level

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.410 
difference in their down that sea level
competing<00:02:01.220> against<00:02:01.490> other<00:02:01.610> teams<00:02:01.909> it's

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
competing against other teams it's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.060 
competing against other teams it's
really<00:02:02.720> dig<00:02:02.929> to<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> heart<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.439> altitude

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
really dig to the heart of altitude

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.709 
really dig to the heart of altitude
training<00:02:04.280> because<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.240> don't<00:02:05.420> know<00:02:05.509> anything

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
training because you don't know anything

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.639 
training because you don't know anything
about<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.289> invented<00:02:06.799> altitude<00:02:07.310> training

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
about it I invented altitude training

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.830 
about it I invented altitude training
record<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:11.000> good<00:02:12.970> hi<00:02:13.970> do<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.630> lot<00:02:14.810> of

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
record that it is good hi do a lot of

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.449 
record that it is good hi do a lot of
people<00:02:15.050> have<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> hard<00:02:15.530> time<00:02:15.709> adjusting<00:02:15.920> did

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
people have a hard time adjusting did

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.680 
people have a hard time adjusting did
you<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> hard<00:02:16.849> time<00:02:16.940> adjusting<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.630> you

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
you have a hard time adjusting when you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.080 
you have a hard time adjusting when you
came<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.019> yeah<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.340> takes<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.730> i<00:02:19.819> think<00:02:19.880> it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
came here yeah it takes it i think it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.400 
came here yeah it takes it i think it
takes<00:02:20.209> about<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.480> month<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.810> kind<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.260> adjust

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
takes about a month to kind of adjust

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.949 
takes about a month to kind of adjust
would<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.400> recommend<00:02:22.849> high<00:02:23.540> altitude

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
would you recommend high altitude

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.240 
would you recommend high altitude
training<00:02:24.049> trips<00:02:24.380> for<00:02:24.560> other<00:02:24.680> club<00:02:25.040> teams

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
training trips for other club teams

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.009 
training trips for other club teams
around<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.489> country<00:02:25.580> yeah<00:02:26.360> i<00:02:26.390> think<00:02:26.720> it's

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
around the country yeah i think it's

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.839 
around the country yeah i think it's
definitely<00:02:27.230> beneficial<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.519> American

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
definitely beneficial if the American

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.490 
definitely beneficial if the American
Gladiators<00:02:29.299> can<00:02:29.540> ever<00:02:29.690> come<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.959> Flagstaff<00:02:30.380> to

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
Gladiators can ever come to Flagstaff to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.400 
Gladiators can ever come to Flagstaff to
