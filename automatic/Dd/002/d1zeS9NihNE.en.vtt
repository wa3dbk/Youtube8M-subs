playing<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.579> bands<00:00:38.760> nobody<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:39.329> told<00:00:39.480> me

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
playing in bands nobody really told me

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150

thing<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.750> ride<00:02:08.929> on<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.500> Bell<00:02:09.679> playing

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
thing on the ride on the Bell playing

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.860 
thing on the ride on the Bell playing
that<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:10.970> can<00:02:11.090> sort<00:02:11.269> of<00:02:11.330> move<00:02:11.480> around<00:02:11.630> the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
that and you can sort of move around the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.630 
that and you can sort of move around the
drums<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.170> little<00:02:12.349> bit<00:02:12.470> if<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.739> like<00:02:12.950> but<00:02:13.459> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
drums a little bit if you like but the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.370 
drums a little bit if you like but the
most<00:02:13.970> important<00:02:14.450> part<00:02:14.599> about<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.959> rhythm<00:02:15.170> is

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
most important part about that rhythm is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.809 
most important part about that rhythm is
what<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.739> snare<00:02:15.980> drum<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.340> really<00:02:16.610> doing

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
what the snare drum was really doing

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.400 
what the snare drum was really doing
there<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> accents<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.930> ghost<00:02:18.170> notes

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
there so the accents and the ghost notes

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.250 
there so the accents and the ghost notes
very<00:02:18.680> important<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.360> would<00:02:20.750> practice<00:02:20.900> that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
very important so I would practice that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.320 
very important so I would practice that
very<00:02:21.680> very<00:02:22.010> slowly<00:02:22.310> until<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.850> sort<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.180> got<00:02:23.299> a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
very very slowly until you sort of got a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.050 
very very slowly until you sort of got a
real<00:02:23.569> grasp<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.700> move<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.819> around<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
real grasp on it move it around the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.180 
real grasp on it move it around the
drums<00:02:26.299> do<00:02:26.690> some<00:02:26.900> fills<00:02:27.200> coming<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:27.950> out<00:02:28.010> of

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
drums do some fills coming in and out of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.680 
drums do some fills coming in and out of
it<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.430> kind<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.730> thing<00:02:28.940> because<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.390> have

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
it that kind of thing because you have

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.259 
it that kind of thing because you have
to<00:02:30.019> do<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> big<00:02:30.950> feel<00:02:31.190> leading<00:02:31.610> into<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:31.850> chorus

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
to do a big feel leading into a chorus

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.729 
to do a big feel leading into a chorus
to<00:02:32.450> go<00:02:32.569> into<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.900> groove<00:02:33.230> or<00:02:33.380> it's<00:02:33.500> really

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
to go into that groove or it's really

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
in the in this particular pattern I

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.240
