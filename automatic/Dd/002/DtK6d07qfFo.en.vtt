gun it's actually really awesome it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.830 
gun it's actually really awesome it's
kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> UH<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.760> an<00:00:35.880> lmg<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.750> its

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
kind of like a UH it's an lmg but its

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.619 
kind of like a UH it's an lmg but its
power<00:00:37.110> housley<00:00:37.710> accurate<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:39.149> really

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
power housley accurate and it's really

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.330 
power housley accurate and it's really
hard<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.020> multi<00:00:40.379> kills<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.860> unless

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
hard to get multi kills with unless

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.880 
hard to get multi kills with unless
they're<00:00:41.640> already<00:00:41.879> damaged<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.469> not

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
they're already damaged because it's not

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
they're already damaged because it's not
really<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> strong<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> has<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> fire

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
really that strong but it has a fire

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
really that strong but it has a fire
rate<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.010> makes<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
rate so it kind of makes up for it it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.420 
rate so it kind of makes up for it it
can<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> beast<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
can be a beast if you really get that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.160 
can be a beast if you really get that
first<00:00:50.730> shot<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.360> him<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.660> he<00:00:51.750> landed
