00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.190
 as of the Italian it is never bourgeois e 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 cafu a substantially 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.150
 intelligent eburina and comedy 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 French cia how to say a nice one 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 a little bit more bourgeois this is innovative 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 compared to an Italian film I like it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 very much the story of the film that is less in two 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 words you know this very rich man 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 and very lonely they find each other's night 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.340
 christmas to rent to hire a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.680
 theater company just to create 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.280
 around the family a family 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.280
 perfect fake fake but that stall 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.860
 I am his wife I am his wife 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.590
 landlady 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.590
 and the perfect one 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.469
 one Christmas night there is always the fireplace 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.800
 lit the tree done the table well 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.260
 then I am his wife in the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.970
 actually I am the wife of the comic leader of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.360
 this company that would be marco 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.360
 yellowish 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.970
 they are hired by sergio 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.409
 castellitto that lion a single person 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.180
 basically that will take this 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.590
 company I have to interpret their own 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.030
 family on christmas day and second 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.299
 me here is also treated 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.039
 loneliness of this character who 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.039
 fun but also really lonely 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.570
 there is an artistic family that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.850
 theater company and there are the typical ones 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.409
 dynamic theater company do me 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.570
 it's very funny because there are so many 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.490
 things that I recognize maybe for one 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.310
 I lived directly but I am 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.229
 exactly those and then there are the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 dynamics from real family and in each 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.170
 In case there is always something wobbling 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.380
 But it is fun to bring out the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380
 flaws 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.070
 I know very well why 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.800
 now a few years that I don't come but 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.479
 I spent several states 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.030
 this place even my son is 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.990
 was conceived in todi for which they are 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.870
 bound 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.330
 yes no a crazy revelation and for which 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.130
 I am very happy to stay here because it is 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.170
 really what the city says 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.170
 most pleasant europe 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.180
 perfect smiling family not 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.220
 maybe the family is beautiful 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.650
 because it is not perfect because it is full of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.540
 edges because full of contradictions 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.989
 that full of contrasts but perhaps that one 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.989
 its nice
