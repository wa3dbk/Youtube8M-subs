00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
follow the path around here to this

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.060 
follow the path around here to this
crossroad<00:04:41.870> now<00:04:42.870> these<00:04:43.050> spirits<00:04:43.440> again<00:04:43.740> can<00:04:43.950> be

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
crossroad now these spirits again can be
