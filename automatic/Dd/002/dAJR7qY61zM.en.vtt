hey<00:00:48.059> we're<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.480> pretty<00:00:48.719> much<00:00:48.840> closer<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
hey we're up here pretty much closer to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
hey we're up here pretty much closer to
this<00:00:49.920> barge<00:00:50.789> looks<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.600> three<00:00:52.260> wide

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
this barge looks like it's three wide

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
this barge looks like it's three wide
and<00:00:52.890> four<00:00:53.129> deep<00:00:53.539> that<00:00:54.539> king<00:00:54.750> tank<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.170> many<00:00:55.410> as

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and four deep that king tank as many as

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
and four deep that king tank as many as
five<00:00:56.160> deep<00:00:58.789> fishing<00:00:59.789> boats<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.329> passed

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
five deep fishing boats just passed

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.750 
five deep fishing boats just passed
including<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.260> jet<00:01:01.500> ski<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.280> comes<00:01:02.489> two

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
including a jet ski and here comes two

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.020 
including a jet ski and here comes two
more<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:05.159> making<00:01:05.729> some<00:01:05.880> waves

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
more and this are making some waves

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
more and this are making some waves
coming<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.170> also

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
coming my way but also

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219 
coming my way but also
we<00:01:08.579> got<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> outflow<00:01:09.329> from<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.780> end<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
we got the outflow from this end of the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
we got the outflow from this end of the
power<00:01:10.439> plant<00:01:10.859> so<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.490> making<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.969> Kern<00:01:12.179> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
power plant so that's making the Kern a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
power plant so that's making the Kern a
little<00:01:12.479> bit<00:01:12.569> faster<00:01:13.079> so<00:01:13.259> I<00:01:13.289> got<00:01:13.469> to<00:01:13.590> come<00:01:13.740> out

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
little bit faster so I got to come out

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
little bit faster so I got to come out
from<00:01:14.069> behind<00:01:14.100> these<00:01:14.549> pylons<00:01:15.289> go<00:01:16.289> over<00:01:16.469> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
from behind these pylons go over in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.590 
from behind these pylons go over in
front<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.069> one<00:01:17.340> pretty<00:01:18.119> soon<00:01:18.359> I'm<00:01:18.479> going

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
front of this one pretty soon I'm going

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
front of this one pretty soon I'm going
to<00:01:18.659> take<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:20.130> geocache<00:01:20.670> program

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to take a little of the geocache program

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.819 
to take a little of the geocache program
and<00:01:21.420> check<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.840> where<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> need<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> cross

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
and check and see where I need to cross

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.969 
and check and see where I need to cross
the<00:01:23.069> river<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> find<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.789> good<00:01:23.969> ship<00:01:24.979> okay

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the river to find the good ship okay

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.410 
the river to find the good ship okay
right<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.429> we're<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.789> process<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
right here we're in the process of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.359 
right here we're in the process of
crossing<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.049> Ohio<00:01:28.439> site<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> Kentucky

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
crossing to the Ohio site the Kentucky

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.510 
crossing to the Ohio site the Kentucky
side<00:01:29.840> down<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.049> way<00:01:31.289> you<00:01:31.349> see<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.770> 275

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
side down this way you see the 275

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.620 
side down this way you see the 275
bridge<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.549> according<00:01:35.969> to<00:01:36.000> my<00:01:36.119> geocache

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
bridge and according to my geocache

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
bridge and according to my geocache
coordinates<00:01:37.289> there<00:01:37.439> supposed<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.859> be<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> Creek

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
coordinates there supposed to be a Creek

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.709 
coordinates there supposed to be a Creek
over<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.789> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.969> other<00:01:39.090> side<00:01:39.329> which<00:01:39.599> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
Kentucky side yeah took a geocache

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.219 
Kentucky side yeah took a geocache
coordinate<00:01:45.119> reading<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.629> says<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.049> about

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
coordinate reading it says we're about

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.910 
coordinate reading it says we're about
4/10<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.069> mile<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.939> ghostship<00:01:48.920> so
