pound<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.040> country's<00:00:05.370> minivan<00:00:06.230> a<00:00:08.059> few<00:00:09.059> days

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
pound of country's minivan a few days

pound of country's minivan a few days
ago<00:00:09.679> this<00:00:10.679> being<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.099> sprung<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> leak<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
ago this being a sprung a leak on the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.470 
ago this being a sprung a leak on the
fuel<00:00:12.660> line<00:00:13.190> which<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.700> connected<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> fuel

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
fuel line which is connected to the fuel

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.510 
fuel line which is connected to the fuel
rail<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.049> cannot<00:00:16.379> buy<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> fuel

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
rail and you cannot buy just the fuel

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.490 
rail and you cannot buy just the fuel
line<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.359> buy<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> whole<00:00:18.900> rail<00:00:19.170> with

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
line you have to buy the whole rail with

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.250 
line you have to buy the whole rail with
the<00:00:19.619> line<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.390> go<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> junkyard<00:00:21.960> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the line so just go to a junkyard you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.279 
the line so just go to a junkyard you
could<00:00:22.410> probably<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.810> as<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:24.960> see

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
could probably get one as you can see

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.670 
could probably get one as you can see
this<00:00:25.470> rubble<00:00:26.220> line<00:00:26.430> right<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.680> usually

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
this rubble line right here usually

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
this rubble line right here usually
breaks<00:00:29.220> usually<00:00:30.179> cracks<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:30.960> by<00:00:31.140> this

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
breaks usually cracks right here by this

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.830 
breaks usually cracks right here by this
connection<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> can't<00:00:32.820> fuse<00:00:33.570> one

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
connection so you can't fuse one

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.750 
connection so you can't fuse one
together<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.469> tried<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.160> because

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
together like I tried to do here because

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.440 
together like I tried to do here because
it<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.059> won't<00:00:36.180> work

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it just won't work

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
it just won't work
it'll<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.110> keep<00:00:37.469> getting<00:00:38.250> gas<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.730> that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it'll just keep getting gas out of that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.540 
it'll just keep getting gas out of that
line<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.879> what<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> did<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.360> came<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.550> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
line so what I did was came in here and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.630 
line so what I did was came in here and
I<00:00:44.879> thought<00:00:45.800> right<00:00:46.800> he's<00:00:46.950> great<00:00:47.129> down<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I thought right he's great down here is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.119 
I thought right he's great down here is
where<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> fuel<00:00:48.120> line<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.809> leaking

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
where the fuel line is it was leaking

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.970 
where the fuel line is it was leaking
and<00:00:50.390> are<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.530> if

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and are you going to get that off is if

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.560 
and are you going to get that off is if
you<00:00:53.219> reach<00:00:53.399> down<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:54.000> there's<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you reach down in there there's a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
you reach down in there there's a
plastic<00:00:54.809> piece<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> push<00:00:56.489> up

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
plastic piece that you have to push up

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.819 
plastic piece that you have to push up
into<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.210> sleeve<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.980> then<00:00:58.980> pull<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> line<00:00:59.609> off

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
into a sleeve and then pull the line off

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
into a sleeve and then pull the line off
it<00:01:01.829> comes<00:01:02.039> off<00:01:02.190> pretty<00:01:02.550> easy<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it comes off pretty easy but you want to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.359 
it comes off pretty easy but you want to
remove<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.939> spark<00:01:06.240> plug<00:01:06.450> wires

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
remove this here the spark plug wires

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.410 
remove this here the spark plug wires
disconnect<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> wiring<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
disconnect all the wiring to that and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
disconnect all the wiring to that and
take<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.530> careful<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:10.950> put

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that right inside then you need to take

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
that right inside then you need to take
the<00:01:13.920> injectors<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:15.240> four<00:01:15.869> bolts<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.439> bolt

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
get those ones on the inside then you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.380 
get those ones on the inside then you
can<00:01:30.229> get<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:32.579> by<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.180> way

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
can get this out just by going this way

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.120 
can get this out just by going this way
you<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> remove<00:01:34.140> some<00:01:34.200> stuff<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:34.920> even

you have to remove some stuff don't even
try<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> without<00:01:35.820> removing<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.390> stuff

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
try to do it without removing that stuff

try to do it without removing that stuff
because<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.439> won't<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.770> able<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> get<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
because you won't be able to get it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.730 
because you won't be able to get it
through<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> remove<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.780> which

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
is the fuel the gas pedal lines and if

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.580 
is the fuel the gas pedal lines and if
you<00:01:46.470> unplug<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.950> plug<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.320> remove

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
