00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
how's it going guys today we are going

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.710 
how's it going guys today we are going
to<00:00:01.860> be<00:00:01.949> looking<00:00:02.250> at<00:00:02.399> importing<00:00:03.000> static<00:00:03.449> meshes

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
to be looking at importing static meshes

to be looking at importing static meshes
from<00:00:04.350> blender<00:00:04.770> with<00:00:05.490> collision<00:00:06.000> information

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
from blender with collision information

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.410 
from blender with collision information
if<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.859> notice<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.280> front<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.580> me<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
if you notice in front of me I have a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.570 
if you notice in front of me I have a
cube<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:11.099> recently<00:00:11.849> imported<00:00:12.410> and

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
cube that I have recently imported and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
cube that I have recently imported and
when<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> attempt<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:17.150> walk<00:00:18.150> through<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.810> get

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
when I attempt to walk through it I get

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.759 
when I attempt to walk through it I get
stopped<00:00:19.439> by<00:00:19.800> its<00:00:20.010> collision<00:00:20.430> information

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
stopped by its collision information

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.900 
stopped by its collision information
throughout<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> course<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.369> video<00:00:23.550> we

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
throughout the course of this video we

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.640 
throughout the course of this video we
will<00:00:24.029> go<00:00:24.180> through<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.539> modeling<00:00:24.990> process<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
will go through the modeling process the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.259 
will go through the modeling process the
export<00:00:26.070> process<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.000> import<00:00:27.390> process

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
export process and the import process

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.770 
export process and the import process
so<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> begin<00:00:31.070> fire<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.489> blender<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:33.480> using

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so to begin fire up in blender I'm using

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.920 
so to begin fire up in blender I'm using
blender<00:00:34.170> 2.7<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.730> we're<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> start<00:00:36.809> off

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
blender 2.7 and we're going to start off

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
blender 2.7 and we're going to start off
with<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.200> default<00:00:37.590> cube<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.100> am<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.730> go

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
with the default cube I am going to go

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.840 
with the default cube I am going to go
ahead<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.770> move<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:42.649> camera<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.040> lamp<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
ahead and move the camera and lamp to a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.830 
ahead and move the camera and lamp to a
different<00:00:45.210> layer<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.850> here<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
different layer and here we have the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.790 
different layer and here we have the
cube<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.149> modeling

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
cube that we are going to be modeling

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.170 
cube that we are going to be modeling
now<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> make<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:54.030> better

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
now to make it look a little bit better

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.380 
now to make it look a little bit better
I'm<00:00:54.660> gonna<00:00:54.870> defer<00:00:55.289> San<00:00:55.559> able<00:00:56.120> screencast<00:00:57.120> keys

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
I'm gonna defer San able screencast keys

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
I'm gonna defer San able screencast keys
for<00:00:57.629> myself<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.789> see<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.449> I'm

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
for myself so that you can see what I'm

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.910 
for myself so that you can see what I'm
doing<00:01:00.570> over<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> bottom<00:01:01.710> left

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
doing over there here in the bottom left

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910 
doing over there here in the bottom left
hand<00:01:01.980> corner<00:01:02.989> we're<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.350> add<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> simple

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
hand corner we're going to add a simple

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
hand corner we're going to add a simple
bevel<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.450> bevel<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> down<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> little

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
bevel to it just bevel it down a little

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.399 
bevel to it just bevel it down a little
bit<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.510> I'm<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
bit like that I'm going to go to the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
bit like that I'm going to go to the
subdivision<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> modifiers<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> add

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
subdivision or to the modifiers and add

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.800 
subdivision or to the modifiers and add
a<00:01:12.869> subdivision<00:01:13.380> surface<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:15.210> smooth<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.630> out

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
a subdivision surface just smooth it out

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.440 
a subdivision surface just smooth it out
quite<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:17.580> we're<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:18.210> ahead

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
quite a bit and we're going to go ahead

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
quite a bit and we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:18.659> apply<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.409> modifier<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.400> we're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and apply this modifier because we're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
and apply this modifier because we're
done<00:01:20.700> modeling<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.720> problem<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.500> we

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
done modeling so the problem is if we

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.679 
done modeling so the problem is if we
exported<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> imported<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> into

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
exported this now and imported it into

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
exported this now and imported it into
unreal<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.430> mesh<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.150> no<00:01:30.360> collision

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
unreal the mesh would have no collision

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.569 
unreal the mesh would have no collision
information<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> player<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> clip

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
information and the player would a clip

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.630 
information and the player would a clip
right<00:01:32.909> through<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.110> undesired<00:01:34.640> we

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
right through it that is undesired we

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.899 
right through it that is undesired we
want<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> player<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.829> collide<00:01:37.829> with<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.250> box

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
want the player to collide with this box

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.899 
want the player to collide with this box
so<00:01:39.390> how<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.520> how<00:01:41.520> we're<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so how do we do that how we're going to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
so how do we do that how we're going to
do<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> by<00:01:42.630> adding<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.470> another<00:01:44.220> mesh

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
do that is by adding in a another mesh

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.800 
do that is by adding in a another mesh
on<00:01:44.850> top<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:46.369> will<00:01:47.369> tell<00:01:47.820> unreal<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on top of this that will tell unreal to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.770 
on top of this that will tell unreal to
use<00:01:49.409> me<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> collision<00:01:52.290> information<00:01:53.780> so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
use me as the collision information so

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.560 
use me as the collision information so
go<00:01:55.259> ahead<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> hit<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.340> go<00:01:57.090> ahead<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.450> add<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
go ahead and hit can go ahead and add a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.670 
go ahead and hit can go ahead and add a
new<00:01:57.840> cube<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.390> this<00:02:00.390> will<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.930> collision

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
new cube and this will be the collision

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.539 
new cube and this will be the collision
information<00:02:02.329> to<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.750> cube<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.399> now<00:02:05.399> I'm

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
information to this cube here now I'm

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.920 
information to this cube here now I'm
going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.909> go<00:02:06.030> ahead<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.479> move<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
going to go ahead and move this to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.630 
going to go ahead and move this to
another<00:02:07.350> layer<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:08.039> it's

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
another layer because it's

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.540 
another layer because it's
and<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.050> mean<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:11.100> know<00:02:11.130> we

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and up in my way but I mean you know we

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.230 
and up in my way but I mean you know we
can<00:02:11.670> talk<00:02:11.910> about<00:02:12.090> these<00:02:12.450> own<00:02:12.630> if<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.810> want<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
can talk about these own if we want to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.900 
can talk about these own if we want to
so<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.810> looks<00:02:16.020> good<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.520> would<00:02:17.760> be

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
so that looks good I I would be

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.090 
so that looks good I I would be
perfectly<00:02:18.750> fine<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.680> collision

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
perfectly fine with this collision

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.600 
perfectly fine with this collision
volume<00:02:20.640> around<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.600> cube<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.160> problem<00:02:23.520> is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
volume around this cube the problem is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.420 
volume around this cube the problem is
is<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.630> we<00:02:24.810> export<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> bit<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.860> as<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.310> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
is that if we export a bit like as it is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.980 
is that if we export a bit like as it is
now

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
now

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.750 
now
unreal<00:02:27.990> wouldn't<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> use<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.220> cube<00:02:29.550> as

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
unreal wouldn't know to use this cube as

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.280 
unreal wouldn't know to use this cube as
collision<00:02:30.660> information<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.430> to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
collision information so we have to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.310 
collision information so we have to
rename<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.620> cube<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.430> tell<00:02:35.730> unreal<00:02:36.150> hey<00:02:36.510> use

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
rename this cube to tell unreal hey use

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.430 
rename this cube to tell unreal hey use
me<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.770> collision<00:02:38.280> information<00:02:39.110> we<00:02:40.110> do<00:02:40.260> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
me as a collision information we do that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.390 
me as a collision information we do that
by<00:02:40.709> renaming<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.520> cube<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:43.040> give<00:02:44.040> me<00:02:44.070> X

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
by renaming of the cube to be give me X

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.910 
by renaming of the cube to be give me X
underscore<00:02:44.910> cute<00:02:45.890> such<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.959> there<00:02:49.650> are

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
underscore cute such and so so there are

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
underscore cute such and so so there are
a<00:02:49.950> couple<00:02:50.190> types<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.610> different<00:02:50.940> collision

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
a couple types of different collision

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.170 
a couple types of different collision
that<00:02:51.810> unreal<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.410> recognize<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.519> first<00:02:53.850> one

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
that unreal will recognize the first one

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.920 
that unreal will recognize the first one
is<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.080> box<00:02:55.320> which<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.800> UV<00:02:56.310> x<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:57.450> second<00:02:57.810> one

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
is the box which is UV x the second one

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.040 
is the box which is UV x the second one
is<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.500> sphere<00:02:59.040> which<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.310> say<00:02:59.550> USP<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
is a sphere which is say USP and the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.380 
is a sphere which is say USP and the
third<00:03:01.440> one<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.610> see<00:03:02.820> X<00:03:03.000> which<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.360> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
third one is a you see X which is a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.160 
third one is a you see X which is a
convex<00:03:04.140> object<00:03:04.950> which<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.970> something<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.989> is

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
convex object which is something that is

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.250 
convex object which is something that is
not<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.470> cube<00:03:07.890> or<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.160> sphere<00:03:08.450> okay<00:03:09.860> generic<00:03:10.860> so

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
not a cube or a sphere okay generic so

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.370 
not a cube or a sphere okay generic so
we<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.440> go<00:03:13.560> ahead<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.070> export<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.390> UV<00:03:15.840> x<00:03:16.019> cube

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
we can go ahead and export the UV x cube

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.699 
we can go ahead and export the UV x cube
and<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.799> cube<00:03:17.750> note<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.140> UV<00:03:19.530> X

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
and the cube note that the UV X

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.520 
and the cube note that the UV X
underscore<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.940> then<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.840> has<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.410> be

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
underscore and then this this has to be

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.770 
underscore and then this this has to be
the<00:03:22.680> same<00:03:22.980> name<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.519> object<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.540> want

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the same name of the object that we want

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.410 
the same name of the object that we want
to<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:26.250> we<00:03:26.370> want<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.610> tie<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.880> collision

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
to that we want to tie the collision

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.610 
to that we want to tie the collision
information<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:29.299> so<00:03:30.299> let's<00:03:31.230> start<00:03:31.470> off<00:03:31.560> by

and now we have our cube which we can
place<00:05:33.340> we<00:05:34.060> can<00:05:34.330> move<00:05:35.640> we<00:05:36.640> can<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:38.020> collide

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
place we can move we can and collide

place we can move we can and collide
with<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.060> which<00:05:40.060> is<00:05:40.180> good<00:05:41.940> double<00:05:42.940> click<00:05:43.120> on<00:05:43.300> it

you can open up the aesthetic mesh tool

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.390 
you can open up the aesthetic mesh tool
and<00:05:46.030> you<00:05:46.690> are<00:05:46.810> given<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.169> viewport<00:05:47.650> with<00:05:47.950> you

details<00:05:54.700> of<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.240> mesh<00:05:55.390> we<00:05:56.260> can<00:05:56.410> also<00:05:56.560> see<00:05:56.919> the

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
details of the mesh we can also see the

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.990 
details of the mesh we can also see the
collision<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:58.050> we<00:05:59.050> do<00:05:59.260> see<00:05:59.500> that<00:05:59.770> it<00:06:00.460> is<00:06:00.610> using

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
collision and we do see that it is using

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.159 
collision and we do see that it is using
the<00:06:01.330> box<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:02.350> we<00:06:02.500> used<00:06:03.720> for<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.810> collision

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
the box that we used for the collision

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.190 
the box that we used for the collision
information<00:06:05.970> so<00:06:06.970> this<00:06:07.120> was<00:06:07.360> a<00:06:07.390> very<00:06:07.900> quick
