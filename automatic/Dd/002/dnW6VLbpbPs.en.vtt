00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
so the first part of this tutorial is

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.870 
so the first part of this tutorial is
the<00:00:42.840> Rama<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.220> I<00:00:44.250> take<00:00:44.700> about

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
the Rama as you can see I take about

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.020 
the Rama as you can see I take about
four<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.690> five<00:00:45.720> steps<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.380> this<00:00:46.620> direction

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
four to five steps to this direction

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
four to five steps to this direction
also<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.240> is<00:00:48.450> very<00:00:48.660> important<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.290> have<00:00:49.440> your

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
also it is very important to have your

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.530 
also it is very important to have your
body<00:00:49.740> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> right<00:00:50.100> position<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.390> give

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
body in the right position if you give

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.090 
body in the right position if you give
too<00:00:51.720> much<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> back<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.620> ball<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:52.980> go

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
too much to the back the ball will go

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
too much to the back the ball will go
too<00:00:53.160> high<00:00:53.490> and<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.150> lean<00:00:54.360> too<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:54.540> in<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
too high and if you lean too much in the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.280 
too high and if you lean too much in the
front

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
front

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.200 
front
the<00:00:55.380> ball<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.830> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.130> ground<00:00:56.310> so<00:00:57.090> that's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the ball will go to the ground so that's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.850 
the ball will go to the ground so that's
not<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.320> need<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> make
