00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 Y 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.730
 hello talks to them andres javi stop 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.530
 android and today I bring you a 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.840
 video that promised a long time ago and finally 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.000
 is here is the widget video that 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.180
 always occupied and the videos come out almost 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.420
 always this widget is called hÃ¼ller but 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.100
 to apply it we need to use w that 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.100
 is the application that will practically do 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.170
 everything to install s &amp; w should only 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.840
 look for it in the place thor and install it 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.199
 as any application use that w 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.140
 it works from android 2.2 onwards 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.050
 once you install that w are going to 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.879
 look for the topic that I have cooler but 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.679
 if they do not like to play they can search 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.010
 any corner on the place thor with 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.600
 just put you s &amp; w skin once 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.789
 that have everything installed should only 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.530
 put a widget on your screen the 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.659
 as long as it is going to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.239
 adjust select the skin that 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.339
 like in this case is Julian's and 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.679
 then they will have to add another widget 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.809
 the togolese hotspots this is just 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.180
 momentary and is to be able to create 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.460
 shortcuts make sure that the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.420
 padlock is open once opened 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.850
 they only touch 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.670
 and a menu will activate this is for 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.409
 configure it in world access point yo 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.439
 I always select the application of 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.750
 clock and in point 2 the calendar 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.759
 but if you want they can put something else 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.340
 of their decision once they do that 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.890
 they just block the widget from the side 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.570
 top right and if you like you can 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.330
 remove the padlock widget no longer 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.250
 will be necessary and this would be all already go 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.409
 to be able to adjust the widget to the size that 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.470
 you want if you do not like the subject 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.500
 of July I recommend elegant or as 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.360

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.460
