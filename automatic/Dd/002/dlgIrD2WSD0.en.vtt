00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.309
 we started with this medical procedure called in Hebrew endoscopy that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 combines science and technology by saving many lives 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.079
 Fernando Lopez, 33 years old, began to experience severe pain in 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.220
 the extremities 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.449
 Optical difficulty memory loss and constant headache 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.889
 the patient has had a tac and a colon cyst seter peter sehr 

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:26.470
 ventricle is to say 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.260
 a rare disease that lies in the appearance of a small tumor 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.120
 left in the center of the brain 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.560
 and for the coupon one million in the morning 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.380
 I lost consciousness 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.040
 mussi and I do not know how he got to the house 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030
 the only thing that I remember a gene 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 I used to work 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 and I was awakened by the short list 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 never again more brands 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.260
 According to the specialist Juan Fernando Ramón 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.289
 the patient was operated on by the same pathology two years ago but the 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.680
 surgery did not yield the expected result and the cyst that presents 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.290
 fernando lópez grew and generated more damage by creating strong pressure on the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.620
 center of your brain 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.220
 the road project 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.960
 it deserves the weird the operation because 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 because I feel good about your normal job 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.690
 before I get tired a lot 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.560
 everyone else walking 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.450
 for the 4 5 blocks 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.450
 nebot liver healthy 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.410
 although the patient did not want to have surgery 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.050
 in the wake of the imminent alarm of a possible sudden death the medical board 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.620
 decided to operate through a new, minimally invasive scientific method 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.000
 call of a few as we see in detention centers 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.420
 the third row 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 is going to accumulate 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.770
 a black substance inside the membranes in a very difficult place of 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.090
 enter the brain because we have here very important structures like 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.510
 are basic for memory at this point here 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.510
 although they are also basic for the meeting 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:31.040
 this type x that has a center of Latinos and grows progressively causing 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.670
 hydrocephalus or compression 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.099
 and a vital part of the brain like the hypothalamus 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.850
 which is responsible for regulating the appetite the dream 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.969
 and society through the world 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.819
 according to statistics granted by ramón approximately 1 percent 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.819
 of intracerebral pathologies or tumors 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.120
 good as the case of transportation 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.199
 we have 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.139
 that the space to try at this moment is very small 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.209
 nor the margin of error is very little because we have 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.909
 in the previous part 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.809
 some very important titles for the same never in the lateral parts 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.510
 our central structure the surgical removal is a method 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.799
 effective scientist to correct the problem in its entirety and save a 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:12.170
 lifetime 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.179
 After the patient is operated, immediate results are seen in his health 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.809
 the intracranial pressure is rapidly relieved thereby improving the 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.759
 neurological functions including the euro itself and the yen the euro and the yen 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:25.949
 Camilo 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
 and remembered everything 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.909
 Well, and to expand them to this topic, the neurosurgeon is with us 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.509
 how fernando ramón 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.079
 Doctor ramón very good morning like this 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.399
 Very good days 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:46.349
 tell me where they are best assimilated endoscopy of all 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.720
 Latin America we are pioneers in this of the coup in Latin America 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.870
 let's say that the dam nothing efe 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.529
 anywhere in Latin America as 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.809
 argentina mexico brasil colombia can be done 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.249
 to the same technology of countries 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:01.889
 as North America and Europe 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.999
 what really pioneers in up to 100 in our continent are the 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:10.419
 North Americans may Americans and then Argentina and doctor 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.679
 being brazil 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.569
 and now in colombia we have the latest technology 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.399
 in the last city basically in endoscopy mediating precisely the 

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.779
 I miss endoscopy 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.860
 it really saves many lives is a surgery 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.830
 so important that it saved many lives 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.129
 to see if I believe they are surgeries 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.119
 because basically they are initially based on surgeries that have 

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.389
 always existed and what we do is that we decrease 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.699
 ll the size of the incisions and we improve the technology such point I 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:42.770
 with a camera 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.830
 we can arrive 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.740
 even the most recondite of our brain and be able to do for him if I am very 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.240
 small if ciu and disgusting required 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.360
 first a very long surgical time a few post-operatives much more the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.600
 very difficult recovery and not such ideas 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.990
 more complications 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.120
 iosu obviously improves the forecast is not possible good in this 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.550
 case to the patient what there were many that recovers ram memory and recovers 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.290
 very many 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.290
 bets that I could have lost to that I had already lost 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.509
 in which more the neo endoscopy is put basically in a disc that we already have 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.080
 two clear points none that are those of a few copies of the skull and the brain in 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.270
 that not only for receiving cysts 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.300
 efe is an alternative procedure 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.860
 Ventriculoperitoneal shunts is 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.529
 hydrocephalus c also resections moorings them a high on the road actor 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.699
 but if it fails well we know that besides press this is a complication 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.870
 very very serious 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.510
 Yes, you can treat and improve the quality of life of the patient. 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.830
 percentage 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.260
 I believe that if the procedure is done in time 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.069
 you can improve the patient in its entirety 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.559
 the important thing is is against the patient at the right time to 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.020
 to be able to do that is the ideal 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.520
 ilana a 2 copy the other part have to do with the procedures of 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.229
 columbia in the sequel gets a two glasses 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.949
 increasingly 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.949
 all the science in medicine dimas in surgical techniques 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.339
 they have to be minimally invasive 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.459
 your page we need or page so you can also consult it not 

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:14.810
 only consult us asaja the other 11 st 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.900
 but also if they want to ask you questions or directly I think 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.330
 important for all Latin Americans who are connected 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.159
 with us what is that peace with much use the page is 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:28.909
 robredo broke point or euro min dot net there is coming out on the screen 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:29.680
 houses sell 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.690
 triple talk see a tournament my thing ponteros arias also doctor do not know me 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.569
 go you do not disconnect from six stages 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.189
 this commercials we will talk to you 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.009
 we will tell you what is the reason 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.110
 when which establishes the art 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.319
 a different way 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.409
 before that we have our first priority
