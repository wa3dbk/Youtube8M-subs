fun

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.320 

I<00:02:48.200> think<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.130> they<00:02:49.280> taught<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.090> solve

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
I think that they taught you to solve

00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:24.630 
I think that they taught you to solve
this<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.690> better<00:02:50.870> way<00:02:51.110> so<00:03:22.720> as<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.410> here

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
this in a better way so as you see here

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.790 
this in a better way so as you see here
with<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.760> knife<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:26.239> wouldn't<00:03:27.230> recommend<00:03:27.530> it

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
with the knife I wouldn't recommend it

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.580 
with the knife I wouldn't recommend it
you<00:03:27.920> try<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.220> out<00:03:29.050> because<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.350> can't

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
you try it out because you can't
