00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 I went to 20 and it's fucking back. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.270
 look straight is and auto baby schumi 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.109
 High will see 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.109
 eraldo was 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.200
 Galera Beauty talks that fight back with 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 One more video will take you five years. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.230
 and this time to make a speedtest here 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 of the program had ti versus the Osiris for 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 to know which of the two cars runs more 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.080
 terms of startup and everything else 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 I 'm here with the help of the six 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:51.239
 Speech and xix, it 's people and it's beauty. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.880
 beauty that with the g20 and ix goes with 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.949
 that require it to ball then the old 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.530
 remembering that we will not leave with the exit 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.320
 everything does not cheat on you and it's also a 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.900
 ghost thing, that is, it has no help and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.240
 there is also no vacuum in the vacuum which 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.420
 the karate's vacuum a speed and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 help it makes the first one 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.260
 more advantage is mounting to this is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.540
 Truth then, oh, he already gave a start. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.210
 here you can see that the g20 is a 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.729
 little're face to face today 11 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.870
 space is in the front coming up 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 Opel passing now is only in front a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.030
 the other side of the half and half and will be 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.730
 is gaining maximum tightness in the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.270
 legal framework will now pass now 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.990
 passed in a car that will pass the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.400
 draw 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.930
 mano what has earned him because the law 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.380
 face as it had happened in the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.470
 protests osíris got in a part 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.570
 the race is very little good 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 A little twilight 12 years ago. 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.130
 to win the caré race was what kind 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.840
 tied is connected was so little 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.180
 difference today was still in front 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.190
 then redo the test again only 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.530
 that I'm going to get it now 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.090
 Forget the circus will contain 20 beauty 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 So guys, now that I have the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.879
 osiris and the six goes with that of 20 then 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.370
 let's see what happens then 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.900
 now on the second attempt because in the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.940
 first phase and there was little 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.890
 difference of ter 20 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.720
 so now I'll cook for you 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.500
 see if it's going to be the same or vice 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.769
 versa not knowing now who gets out of the turbo 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.260
 although not in a rush of the two is 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.780
 basically the same same damn otter 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.030
 20 left in front 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.180
 I'm going to stay here more side by side 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.890
 arriving here straight on the skin is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.680
 this face you well advanced that you do not 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.550
 you will not be deceived but you will not be 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.910
 that 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.569
 I picked up the speed showed here face 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.970
 People, I'll tell you what if you had it. 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:01.780
 to win will win is very 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:05.390
 relative in the best in the other 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.550
 invitation was the worst without little 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.970
 difference then you think osita 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.860
 won another 20 to face let's do the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.790
 final test now trained now do 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.010
 a final test for us is 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.680
 even needing it because it is also stable 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.440
 this guy plants gained there comes a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.030
 have 20 won another then so the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.010
 cars are basically the same as 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.950
 depends on the luck is on 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.769
 it's basically this then barbie test 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.580
 end now comes what will roll in this 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.459
 Osiris stretch will have greater speed 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.590
 the t20 will have a higher speed or 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.730
 they will be quite relative in terms of 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.250
 velocity 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.799
 let's play there then guys with the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.579
 last test that is now the invitation and the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:53.810
 ix with eleven guys it's very strange and 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:57.560
 sic old is that so the two cars 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.260
 they came to compete in truth, right? 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.269
 are very similar in terms of design in 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.980
 speed you can see that you do not have 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.130
 as much as you have the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.959
 minor was in front also in front 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.810
 with the magazine in front 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.010
 The other victim is only what 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.989
 get close 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.940
 It arrives everything else here is depends on 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.580
 each race but can not define 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.789
 year is giving always speaks is very relative 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.590
 because she has no way of knowing 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.169
 then stood alone in front of another 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.120
 another victim in the old they humans 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.030
 I think he has a little bit of it today. 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.039
 yes a little bit more generate energy 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.690
 There's the test because we know 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.979
 also records his channel remembers a 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.659
 channel should be in this case of the video 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.220
 For those who do not know one step there 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.930
 recorded a test on channel 12 and became 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.220
 little ahead 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.199
 the asset then anyhow today 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.740
 still with the leadership is a 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.660
 a little better thing if a little more 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.610
 do not do not leave it here too 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.620
 the top-20 in a car and you can do it 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.440
 race in a good car too 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.750
 That's it, it's just the videos that have more 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.460
 speed on the track or race like this 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.680
 delegate happens when he is 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.470
 running so he can keep the 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.320
 speed is one thing that is a 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.650
 slightly different in t20 t21 no longer 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.500
 can force as much belly as the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.910
 but kids are good cars and gives to 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.050
 run well with them 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.419
 So that's it, then, I do not know who 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.800
 said they are already exhausting video so do not 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.759
 forget to click on taste to help 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.530
 from the video to help in the 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.229
 disclosure and 29 every day are 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.690
 connected by said 'the chaos around the 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.690
 subscription is ugly
