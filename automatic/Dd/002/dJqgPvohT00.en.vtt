00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
now when you look back I thought we did

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.159 
now when you look back I thought we did
a<00:00:30.189> good<00:00:30.430> job<00:00:30.490> of<00:00:30.730> keeping<00:00:31.270> it<00:00:31.570> together<00:00:31.720> when

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
a good job of keeping it together when

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.540 
a good job of keeping it together when
we<00:00:32.289> didn't<00:00:32.529> start<00:00:32.769> as<00:00:32.920> well<00:00:33.100> as<00:00:33.219> we'd<00:00:33.370> like<00:00:33.489> to

we didn't start as well as we'd like to

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.569 
we didn't start as well as we'd like to
I<00:00:34.030> thought<00:00:34.510> our<00:00:34.569> kids<00:00:34.690> didn't<00:00:35.199> flinch<00:00:35.579> credit

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
or the league obviously and I don't want

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.580 
or the league obviously and I don't want
to<00:01:30.190> say<00:01:30.310> sound<00:01:30.700> cliche<00:01:31.180> but<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.930> know<00:01:32.050> every

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
to say sound cliche but you know every

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.140 
to say sound cliche but you know every
day<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.860> preparation<00:01:33.220> is<00:01:33.670> critically

day of preparation is critically

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.450

important<00:01:34.600> for<00:01:34.750> us<00:01:34.870> we<00:01:35.020> can't<00:01:35.260> afford<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.740> take

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
important for us we can't afford to take

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.970 
important for us we can't afford to take
one<00:01:36.760> step<00:01:37.030> back<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.660> I<00:01:37.900> think<00:01:38.440> we<00:01:38.590> got<00:01:38.620> to<00:01:38.860> do<00:01:38.950> a
