00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.390 
kind of rough idea for her right now is
that<00:02:08.970> she's<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.110> an<00:02:10.319> occupation<00:02:11.009> she's<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that she's like as an occupation she's a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880 
that she's like as an occupation she's a
model<00:02:11.760> um<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:13.020> she<00:02:13.080> has<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.379> get<00:02:13.470> dressed

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
model um so she has to get dressed

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860 
model um so she has to get dressed
up<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> dolled<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.090> everything<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.690> work

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
up and dolled up and everything for work

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.840 
up and dolled up and everything for work
so<00:02:16.170> when<00:02:16.680> she's<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.040> work<00:02:17.340> she<00:02:17.580> really

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
so when she's not work she really

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.050 
so when she's not work she really
prefers<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.290> huge<00:02:20.280> oversized

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
prefers to just be in huge oversized

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.180 
prefers to just be in huge oversized
sweaters<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.670> comfy<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.920> sort<00:02:26.040> of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
sweaters and comfy and just sort of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.880 
sweaters and comfy and just sort of
looked<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.060> slacker<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.530> she<00:02:28.560> goes

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
looked like a slacker but then she goes

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.710 
looked like a slacker but then she goes
to<00:02:29.010> work<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.280> she<00:02:29.400> has<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> get<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:29.880> these<00:02:30.000> like

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to work and she has to get in these like

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.900 
to work and she has to get in these like
awesome<00:02:31.260> dresses<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.890> gowns<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.459> everything

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
awesome dresses and gowns and everything

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.170 
awesome dresses and gowns and everything
but<00:02:34.070> no<00:02:35.070> one<00:02:35.220> would<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.550> looking<00:02:36.090> at

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
but no one would know that looking at

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.520 
but no one would know that looking at
her<00:02:36.270> on<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> street<00:02:36.780> because<00:02:36.990> she<00:02:37.350> just

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
her on the street because she just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.949 
her on the street because she just
dresses<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.820> kid<00:02:39.090> right<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.540> college

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
Nations character so that would be her

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.500
