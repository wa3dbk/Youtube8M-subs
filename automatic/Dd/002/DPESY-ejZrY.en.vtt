00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.410
 today today today we are not going to learn to do 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.390
 nothing of crafts or anything that kind of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.540
 things today we are going to enter another 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.040
 category which is called beauty 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.019
 so today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 homemade scrub for our nails 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.520
 this serves to recover the target of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.670
 the nails we will see what products and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.580
 utensils we will need 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.040
 We are going to need a spoonful of water 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.160
 oxygenated if you do not have the ability to 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.900
 get very easily in the pharmacy 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.059
 we are also going to need two tablespoons 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.450
 sodium bicarbonate or also is 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.760
 knows in sodium bicarbonate the measures 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.309
 they are going to make this spoon of this type 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.300
 of spoon that is called tureens we go 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.300
 to see what utensils 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.740
 and utensils as swabs or also 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.780
 he knows them as cotton swabs 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.730
 and a small bowl to mix because 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 small because the previous amounts 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.230
 that I mentioned are very minimal so 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.600
 we will not need a big one 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.430
 you will ask and one to mix not 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.680
 we will need nothing to mix 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.540
 because that's what the swabs are for 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.369
 just that we will not apply so 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.440
 it is not necessary to need a spoon if 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.440
 you want you may need one of these 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.740
 smaller spoons let's see the 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.740
 process 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.360
 on the mobile we will add the two 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.360
 tablespoons of baking 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.800
 the spoonful of hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.670
 and we mix very well 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.590
 As I said , we are going to do it 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.439
 with the swab or with your small spoon 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.689
 you are going to mix until you have a pasta 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.310
 homogeneous is to say that everything is very 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.709
 well integrated 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.170
 and ready, as you have all the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.840
 integrated ingredients and of this type 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.739
 of consistency with a leg either 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.890
 ready your homemade scrub now I'm going 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.710
 to explain how your application 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.380
 with a hyssop you are going to grab a bit of 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.810
 mix and you will add it in the nails and 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.140
 you're going to let it sit for 3 minutes 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.410
 when the 3 minutes have passed you go 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 to rinse with warm water and ready this 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.250
 same procedure or this same 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
 Exfoliating can be repeated within 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.930
 six or eight weeks and you already have a 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.450
 Home scrub is super easy and with 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.280
 little things that we have in house I hope that
