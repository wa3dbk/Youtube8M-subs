was typed in mi zu on the keyboard it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.440 
was typed in mi zu on the keyboard it
automatically<00:02:49.709> translated<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.489> into<00:02:50.610> header

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
automatically translated it into header

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.320
