and the next Xbox uh they don't believe

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
and the next Xbox uh they don't believe
the<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> was<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> step<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.190> big<00:02:08.610> enough

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
