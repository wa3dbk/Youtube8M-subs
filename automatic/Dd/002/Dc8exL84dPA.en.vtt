minutes<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.540> don't<00:04:13.440> know<00:04:13.620> if<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.800> gg5<00:04:14.190> boot<00:04:14.430> up

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
minutes I don't know if the gg5 boot up

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:23.689 
minutes I don't know if the gg5 boot up
will<00:04:14.640> take<00:04:14.670> too<00:04:15.030> long<00:04:22.310> it's<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.400> lot<00:04:23.550> easier

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
will take too long it's a lot easier

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:24.980 
will take too long it's a lot easier
than<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.090> looks<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.510> lot<00:04:24.660> easier<00:04:24.960> that

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
than it looks and a lot easier that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.850 
than it looks and a lot easier that
people<00:04:25.350> make<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.620> out<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.770> be<00:04:25.889> um<00:04:27.680> there<00:04:28.680> are<00:04:28.710> a

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
people make it out to be um there are a

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.920 
people make it out to be um there are a
couple<00:04:29.070> tutorials<00:04:29.310> but<00:04:30.210> like<00:04:30.389> their<00:04:30.630> text

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
couple tutorials but like their text

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.420 
couple tutorials but like their text
tutorials<00:04:31.350> online<00:04:31.560> they're<00:04:31.949> a<00:04:31.979> lot<00:04:32.130> more

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
tutorials online they're a lot more

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.390 
tutorials online they're a lot more
they're<00:04:32.940> much<00:04:33.090> more<00:04:33.270> harder<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.780> follow<00:04:34.260> so<00:04:35.040> I

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
they're much more harder to follow so I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.610 
they're much more harder to follow so I
learned<00:04:36.150> myself<00:04:36.330> through<00:04:37.320> those<00:04:37.440> tech

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
learned myself through those tech

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.320 
learned myself through those tech
tutorials<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.220> found<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:39.150> had<00:04:39.300> a

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
tutorials and I found that if I had a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.520 
tutorials and I found that if I had a
video<00:04:39.479> would<00:04:39.780> have<00:04:39.900> made<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.169> lot<00:04:40.320> more

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
video would have made it a lot more

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.430 
video would have made it a lot more
easier<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:40.889> me<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:42.030> I'm<00:04:42.690> making<00:04:42.870> easier<00:04:43.290> for

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
easier for me so I'm making easier for

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.680 
easier for me so I'm making easier for
you<00:04:43.500> guys<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:47.060> will<00:04:48.060> probably<00:04:48.419> do<00:04:48.510> another

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
you guys I will probably do another

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.060 
you guys I will probably do another
video<00:04:48.870> on<00:04:49.050> how<00:04:49.139> to<00:04:49.200> do<00:04:49.380> car<00:04:49.590> height<00:04:49.770> leave<00:04:49.979> it

want<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.820> add<00:05:36.940> go<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.660> engine<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:39.010> then<00:05:39.970> engine

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
want to add go to engine and then engine

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.080 
want to add go to engine and then engine
upgrade<00:05:40.660> one<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:42.490> should<00:05:42.670> see<00:05:42.790> something

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
upgrade one and you should see something

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.660 
upgrade one and you should see something
insane<00:05:43.480> like<00:05:43.660> that<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.980> actually<00:05:45.250> did<00:05:45.520> move

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
insane like that so I actually did move

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.540 
insane like that so I actually did move
the<00:05:45.700> decimal<00:05:46.090> places<00:05:46.300> over<00:05:46.870> like<00:05:47.590> think<00:05:48.280> four

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
the decimal places over like think four

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.100 
the decimal places over like think four
so<00:05:48.850> my<00:05:48.880> multiplier<00:05:49.390> is<00:05:49.540> insanely<00:05:50.440> huge<00:05:52.110> but

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
so my multiplier is insanely huge but

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.750 
so my multiplier is insanely huge but
yeah<00:05:53.260> yours<00:05:53.530> will<00:05:53.710> be<00:05:53.830> ridiculously<00:05:54.340> high<00:05:54.520> if

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
yeah yours will be ridiculously high if

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.610 
yeah yours will be ridiculously high if
you<00:05:54.850> copied<00:05:55.210> what<00:05:55.330> I<00:05:55.360> did<00:05:55.570> with<00:05:56.020> with<00:05:56.410> the

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
you copied what I did with with the

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.670 
you copied what I did with with the
extra<00:05:57.070> zero<00:05:57.280> is<00:05:57.460> in<00:05:57.580> between<00:05:57.820> 28<00:05:58.240> and<00:05:58.270> 64<00:05:58.870> you

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
extra zero is in between 28 and 64 you

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.140 
extra zero is in between 28 and 64 you
will<00:05:59.830> get<00:05:59.980> a<00:06:00.010> bunch<00:06:00.310> of<00:06:00.400> horsepower<00:06:00.790> like<00:06:00.970> that

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
will get a bunch of horsepower like that

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.360 
will get a bunch of horsepower like that
so<00:06:01.960> that's<00:06:02.260> my<00:06:02.470> quick<00:06:02.680> tutorial<00:06:03.130> on<00:06:03.190> how<00:06:03.310> to
