00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.790
 Hello dear reader 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.319
 the site just as he is my name is their special 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.759
 kind and we are with you now 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.059
 look comparative review 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.059
 as well as operating experience in two 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.820
 flagship phones nokia rocker 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.130
 97 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.990
 and this is 97 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.060
 not less 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.329
 which 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.949
 will become 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.669
 phone of one of our readers is very 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.710
 soon so percent 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.180
 basically 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.410
 used in both phones 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.330
 s60 platform 5th edition which we 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.580
 reviewed in some detail 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.550
 in the Nokia 508 phone review on November 2 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.040
 now I would like to dwell on 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.690
 just a few 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.270
 things apart from the appearance of what 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 we will have a separate conversation and which 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.890
 it did not get for some reason in 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.290
 review for example 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.250
 it completely stayed 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.570
 for attention the percentage of the browser which 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.160
 built in 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.140
 percent 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.549
 by default in balashikha it is edition 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.640
 here, too, it supports flash 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 here is bonner 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.540
 runs on our site 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.250
 process to say what 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.610
 the center works with very sensitive 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 very nice 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520
 I unfortunately can not 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.080
 but basically use it 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.440
 browser can 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.540
 and he has naturally 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.200
 horizontal modes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.970
 there is 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.350
 vertical there is an opportunity 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.000
 scaling pictures 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 button works all 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.740
 sometimes smoothly they sometimes not 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 in general with varying success 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.170
 let's be frank 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.360
 This is especially true for large enough. 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 heavy pages 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.430
 which may be controversial dubai cup 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.579
 percentage in principle 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.720
 I don't have one 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.530
 bookmarking 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.489
 and update 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.369
 word search 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.369
 in the parameters we have 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.599
 access to home access points 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.119
 pages 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.989
 setup protection warnings and java 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.539
 scripts 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.409
 what else do we have 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.840
 loading content can be loaded 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.840
 only text can turn flash off 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.169
 quotes 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.619
 lock sweeter hackon 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.619
 font size 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.749
 secrecy is security 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.999
 boredom work with 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.339
 data storage 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.339
 can be stored with a password 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.900
 in general, here 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.169
 so here 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.309
 can not say that a small but not so 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.809
 already 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.000
 and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.519
 strong set for 2010 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.609
 for browsers 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.689
 glad you can still come 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.329
 go from new page to bookmarks 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.459
 news story 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.249
 display options 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.199
 parameters in pages 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.139
 but as a matter of fact 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.139
 of important 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.379
 of important 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.009
 the main thing is that flash is supported 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.009
 which is not everywhere 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.729
 and in principle 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.339
 and have the ability to scale 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.689
 which does not always work quickly and 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.279
 well there is also the possibility 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.849
 page views in horizontal and 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:50.789
 upright 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:51.809
 in mode 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.579
 I think that there will be some more details 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.909
 shocked 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.930
 sing can watch but p 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.089
 would love to 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.349
 to show 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.099
 more is he 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.009
 custom budgets 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:08.749
 desktop looks like this 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.369
 they may have 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.669
 how do you filter so much 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.069
 and horizontal orientation 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.259
 and 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.169
 they can be customized 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.189
 Well, they are placed in blocks that can 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.779
 delete 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.610
 here is the block removed now you can add 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.289
 here new 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.249
 means we have accessibility mode 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.259
 there is a possibility 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.909
 install rabbi jets 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.989
 There are two panels of type 4 contacts issued 

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:40.379
 contacts 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.949
 prosthesis 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.150
 but in principle convenient for me personally 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.330
 I use m there 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.169
 player percentage 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.169
 music 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.129
 and in principle it is a contact with whom 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.360
 I also use a slave 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.539
 two panels of 4 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.960
 contact from favorites 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.090
 n all import contracts indoors 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.300
 asterisks in the address book automatically 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.419
 appears here 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.229
 dumplings all first 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.719
 percent 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.120
 the first place 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.050
 then p still needs to be said that he 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.949
 these panels 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.629
 can move 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.749
 to swap 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:29.349
 so here it looks 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.349
 horizontal mode 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.990
 here we can not say that some big 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.080
 miracles 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.089
 but the percentage 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.770
 anyway 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.210
 Here is precisely such a system of pancakes she 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.699
 many have some sort of their own 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:45.710
 you see 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.550
 that is, in principle 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.550
 Now add to haiti 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.439
 let's see what will happen 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.849
 work 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.849
 yes here are the messages from twitter 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.559
 process steel still rub 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.379
 can say 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.929
 about the fact that he is a list of applications exactly 

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.929
 same he tuned 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.939
 streamline 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.900
 and here you can 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.839
 rearrange 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.749
 a machine 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:24.150
 how Fedchenko works 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.039
 vashadze 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.990
 application those who participate 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.060
 enjoy victory 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.710
 use raise elevated with 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.770
 so that they 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.650
 were available immediately 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.819
 and now when selecting an application item 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:40.949
 he is trent 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.949
 fruits of baskerville ditz rose above 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:47.029
 that's it exactly 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:49.809
 all that can be said 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.499
 such an unusual interesting 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.789
 about what is in it 97 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.960
 but we still have a map to show 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.409
 cards 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.949
 but I like you know for free we got 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.409
 two articles 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.539
 process 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.740
 This is how it looks 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.689
 map 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:11.610
 Kiev 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.619
 I'll try to bring closer 

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:17.619
 that's how it scales 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:23.119
 this card that does not come in the water supply 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:24.479
 before becoming 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.309
 but 

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:28.989
 what card is included post on 

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:31.989
 rate can be an hour to see 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.490
 I have not installed it here 

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:44.929
 This is what Kiev looks like 

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:46.949
 in mini pc 

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:49.949
 that is, just 3 doronin 

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:52.830
 Friendship Forward Award 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.849
 in Ukrainian Lesi Boulevard 

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.509
 This is how Kiev looked 

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.719
 on old maps of Ukraine 

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:00.169
 until November 

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:02.159
 2009 when 

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:05.409
 map appeared more detailed 

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:06.460
 here 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.310
 but it's probably all thank you for your attention 

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.360
