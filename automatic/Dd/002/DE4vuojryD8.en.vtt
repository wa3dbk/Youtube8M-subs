about<00:01:12.890> connecting<00:01:13.460> people<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:14.120> think<00:01:14.900> of<00:01:14.990> my

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
about connecting people I think of my

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
imagine being able to call them and see

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.300 
imagine being able to call them and see
them<00:01:22.370> but<00:01:23.030> also<00:01:23.180> look<00:01:24.050> into<00:01:24.200> their<00:01:24.410> eyes<00:01:24.440> and

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
them but also look into their eyes and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.930 
them but also look into their eyes and
see<00:01:25.550> how<00:01:25.760> are<00:01:25.880> they<00:01:25.970> really<00:01:26.120> doing<00:01:27.730> what<00:01:28.730> makes

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
see how are they really doing what makes

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.600 
see how are they really doing what makes
it<00:01:29.090> even<00:01:29.300> better<00:01:29.480> is<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.890> switches<00:01:31.430> from

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
it even better is that it switches from

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.240 
it even better is that it switches from
the<00:01:31.790> front<00:01:32.120> camera<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:32.960> back<00:01:33.200> camera<00:01:33.500> so

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
the front camera to the back camera so

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.850 
the front camera to the back camera so
you<00:01:34.280> can<00:01:34.400> show<00:01:35.150> someone<00:01:35.720> what<00:01:36.380> you're<00:01:36.560> seeing

one<00:04:37.810> thing<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.170> made<00:04:38.350> larger<00:04:38.950> was<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.310> battery

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
one thing we made larger was the battery

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.720 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:40.000> fact<00:04:40.570> iphone<00:04:41.140> 4<00:04:41.440> delivers<00:04:41.950> up<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.190> forty

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.350 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty
percent<00:04:43.060> more<00:04:43.360> talk<00:04:43.570> time

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
percent more talk time

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.619 
percent more talk time
and<00:04:45.930> we<00:04:46.110> started<00:04:46.710> with<00:04:47.210> completely<00:04:48.210> opposing

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
and we started with completely opposing

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.170 
and we started with completely opposing
goals<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.319> we<00:04:50.009> wanted<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.310> make<00:04:50.490> this<00:04:50.669> iphone

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420 
goals and we wanted to make this iphone
more<00:04:51.810> capable<00:04:52.349> we<00:04:52.620> wanted<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:52.949> add<00:04:53.129> more

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
more capable we wanted to add more

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.209 
more capable we wanted to add more
feature<00:04:53.759> and<00:04:54.360> yet<00:04:55.110> at<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.289> same<00:04:55.349> time<00:04:55.530> we

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
feature and yet at the same time we

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.740 
feature and yet at the same time we
wanted<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.550> make<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.729> smaller<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.389> even

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
wanted to make it smaller and even

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.140 
wanted to make it smaller and even
thinner<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.379> that<00:04:59.189> led<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.400> some<00:04:59.729> really

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
thinner and that led to some really

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.740 
thinner and that led to some really
surprising<00:05:00.330> innovation<00:05:02.180> we<00:05:03.180> developed<00:05:03.360> an

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
surprising innovation we developed an

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.649 
surprising innovation we developed an
entirely<00:05:04.259> new<00:05:04.439> grade<00:05:04.979> stainless<00:05:05.639> steel<00:05:06.120> that

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
entirely new grade stainless steel that

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.219 
entirely new grade stainless steel that
after<00:05:06.990> machining<00:05:07.409> is<00:05:08.069> incredibly<00:05:09.000> strong<00:05:09.389> but

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
after machining is incredibly strong but

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.670 
after machining is incredibly strong but
also<00:05:10.409> remarkably<00:05:11.219> precise<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:13.020> steel<00:05:13.319> frame

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
also remarkably precise the steel frame

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.219 
also remarkably precise the steel frame
functions<00:05:14.280> as<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.460> antenna<00:05:15.000> but<00:05:15.449> also<00:05:15.719> the

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
functions as the antenna but also the

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.230 
functions as the antenna but also the
primary<00:05:16.500> structure<00:05:17.250> giving<00:05:17.819> us<00:05:18.000> more

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
primary structure giving us more

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.309 
primary structure giving us more
internal<00:05:18.779> volume<00:05:20.479> we<00:05:21.479> also<00:05:21.599> developed<00:05:22.199> a

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
internal volume we also developed a

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.230 
internal volume we also developed a
custom<00:05:22.710> glass<00:05:22.889> that's<00:05:23.550> comparable<00:05:24.090> in

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
custom glass that's comparable in

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.659 
custom glass that's comparable in
strength<00:05:24.539> to<00:05:24.750> sapphire<00:05:25.110> crystal<00:05:25.710> but<00:05:26.490> about

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
strength to sapphire crystal but about

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.649 
strength to sapphire crystal but about
30<00:05:27.000> times<00:05:27.360> harder<00:05:28.050> than<00:05:28.199> plastic<00:05:29.330> this<00:05:30.330> glass

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
would be an amazing new iphone but it's

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.409 
would be an amazing new iphone but it's
