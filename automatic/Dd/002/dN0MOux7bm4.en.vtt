so<00:01:37.150> here<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.540> can<00:01:37.690> see<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.020> detail<00:01:38.380> on<00:01:38.409> the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
so here you can see the detail on the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.210 
so here you can see the detail on the
head<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.420> can<00:01:40.600> see<00:01:40.810> he's<00:01:40.930> got<00:01:41.220> individual

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
head and you can see he's got individual

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.050 
head and you can see he's got individual
knife-like

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
knife-like

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.390 
knife-like
teeth<00:01:43.360> they<00:01:43.720> are<00:01:43.750> rounded<00:01:44.380> off<00:01:44.530> probably<00:01:45.010> for

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
teeth they are rounded off probably for

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.980 
teeth they are rounded off probably for
safety<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:45.850> imagine<00:01:46.360> because<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.750> amount<00:01:46.960> of

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
safety I imagine because the amount of

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.200 
safety I imagine because the amount of
detail<00:01:47.320> Papo<00:01:47.680> can<00:01:47.950> go<00:01:48.130> into<00:01:48.310> they<00:01:48.970> probably

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
detail Papo can go into they probably

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.940 
detail Papo can go into they probably
could<00:01:49.540> make<00:01:49.570> those<00:01:49.930> sharp<00:01:50.260> if<00:01:50.439> they<00:01:50.560> wanted<00:01:50.890> to

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
could make those sharp if they wanted to

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.420 
could make those sharp if they wanted to
and<00:01:51.340> as<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.479> see<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.200> jaw<00:01:53.470> is<00:01:53.680> hinged<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:54.400> I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
and as you see the jaw is hinged so I

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.080 
and as you see the jaw is hinged so I
can<00:01:54.610> open<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.030> close<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.450> jaw<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.700> just<00:01:57.970> a

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
can open and close the jaw it's just a

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.230 
can open and close the jaw it's just a
fantastic<00:01:58.570> sculpt<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.700> I'll<00:02:00.820> show<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.090> the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
fantastic sculpt and I'll show you the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.390 
fantastic sculpt and I'll show you the
other<00:02:01.330> side<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.860> things<00:02:03.040> plateau

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
other side so one of the things plateau

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.609 
other side so one of the things plateau
has<00:02:03.460> done<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.909> they've<00:02:04.270> given<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.380> two

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
has done is they've given you two

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.590 
has done is they've given you two
options<00:02:06.070> for<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.430> way<00:02:06.549> that<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.850> t-rex<00:02:07.180> looks

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
options for the way that the t-rex looks

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.080 
options for the way that the t-rex looks
so<00:02:07.900> this<00:02:08.590> eye<00:02:08.769> is<00:02:08.829> staring<00:02:09.369> outwards<00:02:09.879> towards

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
so this eye is staring outwards towards

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.559 
so this eye is staring outwards towards
us<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:12.069> one<00:02:12.279> on<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.459> other<00:02:12.549> side<00:02:12.639> is

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
us and this one on the other side is

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.809 
us and this one on the other side is
in<00:02:13.750> forwards<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.950> depending<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.400> how<00:02:15.549> you<00:02:15.610> want

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
in forwards so depending on how you want

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.699 
in forwards so depending on how you want
to<00:02:15.849> display<00:02:16.150> him<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:17.049> can<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.379> him<00:02:17.469> looking

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
to display him you can have him looking

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.020 
to display him you can have him looking
in<00:02:17.859> two<00:02:18.010> different<00:02:18.159> directions

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
in two different directions

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.179 
in two different directions
they've<00:02:19.810> sculpted<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.319> inside<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:20.980> mouth

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
they've sculpted the inside of the mouth

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.220 
they've sculpted the inside of the mouth
their<00:02:22.109> wonderful<00:02:23.109> detail<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.189> tongue

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
their wonderful detail the tongue

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.849 
their wonderful detail the tongue
absolutely<00:02:26.230> beautiful

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
absolutely beautiful

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.250 
absolutely beautiful
there's<00:02:27.579> all<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.849> folds<00:02:28.269> of<00:02:28.359> skin<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:29.079> down

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
there's all the folds of skin going down

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.550 
there's all the folds of skin going down
his<00:02:29.379> neck<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:31.359> musculature<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.140> his<00:02:32.319> arms

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
his neck the musculature on his arms

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.280 
his neck the musculature on his arms
just<00:02:35.560> really<00:02:36.400> staggering<00:02:36.909> detail<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.959> like<00:02:38.260> I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
just really staggering detail and like I

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.740 
just really staggering detail and like I
said<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.680> more<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.129> a<00:02:39.159> sideshow<00:02:39.750> figuring

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
said it's more like a sideshow figuring

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.559 
said it's more like a sideshow figuring
like<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.189> like<00:02:42.189> a<00:02:42.220> statue<00:02:42.609> made<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
like a like a statue made for a

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.960 
like a like a statue made for a
collector<00:02:44.099> rather<00:02:45.099> than<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.959> toy<00:02:46.959> figurine<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
collector rather than a toy figurine so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.270 
collector rather than a toy figurine so
the<00:02:49.689> kids<00:02:49.930> have<00:02:50.109> really<00:02:50.139> been<00:02:50.590> spoiled<00:02:51.129> this

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
the kids have really been spoiled this

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.809 
the kids have really been spoiled this
time<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.989> don't<00:02:53.049> think<00:02:53.609> we're<00:02:54.609> going<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
time and I don't think we're going to

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.089 
time and I don't think we're going to
see<00:02:55.000> toys<00:02:55.269> like<00:02:55.569> this<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:56.439> a<00:02:56.500> while<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.620> yeah

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
see toys like this for a while so yeah

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.699 
see toys like this for a while so yeah
fantastic<00:03:00.489> detail<00:03:01.290> fantastic<00:03:02.290> fantastic

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
fantastic detail fantastic fantastic

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.869 
fantastic detail fantastic fantastic
detail<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.739> legs<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> arms<00:03:06.639> are<00:03:06.760> not

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
detail and the legs and the arms are not

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.520 
detail and the legs and the arms are not
articulated<00:03:07.629> they<00:03:07.750> are<00:03:07.870> made<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.319> sort

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
articulated they are made of this sort

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.970 
articulated they are made of this sort
of<00:03:08.590> rubbery<00:03:08.829> plastic<00:03:10.349> so<00:03:11.349> you<00:03:11.379> can<00:03:11.680> sort<00:03:11.950> of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
of rubbery plastic so you can sort of

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.140 
of rubbery plastic so you can sort of
just<00:03:12.069> wiggle<00:03:12.609> wiggle<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.299> arms<00:03:14.939> but<00:03:15.939> they're

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
just wiggle wiggle the arms but they're

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.689 
just wiggle wiggle the arms but they're
not<00:03:16.299> articulated<00:03:17.139> here<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.250> neither<00:03:18.459> are<00:03:18.639> the

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
not articulated here and neither are the

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.250 
not articulated here and neither are the
legs<00:03:18.940> but<00:03:19.629> to<00:03:19.720> be<00:03:19.810> honest<00:03:20.019> when<00:03:20.139> you're

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
legs but to be honest when you're

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.920 
legs but to be honest when you're
getting<00:03:20.379> detail<00:03:20.799> like<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.659> it<00:03:22.659> really

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
getting detail like this it really

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.439 
getting detail like this it really
doesn't<00:03:23.349> matter<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:24.150> here's<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.209> quick

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
doesn't matter so here's a quick

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.629 
doesn't matter so here's a quick
comparison<00:03:25.659> with<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.409> brown<00:03:26.650> t-rex<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.430> can

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
comparison with the brown t-rex you can

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.960 
comparison with the brown t-rex you can
see<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.810> paint<00:03:29.079> job<00:03:29.349> differs<00:03:30.310> quite

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
see the the paint job differs quite

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.930 
see the the paint job differs quite
radically<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:32.069> think<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.280> airbrushing<00:03:33.790> that's

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
radically I think the airbrushing that's

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.059 
radically I think the airbrushing that's
been<00:03:34.090> done<00:03:34.269> around<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.169> head<00:03:35.409> here<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:35.769> a

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
been done around the the head here is a

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.189 
been done around the the head here is a
bit<00:03:36.370> more<00:03:36.549> detailed<00:03:37.000> than<00:03:37.359> on<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.989> brown

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
bit more detailed than on the brown

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.899 
bit more detailed than on the brown
t-rex<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:38.859> think<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.069> prefer<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.699> green

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
t-rex and I think I prefer on the green

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.009 
t-rex and I think I prefer on the green
Rex<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:41.139> I<00:03:41.319> do<00:03:41.440> like<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.489> brown<00:03:42.699> t-rex<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.510> lot

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
Rex but I do like the brown t-rex a lot

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.110 
Rex but I do like the brown t-rex a lot
because<00:03:44.319> it<00:03:44.799> resembles<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.519> one<00:03:45.639> we<00:03:45.819> see<00:03:46.000> in

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
because it resembles the one we see in

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.839 
because it resembles the one we see in
the<00:03:46.239> first<00:03:46.419> film<00:03:47.250> articulation<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.370> exactly

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
the first film articulation is exactly

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.750 
the first film articulation is exactly
the<00:03:48.970> same<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:50.049> jaw<00:03:50.349> behaves<00:03:51.129> exactly<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the same so the jaw behaves exactly the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.589 
the same so the jaw behaves exactly the
same<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:54.190> as<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.459> can<00:03:54.609> see<00:03:54.669> the<00:03:55.000> sculpt<00:03:55.389> is

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
same and as you can see the sculpt is

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.559 
same and as you can see the sculpt is
the<00:03:55.750> same<00:03:56.019> it's<00:03:56.889> just<00:03:56.979> that<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.430> paint<00:03:58.209> job<00:03:58.419> is

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
the same it's just that the paint job is

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.600
