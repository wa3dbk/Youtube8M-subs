00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
product out from this box it brings this

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.479 
product out from this box it brings this
paper<00:03:00.150> telling<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.570> how<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.019> connect<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.530> I

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
paper telling you how to connect it I

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.210 
paper telling you how to connect it I
think<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> power<00:03:03.600> adapter<00:03:04.100> do<00:03:05.100> you

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
think this is a power adapter do you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.180 
think this is a power adapter do you
connect<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.930> bring<00:03:06.930> HDMI<00:03:07.560> cable<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.040> then

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
connect it to bring HDMI cable and then

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.310 
connect it to bring HDMI cable and then
the<00:03:08.400> mini<00:03:08.580> DisplayPort<00:03:08.730> cable<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.170> that's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
the mini DisplayPort cable so that's

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.259 
the mini DisplayPort cable so that's
good<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.709> brings<00:03:10.920> both<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.940> them<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.120> kind

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
good that it brings both of them I kind

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.640 
good that it brings both of them I kind
of<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.050> don't<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.380> go<00:03:13.500> out

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
of like that so you don't have to go out

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.110 
of like that so you don't have to go out
and<00:03:13.680> buy<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:15.480> which<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.400> HDMI<00:03:17.400> male<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.940> male

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.690 
and buy but which is HDMI male to male
and<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:18.540> mini<00:03:19.470> DisplayPort<00:03:20.040> smelted<00:03:20.430> multi

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
and then mini DisplayPort smelted multi

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.630 
and then mini DisplayPort smelted multi
and<00:03:21.680> then<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:23.040> product<00:03:23.549> itself<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:26.310> right

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
and then this product itself it's right

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.930

you<00:04:01.140> see<00:04:01.290> my<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.950> mini<00:04:02.250> DisplayPort<00:04:02.430> right

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
you see my in the mini DisplayPort right

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.440 
you see my in the mini DisplayPort right
there<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.700> that's<00:04:05.700> all<00:04:05.850> they<00:04:05.940> lines<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.360> then

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
there so that's all they lines and then

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.509 
there so that's all they lines and then
the<00:04:06.570> bottom<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:07.079> grippy<00:04:08.010> thing<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.400> it

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
the bottom is just grippy thing so it

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.190 
the bottom is just grippy thing so it
doesn't<00:04:08.549> fall<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.989> says<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:11.239> think<00:04:12.239> now<00:04:13.170> that

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
doesn't fall it says I think now that

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.810 
doesn't fall it says I think now that
I'm<00:04:13.380> reading<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:13.859> I'm<00:04:14.070> gonna<00:04:14.250> try<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.549> look

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
I'm reading this I'm gonna try and look

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.920 
I'm reading this I'm gonna try and look
for<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.180> but<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:15.480> don't<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:18.570> says<00:04:18.750> right

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
for it but I don't see it it says right

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.229 
for it but I don't see it it says right
here<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.140> Spanish<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:19.739> 720p<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:21.120> I'm

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
here in Spanish that is 720p so I'm

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.700 
here in Spanish that is 720p so I'm
guessing<00:04:21.570> that's<00:04:21.660> what<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.019> but<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.470> don't

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
guessing that's what it is but I don't

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.940 
guessing that's what it is but I don't
find<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.070> anywhere<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.760> English<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:25.410> says<00:04:25.650> is

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
find that anywhere in English it says is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.439 
find that anywhere in English it says is
720

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
720

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.510 
720
or<00:04:28.449> look<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:28.780> up<00:04:28.840> online<00:04:29.050> but<00:04:29.380> right<00:04:30.190> there<00:04:30.400> in

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
or look it up online but right there in

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.189 
or look it up online but right there in
Spanish<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.060> can<00:04:31.270> read<00:04:31.389> Spanish<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.900> know

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
Spanish I can read Spanish so I know

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.090 
Spanish I can read Spanish so I know
what<00:04:32.949> it<00:04:33.070> says<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.430> it<00:04:33.490> says<00:04:33.520> it's<00:04:33.850> 720p<00:04:34.480> so

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
what it says and it says it's 720p so

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.909 
what it says and it says it's 720p so
I'm<00:04:36.100> guessing<00:04:36.490> it's<00:04:36.699> an<00:04:36.880> 20<00:04:37.150> P<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:38.290> I'm<00:04:38.710> just

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
I'm guessing it's an 20 P and I'm just

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.540 
I'm guessing it's an 20 P and I'm just
gonna<00:04:39.040> take<00:04:39.250> their<00:04:39.820> word<00:04:40.030> for<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:41.280> cuz<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.340> can't

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
gonna take their word for it cuz I can't

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.320 
gonna take their word for it cuz I can't
find<00:04:42.729> anything<00:04:42.970> anyway<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.850> that's<00:04:45.850> it

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
find anything anyway but that's it

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.270 
find anything anyway but that's it
just<00:04:48.000> paper<00:04:49.000> all<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.389> says<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.750> just<00:04:50.280> connected

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280
