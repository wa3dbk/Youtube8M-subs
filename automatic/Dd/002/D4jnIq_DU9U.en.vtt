00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:56.129
 What's happening on YouTube is what's happening. 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.629
 Well I noticed some topics in the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.280
 forum in which of the month live to dismiss 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.589
 these guys there frequent the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.299

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.159
 for us and october 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.310
 look old or how it will start again 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.229
 This companion, we do not do video. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.009
 networks that are on the roots of the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 Now you 're asking why? 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.870
 of this base 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.640
 you do not because you simply 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.850
 because if they want to have access to a 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.420
 place you do not rockstar take to a 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:41.229
 take to is simply taking the fla 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.410
 gandu videos that contain news or 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.180
 spanish networks 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.550
 Are you asking one out of ten? 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.970
 Nights of times that was because of 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.600
 Besides that, not bringing much left 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.369
 a lot of things even a few more 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.270
 relevant than blue, but I do not 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.890
 brought because I'm afraid wretch 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.750
 It's okay that I have melody account. 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.940
 network what is this 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.060
 when I take I will not strike for me and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.420
 network but all old way is to be 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.180
 useful because the post fell together then no 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620
 It's very logical, that's when I stayed. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.630
 fucking worried because what? 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.850
 I had made the video before I did not know the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.880
 what was going to happen 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:29.860
 It seems that until the future she saw things that 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.370
 it 's not the battle on youtube stayed is with 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.290
 at the same time and have all the power 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.019
 you are absolutely sure in yourself in which 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.110
 that business was not silver 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.180
 youtube and they communicate youtube and 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.820
 same time the team donate or finish 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:56.709
 Speaking, I had a problem with 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.930
 This was not because of the video 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.930
 of laws about head video case 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.040
 nerd is a problem on which youtube you 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.510
 brings news 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.780
 That's why if you bring a 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.540
 news that the company is prepared 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.560
 to walk block news after 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.370
 and this news simply leaks is and is 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.769
 very human simply says organize the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.870
 the logistics of the company 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.720
 You're just there doing your thing. 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.140
 I play it all, there's an employee 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.200
 ends up leaking something in the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.020
 time of launch or ne 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.989
 of e3 more or less so it ends with the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.260
 logistics of the game and what is 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:44.010
 happening - live and uncle to send them 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.950
 are simply started in codes 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.340
 Serious sources the guys they talk to all 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.690
 of everything, especially the gta 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.140
 in fact, more specifically 99% and 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.510
 they ended up taking the other the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.220
 miracle that took strike right? 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.140
 stress on his second channel in the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.780
 first channel has already lost the channel 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.250
 cause of this yes he has already lost the channel o 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.890
 first channel because of that 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:16.829
 business and the second he took a strike 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.959
 also improper content is and is what 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.650
 there was inappropriate content of take two 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.050
 interactive anything I think 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.240
 I do not know if I can put more 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.340
 if I do not get excuses put in 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.440
 screen the strike I took I think 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.750
 I can not do this, it's no, no 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.810
 I can and I can not sorry I can not be 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.560
 My network rules can not because 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.500
 they work and if there is anyway, but the uncle 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.630
 of the team he took a flag because he 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.070
 also has account - the owner of the label had 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.919
 Mello account and only you have a problem 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.350
 he ended up running out of 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.900
 contamination and ended up losing the channel and 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.789
 This is what worries me then, when 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.440
 you are asking for a video of the time is 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.510
 asking these things you want in 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.280
 October of the same 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:08.039
 specifically gta news avoids a 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.060
 little back records at the moment 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.220
 because it's coming sometimes and when the 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.500
 launch of these things to conquer or 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.690
 any other company she does not like 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.110
 leaks because I will hurt 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.440
 the logistic influence of the company 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.639
 What happens is a very 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.700
 so banal let's say so 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.389
 Good. This message to you. 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.610
 as the calls here pilot also ivan 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:38.400
 colleague if I'm not mistaken chi x global fx 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.950
 and also published a topic there in which 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.580
 he got a flash only who managed 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.830
 draw managed to decrease 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.500
 had a problem there but anyway I 'm not 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.389
 wanting to take this risk, I'm already 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.060
 I talked to the network, we're giving 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.330
 you do not have a network on the 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.789
 youtube makes video search at least 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.169
 or find a security network a 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.409
 big does not make sense to exist in 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.990
 moment that is I took the flamengo case 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.610
 the reality of the thing so much 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.259
 likely if I make a video of the times 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.770
 saying this and that also takes a 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:14.080
 flash a strike yes sir but a lot of 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:18.550
 youtube is 0 is asking who flags 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.310
 troicki flag is when you take the serum 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.050
 copyright in which you can not 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.550
 monetize the video or simply 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.240
 can keep every day going to the company 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.560
 in which is from the director to that there until the 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.110
 invitation to stay in the air 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.849
 if you take a strike the video is 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.279
 removed from the air and you lose some 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.250
 benefits such as putting half and 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:42.639
 to place the music library in the 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.180
 things if you take three strikes on your 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.210
 channel 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.770
 your case is simple dictation so many 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.870
 channels have already had this problem and I 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.490
 I want to have my then excuses 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.590
 these will take a little while to 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.800
 bring the channel if tomorrow something 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.430
 type will have video but finally understand 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.169
