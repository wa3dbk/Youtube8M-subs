 except microjig in terms of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 production process like and combines in 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.480
 currently a number of technologies including low 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.000
 resign x-torq multiply break and micro 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 stove setter more about this technology we 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.630
 told separately and now I offer 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180

 meets a rather thin and powerful form 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.079
 working without failures with smoothly 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.699

 size with standard kit but in 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.380
 in this case we have no loss 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.380
 in the casting distance almost 5 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.750
