little cameras um pretty much all

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
little cameras um pretty much all
cameras<00:01:25.140> work<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> same<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> insides<00:01:26.280> we

cameras work the same in the insides we
learned<00:01:26.670> about<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.080> settings<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:29.189> can

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
learned about all the settings so we can

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.230 
learned about all the settings so we can
figure<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.320> light<00:01:31.320> our<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> cameras

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
figure out how to light our the cameras

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 
figure out how to light our the cameras
like<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.320> any<00:01:34.920> setting<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
like this in here all any setting you

can imagine in a camera we learned about
and<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.400> learned<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.759> adjust<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.810> never

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and we learned how to adjust and I never

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
and we learned how to adjust and I never
knew<00:01:40.409> any<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.040> stuff<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.700> it's

much<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:56.759> gonna<00:01:57.030> try<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.390> fiddle<00:01:57.719> around

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
much so I'm gonna try and fiddle around

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
much so I'm gonna try and fiddle around
and<00:01:58.229> figure<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.619> how<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> work<00:01:59.670> all<00:01:59.850> this

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and figure out how to work all this

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.660 
and figure out how to work all this
because<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.560> know<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.920> need<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> backlight

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
do it we learned about that we also

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
do it we learned about that we also
learned<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.750> different<00:02:06.899> lenses<00:02:07.500> lenses<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
learned about different lenses lenses to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.630 
learned about different lenses lenses to
use<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.610> close-ups

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
use for close-ups

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.360 
use for close-ups
for<00:02:10.090> far<00:02:10.270> away<00:02:10.680> it<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:11.830> really<00:02:12.069> interesting

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
for far away it was really interesting

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.880 
for far away it was really interesting
to<00:02:12.700> learn<00:02:13.360> about<00:02:13.690> how<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.290> iPhone<00:02:14.680> camera

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
to learn about how the iPhone camera

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.890 
to learn about how the iPhone camera
actually<00:02:15.340> really<00:02:15.520> sucks<00:02:15.819> because<00:02:16.450> how<00:02:16.690> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
actually really sucks because how it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.480 
actually really sucks because how it
like<00:02:17.050> makes<00:02:17.350> your<00:02:17.530> face<00:02:17.740> look<00:02:17.950> because<00:02:18.310> it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
like makes your face look because it's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.220 
like makes your face look because it's
not<00:02:18.640> realistic<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.660> more<00:02:19.870> realistic

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
not realistic this is more realistic

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.840 
not realistic this is more realistic
than<00:02:20.830> an<00:02:21.670> iPhone<00:02:22.170> camera<00:02:23.170> because<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.010> sort<00:02:24.730> of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
than an iPhone camera because it sort of

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.120 
than an iPhone camera because it sort of
looks<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.900> me<00:02:26.350> like<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.770> real<00:02:26.950> life<00:02:27.100> like

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
looks like me like in real life like

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.400 
looks like me like in real life like
this<00:02:27.820> is<00:02:27.970> kind<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.240> what<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.390> look<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:29.260> an

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
this is kind of what I look like but an

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.960 
this is kind of what I look like but an
iPhone<00:02:29.740> life<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.130> rounds<00:02:30.490> your<00:02:30.640> face<00:02:30.760> out

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970

the<00:03:14.140> information<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.920> us<00:03:15.100> so<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:15.519> actually

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
the information with us so we actually

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.370 
the information with us so we actually
learned<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.480> knew<00:03:16.600> what<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:16.870> were<00:03:16.959> talking

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
learned and knew what we were talking

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.430 
learned and knew what we were talking
about<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.579> our<00:03:18.850> final<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.660> practical

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
about and then our final like practical

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.520 
about and then our final like practical
kind<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.829> thing<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.160> we<00:03:21.280> did<00:03:21.519> was<00:03:22.150> actually

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
kind of thing that we did was actually

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.870 
kind of thing that we did was actually
taking<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.620> photo<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:24.010> we<00:03:24.310> found<00:03:24.549> online

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
taking a photo that we found online

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.030 
taking a photo that we found online
doing<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.959> makeup<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.620> he<00:03:26.769> wasn't

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
doing the makeup for it he wasn't

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.680 
doing the makeup for it he wasn't
judging<00:03:27.220> makeup<00:03:27.610> but<00:03:27.760> he<00:03:27.880> was<00:03:28.000> judging<00:03:28.299> how<00:03:28.630> we

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
judging makeup but he was judging how we

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.860 
judging makeup but he was judging how we
light<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.170> because<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.890> then<00:03:30.190> went<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.870> from

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
light it because we then went and from

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.810 
light it because we then went and from
the<00:03:31.989> photo<00:03:32.260> we<00:03:32.530> had<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.860> recreate<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.610> same
