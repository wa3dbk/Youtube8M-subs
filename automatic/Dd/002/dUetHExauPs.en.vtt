said to feature dis the Mazda rx-8 so
she<00:00:08.849> care<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.300> didn't<00:00:09.540> really<00:00:09.690> think<00:00:09.990> I

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
she care that I didn't really think I

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.320 
she care that I didn't really think I
was<00:00:10.320> gonna<00:00:10.469> actually<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.969> happened<00:00:12.210> sort

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
was gonna actually do what happened sort

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.580 
was gonna actually do what happened sort
of<00:00:12.389> project<00:00:12.719> drifting<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.049> but<00:00:13.259> then<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.380> looked

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
of project drifting on but then I looked

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.980 
of project drifting on but then I looked
at<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.400> like<00:00:14.519> wow<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.630> actually

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
at it and I was like wow this actually

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.080 
at it and I was like wow this actually
has<00:00:16.199> 50-50<00:00:16.980> weight<00:00:17.100> distribution<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.940> this

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
has 50-50 weight distribution so this

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.910 
has 50-50 weight distribution so this
might<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.359> sort<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.990> similar<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> Honda

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
might be sort of similar to the Honda

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.040 
might be sort of similar to the Honda
s2000<00:00:20.490> right<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.359> after<00:00:21.570> I've<00:00:21.660> doing<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
s2000 right there after I've doing it it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.779 
s2000 right there after I've doing it it
looks<00:00:22.199> like<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.010> looks<00:00:23.070> awesome<00:00:23.670> oh

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
looks like this and it looks awesome oh

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.340 
looks like this and it looks awesome oh
yeah<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> looks<00:00:24.750> pretty<00:00:24.990> good<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
yeah I think it looks pretty good the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
yeah I think it looks pretty good the
paint<00:00:25.619> job<00:00:25.800> kind<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> gives<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> sort<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> like

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
paint job kind of gives it sort of like

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.480 
paint job kind of gives it sort of like
a<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.900> tint<00:00:28.320> off<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.619> bronze<00:00:28.949> or<00:00:29.220> whatever

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
a that tint off like bronze or whatever

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.220 
a that tint off like bronze or whatever
you<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.449> able<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.840> probably<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you be able to see it probably in a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.749 
you be able to see it probably in a
sunlight<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> little<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:31.920> better<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.250> still<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
sunlight a little bit better but still I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.160 
sunlight a little bit better but still I
like<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> way<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.390> looks<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
like the way it looks I like the way it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.069 
like the way it looks I like the way it
looks<00:00:34.320> lowered<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.280> gray<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.520> gray<00:00:35.640> looks

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
looks lowered the gray on gray looks

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.380 
looks lowered the gray on gray looks
good<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.350> opinion<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.950> yeah<00:00:38.879> let's<00:00:39.300> go

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
good in my opinion and yeah let's go

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.180 
good in my opinion and yeah let's go
into<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> setup<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> setup<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.070> can

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
into the setup so the setup as you can

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
into the setup so the setup as you can
see<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> has<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:42.030> 550<00:00:42.989> brake<00:00:43.140> horsepower<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
see it has a 550 brake horsepower I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.479 
see it has a 550 brake horsepower I
didn't<00:00:43.710> want<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:43.980> any<00:00:44.129> higher

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
didn't want to go any higher

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.860 
didn't want to go any higher
I<00:00:44.520> could<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.180> still<00:00:45.390> changed<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I could have still changed the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
I could have still changed the
exhaustion<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.250> added<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
exhaustion or and or added a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
exhaustion or and or added a
supercharger<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> change<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> horsepower<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
supercharger to change the horsepower a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.889 
supercharger to change the horsepower a
bit<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> left<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> way<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
bit but I left it the way it is it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
bit but I left it the way it is it
weighs<00:00:52.079> 1072<00:00:52.920> kilos<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.399> that's<00:00:53.430> pretty<00:00:53.699> good

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
weighs 1072 kilos so that's pretty good

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
weighs 1072 kilos so that's pretty good
pretty<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:54.899> power<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> weight

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pretty really good power to weight

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.029 
pretty really good power to weight
distribution<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:57.109> yeah<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:58.920> much

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
distribution and yeah that's pretty much

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.410 
distribution and yeah that's pretty much
it<00:00:59.129> let's<00:00:59.430> take<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> track

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it let's take it out on the track

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.110 
it let's take it out on the track
so<00:01:00.719> um<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:02.190> we're<00:01:02.489> starting<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> cloud<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so um as we're starting in a cloud of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.320 
so um as we're starting in a cloud of
smoke<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:04.640> decide<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> Burnout<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.210> let's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
smoke I decide to do a Burnout one let's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.609 
smoke I decide to do a Burnout one let's
see<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.540> good<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.170> doing<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> burnout

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
see how good this is at doing a burnout

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.789 
see how good this is at doing a burnout
and<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.610> pretty<00:01:08.760> alright<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:10.590> care

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and it's pretty alright but the care

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.880 
and it's pretty alright but the care
itself<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.900> easy<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> hang<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
itself was easy to get the hang of it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.510 
itself was easy to get the hang of it
was<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:14.369> very<00:01:14.610> easy<00:01:14.850> um<00:01:16.100> when<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> messed

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
was actually very easy um when I messed

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
was actually very easy um when I messed
around<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> toe<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> camber<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
around with the toe in the camber in the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.440 
around with the toe in the camber in the
beginning<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.580> usually<00:01:20.820> add<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.180> sort<00:01:21.420> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
beginning I usually add some sort of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.440 
beginning I usually add some sort of
like<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> bass<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> him<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.320> pretty<00:01:22.590> much<00:01:22.710> um

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
like a bass to him so pretty much um

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.850 
like a bass to him so pretty much um
every<00:01:24.450> car<00:01:24.630> did<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.840> start<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.259> my<00:01:25.560> tune<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
every car did I start with my tune it

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
every car did I start with my tune it
for<00:01:25.890> drifting<00:01:26.280> they<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.150> start<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
for drifting they all start with the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 
for drifting they all start with the
exact<00:01:27.930> same<00:01:28.080> tune<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.250> go<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.000> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
exact same tune and then I go when I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
exact same tune and then I go when I
changed<00:01:30.360> from<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.659> basically<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
changed from there basically that's the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.160 
changed from there basically that's the
sale<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:33.000> tunes<00:01:33.210> work<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.659> start

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
sale that's a all my tunes work I start

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
sale that's a all my tunes work I start
off<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> same<00:01:34.650> exact<00:01:35.159> tune<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:36.090> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
off with the same exact tune and then I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
off with the same exact tune and then I
see<00:01:36.360> where<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.840> fix<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.470> change<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
see where I have to fix it and change it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
see where I have to fix it and change it
and<00:01:38.369> whatever<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> better<00:01:39.540> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and whatever to make it better so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
and whatever to make it better so
basically<00:01:40.110> um<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:41.250> had<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> change<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> dampers

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
basically um I had to change the dampers

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.569 
basically um I had to change the dampers
a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.899> had<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> change<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
a little bit on this I had to change the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.389 
a little bit on this I had to change the
tone<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> camber<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.360> course<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.990> make<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.399> you

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
tone the camber of course to make it you

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.010 
tone the camber of course to make it you
know<00:01:47.490> drive<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> wanted<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> drive

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
know drive the way I wanted it to drive

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.639 
know drive the way I wanted it to drive
so<00:01:49.700> here<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.869> actually

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
so here it is and it's a it's actually

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.460 
so here it is and it's a it's actually
very<00:01:52.890> easy<00:01:53.130> very<00:01:53.430> easy<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.119> drift<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.509> I'm

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
very easy very easy to drift so I'm

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.780 
very easy very easy to drift so I'm
happy<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.040> thing<00:01:56.100> turned<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
happy the way this thing turned out I

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.609 
happy the way this thing turned out I
was<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.689> said<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:58.020> skeptical<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
was as I said a bit skeptical at the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
was as I said a bit skeptical at the
beginning<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.399> didn't<00:01:59.939> think<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.180> an

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
beginning because I didn't think I'm an

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
beginning because I didn't think I'm an
rx-8<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.409> very<00:02:01.710> very<00:02:01.979> good<00:02:02.159> drift<00:02:02.520> car

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
rx-8 would be a very very good drift car

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.580 
rx-8 would be a very very good drift car
but<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:05.969> bit

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
but it actually is it's a little bit

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.380 
but it actually is it's a little bit
it's<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:08.160> little<00:02:08.670> bit<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:09.000> difficult<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it's just a little bit more difficult to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.600 
it's just a little bit more difficult to
drift<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.319> than<00:02:10.649> an<00:02:10.800> Oryx

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
drift in that than an Oryx

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.890 
drift in that than an Oryx

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
7

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.930 
7
and<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.319> very<00:02:13.799> very<00:02:13.950> similar<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> nest

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and it's very very similar to the nest

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.860 
and it's very very similar to the nest
mm<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.420> way<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.569> drives<00:02:15.690> very<00:02:15.900> very<00:02:16.769> similar

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
mm the way it drives very very similar

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.030 
mm the way it drives very very similar
probably<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.080> put<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.590> exact<00:02:19.890> same

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
probably if I put this the exact same

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920 
probably if I put this the exact same
tone<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.580> did<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.120> s2000<00:02:21.599> on<00:02:21.720> this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
tone that I did on the s2000 on this

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.649 
tone that I did on the s2000 on this
it'll<00:02:22.230> probably<00:02:22.319> work<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.920> well<00:02:23.099> or<00:02:23.909> vice

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
it'll probably work as well or vice

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.839 
it'll probably work as well or vice
versa<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.170> put<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:25.500> tune<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.280> s2000

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
versa if I put this tune on the s2000

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.339 
versa if I put this tune on the s2000
it'll<00:02:27.090> probably<00:02:27.239> work<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.720> s2000<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.200> well

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
it'll probably work on the s2000 as well

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.819 
it'll probably work on the s2000 as well
but<00:02:29.069> yeah<00:02:29.760> car<00:02:30.239> drives<00:02:30.450> great<00:02:30.629> tuners<00:02:31.530> alright

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
but yeah car drives great tuners alright

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:32.990 
but yeah car drives great tuners alright
I<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.250> it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I like it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.869 
I like it
I'm<00:02:33.599> keeping<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.349> anyway<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.829> am<00:02:35.549> going<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
I'm keeping it but anyway I am going to

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.420 
I'm keeping it but anyway I am going to
start<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.360> whole<00:02:36.690> week<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.260> GT<00:02:37.799> six<00:02:38.099> project

start a whole week of GT six project
drifting<00:02:38.670> videos<00:02:38.940> I've<00:02:39.060> done<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.299> with<00:02:39.420> Gran

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599

Turismo<00:02:39.720> 5<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.349> people<00:02:40.560> liked<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.970> liked<00:02:42.299> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
Turismo 5 and people liked it I liked it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.759 
Turismo 5 and people liked it I liked it
as<00:02:42.510> well<00:02:42.659> because<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.049> was<00:02:43.140> actually<00:02:43.530> fun<00:02:43.739> to

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
as well because it was actually fun to

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.979 
as well because it was actually fun to
do<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.129> bunch<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.489> cars<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.239> guys<00:02:45.420> are

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
do a bunch of cars that you guys are

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.589 
do a bunch of cars that you guys are
requesting<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.829> if<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.879> any<00:02:48.120> other<00:02:48.329> cars

single in my videos so far you know
people<00:02:52.829> asking<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:54.120> cars<00:02:54.629> to<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:54.810> featured<00:02:55.140> in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
people asking for cars to be featured in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.319 
people asking for cars to be featured in
this<00:02:55.379> game<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.799> want<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.099> see<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.459> again

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329

this is your chance to get your cars
featured<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.659> your<00:03:00.780> cars<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.349> get<00:03:01.590> me

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
it and most likely will end up do a

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.710 
it and most likely will end up do a
