00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
low ground pressures to be optimum we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.900 
low ground pressures to be optimum we
have<00:01:12.630> homes<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.530> close<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> project<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
have homes very close to the project so

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.380

a<00:01:15.240> lot<00:01:15.870> of<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> has<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.650> done<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.370> maybe<00:01:18.300> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
a lot of it has to be done with maybe a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.360 
a lot of it has to be done with maybe a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
preciseness of the work so we really

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.310 
preciseness of the work so we really
find<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.670> Deere<00:01:23.880> equipment<00:01:24.170> matches<00:01:25.170> up

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

of the day having the joysticks right on
the<00:03:20.669> arm<00:03:21.150> rests<00:03:21.779> it<00:03:22.139> really<00:03:22.469> has<00:03:22.590> helped<00:03:22.950> with

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
the arm rests it really has helped with

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.099 
the arm rests it really has helped with
in<00:03:23.519> gaining<00:03:23.819> productivity<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.779> other<00:03:24.900> piece

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
in gaining productivity the other piece

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.080 
in gaining productivity the other piece
that<00:03:25.139> we<00:03:25.469> really<00:03:25.829> do<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.159> is<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.579> John<00:03:26.819> Deere

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
that we really do like is the John Deere

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.569 
that we really do like is the John Deere
6:24<00:03:27.930> loaders<00:03:28.319> we<00:03:28.709> find<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.189> be<00:03:29.279> a<00:03:29.309> very

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
6:24 loaders we find it to be a very

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.629 
6:24 loaders we find it to be a very
versatile<00:03:30.180> piece<00:03:30.569> with<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.430> double<00:03:32.430> diff

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
versatile piece with the double diff

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.729 
versatile piece with the double diff
lock<00:03:32.909> so<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.719> actually<00:03:33.930> can<00:03:34.200> lock<00:03:34.379> up<00:03:34.559> all

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
lock so you actually can lock up all

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.259 
lock so you actually can lock up all
four<00:03:34.980> tires<00:03:35.249> and<00:03:35.489> have<00:03:35.579> them<00:03:35.730> all<00:03:35.879> pulling

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
four tires and have them all pulling

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.209 
four tires and have them all pulling
yourself<00:03:36.359> through<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.260> mud<00:03:37.439> and<00:03:37.469> soft<00:03:37.859> clays

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:38.219 
yourself through the mud and soft clays

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.690 
yourself through the mud and soft clays
so<00:03:38.879> so<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.540> almost<00:03:39.779> works<00:03:40.349> as<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:40.919> track<00:03:41.279> loader

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
so so it almost works as a track loader

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.059 
so so it almost works as a track loader
