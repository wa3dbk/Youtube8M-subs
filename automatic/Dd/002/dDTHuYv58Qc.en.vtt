00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.559 

all<00:00:01.570> right<00:00:02.080> this<00:00:02.379> is<00:00:02.740> a<00:00:03.370> Vanagon<00:00:03.909> front<00:00:04.359> brake

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:04.569 
all right this is a Vanagon front brake

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.139 
all right this is a Vanagon front brake
rotor<00:00:04.959> and<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:06.490> going<00:00:06.609> to<00:00:06.669> be<00:00:06.729> installing

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
rotor and I'm going to be installing

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.320 
rotor and I'm going to be installing
some<00:00:08.040> front<00:00:09.870> brake<00:00:11.400> I'm<00:00:12.400> actually<00:00:12.580> frosting

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
some front brake I'm actually frosting

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.690 
some front brake I'm actually frosting
some<00:00:13.450> front<00:00:13.690> wheel<00:00:13.780> bearings<00:00:14.170> and<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:15.580> of<00:00:15.640> the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
some front wheel bearings and one of the

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.040 
some front wheel bearings and one of the
big<00:00:15.850> things<00:00:16.119> about<00:00:16.240> doing<00:00:16.449> this<00:00:16.599> is

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
big things about doing this is

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.419 
big things about doing this is
installing<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:19.589> races<00:00:20.589> into<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:20.949> new<00:00:21.070> rotors

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:21.429 
installing the races into the new rotors

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.749 
installing the races into the new rotors
and<00:00:22.169> so<00:00:23.169> as<00:00:23.380> you<00:00:23.499> can<00:00:23.619> see<00:00:23.679> I'm<00:00:24.159> using<00:00:24.400> a<00:00:24.519> hammer

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
and so as you can see I'm using a hammer

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.130 
and so as you can see I'm using a hammer
and<00:00:25.739> basically<00:00:26.739> the<00:00:26.859> easiest<00:00:27.159> way<00:00:27.489> to<00:00:27.519> do<00:00:27.699> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and basically the easiest way to do this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.010 
and basically the easiest way to do this
is<00:00:29.140> just<00:00:29.199> Pat<00:00:29.859> back<00:00:30.099> and<00:00:30.310> forth<00:00:31.020> with<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.050> hammer

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
is just Pat back and forth with a hammer

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.110 
is just Pat back and forth with a hammer
you<00:00:35.020> try<00:00:35.320> you<00:00:35.590> don't<00:00:35.770> want<00:00:35.980> to<00:00:36.040> hit<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.430> here

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
you try you don't want to hit in here

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.900 
you try you don't want to hit in here
where<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.510> race<00:00:37.720> is<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:38.350> know<00:00:38.470> where<00:00:38.650> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
where the race is you know where the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.010 
where the race is you know where the
bearings<00:00:39.910> touch<00:00:40.180> but<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.890> funny<00:00:42.100> part<00:00:42.190> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
bearings touch but the funny part is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.350 
bearings touch but the funny part is
hitting<00:00:44.020> us<00:00:44.110> with<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.350> hammer<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:46.030> not<00:00:46.210> going

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
hitting us with a hammer it's not going

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.450 
hitting us with a hammer it's not going
to<00:00:46.420> hurt<00:00:46.570> anything<00:00:49.260> these<00:00:50.260> races<00:00:50.650> are<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:50.770> hard

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
to hurt anything these races are so hard

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.370 
to hurt anything these races are so hard
the<00:00:52.120> steel<00:00:52.630> is<00:00:53.220> harder<00:00:54.220> than<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.580> hammer<00:00:54.910> head

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
the steel is harder than the hammer head

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.990 
the steel is harder than the hammer head
and<00:00:56.380> I<00:00:56.470> have<00:00:56.650> removed<00:00:57.010> these<00:00:57.310> races<00:00:57.820> before

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
and I have removed these races before

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.520 
and I have removed these races before
with<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:59.110> cold<00:01:00.040> hard<00:01:00.400> and<00:01:00.579> chisel<00:01:01.230> when<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.320> get

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
with a cold hard and chisel when you get

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.910 
with a cold hard and chisel when you get
done<00:01:02.770> doing<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.160> the<00:01:03.640> end<00:01:03.850> of<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.119> chisel<00:01:04.600> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
done doing that the end of the chisel is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.660 
done doing that the end of the chisel is
trashed<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.850> races<00:01:07.330> still<00:01:07.750> look<00:01:07.990> fine<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
trashed and the races still look fine so

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.730 
trashed and the races still look fine so
don't<00:01:10.180> worry<00:01:10.330> about<00:01:10.570> damaging<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.170> races<00:01:11.590> but

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
don't worry about damaging the races but

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.360 
don't worry about damaging the races but
do<00:01:11.980> try<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.280> avoid<00:01:12.640> hitting<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:14.020> here<00:01:14.980> where

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
do try to avoid hitting in here where

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.100 
do try to avoid hitting in here where
the<00:01:15.970> bearings<00:01:16.360> are<00:01:16.450> going<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.630> touch<00:01:16.810> you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
the bearings are going to touch you

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.330 
the bearings are going to touch you
don't<00:01:17.350> want<00:01:17.530> hit<00:01:17.620> them<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.950> want<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.159> hit

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
don't want hit them and you want to hit

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.830 
don't want hit them and you want to hit
back<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.240> forth<00:01:20.430> tapping<00:01:21.430> as<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.760> go<00:01:21.850> down<00:01:22.090> it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
back and forth tapping as you go down it

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.050 
back and forth tapping as you go down it
will<00:01:22.930> go<00:01:22.960> down<00:01:23.229> as<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:24.310> get<00:01:24.460> farther<00:01:24.670> down

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
will go down as you get farther down

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.990 
will go down as you get farther down
towards<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.540> bottom<00:01:26.310> when<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.400> gets<00:01:27.520> past<00:01:27.790> the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
towards the bottom when it gets past the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.450 
towards the bottom when it gets past the
surface<00:01:28.510> right<00:01:28.720> here<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:30.130> want<00:01:30.400> to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
surface right here then you want to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.560 
surface right here then you want to
start<00:01:30.640> using<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:32.909> something<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.240> can<00:01:34.540> be

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
start using a something so that can be

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.630 
start using a something so that can be
recessed<00:01:35.290> in<00:01:35.530> there<00:01:35.770> like<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:38.430> socket<00:01:39.430> I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
recessed in there like this socket I

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.280 
recessed in there like this socket I
can't<00:01:40.240> remember<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.540> name<00:01:40.690> of<00:01:40.750> anything<00:01:41.080> this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
can't remember the name of anything this

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.219 
can't remember the name of anything this

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
morning too early so use a socket and

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.399 
morning too early so use a socket and
you<00:01:44.619> hit<00:01:44.860> against<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.369> tap<00:01:45.790> that<00:01:46.000> down<00:01:46.409> let

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
you hit against that tap that down let

you hit against that tap that down let
me<00:01:47.470> tap<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.770> down<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.920> little<00:01:48.010> bit<00:01:48.130> I'll<00:01:48.280> show

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310

you alright so as you can see I have

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.149 
you alright so as you can see I have
knocked<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.580> bearing<00:01:51.880> race<00:01:52.030> down<00:01:52.330> into<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
knocked the bearing race down into the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.800 
knocked the bearing race down into the
rotor<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.909> point<00:01:55.119> where<00:01:55.299> it's<00:01:55.420> just<00:01:55.450> going

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
rotor to the point where it's just going

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.020 
rotor to the point where it's just going
starting<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.260> go<00:01:56.320> below<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.740> edge<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.760> still

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
starting to go below this edge it still

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.750 
starting to go below this edge it still
has<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.330> go<00:01:58.479> down<00:01:58.990> here<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.740> where<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.400> see<00:02:00.610> the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
has to go down here to where you see the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.500 
has to go down here to where you see the
cutout<00:02:01.150> as<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:02.080> go<00:02:02.140> all<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.619> way<00:02:02.650> down<00:02:02.979> and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
cutout as you go all the way down and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.450 
cutout as you go all the way down and
bottom<00:02:04.510> out<00:02:04.869> there<00:02:05.140> before<00:02:05.619> you're<00:02:05.770> done<00:02:06.010> so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
bottom out there before you're done so

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.370 
bottom out there before you're done so
you<00:02:06.549> need<00:02:06.820> something<00:02:07.420> that's<00:02:08.049> going<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.259> be

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
you need something that's going to be

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.660 
you need something that's going to be
able<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.590> knock<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.770> down<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.310> rest<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
able to knock it down the rest of the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.020 
able to knock it down the rest of the
way<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.500> actually<00:02:11.890> part<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.459> front<00:02:12.849> end

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
way this is actually part of a front end

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.280 
way this is actually part of a front end
bearing

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290

press tool that you can use you just

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.030 
press tool that you can use you just
need<00:02:19.090> something<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.560> push<00:02:20.560> up<00:02:20.680> against<00:02:20.920> the

need something to push up against the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.789 
need something to push up against the
edge<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> race<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.230> tap<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.680> it

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
edge of the race so you can tap on it

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.610 
edge of the race so you can tap on it
with<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> hammer<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:26.140> course<00:02:26.379> it's<00:02:26.530> not

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
with a hammer and of course it's not

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.410 
with a hammer and of course it's not
going<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.860> stay<00:02:27.099> by<00:02:27.280> itself<00:02:27.310> because<00:02:27.909> expand

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
going to stay by itself because expand

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.990 
going to stay by itself because expand
or<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:30.280> know<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.549> like<00:02:30.640> something<00:02:30.910> like

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
or so you know it's like something like

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.670 
or so you know it's like something like
this<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.510> put<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.780> against<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.140> edge<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
this you put it against the edge of it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.729 
this you put it against the edge of it
and<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.280> give<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.760> some<00:02:33.879> tax<00:02:34.620> course<00:02:35.620> way

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
and you just give it some tax course way

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.140 
and you just give it some tax course way
harder<00:02:36.040> than<00:02:36.069> this<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.810> push<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.230> down<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
harder than this to push it down the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.699 
harder than this to push it down the
other<00:02:40.150> things<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.569> like<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.870> do<00:02:41.019> if<00:02:41.349> you<00:02:41.500> don't
