00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
compare phones are gonna put an LG shine

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
compare phones are gonna put an LG shine
up<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.449> exactly<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
up here and now we have exactly a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.279 
up here and now we have exactly a
side-by-side<00:00:59.219> comparison<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:01.109> can

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
side-by-side comparison that we can

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
side-by-side comparison that we can
resize<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.370> quickly<00:01:03.090> compare<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.750> curve

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
resize and quickly compare the curve

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.770 
resize and quickly compare the curve
8310<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> LG<00:01:05.400> shine<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.000> what<00:01:06.600> features

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
8310 to the LG shine and what features

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.920 
8310 to the LG shine and what features
they<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.290> both<00:01:07.590> 3G<00:01:08.100> both<00:01:08.640> bluetooth<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> see

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
they have both 3G both bluetooth and see

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
they have both 3G both bluetooth and see
what<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> different<00:01:10.799> features<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.460> we

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
what the different features are that we

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.420 
what the different features are that we
might<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> compare<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.560> pick<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> phone

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
might want to compare and pick the phone

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
might want to compare and pick the phone
maybe<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.270> BlackBerry<00:01:15.659> has<00:01:15.810> more

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
maybe it's the BlackBerry has more

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
maybe it's the BlackBerry has more
battery<00:01:16.380> life<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.890> hours<00:01:17.189> instead<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> three

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
battery life for hours instead of three

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.149 
battery life for hours instead of three
hours<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.450> maybe<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.860> pick<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
hours so maybe we pick the the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.550 
hours so maybe we pick the the
BlackBerry<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> cool

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
BlackBerry there as well one of the cool

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
BlackBerry there as well one of the cool
things<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> table<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.520> also<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.240> go

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
things that the table can also do is go

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.600 
things that the table can also do is go
to<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.990> coverage<00:01:25.470> map<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.009> actually<00:01:26.189> drill

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
to a coverage map we can actually drill

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.789 
to a coverage map we can actually drill
down<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.850> any<00:01:27.180> city<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.720> America<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
down to any city in America get all the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.700 
down to any city in America get all the
way<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.490> street<00:01:30.030> level<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.110> go

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
way down to street level and then go

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640 
way down to street level and then go
down<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.220> pick<00:01:32.700> 3G<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> find<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
down here and pick 3G and find what the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.319 
down here and pick 3G and find what the
3G<00:01:35.130> coverage<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.119> particular

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
3G coverage is so in this particular

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.060 
3G coverage is so in this particular
neighborhood<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:37.409> 3G<00:01:37.799> coverage

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
neighborhood there's 3G coverage

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.520 
neighborhood there's 3G coverage
