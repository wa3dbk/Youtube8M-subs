00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
different it's not a Decker wheel review

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.519 
different it's not a Decker wheel review
but<00:00:26.500> this<00:00:26.710> time<00:00:27.039> we<00:00:27.250> will<00:00:27.429> be<00:00:27.580> reviewing<00:00:28.000> some

Riptide wfb bushings for you I have
three<00:00:32.650> different<00:00:32.980> shapes<00:00:33.190> that<00:00:33.400> we'll<00:00:33.730> be

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
three different shapes that we'll be

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.570 
three different shapes that we'll be
reviewing<00:00:34.589> as<00:00:35.589> well<00:00:35.949> as<00:00:36.100> different

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
reviewing as well as different

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.189 
reviewing as well as different
combinations<00:00:37.150> that<00:00:37.420> I've<00:00:37.510> tried<00:00:37.720> out<00:00:37.780> and

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
combinations that I've tried out and

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.439 
combinations that I've tried out and
which<00:00:38.320> ones<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:38.650> like<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.830> best<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:40.030> free

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
which ones I like the best for free

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.450 
which ones I like the best for free

world's<00:00:49.449> fastest<00:00:49.989> bushing<00:00:50.469> this<00:00:51.340> is<00:00:51.489> because

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
world's fastest bushing this is because

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.180 
world's fastest bushing this is because
it<00:00:52.059> comes<00:00:52.300> with<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.539> free<00:00:52.809> lubricated<00:00:53.739> surface

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
it comes with a free lubricated surface

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.700 
it comes with a free lubricated surface
which<00:00:54.969> allows<00:00:55.390> less<00:00:55.780> resistance<00:00:56.379> in<00:00:56.590> the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
which allows less resistance in the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.180 
which allows less resistance in the
truck<00:00:57.010> so<00:00:57.940> you<00:00:57.969> get<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.329> deeper<00:00:58.780> turn<00:00:58.989> as<00:00:59.440> well

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
truck so you get a deeper turn as well

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.549 
truck so you get a deeper turn as well
as<00:01:00.340> a<00:01:00.370> quicker<00:01:00.699> response<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.510> allows<00:01:02.050> for<00:01:02.289> a

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
as a quicker response and allows for a

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.460 
as a quicker response and allows for a
very<00:01:02.949> fluid<00:01:03.420> motion<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> truck<00:01:04.839> I've

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
very fluid motion of the truck I've

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.669 
very fluid motion of the truck I've
never<00:01:05.710> felt<00:01:05.950> any<00:01:06.190> bushings<00:01:06.610> like<00:01:06.820> this<00:01:07.000> before

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
never felt any bushings like this before

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:12.090 
never felt any bushings like this before
I've<00:01:08.679> come<00:01:09.009> from<00:01:09.690> countless<00:01:10.690> sets<00:01:11.259> of<00:01:11.619> Venom's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
I've come from countless sets of Venom's

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.560 
I've come from countless sets of Venom's
and<00:01:12.369> these<00:01:12.640> are<00:01:12.820> probably<00:01:13.090> some<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.420> most

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
and these are probably some of the most

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.929 
and these are probably some of the most
lively<00:01:13.840> bushings<00:01:14.439> I've<00:01:14.650> ever<00:01:14.830> ridden<00:01:15.100> with

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
lively bushings I've ever ridden with

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.960 
lively bushings I've ever ridden with
disappointment<00:01:16.360> you're<00:01:17.229> gonna<00:01:17.500> be

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
disappointment you're gonna be

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.850 
disappointment you're gonna be
experiencing<00:01:19.020> roughly<00:01:20.020> fifteen<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.590> twenty

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
experiencing roughly fifteen to twenty

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.789 
experiencing roughly fifteen to twenty
percent<00:01:20.890> more<00:01:21.280> turn<00:01:21.820> than<00:01:22.390> another<00:01:23.259> bushing

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
percent more turn than another bushing

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.429 
percent more turn than another bushing
of<00:01:23.979> comparable<00:01:24.579> durometer<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:26.020> when<00:01:26.290> you're

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
of comparable durometer so when you're

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.859 
of comparable durometer so when you're
choosing<00:01:27.009> bushings<00:01:27.640> you're<00:01:28.180> gonna<00:01:28.479> want<00:01:28.780> to

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
choosing bushings you're gonna want to

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.899 
choosing bushings you're gonna want to
go<00:01:29.110> at<00:01:29.320> least<00:01:29.560> two<00:01:30.250> maybe<00:01:30.579> even<00:01:30.700> three

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
go at least two maybe even three

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.789 
go at least two maybe even three
barometers<00:01:31.840> higher<00:01:32.079> than<00:01:32.350> you're<00:01:32.500> used<00:01:32.530> to

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
barometers higher than you're used to

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.819 
barometers higher than you're used to
another<00:01:33.640> aspect<00:01:34.180> that<00:01:34.270> sets<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.840> WFP<00:01:35.259> apart

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
another aspect that sets the WFP apart

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.090 
another aspect that sets the WFP apart
from<00:01:36.159> other<00:01:36.430> bushings

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
from other bushings

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.780 
from other bushings
is<00:01:37.189> their<00:01:37.490> extremely<00:01:38.060> low<00:01:38.479> return<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:39.080> center

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
is their extremely low return to center

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.060 
is their extremely low return to center
a<00:01:40.790> lot<00:01:41.180> of<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.390> people<00:01:41.720> who<00:01:42.500> step<00:01:42.799> on<00:01:42.920> these

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
a lot of the people who step on these

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.460 
a lot of the people who step on these
bushings<00:01:43.549> kind<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.390> refer<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:44.810> them<00:01:44.930> as<00:01:44.960> mushy

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
bushings kind of refer to them as mushy

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.910 
bushings kind of refer to them as mushy
but<00:01:46.400> I<00:01:46.670> want<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.390> describe<00:01:47.659> it<00:01:47.900> as<00:01:48.049> completely

durometer I went ahead and chose this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.090 
durometer I went ahead and chose this
standard<00:02:34.730> setup<00:02:34.970> because<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.750> come<00:02:36.470> from<00:02:36.680> a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100

freeride riptide double barrels however
are<00:02:48.290> extremely<00:02:49.070> diving<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.299> most

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
that I've tried Riptide I would

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.680 
that I've tried Riptide I would
recommend<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.400> double<00:02:55.549> barrel<00:02:55.850> combo<00:02:56.390> to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
recommend the double barrel combo to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.380 
recommend the double barrel combo to
mostly<00:02:57.410> free<00:02:57.650> riding<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.790> find<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.090> little<00:02:59.269> bit

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
mostly free riding and find a little bit

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.150 
mostly free riding and find a little bit
if<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.079> have<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.440> durometer

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
if I have one durometer

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.690 
if I have one durometer
harder<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:02.350> 793<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.440> also<00:03:03.799> had<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> ninety-five

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
harder so 793 I also had a ninety-five

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.020 
harder so 793 I also had a ninety-five
point<00:03:05.000> five<00:03:05.269> eight<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.810> would<00:03:06.640> use<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.790> double

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
point five eight I would use the double

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.830 
point five eight I would use the double
barrel<00:03:08.180> combo<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.630> lot<00:03:08.810> more<00:03:08.989> effectively

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
barrel combo a lot more effectively

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.800 
barrel combo a lot more effectively
but<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.440> double<00:03:10.739> 93a<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:12.060> was<00:03:12.209> just<00:03:12.540> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
but with the double 93a it was just a

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.140 
but with the double 93a it was just a
little<00:03:13.319> too<00:03:13.590> much<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.519> got<00:03:14.670> wheel<00:03:14.910> bike

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
little too much and I got wheel bike

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.059 
little too much and I got wheel bike
pretty<00:03:15.510> easy<00:03:15.750> however<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.319> was<00:03:16.560> still<00:03:16.739> able<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
pretty easy however I was still able to

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.280 
pretty easy however I was still able to
take<00:03:17.280> them<00:03:17.489> up<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.640> speed<00:03:17.849> around<00:03:18.180> 45<00:03:18.900> miles<00:03:19.140> an

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
take them up to speed around 45 miles an

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.790 
take them up to speed around 45 miles an
hour

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
hour

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.339 
hour
nice<00:03:20.340> combination<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.970> tried<00:03:21.239> was<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.840> chubby

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
nice combination I tried was a chubby

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.199 
nice combination I tried was a chubby
and<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:23.190> barrel

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
and a barrel

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.900 
and a barrel
both<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.870> 93<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> durometer<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.310> chubby<00:03:26.640> barrel

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
both of 93 a durometer the chubby barrel

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.000 
both of 93 a durometer the chubby barrel
combo<00:03:27.269> made<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.599> nice<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.140> stable<00:03:28.620> for

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
combo made it nice and stable for

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.660 
combo made it nice and stable for
downhill

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
downhill

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.789 
downhill
I<00:03:29.780> felt<00:03:30.780> way<00:03:30.930> more<00:03:30.959> comfortable<00:03:31.379> on<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
I felt way more comfortable on the

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.160 
I felt way more comfortable on the
chubby<00:03:32.010> barrel<00:03:32.489> combo<00:03:32.910> than<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.090> did<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
chubby barrel combo than I did the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.229 
chubby barrel combo than I did the
double<00:03:34.500> barrel<00:03:34.680> combo<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.970> partly

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
double barrel combo this is partly

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.270 
double barrel combo this is partly
because<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> instant<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.799> chubby

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
because of the instant that the chubby

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.000 
because of the instant that the chubby
uses<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.420> fits<00:03:39.660> nice<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.379> tight<00:03:40.590> into<00:03:40.920> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
uses so it fits nice and tight into the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.870 
uses so it fits nice and tight into the
bushing<00:03:41.340> seat<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.930> then<00:03:42.930> right<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.440> it's

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
bushing seat and then right as it's

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.180 
bushing seat and then right as it's
exiting<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.030> bushing<00:03:45.390> see<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:46.200> expands<00:03:46.950> and

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
exiting the bushing see it expands and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.910 
exiting the bushing see it expands and
becomes<00:03:47.340> wider<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:48.959> helps<00:03:49.319> restrict<00:03:49.739> some

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
becomes wider so it helps restrict some

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.009 
becomes wider so it helps restrict some
of<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.069> lean<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.910> said<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.450> setup<00:03:51.750> was

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
of the lean like I said that setup was

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.190 
of the lean like I said that setup was
the<00:03:52.049> most<00:03:52.380> stable<00:03:52.709> for<00:03:53.130> downhill<00:03:54.019> but<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.049> also

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
the most stable for downhill but I also

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.949 
the most stable for downhill but I also
rubbed<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.099> on<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> slide<00:03:56.549> jam<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.150> was<00:03:57.299> still<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
rubbed it on a slide jam and was still a

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.800 
rubbed it on a slide jam and was still a
little<00:03:58.110> freeride<00:03:58.650> quite<00:03:59.040> nicely<00:03:59.459> it<00:04:00.450> offered

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
little freeride quite nicely it offered

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.360 
little freeride quite nicely it offered
a<00:04:01.049> little<00:04:01.349> bit<00:04:01.470> more<00:04:01.650> control<00:04:02.040> than<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
a little bit more control than the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.890 
a little bit more control than the
double<00:04:02.610> barrel<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.239> just<00:04:03.450> didn't<00:04:03.720> tip

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
double barrel so you just didn't tip

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.309 
double barrel so you just didn't tip
over

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
over

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.280 
over
you've<00:04:04.860> has<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> nice<00:04:05.489> lean<00:04:06.209> initiation<00:04:06.900> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
you've has a nice lean initiation and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.860 
you've has a nice lean initiation and
the<00:04:07.379> nice<00:04:07.560> control<00:04:08.040> from<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.549> chubby<00:04:08.870> the

the nice control from the chubby the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.900 
the nice control from the chubby the
last<00:04:10.079> setup<00:04:10.319> I<00:04:10.470> tried<00:04:10.739> was<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:10.980> fat<00:04:11.250> cone<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
last setup I tried was the fat cone and

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.210 
last setup I tried was the fat cone and
a<00:04:12.480> barrel<00:04:13.379> combo<00:04:13.799> both<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.430> 93<00:04:14.940> again<00:04:15.979> this<00:04:16.979> is

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
a barrel combo both of 93 again this is

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.120 
a barrel combo both of 93 again this is
pretty<00:04:18.209> similar<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.930> chubby<00:04:19.260> considering

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
pretty similar to the chubby considering

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.700 
pretty similar to the chubby considering
the<00:04:20.400> fat<00:04:20.609> cone<00:04:20.850> has<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.239> same<00:04:21.479> in<00:04:21.780> step<00:04:22.079> and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
the fat cone has the same in step and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.610 
the fat cone has the same in step and
then<00:04:22.889> expansion<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.760> wider<00:04:24.090> width<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:25.289> the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
then expansion to a wider width but the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.200 
then expansion to a wider width but the
fact<00:04:25.830> cone<00:04:26.010> is<00:04:26.220> gonna<00:04:26.400> be<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.669> little<00:04:26.880> bit<00:04:27.030> more

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
fact cone is gonna be a little bit more

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.000 
fact cone is gonna be a little bit more
progressive<00:04:27.450> than<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.050> Chubby's<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:28.710> you're

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
progressive than the Chubby's so you're

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.740 
progressive than the Chubby's so you're
still<00:04:29.250> gonna<00:04:29.340> have<00:04:29.580> some<00:04:29.789> nice<00:04:29.940> easy<00:04:30.330> lean

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
still gonna have some nice easy lean

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.200 
still gonna have some nice easy lean
right<00:04:31.650> away<00:04:31.919> but<00:04:32.220> as<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.580> get<00:04:32.729> to<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.970> end<00:04:33.120> of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
right away but as you get to the end of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.129 
right away but as you get to the end of
the<00:04:33.300> lean<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:34.610> fat<00:04:35.610> come<00:04:35.849> kicks<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.389> and<00:04:36.660> helps

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
the lean the fat come kicks in and helps

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.779 
the lean the fat come kicks in and helps
restrict<00:04:37.560> something<00:04:38.070> compared<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.639> the

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
restrict something compared to the

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.570 
restrict something compared to the
double<00:04:39.450> barrel<00:04:39.599> combo<00:04:40.110> but<00:04:40.950> it's<00:04:41.099> still<00:04:41.310> more

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
double barrel combo but it's still more

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.730 
double barrel combo but it's still more
responsive<00:04:42.180> than<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.539> barrel<00:04:42.870> chubby<00:04:43.380> combo

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
responsive than the barrel chubby combo

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.440 
responsive than the barrel chubby combo
I<00:04:43.950> found<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.580> be<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.789> best<00:04:44.970> option<00:04:45.240> for

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
I found this to be the best option for

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.629 
I found this to be the best option for
free<00:04:45.780> riding<00:04:46.050> you<00:04:46.770> can<00:04:46.800> still<00:04:47.130> take<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.370> down

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
free riding you can still take it down

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.510 
free riding you can still take it down
the<00:04:47.789> hill<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.090> stuff<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:48.690> with<00:04:48.900> the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
the hill and stuff but with the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.420 
the hill and stuff but with the
the<00:04:49.669> fact<00:04:49.910> owned<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.389> really<00:04:50.690> provides<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.199> nice

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
the fact owned it really provides a nice

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.159 
the fact owned it really provides a nice
progressive<00:04:52.430> feeling<00:04:52.789> for<00:04:53.030> slides<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.110> you

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
progressive feeling for slides so you

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.920 
progressive feeling for slides so you
don't<00:04:54.530> keep<00:04:54.979> leaning<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.639> I<00:04:56.030> sat<00:04:56.300> on<00:04:56.569> some<00:04:56.870> of

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
don't keep leaning and I sat on some of

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.710 
don't keep leaning and I sat on some of
your<00:04:57.020> slides<00:04:57.259> I<00:04:57.590> weigh<00:04:58.009> roughly<00:04:58.250> 170<00:04:59.240> pounds

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
your slides I weigh roughly 170 pounds

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.110 
your slides I weigh roughly 170 pounds
and<00:05:00.160> all<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.340> bushings<00:05:01.639> I've<00:05:01.849> tried

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
and all the bushings I've tried

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.360 
and all the bushings I've tried
permanent<00:05:02.539> ride<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:02.930> far<00:05:03.169> has<00:05:03.440> been<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.650> 93<00:05:04.340> a

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
permanent ride so far has been a 93 a

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.760 
permanent ride so far has been a 93 a
durometer<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.509> is<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.690> pretty<00:05:05.960> solid<00:05:06.229> feeling

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
durometer this is a pretty solid feeling

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.879 
durometer this is a pretty solid feeling
for<00:05:06.979> me<00:05:07.099> however<00:05:07.780> at<00:05:08.780> first<00:05:09.050> it<00:05:09.349> was<00:05:09.470> a<00:05:09.500> little

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
for me however at first it was a little

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.640 
for me however at first it was a little
extreme<00:05:10.639> almost<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:11.630> felt<00:05:11.900> like<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.259> was<00:05:12.410> riding

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
extreme almost it felt like I was riding

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.559 
extreme almost it felt like I was riding
something<00:05:13.220> almost<00:05:13.550> like<00:05:13.729> 88

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
something almost like 88

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.499 
something almost like 88
so<00:05:15.139> if<00:05:16.099> I<00:05:16.190> were<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.340> recommend<00:05:16.669> to<00:05:16.970> someone<00:05:17.180> of

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
so if I were to recommend to someone of

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.120 
so if I were to recommend to someone of
my<00:05:17.690> weight<00:05:17.960> caliber<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.560> would<00:05:18.680> recommend

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
my weight caliber I would recommend

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.490 
my weight caliber I would recommend
messing<00:05:19.729> around<00:05:19.849> with<00:05:20.120> some<00:05:20.419> of<00:05:20.509> the<00:05:20.569> 9525

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
messing around with some of the 9525

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.560 
messing around with some of the 9525
days<00:05:21.889> just<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.520> get<00:05:22.729> that<00:05:22.880> added<00:05:23.240> extra

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
days just so you get that added extra

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.450 
days just so you get that added extra
stability<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.620> it<00:05:24.919> doesn't<00:05:25.250> feel<00:05:25.400> like

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
stability and it doesn't feel like

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.520 
stability and it doesn't feel like
you'll<00:05:25.820> just<00:05:26.000> dive<00:05:26.630> right<00:05:26.960> off<00:05:27.110> your<00:05:27.289> board

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
you'll just dive right off your board

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.980 
you'll just dive right off your board
and<00:05:27.680> fall<00:05:27.889> over<00:05:27.919> but<00:05:28.729> after<00:05:29.000> several<00:05:29.539> weeks<00:05:29.720> of

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
and fall over but after several weeks of

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.409 
and fall over but after several weeks of
writing<00:05:30.320> these<00:05:30.470> bushings<00:05:30.949> I<00:05:31.639> really<00:05:32.240> like

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
writing these bushings I really like

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.730 
writing these bushings I really like
them<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:32.840> they'll<00:05:33.229> probably<00:05:33.380> make<00:05:33.680> a

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
them and they'll probably make a

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.379 
them and they'll probably make a
permanent<00:05:34.280> replacement<00:05:34.490> of<00:05:34.880> my<00:05:35.090> venom

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
permanent replacement of my venom

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.360 
permanent replacement of my venom
bushing<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.960> may<00:05:36.320> even<00:05:36.620> try<00:05:36.740> have<00:05:36.979> the<00:05:37.160> other

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
bushing I may even try have the other

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.820 
bushing I may even try have the other
formula<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.090> riptide<00:05:38.419> offers<00:05:38.810> as<00:05:39.349> well<00:05:39.680> as

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
formula that riptide offers as well as

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.499 
formula that riptide offers as well as
some<00:05:40.009> different<00:05:40.039> diameters<00:05:40.789> to<00:05:40.820> get<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> nice

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
some different diameters to get a nice

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.360 
some different diameters to get a nice
perfectly<00:05:42.080> entitled<00:05:42.349> infield<00:05:42.949> that's<00:05:43.190> going

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
perfectly entitled infield that's going

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.830 
perfectly entitled infield that's going
to<00:05:43.460> go<00:05:43.550> ahead<00:05:43.669> and<00:05:43.940> wrap<00:05:44.090> up<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.479> review<00:05:44.810> of

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
to go ahead and wrap up the review of

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.140 
to go ahead and wrap up the review of
the<00:05:45.409> Riptide<00:05:45.830> and<00:05:45.860> definitely<00:05:46.430> beat<00:05:46.729> bushings

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
the Riptide and definitely beat bushings

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.120 
the Riptide and definitely beat bushings
I<00:05:47.360> just<00:05:47.569> want<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.900> go<00:05:48.380> ahead<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:48.680> say<00:05:48.830> again

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130
