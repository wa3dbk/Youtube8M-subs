00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello girls here is the new video 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.509
 in this video I'll show you 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.580
 finally a nail art network 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 Christmas in particular as a realization 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.019
 a snowman for the base of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.059
 I refer to the video on needle technique 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 take the acrylic colors in this case 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.920
 a red white black is an orange and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.519
 I go with white is a pointed brush 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.160
 0 to draw the outline of my puppet 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.740
 of snow that was there the snowman 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 usually presents two or three balls 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.969
 three snowballs 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.010
 in this case I made two ifs 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.840
 used acrylic colors bought in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.530
 I recommend the fine art shops 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.180
 diluted with water and make two 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.190
 pass in order to make it beautiful 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 covering the color and eliminating 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.710
 any furrows or streaks that have occurred 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.539
 create by stretching the color then always 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.180
 with the zero point brush after having it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.879
 clean I take the black color and go to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.620
 make the hat in this case 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.480
 I do it leaning on you side then 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.850
 you can do it the way you want 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.949
 it is a very stylized thing therefore also 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 quite simple to do is always with 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.390
 black color I make eyes the hand that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.740
 this is also very stylized 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.990
 perfectly to make the meshes of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.780
 snowmen using the branches and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 the more I also make the broom I put it 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 behind so that it looks like he kept it 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.180
 in hand with the other and with the other 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.400
 and to do the purpose of using three 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.619
 color the black which is the base then later 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.210
 with the white the white mixed a bit of 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.850
 black to get gray I go to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.170
 draw the inner part of the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.869
 broom 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.119
 at this point he takes the red and I go to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.530
 make the scarf follow the outline 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.170
 of the ball that you have made so 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.770
 that is even more realistic and also 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 for the final part of the scarf 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.880
 follow the contour and body so 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.369
 to give even more volume give a 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 volume to this snowman with 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.310
 orange goes to be done 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.270
 the nose and finally with a brush goes to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.000
 realize of the points of light can 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.030
 being more or less large can be 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.979
 also snowflakes 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.720
 if you are really good in this case 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.420
 I couldn't have done it anyway 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.630
 I wanted to give greater emphasis to the puppet 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.480
 of snow than to decoration in general 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 and finally just to increase the points 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.420
 light then focus on 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.700
 this kind of the core on this 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.920
 right I go with the base gel and the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.380
 rhinestones to apply a small layer to the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 center of the two snowflakes or points 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.650
 biggest light I made e 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.640
 using the white acrylic color e 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.380
 using the base gel should be done 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.330
 catalyze in the lamp two minutes or 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.440
 you can also use the glue for 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.800
 Finally, I apply the sealing gel 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.130
 over the entire nail and catalyze it 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.050
 the four-minute lamp is one 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.150
 decoration that admits fines because 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.950
 however very effective very Christmas 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.860
 very beautiful and obvious that anyway it is a 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.120
 type of decoration in which in my opinion more than 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.950
 the decoration if you have to be 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.560
 be careful with the details because when you do 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.890
 they do these jobs you also need a 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.870
 just think about it, think about what 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.970
 on how to do it and maybe do some 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.799
 try it on a card because I have it 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.380
 done first on cardboard and then ho 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.299
 tried to do it again on the nail I hope that 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.010
 to you like it I like it a lot e 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.420
 all my friends also make me i 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.190
 congratulations because they don't believe that 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.859
 he realized that I designed it 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.660
 me on my finger 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.000
 I hope you like it too 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.519
 you decide to reproduce it to do it again 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.560
 let me know if it came to you if it is not there 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.269
 come what friends and relatives say and 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.340
 all I send you a big kiss 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.340
 hi girls to the next video
