what<00:00:06.510> we're<00:00:06.630> doing<00:00:06.900> is<00:00:06.960> we're<00:00:07.140> evaluating<00:00:07.650> a

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
what we're doing is we're evaluating a

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.520 
what we're doing is we're evaluating a
full<00:00:08.430> for<00:00:08.910> conformation<00:00:09.780> problems<00:00:10.320> as<00:00:10.500> you

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
full for conformation problems as you

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.459 
full for conformation problems as you
can<00:00:10.799> see<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.910> left<00:00:12.240> front<00:00:12.600> leg<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.020> this<00:00:13.200> fall

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
can see the left front leg of this fall

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.820 
can see the left front leg of this fall
is<00:00:13.680> very<00:00:14.070> varus<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.180> it<00:00:15.330> toes<00:00:15.629> in<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
is very varus in that it toes in and the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.760 
is very varus in that it toes in and the
knee<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.310> crooked<00:00:17.550> through<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> knee<00:00:18.770> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
knee it's crooked through the knee the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
knee it's crooked through the knee the
knee<00:00:19.800> breaks<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> full<00:00:21.180> walks<00:00:21.570> if

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
knee breaks out when the full walks if

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.960 
knee breaks out when the full walks if
you<00:00:22.560> drop<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> line<00:00:23.339> down<00:00:23.820> through<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.269> leg

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
you drop a line down through this leg

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.609 
you drop a line down through this leg
the<00:00:26.970> leg<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> leg<00:00:27.570> tends<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> go<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.410> this

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the leg the leg tends to go like this

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.819 
the leg the leg tends to go like this
and<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:28.980> arc<00:00:29.249> to<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> inside<00:00:30.380> meaning<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.529> he

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
and an arc to the inside meaning that he

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.760 
and an arc to the inside meaning that he
is<00:00:32.270> base<00:00:33.270> narrow<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.140> wide<00:00:34.350> through<00:00:34.740> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
is base narrow and wide through the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.580 
is base narrow and wide through the
knees<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.970> look<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.450> left<00:00:36.690> knee<00:00:36.960> fairly

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
knees you look at this left knee fairly

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.889 
knees you look at this left knee fairly
obviously<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.850> goes<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> toe

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
obviously it goes like this the toe

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.770 
obviously it goes like this the toe
faces<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.559> way<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.949> his<00:00:41.129> full<00:00:41.570> ages<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
faces that way as his full ages and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.560 
faces that way as his full ages and
gains<00:00:43.020> weight<00:00:43.410> his<00:00:44.190> left<00:00:44.550> leg<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:45.059> continue

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
gains weight his left leg will continue

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.110 
gains weight his left leg will continue
to<00:00:45.690> bend<00:00:46.020> further<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.859> his<00:00:47.399> knee<00:00:47.640> will<00:00:47.850> break

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
to bend further and his knee will break

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.630 
to bend further and his knee will break
out<00:00:48.359> furthers<00:00:48.780> Neil<00:00:49.050> come<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
out furthers Neil come this way and the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
out furthers Neil come this way and the
toe<00:00:50.879> will<00:00:51.090> go<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.079> want<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> avoid

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
toe will go this way so we want to avoid

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
toe will go this way so we want to avoid
that<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.609> that<00:00:53.969> puts<00:00:54.149> too<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.420> pressure

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that because that puts too much pressure

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.009 
that because that puts too much pressure
on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> joints<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.179> in<00:00:57.179> and<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.750> fashion

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
on the joints in in and in a fashion

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.680 
on the joints in in and in a fashion
that<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.649> causes<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> develop<00:01:00.210> chips

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that that causes them to develop chips

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.930 
that that causes them to develop chips
on<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.469> inside<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> knee<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
on the inside of the knee because the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
on the inside of the knee because the
inside<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> knee<00:01:03.629> carries<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.290> pressure

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
inside of the knee carries more pressure

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.090 
inside of the knee carries more pressure
when<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> knee<00:01:05.250> breaks<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> toes<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.200> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
when the knee breaks out and toes in so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.760 
when the knee breaks out and toes in so
our<00:01:08.610> object<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.690> try<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:09.990> improve<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
our object here is to try to improve the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
our object here is to try to improve the
conformation<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.670> animal<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.870> that<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
conformation of this animal so that it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.280 
conformation of this animal so that it
will<00:01:13.500> sustain<00:01:13.890> racing<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.760> high<00:01:14.940> speed<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:16.170> as

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
will sustain racing at high speed for as

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.680 
will sustain racing at high speed for as
long<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.590> possible<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.730> breeds<00:01:18.090> both<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
long as possible the breeds both the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.910 
long as possible the breeds both the
thoroughbreds<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.410> standard<00:01:19.740> Brits

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
thoroughbreds and the standard Brits

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.530 
thoroughbreds and the standard Brits
have<00:01:20.130> gravitated<00:01:20.760> towards<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.300> type<00:01:21.480> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
have gravitated towards this type of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
have gravitated towards this type of
conformation<00:01:22.260> over<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> years<00:01:23.180> because

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
conformation over the years because

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.220 
conformation over the years because
these<00:01:24.390> horses<00:01:24.660> tend<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.200> faster<00:01:25.470> than

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
these horses tend to be faster than

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.100 
these horses tend to be faster than
horses<00:01:28.230> that<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.560> towed<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
horses that are towed out so with that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.650 
horses that are towed out so with that
whereas<00:01:31.590> 3040<00:01:32.580> years<00:01:32.790> ago<00:01:33.060> most<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
whereas 3040 years ago most of the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.850 
whereas 3040 years ago most of the
standard<00:01:34.050> breads<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> many<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
standard breads and many of the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.120 
standard breads and many of the
thoroughbreds<00:01:35.340> were<00:01:35.430> towed<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.660> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
thoroughbreds were towed out the the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
thoroughbreds were towed out the the
tendency<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.370> is<00:01:38.760> for<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> foals<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.720> be

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
tendency now is for the foals to be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.930 
tendency now is for the foals to be
towed<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.580> prime<00:01:41.910> example

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
towed in and this is a prime example

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.080 
towed in and this is a prime example
it's<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:42.900> as<00:01:43.080> bad<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.560> some<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.830> them<00:01:43.980> get<00:01:44.250> but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it's not as bad as some of them get but

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.570 
it's not as bad as some of them get but
now<00:01:45.240> we're<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.310> some

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
now we're going to go to the to put some

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.970 
now we're going to go to the to put some
aqua<00:01:48.570> locks<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.080> outside<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.530> his<00:01:49.650> feet

aqua locks on the outside of his feet

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.890 
aqua locks on the outside of his feet
while<00:01:50.520> he's<00:01:50.730> still<00:01:51.030> young<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.420> fall<00:01:51.660> is<00:01:51.780> only

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
while he's still young this fall is only

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.960 
while he's still young this fall is only
about<00:01:52.140> two<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.470> half<00:01:52.590> weeks<00:01:52.830> old<00:01:53.100> we'll<00:01:53.790> put

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
about two and a half weeks old we'll put

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.450 
about two and a half weeks old we'll put
the<00:01:54.060> equi<00:01:54.360> locks<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.780> his<00:01:54.900> feet<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.380> manage<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the equi locks on his feet to manage the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.980 
the equi locks on his feet to manage the
positioning<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.180> his<00:01:57.330> feet<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:57.870> we'll
