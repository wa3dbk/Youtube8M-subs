00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.930
 paris kept restricted a lot of fishing 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.920
 a man could make jam with that or why not and here we 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.719
 would be quiet 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.119
 we would have for this course commented on the little already for a moment you in 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.739
 think bonen 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.659
 this is perhaps the loire for me I can show how we go around 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:20.449
 from Belgium 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.880
 it was easy enough for this dispatch first 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.139
 at the first stage the meeting will have to have the news 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.759
 a kilo of his performance 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.259
 in fact if so 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.890
 passionate about fishing 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.410
 good let's get ripe you can not do it with a thrifty but if we 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.010
 watch it is done alone with a thrifty thanks to this cup calder m 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.660
 Why 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.430
 - cut the fruits of the tooth 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 in valais cut into six washers 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.560
 for now the blows like that in thin slices 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.330
 but what makes it cut there 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.600
 in the orangery 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.730
 for a kilo of fishing 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.380
 we are going 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.690
 a kilo of sugar 1 kilo of amf is a kilo of sugar crystal sugar 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.140
 in powder 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.740
 or if you find it's a kilo of gelling sugar 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 we add the swiss team 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.630
 have pretty impressive cf 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.850
 created in jam and 78 'injured 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 to make money 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.420
 while the appointment is completely different once we have 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.590
 let him rest mix together 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.220
 OK perfect 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.490
 so we let it rest for a few hours 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.690
 ap 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.410
 before passing it 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.460
 on the fire 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.080
 before leaving at rest was untenable mixer we will add a 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.690
 little ginger is a good theme and it was well worth a break 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.740
 some fishing 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.040
 all have in common a teaspoon 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.019
 so we are not going to resolve in big 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.000
 we deal with it 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.390
 pontacq a teaspoon a setback in June 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.009
 our range 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.209
 after a few hours this so are not at all the same thing 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.000
 the adjutant show but you see it's too much yes the bishopric deep but you 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.220
 see that peaches have sips it's a lot more complicated I'm going out 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.159
 a container 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.679
 we will run away 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.609
 like a thousand 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.999
 so it depends on the sugar that was used that she said she was proud 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:43.279
 this is crystallizes declared aiming it will be 15 20 minutes 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.359
 if we used giant checks it's twice as fast m 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.329
 after it's boiling 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.019
 and once that boils 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.929
 or put it on fire 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.969
 during the crystallized sugar these 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.329
 r 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.329
 here 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.449
 his arrival after 15 minutes 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.159
 let's go again 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.739
 indre 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.149
 still a little bit 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.929
 we see 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.929
 so I do not close immediately 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.939
 p I do not return 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.829
 diana 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.049
 no need to stabilize sakhaline 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.109
 my father is lifted from the roads 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.760
