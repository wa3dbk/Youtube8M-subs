00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
position during the power outage you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
position during the power outage you
would<00:01:12.570> simply<00:01:12.750> go<00:01:12.900> outside<00:01:13.470> start<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
would simply go outside start the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.789 
would simply go outside start the
generator<00:01:14.549> come<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> flip<00:01:16.650> these

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
generator come in here and flip these

switches from line to generator and that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
switches from line to generator and that
would<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.100> power<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.580> everything<00:01:21.299> that's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
would now power up everything that's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.600 
would now power up everything that's
tied<00:01:21.630> into<00:01:21.659> these<00:01:22.080> circuits<00:01:22.530> great<00:01:23.130> what's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
tied into these circuits great what's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
tied into these circuits great what's
next<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.630> ahead<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.049> started

any lights in the house and be far from

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.840 
any lights in the house and be far from
generator<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.280> we've<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.579> light<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
generator so we've got some light to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:55.469 
generator so we've got some light to
work<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.659> sounds<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.990> good<00:01:40.140> idea

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.630 

okay<00:01:56.320> generator<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:56.979> an<00:01:57.100> honor<00:01:57.250> when<00:01:57.430> it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
okay generator is an honor when it

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.679 
okay generator is an honor when it
temporary<00:01:58.000> lights<00:01:58.180> for<00:01:58.390> you

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
temporary lights for you

okay<00:01:59.200> now<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.710> main<00:01:59.890> brake<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.369> off

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
okay now that the main brake is off

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.800 
okay now that the main brake is off
we're<00:02:00.850> going<00:02:00.939> to<00:02:01.030> finish<00:02:01.180> tightening<00:02:01.509> this

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
we're going to finish tightening this

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.690 
we're going to finish tightening this
lock<00:02:02.049> nut<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.740> we<00:02:02.799> can<00:02:02.979> secure<00:02:03.280> these<00:02:03.430> wires

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
lock nut so we can secure these wires

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.940 
lock nut so we can secure these wires
into<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.149> electrical<00:02:04.600> panel

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.380 

so<00:02:08.950> there's<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.250> couple<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.640> wires<00:02:09.849> that<00:02:10.209> come

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
so there's a couple of wires that come

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.390 
so there's a couple of wires that come

this switch over to generator and that

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.420 
this switch over to generator and that
would<00:03:25.329> send<00:03:25.569> power<00:03:25.750> up<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.470> black<00:03:26.650> wire<00:03:26.950> to

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
would send power up the black wire to

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.370 
would send power up the black wire to

plugs<00:04:38.710> into<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.099> wall<00:04:39.389> now<00:04:40.389> Chris<00:04:40.630> this<00:04:40.780> is

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
plugs into the wall now Chris this is

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.249 
plugs into the wall now Chris this is
working<00:04:41.289> off<00:04:41.530> of<00:04:42.240> gasoline<00:04:43.240> right<00:04:43.720> so<00:04:44.080> right

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
working off of gasoline right so right

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.680 
working off of gasoline right so right
is<00:04:44.380> going<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.680> exhaust<00:04:45.039> carbon<00:04:45.580> monoxide<00:04:46.090> so

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
is going to exhaust carbon monoxide so

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.230 
is going to exhaust carbon monoxide so
this<00:04:47.020> stays<00:04:47.500> outside<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.520> away<00:04:48.910> from<00:04:49.060> the

alright<00:04:56.380> now<00:04:56.650> that<00:04:56.770> we<00:04:56.889> have<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.099> generator

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
alright now that we have the generator

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.390 
alright now that we have the generator
running<00:04:57.759> outside<00:04:58.470> we<00:04:59.470> can<00:04:59.650> simulate<00:04:59.919> a<00:05:00.130> power

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
running outside we can simulate a power

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.749 
running outside we can simulate a power
outage<00:05:00.669> by<00:05:01.210> shutting<00:05:01.509> off<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.780> main<00:05:02.759> now

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
outage by shutting off the main now

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.159

we'll<00:05:03.910> go<00:05:04.030> ahead<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.419> turn<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:04.960> switches

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
we'll go ahead and turn the switches

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.529 
we'll go ahead and turn the switches
from<00:05:05.410> RN<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.770> generator<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:09.669> you<00:05:10.090> are<00:05:10.270> running

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
from RN to generator and you are running

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.020 
from RN to generator and you are running
on<00:05:10.659> generator<00:05:11.110> power

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030
