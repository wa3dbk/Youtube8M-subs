00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.620 

see<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.640> just<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:53.000> hair<00:02:53.239> out<00:02:53.270> of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
see this one is just a hair out of

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.150 
see this one is just a hair out of
square<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:56.620> we're<00:02:57.620> not<00:02:57.770> going<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> worry

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
square but we're not going to worry

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:13.380 
square but we're not going to worry
about<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.370> too<00:02:58.670> much

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.949 

all<00:03:14.390> right<00:03:14.950> at<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.129> point<00:03:16.840> Plante<00:03:17.840> was

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
all right at that point Plante was

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.009 
all right at that point Plante was
holding<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.620> square<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.239> notice<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.870> was

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
holding it square but I notice it was

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.080 
holding it square but I notice it was
just<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.409> DAB<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.099> square<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.700> released

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
just a DAB out of square so I released

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.780 
just a DAB out of square so I released
it<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.620> put<00:03:24.830> things<00:03:25.010> back<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.549> square

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
it and that put things back in square

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.850 
it and that put things back in square
now

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.880 

and<00:03:33.020> anyway<00:03:35.450> you'll<00:03:36.450> need<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> circular<00:03:37.410> saw<00:03:37.620> at

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
and anyway you'll need a circular saw at

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.760 
and anyway you'll need a circular saw at
the<00:03:37.980> very<00:03:38.220> least<00:03:38.780> you'll<00:03:39.780> need<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:40.200> hammer<00:03:40.440> and

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
the very least you'll need a hammer and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.460 
the very least you'll need a hammer and
some<00:03:40.920> nails<00:03:40.980> obviously<00:03:41.970> some<00:03:42.690> wood<00:03:42.900> glue<00:03:43.170> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
some nails obviously some wood glue and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.130 
some nails obviously some wood glue and
clamps<00:03:44.430> when<00:03:45.210> I<00:03:45.240> first<00:03:45.510> started<00:03:45.810> putting<00:03:45.960> them

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
clamps when I first started putting them

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.360 
clamps when I first started putting them
together<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.500> use<00:03:46.800> nothing<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:47.250> straps<00:03:47.730> and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
together I use nothing but straps and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.600 
together I use nothing but straps and
one<00:03:50.370> pipe<00:03:50.790> clamp<00:03:51.150> on<00:03:51.390> top<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.840> hold<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.140> square

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
one pipe clamp on top to hold it square

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.270 
one pipe clamp on top to hold it square
but<00:03:53.750> when<00:03:54.750> you've<00:03:54.870> got<00:03:54.900> tough<00:03:55.440> lumber

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
but when you've got tough lumber

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.090 
but when you've got tough lumber
a<00:03:56.310> strap<00:03:57.300> will<00:03:57.570> not<00:03:57.780> pull<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.380> cup<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.890> no

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
a strap will not pull that cup out no

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.550 
a strap will not pull that cup out no
matter<00:03:59.310> how<00:03:59.550> tight<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.120> get<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:01.440> this

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
matter how tight you get it in this

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.290 
matter how tight you get it in this
particular<00:04:01.830> case<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.460> had<00:04:02.610> several<00:04:02.880> piece<00:04:03.150> of

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
particular case I had several piece of

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.710 
particular case I had several piece of
the<00:04:03.390> cuff<00:04:03.600> lumber<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:04.800> had<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.220> use<00:04:05.370> bar<00:04:05.720> bar

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
the cuff lumber so I had to use bar bar

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.480 
the cuff lumber so I had to use bar bar
and<00:04:06.930> pipe<00:04:07.140> clamps<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.680> draw<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.950> cup<00:04:08.250> out<00:04:08.430> of

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
and pipe clamps to draw the cup out of

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.720 
and pipe clamps to draw the cup out of
it<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:10.500> got<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.800> working<00:04:11.010> that's<00:04:11.340> no<00:04:11.520> big

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
it but we got it working that's no big

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.980 
it but we got it working that's no big
deal<00:04:12.020> but<00:04:13.020> anyway<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:14.060> would<00:04:15.060> say<00:04:15.240> your<00:04:15.510> minimum

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
it's capacity is only eight inches so I

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.340
