really<00:01:45.280> what<00:01:45.430> this<00:01:45.550> is<00:01:45.760> about<00:01:45.940> for<00:01:46.420> me<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:48.660> and

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
really what this is about for me is and

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.090 
really what this is about for me is and
a<00:01:49.780> lot<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.140> people<00:01:50.410> involved<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:53.070> sort<00:01:54.070> of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
a lot of the people involved is sort of

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.530 
a lot of the people involved is sort of
reduction<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.730> weights<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.120> trying<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.450> get

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
reduction of weights and trying to get

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.130 
reduction of weights and trying to get
outside<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.080> box<00:01:56.350> this<00:01:57.150> free<00:01:58.150> meal<00:01:58.360> isn't

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
outside the box this free meal isn't

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.480 
outside the box this free meal isn't
associated<00:02:00.040> with<00:02:00.760> any<00:02:01.300> any<00:02:02.260> ideology<00:02:02.979> or

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
associated with any any ideology or

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.390 
associated with any any ideology or
anything<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.180> it's<00:02:04.930> kind<00:02:05.290> of<00:02:05.380> outside<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.860> box

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
anything is it's kind of outside the box

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.910 
anything is it's kind of outside the box
and<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:08.790> think<00:02:09.790> that's<00:02:10.750> really<00:02:10.929> how<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.560> has<00:02:11.890> to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and I think that's really how it has to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.230 
and I think that's really how it has to
be<00:02:12.280> because<00:02:13.770> if<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.040> was<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.400> another<00:02:15.670> cause

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
be because if it was just another cause

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.040 
be because if it was just another cause
or<00:02:16.720> something<00:02:17.230> then<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.510> would

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
or something then it you know would

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.990 
or something then it you know would
would<00:02:20.470> wouldn't<00:02:21.070> be<00:02:21.340> able<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.550> fulfill<00:02:21.970> that

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
would wouldn't be able to fulfill that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.330 
would wouldn't be able to fulfill that
unconditional<00:02:22.630> t<00:02:23.290> two<00:02:24.100> directions<00:02:24.730> role<00:02:25.060> or

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
unconditional t two directions role or

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.150 
unconditional t two directions role or
you<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.459> would<00:02:28.470> wouldn't<00:02:29.470> be<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.709> place<00:02:30.130> for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
you know would wouldn't be a place for

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.770 
you know would wouldn't be a place for
people<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:30.760> out<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.090> box<00:02:31.330> would<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.690> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
schools but it's really pretty easy this

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.759 
schools but it's really pretty easy this
the<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> state<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.959> Utah<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.380> schools

the in the state of Utah the schools

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.759 
gave us all the dishes and silverware
and<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:25.330> it's<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.380> mean<00:03:27.220> there's<00:03:27.400> there's<00:03:27.640> no

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
and so it's a I mean there's there's no

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.380 
and so it's a I mean there's there's no
mystery<00:03:29.769> or<00:03:29.950> secret<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.670> doing<00:03:30.820> this<00:03:31.120> it's

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
mystery or secret to doing this it's

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.850 
mystery or secret to doing this it's
just<00:03:31.600> sort<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.170> putting<00:03:32.530> all<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.709> pieces

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
just sort of putting all the pieces

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.080 
just sort of putting all the pieces
together

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
together

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.970 
together
so<00:03:34.840> if<00:03:34.989> there's<00:03:35.170> somebody<00:03:35.379> in<00:03:35.620> some<00:03:35.830> small

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
so if there's somebody in some small

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.869 
so if there's somebody in some small
town<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> US<00:03:37.180> or<00:03:37.360> anywhere<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.930> world

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
town in the US or anywhere in the world

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.690 
town in the US or anywhere in the world
and<00:03:39.879> are<00:03:40.569> thinking<00:03:41.050> about<00:03:41.379> doing<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
and are thinking about doing this and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.759 
and are thinking about doing this and
stop<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.300> wasting<00:03:43.660> food<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:43.959> paying<00:03:44.590> it

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
stop in the wasting food and paying it

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.130 
stop in the wasting food and paying it
forward<00:03:44.800> so<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.400> speak<00:03:45.780> what<00:03:46.780> would<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.050> have

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
forward so to speak what would you have

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.180 
forward so to speak what would you have
to<00:03:47.290> say<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.470> them<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:49.650> don't<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.890> idea<00:03:50.980> of

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
to say to them I don't like the idea of

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.890 
to say to them I don't like the idea of
paying<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.580> forward<00:03:51.640> because<00:03:52.150> that's<00:03:52.360> back<00:03:52.870> to

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
paying it forward because that's back to

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.970 
paying it forward because that's back to
keeping<00:03:53.440> some<00:03:53.709> sort<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:54.010> tabs<00:03:54.310> on<00:03:55.950> give<00:03:56.950> and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
keeping some sort of tabs on give and

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.619 
keeping some sort of tabs on give and
take<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.580> we<00:03:57.700> shouldn't<00:03:57.970> worry<00:03:58.209> about<00:03:58.269> that

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
take and we shouldn't worry about that

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.530 
take and we shouldn't worry about that
but<00:03:59.129> if<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.280> get<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.580> going<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.120> mean<00:04:01.269> you<00:04:01.390> can

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
but if you get this going I mean you can

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.750 
but if you get this going I mean you can
start<00:04:01.810> at<00:04:01.989> just<00:04:02.019> one<00:04:02.500> day<00:04:02.799> or<00:04:03.010> two<00:04:03.040> days<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.400> week

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
start at just one day or two days a week

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.400 
start at just one day or two days a week
I<00:04:05.340> think<00:04:06.340> what<00:04:06.519> works<00:04:06.819> for<00:04:07.180> us<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:08.230> it's

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
I think what works for us is that it's

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.729 
I think what works for us is that it's
in<00:04:08.620> sort<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.069> neutral<00:04:09.459> location<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:12.299> that

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
in sort of a neutral location and that

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.319 
in sort of a neutral location and that
it's<00:04:14.739> taking<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.430> little<00:04:15.549> while<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:16.000> build<00:04:16.150> up

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
it's taking a little while to build up

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.909 
it's taking a little while to build up
the<00:04:16.359> crowd<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:16.840> have<00:04:17.019> here<00:04:17.290> but<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.620> want<00:04:17.799> to

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
the crowd we have here but you want to

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.129 
the crowd we have here but you want to
get<00:04:18.070> some<00:04:18.910> people<00:04:19.269> excited<00:04:19.600> about<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.109> that

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
get some people excited about it that

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.469 
get some people excited about it that
are<00:04:20.380> sort<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.700> socially<00:04:21.700> popular<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.389> the

are sort of socially popular in the

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.360 
are sort of socially popular in the
communities<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.470> other<00:04:23.800> people<00:04:23.860> feel

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370

communities so that other people feel
comfortable<00:04:24.970> coming<00:04:25.630> here<00:04:26.020> it's<00:04:26.139> it's<00:04:26.729> it's

comfortable coming here it's it's it's

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.279 
comfortable coming here it's it's it's
really<00:04:27.970> difficult<00:04:28.210> for<00:04:28.539> people<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:28.990> overcome

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
really difficult for people to overcome

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.189 
really difficult for people to overcome
their<00:04:29.650> apprehensions<00:04:30.870> because<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:32.050> the
