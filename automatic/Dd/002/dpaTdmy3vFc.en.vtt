00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.140 

hey<00:00:04.819> I<00:00:05.990> yawn<00:00:06.990> too<00:00:07.200> much<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.910> tutorial

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
hey I yawn too much so for this tutorial

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.549 
hey I yawn too much so for this tutorial
we're<00:00:09.599> going<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.780> talk<00:00:09.990> about<00:00:10.139> what<00:00:10.410> are<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
we're going to talk about what are the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.589 
we're going to talk about what are the
note<00:00:10.710> parameters<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.519> they<00:00:11.730> work<00:00:11.969> to

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
note parameters and how they work to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.330 
note parameters and how they work to
start<00:00:12.809> off<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> create<00:00:13.559> rm8<00:00:14.040> or<00:00:14.130> so

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
start off we have to create rm8 or so

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.829 
start off we have to create rm8 or so
let's<00:00:14.549> go<00:00:14.670> over<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.820> our<00:00:14.969> emitter<00:00:15.360> panel<00:00:15.690> right

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
let's go over to our emitter panel right

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
let's go over to our emitter panel right
here<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> top<00:00:16.410> left-hand<00:00:16.890> corner<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
here to the top left-hand corner of the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.340 
here to the top left-hand corner of the
screen<00:00:17.460> next<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> demons<00:00:18.869> button<00:00:19.199> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
screen next to the demons button and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.099 
screen next to the demons button and
let's<00:00:20.130> select<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.640> circle<00:00:20.939> emitter<00:00:21.390> okay<00:00:22.050> so

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
let's select the circle emitter okay so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.810 
let's select the circle emitter okay so
as<00:00:22.410> soon<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:22.949> you'll<00:00:23.580> notice

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
as soon as you do that you'll notice

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670 
as soon as you do that you'll notice
that<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.029> get<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> lots<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.779> lots<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.109> values

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
that you get a lots and lots of values

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
that you get a lots and lots of values
and<00:00:25.710> information<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> right<00:00:27.359> side<00:00:27.599> of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and information to the right side of

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720 
and information to the right side of
rail<00:00:28.140> flow<00:00:28.380> under<00:00:28.830> your<00:00:28.980> node<00:00:29.189> parameters

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
rail flow under your node parameters

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.070 
rail flow under your node parameters
panel<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.390> we're<00:00:30.510> gonna<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.720> through<00:00:30.929> all

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
panel now we're gonna go through all

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840 
panel now we're gonna go through all
these<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.679> by<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> tell<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
these one by one just to tell you

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.729 
these one by one just to tell you
explicitly<00:00:33.450> what<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.020> are<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.649> do

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
explicitly what they are and what do

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
explicitly what they are and what do
they<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.610> simulation<00:00:36.120> parameter<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they do so the simulation parameter is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.479 
they do so the simulation parameter is
going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> exhibit<00:00:37.710> either<00:00:37.950> active<00:00:38.460> or

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
going to exhibit either active or

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
going to exhibit either active or
inactive<00:00:38.960> there<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> third<00:00:40.350> option<00:00:40.530> known

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
inactive there is a third option known

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
inactive there is a third option known
as<00:00:40.950> cash<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.550> we'll<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
as cash but we'll get that on in the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.380 
as cash but we'll get that on in the
later<00:00:42.629> tutorial<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:43.770> know

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
later tutorial when we actually know

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.810 
later tutorial when we actually know
what<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.840> used<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> have

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
what it would be used for so if you have

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
what it would be used for so if you have
the<00:00:48.030> simulation<00:00:48.539> parameters<00:00:48.629> set<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> active

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the simulation parameters set to active

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.470 
the simulation parameters set to active
obviously<00:00:50.190> when<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.610> simulate<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.180> will<00:00:51.390> be

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
obviously when you simulate it will be

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.439 
obviously when you simulate it will be
on<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> set<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.949> inactive<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
on and if you have it set to inactive it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.260 
on and if you have it set to inactive it
shall<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.949> anymore<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.210> go

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
shall not be on anymore so there you go

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.939 
shall not be on anymore so there you go
simulating<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:57.989> simulating<00:00:58.469> nothing<00:00:58.770> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
simulating it's simulating nothing so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
simulating it's simulating nothing so
basically<00:00:59.430> an<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.090> switch<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.390> your

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
basically an on off switch for your

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860 
basically an on off switch for your
emitters<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> position<00:01:03.239> parameter<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
emitters so the position parameter is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.500 
emitters so the position parameter is
going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> change<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.619> position<00:01:04.830> exactly

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
going to change your position exactly

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
going to change your position exactly
based<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.470> input<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> keys

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
based on what you input it for the keys

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
based on what you input it for the keys
so<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.750> example<00:01:09.810> let's<00:01:10.110> say<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> want<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> move

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
so for example let's say I want to move

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
so for example let's say I want to move
this<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> little<00:01:11.640> bit<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.390> XY<00:01:12.960> position

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this a little bit in the XY position

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
this a little bit in the XY position
black<00:01:13.890> pony<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.340> exact<00:01:14.820> increments<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> my

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
black pony in exact increments to my

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
black pony in exact increments to my
scene<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.470> I'll<00:01:16.619> place<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
scene so I'll place right here in the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
scene so I'll place right here in the
first<00:01:18.659> increment<00:01:19.110> I'll<00:01:19.470> place<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.900> 2.8<00:01:22.850> 750

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
first increment I'll place it at 2.8 750

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.899 
first increment I'll place it at 2.8 750
okay<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.759> either

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
okay and now I think for the it's either

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
okay and now I think for the it's either
the<00:01:27.119> X<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.479> z<00:01:27.930> axis<00:01:27.960> i'm<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.710> sure<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:28.950> for

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the X to the z axis i'm not sure but for

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
the X to the z axis i'm not sure but for
this<00:01:29.610> axis<00:01:30.000> i'll<00:01:30.119> put<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.659> example<00:01:30.750> two

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this axis i'll put it in for example two

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.550 
this axis i'll put it in for example two
point<00:01:31.710> zero<00:01:31.860> zero<00:01:32.280> five<00:01:32.840> okay<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> why

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
point zero zero five okay now on the why

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800 
point zero zero five okay now on the why
I<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> move<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.400> exactly<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.240> about

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
I want to move it up exactly to about

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.069 
I want to move it up exactly to about
two<00:01:37.380> point<00:01:37.909> 33<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.119> we'll<00:01:39.240> type<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.509> two<00:01:39.720> point

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
two point 33 so we'll type in two point

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.350 
two point 33 so we'll type in two point
33<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> position<00:01:41.820> parameter<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
33 so with the position parameter it's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
33 so with the position parameter it's
pretty<00:01:42.659> straightforward<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> does

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
pretty straightforward on what it does

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.910 
pretty straightforward on what it does
it<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.670> basically<00:01:45.320> changes<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.439> position

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it just basically changes your position

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.380 
it just basically changes your position
based<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.430> keys<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> put<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.119> into<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
based on what keys you put it into the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.020 
based on what keys you put it into the
exact<00:01:48.930> amount<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> pretty<00:01:50.759> helpful

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
exact amount so this is pretty helpful

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.520 
exact amount so this is pretty helpful
what<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.659> line<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.960> projects<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
what I have to line up projects and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
what I have to line up projects and
emitters<00:01:53.090> exactly<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> want<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
emitters exactly to the way I want so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.730 
emitters exactly to the way I want so
yeah<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> position<00:01:56.280> parameter<00:01:57.060> as

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
yeah that's the position parameter as

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.990 
yeah that's the position parameter as
well<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> position<00:01:59.369> parameter<00:01:59.909> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
well as for the position parameter the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120 
well as for the position parameter the
rotation<00:02:00.479> parameter<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:01.079> exactly<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> same

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
rotation parameter is exactly the same

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
rotation parameter is exactly the same
except<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.450> will<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:03.930> rotate

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
except this time it will just rotate

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.889 
except this time it will just rotate
your<00:02:04.920> selected<00:02:05.399> object<00:02:05.820> based<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.420> its<00:02:06.600> values

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
your selected object based on its values

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.510 
your selected object based on its values
that<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.110> put<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.799> let's<00:02:08.190> say<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.489> example

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that you put in so let's say for example

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420 
that you put in so let's say for example
let's<00:02:09.420> put<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> 180<00:02:10.440> degrees<00:02:10.500> way<00:02:11.250> up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
let's put this up to 180 degrees way up

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
let's put this up to 180 degrees way up
in<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> air<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.879> want<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.270> thing

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
in the air we want to have this thing

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.250 
in the air we want to have this thing
shoot<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
shoot up so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.009 
shoot up so
typed<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> 180<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.580> simulate<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.239> there<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
typed in 180 and simulate it there you

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.289 
typed in 180 and simulate it there you
go<00:02:16.170> now<00:02:16.739> it's<00:02:17.099> at<00:02:17.189> 180<00:02:17.670> degrees<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> year

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
go now it's at 180 degrees in the year

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.640 
go now it's at 180 degrees in the year
let's<00:02:18.720> say<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:18.989> want<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.200> place<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
let's say if we want to place it to the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.509 
let's say if we want to place it to the
side<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.950> bit<00:02:20.250> let's<00:02:20.760> put<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.829> 90<00:02:22.829> degrees<00:02:23.159> how

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
side a bit let's put in 90 degrees how

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.380 
side a bit let's put in 90 degrees how
about<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.900> okay<00:02:25.220> simulate<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.670> there

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
about that okay simulate that and there

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.780 
about that okay simulate that and there
you<00:02:27.510> go<00:02:27.689> so<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:29.099> like<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.250> position

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you go so just like the position

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.640 
you go so just like the position
parameter<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> rotation<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.049> exactly<00:02:31.500> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
parameter the rotation is exactly the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.710 
parameter the rotation is exactly the
same<00:02:31.890> except<00:02:32.849> this<00:02:32.970> time<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.450> will<00:02:33.540> rotate

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
same except this time it will rotate

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080 
same except this time it will rotate
your<00:02:34.140> object<00:02:34.560> now<00:02:35.250> scale<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.909> be<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
your object now scale is going to be the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.430 
your object now scale is going to be the
exact<00:02:36.360> same<00:02:36.569> thing<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:36.930> position<00:02:37.319> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
exact same thing as position and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.500 
exact same thing as position and
rotation<00:02:37.640> editing<00:02:38.640> wise<00:02:38.819> same<00:02:39.329> thing<00:02:39.480> goes

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
rotation editing wise same thing goes

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.199 
rotation editing wise same thing goes
for<00:02:39.629> shear<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.200> pivot<00:02:40.859> except<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.640> time<00:02:41.909> it

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
for shear and pivot except this time it

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.819 
for shear and pivot except this time it
will<00:02:42.329> control<00:02:42.659> the<00:02:42.959> amount<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.379> scale<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.769> can

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
will control the amount of scale you can

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.580 
will control the amount of scale you can
use<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.879> time<00:02:45.120> we'll<00:02:45.480> put<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:45.989> for

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
use so for this time we'll put in for

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.349 
use so for this time we'll put in for
the<00:02:46.650> first<00:02:46.799> parameter<00:02:47.040> will<00:02:47.400> select<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:48.150> number

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
the first parameter will select a number

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.690 
the first parameter will select a number
of<00:02:48.690> let's<00:02:49.049> say<00:02:49.200> four<00:02:49.500> okay<00:02:50.040> let's<00:02:50.220> put<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.459> for

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
of let's say four okay let's put in for

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.970 
of let's say four okay let's put in for
it's<00:02:50.970> pretty<00:02:51.209> wide<00:02:51.450> now<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:52.319> least<00:02:52.500> four<00:02:52.709> times

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
it's pretty wide now at least four times

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.710 
it's pretty wide now at least four times
what<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.340> was<00:02:53.370> originally<00:02:53.579> let's<00:02:54.389> make<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.599> a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
what it was originally let's make it a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.479 
what it was originally let's make it a
bit<00:02:54.900> taller<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.769> we'll<00:02:55.889> go<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.190> our<00:02:56.280> y-axis

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
bit taller so we'll go to our y-axis

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.759 
bit taller so we'll go to our y-axis
right<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:57.359> which<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:57.750> middle<00:02:58.139> parameter

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
right here which is the middle parameter

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.710 
right here which is the middle parameter
and<00:02:58.920> we'll<00:02:59.340> set<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.790> something<00:02:59.819> like<00:03:00.359> I

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
and we'll set it to something like I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.369 
and we'll set it to something like I
don't<00:03:01.139> know<00:03:02.540> 3.5<00:03:03.540> sounds<00:03:03.989> pretty<00:03:04.200> good

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
don't know 3.5 sounds pretty good

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.140 
don't know 3.5 sounds pretty good
alright<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.190> now<00:03:05.370> we'll<00:03:05.670> go<00:03:05.790> over<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:06.120> our

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
alright and now we'll go over to our

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.050 
alright and now we'll go over to our
last<00:03:06.840> parameter<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.769> will<00:03:08.010> let's<00:03:08.730> see<00:03:08.879> what

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
last parameter and will let's see what

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.430 
last parameter and will let's see what
makes<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.329> thing<00:03:09.480> pretty<00:03:09.690> long<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.260> let's

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
makes this thing pretty long so let's

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.199 
makes this thing pretty long so let's
put<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.950> about<00:03:12.530> 6.5<00:03:13.530> okay<00:03:13.980> there<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.519> go<00:03:14.700> so

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
put it to about 6.5 okay there you go so

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.349 
put it to about 6.5 okay there you go so
that<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.680> scale<00:03:17.280> parameter<00:03:17.609> pretty

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
that is the scale parameter pretty

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.289 
that is the scale parameter pretty
straightforward<00:03:19.019> isn't<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:20.000> all<00:03:21.000> right<00:03:21.120> on

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
straightforward isn't it all right on

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.000 
straightforward isn't it all right on
this<00:03:21.419> year<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.930> shear<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.349> basically<00:03:22.769> going<00:03:22.919> to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
this year so shear is basically going to

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250 
this year so shear is basically going to
hear<00:03:23.579> whatever<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.810> selected

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
hear whatever you have that is selected

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.809 
hear whatever you have that is selected
so<00:03:25.290> for<00:03:25.590> example<00:03:25.650> we<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.310> cross<00:03:26.579> here

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
so for example we have this cross here

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.280 
so for example we have this cross here
selected<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.389> let's<00:03:27.780> go<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.959> our<00:03:28.139> first

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
selected and let's go to our first

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.610 
selected and let's go to our first
parameter<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.010> let's<00:03:29.549> put<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.879> value<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
parameter and let's put in the value of

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.890 
parameter and let's put in the value of
2.5<00:03:31.620> let's<00:03:31.889> see<00:03:31.980> what<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.160> looks<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.900> okay

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
2.5 let's see what that looks like okay

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.259 
2.5 let's see what that looks like okay
so<00:03:33.959> cheered<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.680> creating<00:03:35.280> pretty<00:03:35.519> good<00:03:35.730> let's

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
so cheered it creating pretty good let's

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.000 
so cheered it creating pretty good let's
go<00:03:36.419> to<00:03:36.540> our<00:03:36.690> second<00:03:37.199> parameter<00:03:37.290> over<00:03:37.739> here

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
go to our second parameter over here

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.520 
go to our second parameter over here
which<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.549> y-axis<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.720> let's<00:03:40.230> put<00:03:40.379> in<00:03:40.470> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
which is the y-axis and let's put in the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.699 
which is the y-axis and let's put in the
value<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.919> let's<00:03:41.129> say<00:03:41.310> out<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.609> 04<00:03:42.000> okay<00:03:42.840> so

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
value of let's say out and 04 okay so

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.189 
value of let's say out and 04 okay so
zoom<00:03:43.980> out<00:03:44.069> here<00:03:44.540> well<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.660> looks<00:03:45.840> pretty<00:03:46.079> cool

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
zoom out here well it looks pretty cool

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.199 
zoom out here well it looks pretty cool
huh<00:03:46.459> alright<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:47.639> let's<00:03:47.819> go<00:03:47.879> over<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.120> our

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
huh alright now let's go over to our

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.420 
huh alright now let's go over to our
third<00:03:48.510> parameter<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.169> setting<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:49.949> value<00:03:50.069> of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
third parameter and setting the value of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.080 
third parameter and setting the value of
2<00:03:51.319> okay<00:03:52.319> now<00:03:53.220> here's<00:03:53.459> where<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.699> weird<00:03:53.849> things

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
2 okay now here's where the weird things

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.849 
2 okay now here's where the weird things
start<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.359> happen<00:03:54.510> Wilshere<00:03:55.109> because<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.709> is

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
start to happen Wilshere because here is

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.460 
start to happen Wilshere because here is
only<00:03:56.159> going<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.970> well<00:03:57.690> physically<00:03:58.079> shear<00:03:58.440> your

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
only going to well physically shear your

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.099 
only going to well physically shear your
object<00:03:59.280> okay<00:03:59.699> it<00:03:59.940> won't<00:04:00.299> actually<00:04:00.449> scale<00:04:00.900> it

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
object okay it won't actually scale it

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.619 
object okay it won't actually scale it
into<00:04:01.530> sighs<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.250> layman's<00:04:02.879> terms<00:04:03.120> see<00:04:03.510> how

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
into sighs so in layman's terms see how

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.530 
into sighs so in layman's terms see how
this<00:04:03.780> looks<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.109> 3d<00:04:04.409> in<00:04:04.590> reality<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.280> not

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
this looks on 3d in reality it's not

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.930 
this looks on 3d in reality it's not
mind<00:04:06.540> equals<00:04:07.349> blown<00:04:07.650> pretty<00:04:08.340> cool<00:04:08.519> huh<00:04:08.699> oh

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
mind equals blown pretty cool huh oh

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.330 
mind equals blown pretty cool huh oh
yeah<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.500> works<00:04:10.859> pretty<00:04:11.040> well<00:04:11.159> for

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
yeah so this works pretty well for

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.129 
yeah so this works pretty well for
creating<00:04:11.940> things<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.269> are<00:04:12.389> diagonal<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:13.049> you

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
creating things that are diagonal if you

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.270 
creating things that are diagonal if you
want<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.409> set<00:04:13.560> them<00:04:13.680> out<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.769> more<00:04:14.069> diagonal

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
want to set them out of more diagonal

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.580 
want to set them out of more diagonal
angle<00:04:14.579> or<00:04:14.970> hills<00:04:15.389> and<00:04:15.720> or<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.079> like<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:16.560> that

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
angle or hills and or the like so that

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.240 
angle or hills and or the like so that
is<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.459> shear<00:04:17.970> parameter<00:04:18.949> all<00:04:19.949> right<00:04:20.099> now<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
is the shear parameter all right now the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.949 
is the shear parameter all right now the
same<00:04:20.519> thing<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.820> going<00:04:20.909> to<00:04:21.000> apply<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.299> pivot<00:04:21.840> as

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
same thing is going to apply to pivot as

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.810 
same thing is going to apply to pivot as
well<00:04:22.200> as<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.650> does<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:23.070> all<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.639> other

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
well as it does to all the other

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.670 
well as it does to all the other
parameters<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.139> note<00:04:25.380> itself<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
parameters for the note itself and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.890 
parameters for the note itself and
it<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:26.919> going<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.699> well<00:04:28.150> change<00:04:28.509> your<00:04:28.630> pivot

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
it is going to well change your pivot

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.070 
it is going to well change your pivot
based<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:30.100> where<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.880> tool<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.539> so<00:04:31.900> in

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
based on where the tool is so in

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.570 
based on where the tool is so in
layman's<00:04:32.410> terms<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.830> basically<00:04:33.100> means<00:04:33.370> for

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
layman's terms that basically means for

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.279 
layman's terms that basically means for
example<00:04:33.639> if<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.000> want<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.270> rotate<00:04:34.419> this<00:04:34.840> object

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
example if I want to rotate this object

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.080 
example if I want to rotate this object
right<00:04:35.410> here<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.770> could<00:04:36.340> rotate<00:04:36.520> our<00:04:36.759> Wembley

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
right here I could rotate our Wembley

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.029 
right here I could rotate our Wembley
nimbly<00:04:37.389> huh<00:04:37.570> it's<00:04:37.870> pretty<00:04:38.020> cool<00:04:38.259> and<00:04:38.500> if<00:04:38.919> you

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
nimbly huh it's pretty cool and if you

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.279 
nimbly huh it's pretty cool and if you
notice<00:04:39.250> it's<00:04:39.610> rotating<00:04:40.300> actually<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.990> pivot

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
notice it's rotating actually the pivot

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.070 
notice it's rotating actually the pivot
point<00:04:41.320> which<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:41.680> on<00:04:42.009> the<00:04:42.090> very<00:04:43.090> very<00:04:43.479> last

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
point which is on the very very last

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.670 
point which is on the very very last
geometry<00:04:44.979> piece<00:04:45.250> right<00:04:45.729> here<00:04:45.759> on<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.509> tail<00:04:47.080> ok

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
geometry piece right here on the tail ok

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.310 
geometry piece right here on the tail ok
so<00:04:48.460> now<00:04:48.669> let's<00:04:48.699> say<00:04:49.120> hey<00:04:49.810> what<00:04:49.990> if<00:04:50.080> i<00:04:50.139> want<00:04:50.289> to

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
so now let's say hey what if i want to

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.590 
so now let's say hey what if i want to
change<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.830> middle<00:04:51.030> you'd<00:04:52.030> go<00:04:52.210> over<00:04:52.419> to

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
change it to the middle you'd go over to

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.810 
change it to the middle you'd go over to
the<00:04:52.720> y<00:04:52.840> axis<00:04:53.350> in<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.800> pivot<00:04:54.160> parameter<00:04:54.669> and

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
the y axis in the pivot parameter and

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.760 
the y axis in the pivot parameter and
set<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.780> something<00:04:55.810> like<00:04:56.320> i<00:04:56.530> don't<00:04:56.710> know

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
set it to something like i don't know

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.670 
set it to something like i don't know
let's<00:04:56.860> say<00:04:57.600> point<00:04:58.600> five<00:04:58.870> let's<00:04:59.229> see<00:04:59.440> what<00:04:59.560> that

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
let's say point five let's see what that

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.230 
let's say point five let's see what that
does<00:04:59.740> ok<00:05:00.220> little<00:05:00.310> bit<00:05:00.460> too<00:05:00.580> low<00:05:00.759> let's<00:05:01.060> set<00:05:01.210> it

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
does ok little bit too low let's set it

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.159 
does ok little bit too low let's set it
to<00:05:01.419> something<00:05:01.449> like<00:05:01.780> one<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.889> half<00:05:04.169> all

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
to something like one and a half all

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.050 
to something like one and a half all
right<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:05.949> it's<00:05:05.979> roughly<00:05:06.490> in<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.639> middle<00:05:06.729> now

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
right so it's roughly in the middle now

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.740 
right so it's roughly in the middle now
and<00:05:07.889> there<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:08.949> go<00:05:09.009> that<00:05:09.310> is<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:10.150> pivot<00:05:10.599> and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
and there you go that is the pivot and

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.779 
and there you go that is the pivot and
it's<00:05:11.349> now<00:05:11.470> been<00:05:11.740> changed<00:05:12.099> because<00:05:12.460> you've

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
it's now been changed because you've

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.909 
it's now been changed because you've
changed<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.300> parameters<00:05:13.690> in<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:13.930> node<00:05:14.199> so

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
changed the parameters in the node so

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.800 
changed the parameters in the node so
now<00:05:15.789> let's<00:05:15.940> experiment<00:05:16.210> around<00:05:16.479> with<00:05:16.690> some

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
now let's experiment around with some

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.360 
now let's experiment around with some
other<00:05:16.930> stuff<00:05:17.139> let's<00:05:17.380> change<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.770> pivot<00:05:18.190> to

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
other stuff let's change the pivot to

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.150 
other stuff let's change the pivot to
the<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.330> think<00:05:19.630> this<00:05:19.750> is<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.930> Z<00:05:20.500> pivot<00:05:20.919> I'm<00:05:21.039> not

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
the I think this is the Z pivot I'm not

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.999 
the I think this is the Z pivot I'm not
sure<00:05:21.250> don't<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.970> x<00:05:22.150> because<00:05:22.570> x<00:05:22.620> y<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:23.919> z

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
sure don't the x because x y and z

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.640 
sure don't the x because x y and z
uh-huh<00:05:24.880> now<00:05:25.300> remember<00:05:25.599> let's<00:05:26.169> change<00:05:26.349> the<00:05:26.500> X

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
uh-huh now remember let's change the X

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.140 
uh-huh now remember let's change the X
to<00:05:26.860> something<00:05:27.130> like<00:05:27.250> four<00:05:28.000> ok<00:05:28.539> and<00:05:29.909> now<00:05:30.909> let's

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
to something like four ok and now let's

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.870 
to something like four ok and now let's
change<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:32.139> z<00:05:32.800> access<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.490> something<00:05:33.669> like

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
change the z access to something like

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.790 
change the z access to something like
two<00:05:34.389> or<00:05:34.810> ya<00:05:35.349> too<00:05:35.970> ok<00:05:37.260> so<00:05:38.260> let's<00:05:38.470> zoom<00:05:38.590> out<00:05:38.680> of

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
two or ya too ok so let's zoom out of

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.040 
two or ya too ok so let's zoom out of
our<00:05:38.889> scene<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.099> little<00:05:39.280> bit<00:05:39.460> here<00:05:39.840> select<00:05:40.840> the

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
our scene a little bit here select the

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.990 
our scene a little bit here select the
rocket<00:05:41.500> again<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:41.979> allow<00:05:42.310> let's<00:05:42.760> start

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
rocket again and allow let's start

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.950 
rocket again and allow let's start
screwing<00:05:43.330> around<00:05:43.539> with<00:05:43.870> just<00:05:44.020> moving<00:05:44.349> it<00:05:44.440> so

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
screwing around with just moving it so

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.570 
screwing around with just moving it so
that's<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:47.080> rocket<00:05:47.440> moving<00:05:47.680> around<00:05:47.860> in<00:05:48.039> freedom

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
that's a rocket moving around in freedom

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.240 
that's a rocket moving around in freedom
of<00:05:48.760> space<00:05:49.300> because<00:05:50.139> we've<00:05:50.320> changed<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:50.770> pivot

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
of space because we've changed the pivot

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.710 
of space because we've changed the pivot
so<00:05:51.460> now<00:05:51.610> it's<00:05:51.820> pivoting<00:05:52.270> around<00:05:52.330> in<00:05:52.630> different

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
so now it's pivoting around in different

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.629 
so now it's pivoting around in different
places<00:05:53.139> I<00:05:53.409> like<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:53.919> so<00:05:54.449> that<00:05:55.449> is<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.860> pivot

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
places I like that so that is the pivot

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.480 
places I like that so that is the pivot
parameter<00:05:58.949> well<00:05:59.949> life<00:06:00.099> gives<00:06:00.370> you<00:06:00.460> lemons

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
parameter well life gives you lemons

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.600

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
make lemonade making Russell lemons on

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.330 
make lemonade making Russell lemons on
burns<00:06:03.940> your<00:06:04.090> house<00:06:04.300> down
