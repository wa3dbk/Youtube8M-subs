this show is about how artists use

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.490 
this show is about how artists use
paintings<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> drawings<00:00:27.080> to<00:00:28.080> trick<00:00:28.320> your

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
eyes what I'm trying to get at is we

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
eyes what I'm trying to get at is we
we're<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.460> used<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.940> looking<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.480> pictures

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
we're so used to looking at pictures

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.190 
we're so used to looking at pictures
where<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.280> view<00:00:35.550> point<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.090> fixed<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
where the view point is fixed the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.440 
where the view point is fixed the
artists<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.399> camera<00:00:38.820> man<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> Stood

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
artists like the camera man it Stood

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.080 
artists like the camera man it Stood
Still<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:40.379> begin<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.950> think<00:00:40.980> everything<00:00:41.820> looks

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
Still we begin to think everything looks

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.600 
Still we begin to think everything looks
that<00:00:42.390> way<00:00:42.629> don't<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:44.040> very

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that way don't we but it's actually very

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
that way don't we but it's actually very
unlike<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.050> way<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:48.149> our<00:00:48.920> lives

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
unlike the way we see because our lives

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.709 
unlike the way we see because our lives
are<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:50.520> about<00:00:50.850> movement<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:52.020> want<00:00:52.199> movement

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
are all about movement we want movement

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.790 
are all about movement we want movement
now<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.770> walk<00:00:56.250> round<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.910> chair<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:58.590> then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
now if I walk round the chair and then

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.750 
now if I walk round the chair and then
think<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> saw<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.770> seems<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.579> me

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
think of what I saw this seems to me

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.429 
think of what I saw this seems to me
would<00:01:03.300> make<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.870> more<00:01:04.470> real<00:01:09.290> around<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
would make it more real around the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
would make it more real around the
beginning<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> 15th<00:01:11.310> century<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:12.030> Europe

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
beginning of the 15th century in Europe

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.700 
beginning of the 15th century in Europe
during<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.840> time<00:01:13.049> called<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> Renaissance

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
during a time called the Renaissance

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.210 
during a time called the Renaissance
people<00:01:14.670> saw<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.210> even<00:01:15.780> though<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.350> road<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
people saw that even though a road is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.390 
people saw that even though a road is
actually<00:01:17.750> made<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.229> lines<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
actually made of two lines that are the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.840 
actually made of two lines that are the
same<00:01:21.000> distance<00:01:21.509> apart<00:01:21.810> from<00:01:22.080> each<00:01:22.320> other<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
same distance apart from each other the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.969 
same distance apart from each other the
lines<00:01:24.090> seem<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.689> come<00:01:24.900> together<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> road

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
lines seem to come together as the road

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
lines seem to come together as the road
goes<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.400> into<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> distance<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:28.380> meet

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
goes off into the distance and they meet

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.990 
goes off into the distance and they meet
at<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> point<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.180> horizon<00:01:30.299> line<00:01:30.930> called

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
at a point on the horizon line called

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.109 
at a point on the horizon line called
the<00:01:33.000> vanishing<00:01:33.240> point<00:01:34.579> artists<00:01:35.579> developed<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the vanishing point artists developed a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
the vanishing point artists developed a
whole<00:01:36.299> system<00:01:36.900> around<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.590> idea<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> it's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
whole system around this idea and it's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.050 
whole system around this idea and it's
called<00:01:38.880> perspective<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:41.159> system<00:01:41.640> allowed

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
called perspective this system allowed

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.969 
called perspective this system allowed
them<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.659> organize<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> things<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.860> their

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
them to organize all the things in their

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.389 
them to organize all the things in their
pictures<00:01:45.619> painters<00:01:46.619> were<00:01:46.770> fascinated<00:01:47.369> with

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
pictures painters were fascinated with

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.760 
pictures painters were fascinated with
perspective<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.329> used<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> make<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
perspective and used it to make the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.939 
perspective and used it to make the
pictures<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.369> very<00:01:50.640> deep
