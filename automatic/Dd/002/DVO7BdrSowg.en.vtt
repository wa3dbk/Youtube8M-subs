00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.240
 goalkeeper doorwerth alblas has his 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.969
 contract with ajax extended by one year 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.770
 the 20 year keeper made it start 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.279
 last season a credit 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.580
 debut 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.590
 do haha was from this side and alblas 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.179
 with an excellent rescue says after one 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.099
 number of good matches shed the 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.779
 alblas in front are in December 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.579
 crotch strap off 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.439
 despite so much , Alblas insisted 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.249
 contract extension due to its good 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.300
 Start 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.579
 it was indeed a nice start of it 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.620
 season with the matches that I could 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.820
 playing in here play was good too 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.410
 for development 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.480
 well that's a shame it 's something 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.469
 ended earlier and actually did 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.629
 Yes 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.149
 the club oil then immediately know clearly 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.680
 that they and beyond were so that as 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.269
 also on despite my injury it was 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.420
 naturally nice to hear 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.250
 give you a certain rest that this cream 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.929
 You have your injury and then you know where you are 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.059
 to it can to work towards 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.019
 the expresses confidence that knowing for sure 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.390
 that is very nice 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.280
 I think it's nice to him too 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.410
 cruciate ligament torn better for almost a year 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.620
 from that you 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.720
 the club gets the opportunity to 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.900
 to prove themselves again 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.810
 and he is also a talented keeper 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.310
 which they like that jaap strain with the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.680
 keep promises 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.610
 So then it makes sense that he has a year 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.399
 get an extension 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.659
 who you were operated on in January 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.920
 how many bear removed from their around 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.329
 no 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.490
 well basically we said we did 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.200
 until the winter break pro 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.240
 card work then we see how work 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.340
 and then really compete with 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.350
 it that play along but I hope to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.310
 Summer already off then on to it 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.420
 do with the team 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.729
 of course also good for myself 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.320
 but i am now keeping my mind off 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.640
 we goalkeeper coach he two weeks two 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.130
 time two days in the week went to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.210
 outside and then you can always do something more 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.880
 so that is also very nice 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.649
 I always say it's not the end of it 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.590
 the world and you have to come back 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.590
 you have to see how beautiful football is 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.960
 weather is therefore normally must 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.310
 players out there better for people 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.979
 who don't know what for it yet 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.860
 type of mouth is you and I am more 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.210
 the football-loving keeper who is very sorry 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.650
 likes to play construction 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.140
 sometimes maybe a little too much death 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.450
 was only 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.599
 and on the lines i can also remind you 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.400
 stand out from celie's kenya already had two 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.799
 alblas 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.180
 the market it would be in mars with peter 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.010
 leeuwenburgh you are part of a 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.420
 generation of young goalkeepers 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.879
 you must ultimately determine 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.379
 who is the keeper of the future 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.480
 no that's right it is very good to say so 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.469
 is a lot of quality then you also notice 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.030
 the trainings 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.769
 but that is just beautiful being good 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.870
 friends with each other so then it is 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.879
 nice work and it flew for me 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.980
 care about working myself and then I sign up 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.680
 Then again if I may very hard 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.569
 are the first ones to get 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.189
 that's how it should be then we have 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.720
 typical 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.370
 trainers and people's well done 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.680
 is the next step for you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.480
 well now body is just getting fit and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.620
 come back to mine as strong as possible 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.450
 injury 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.769
 And yes then it is just important to do so much 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.049
 possible to play matches again to 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.030
 to get more the rhythm I had and 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.310
 thereafter 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.909
 finally a good contract 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.909
 extend hopefully
