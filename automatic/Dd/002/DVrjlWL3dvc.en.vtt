and I

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.760 
and I
he<00:04:00.270> had<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.540> cleanser<00:04:00.900> my<00:04:01.050> hand<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.380> then<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.530> saw

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
he had a cleanser my hand and then I saw

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.890 
he had a cleanser my hand and then I saw
this<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.280> thought<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.700> want<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.420> try<00:04:03.630> something

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
this I thought I want to try something

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.650 
this I thought I want to try something
different<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.740> new<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:05.790> i<00:04:05.820> decided<00:04:06.390> i

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
different and new and so i decided i

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.020 
different and new and so i decided i
would<00:04:06.720> go<00:04:07.050> ahead<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.350> check<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.800> out<00:04:08.070> it's<00:04:08.430> a

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
would go ahead and check this out it's a

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.440 
would go ahead and check this out it's a
toner<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.900> cleanser<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:11.100> figured<00:04:11.610> why

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
toner and a cleanser so I figured why

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.720 
toner and a cleanser so I figured why
not<00:04:12.480> go<00:04:12.750> ahead<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.530> give<00:04:13.770> it<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:14.130> run<00:04:14.370> for<00:04:14.400> its

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
not go ahead and give it a run for its

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.190 
not go ahead and give it a run for its
money<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:16.140> yeah<00:04:16.920> i<00:04:17.220> will<00:04:18.060> definitely<00:04:18.239> be<00:04:18.960> doing

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
money so yeah i will definitely be doing

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.590 
money so yeah i will definitely be doing
a<00:04:19.650> different<00:04:20.130> skin<00:04:20.820> care<00:04:21.030> routine<00:04:21.120> because<00:04:21.450> i

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
a different skin care routine because i

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.270 
a different skin care routine because i
changed<00:04:21.840> my<00:04:21.930> skin<00:04:22.110> care<00:04:22.350> routine<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:23.010> lot

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
changed my skin care routine a lot

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.640 
changed my skin care routine a lot
because<00:04:23.460> my<00:04:23.730> skin<00:04:24.000> becomes<00:04:24.330> immune<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.870> things

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
because my skin becomes immune to things

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.630 
because my skin becomes immune to things
quite<00:04:26.160> fast<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:27.140> I've<00:04:28.140> used<00:04:28.380> up<00:04:28.800> almost<00:04:29.160> all<00:04:29.490> of

quite fast so I've used up almost all of

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.520 
quite fast so I've used up almost all of
my<00:04:29.670> bliss<00:04:30.060> cleansers<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:30.840> I'm<00:04:30.960> probably<00:04:31.230> going
