00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
it's on the larger side but in my

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.070 
it's on the larger side but in my
opinion<00:00:51.920> it's<00:00:52.280> not<00:00:52.340> oversized<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:53.570> not<00:00:53.720> too

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
actually has a silicon finish but the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.030 
actually has a silicon finish but the
case<00:01:16.820> itself<00:01:17.330> is<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.870> in<00:01:18.320> fact<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.650> stainless

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
case itself is is in fact a stainless

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.920 
case itself is is in fact a stainless
steel<00:01:19.070> case<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:19.790> on<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.360> back<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:20.780> see

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
steel case so on the back you can see

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.770 
steel case so on the back you can see
the<00:01:21.260> stainless<00:01:21.500> steel<00:01:21.890> but<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.790> this<00:01:23.240> face

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
the stainless steel but the this face

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.370 
the stainless steel but the this face
here<00:01:24.110> is<00:01:24.229> actually<00:01:24.740> coated<00:01:25.460> in<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:25.909> silicon

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
here is actually coated in the silicon

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.200 
here is actually coated in the silicon
which<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.560> all<00:01:27.770> grey<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:30.430> let's<00:01:31.430> let's<00:01:31.970> go<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.150> a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
which is all grey so let's let's go to a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.270 
which is all grey so let's let's go to a
shot<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.020> dark<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:33.470> this<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:34.130> my

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
shot of this in the dark now this in my

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.950 
shot of this in the dark now this in my
opinion<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.729> one<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.030> downsides<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.810> this

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
opinion is one of the downsides of this

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.800 
opinion is one of the downsides of this
watch<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.409> does<00:01:36.590> have<00:01:37.180> luminescent<00:01:38.180> hands<00:01:38.630> as

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
watch it does have luminescent hands as

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.300 
watch it does have luminescent hands as
you<00:01:39.320> can<00:01:39.470> see<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:39.830> there's<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.010> small

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you can see and there's a small

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.610 
you can see and there's a small
indicator<00:01:40.850> at<00:01:41.060> 12:00<00:01:41.299> o'clock<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.470> not

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
indicator at 12:00 o'clock but it's not

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.960 
indicator at 12:00 o'clock but it's not
going<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.830> be<00:01:42.920> your<00:01:43.070> best<00:01:43.220> friend<00:01:43.549> in<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.760> dark

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
going to be your best friend in the dark

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.780 
going to be your best friend in the dark
because<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.420> numerals<00:01:44.869> are<00:01:45.380> not<00:01:45.790> illuminated

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
because the numerals are not illuminated

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.850 
because the numerals are not illuminated
so<00:01:46.940> that<00:01:47.119> could<00:01:47.330> be<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.479> problem<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.770> know

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
so that could be a problem but you know

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.670 
so that could be a problem but you know
small<00:01:49.490> downside<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:50.450> what<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:50.990> find<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.530> what<00:01:51.650> I

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
small downside for what I find it what I

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
small downside for what I find it what I
think<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:51.979> actually<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.280> very<00:01:52.460> attractive

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
think is actually a very attractive

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.630 
think is actually a very attractive
watch<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:54.229> does<00:01:54.440> have<00:01:54.590> two<00:01:54.830> crowns<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.520> are

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
watch it does have two crowns that are

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.310 
watch it does have two crowns that are
on<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.880> left<00:01:56.210> side<00:01:56.570> now<00:01:56.810> that's<00:01:56.990> that's

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
on the left side now that's that's

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280 
on the left side now that's that's
actually<00:01:57.710> unusual<00:01:58.400> for<00:01:59.180> most<00:01:59.330> watches<00:02:00.049> men

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
actually unusual for most watches men

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.990 
actually unusual for most watches men
generally<00:02:00.770> wear<00:02:00.920> them<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.310> left<00:02:01.520> hand<00:02:01.790> and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
generally wear them on the left hand and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.690 
generally wear them on the left hand and
as<00:02:02.510> you<00:02:02.659> can<00:02:02.780> see<00:02:02.840> by<00:02:03.650> having<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.070> crown<00:02:04.400> on

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
as you can see by having the crown on

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.120 
as you can see by having the crown on
the<00:02:05.030> left<00:02:05.240> side<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.960> means<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.530> as<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.920> move

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
the left side it means that as you move

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.669 
the left side it means that as you move
your<00:02:07.369> wrist<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:08.420> don't<00:02:08.599> you<00:02:09.140> don't<00:02:09.349> have<00:02:09.530> it

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
your wrist you don't you don't have it

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.800 
your wrist you don't you don't have it
kind<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:09.979> jabbing<00:02:10.490> into<00:02:10.700> your<00:02:10.849> hand<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.599> I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
kind of jabbing into your hand so I I

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.650 
kind of jabbing into your hand so I I
think<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.260> that's<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.620> plus<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.310> it's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
think that that's a plus and it's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.050 
think that that's a plus and it's
something<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.140> Nixon<00:02:14.470> does<00:02:14.650> with<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.310> 5130

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
something that Nixon does with this 5130

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.460 
something that Nixon does with this 5130
collection<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:18.570> would<00:02:19.570> wear<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.900> watch<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.440> a

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
collection I would wear this watch on a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.930 
collection I would wear this watch on a
daily<00:02:20.830> basis<00:02:21.160> because<00:02:21.220> it's<00:02:21.460> actually<00:02:21.730> not

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
daily basis because it's actually not

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.810 
daily basis because it's actually not
very<00:02:22.000> heavy<00:02:22.570> it's<00:02:22.840> lighter<00:02:23.200> than<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.650> other

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
very heavy it's lighter than the other

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.070 
very heavy it's lighter than the other
then<00:02:24.820> it's<00:02:24.940> sibling<00:02:25.150> watches<00:02:25.720> from<00:02:25.990> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
then it's sibling watches from the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.740 
then it's sibling watches from the
collection<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.240> think<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.630> it's

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
collection and I just I think that it's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.070 
collection and I just I think that it's
it's<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.950> very<00:02:30.070> versatile<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.940> but<00:02:31.810> what's

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
it's it's very versatile it but what's

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.240 
it's it's very versatile it but what's
great<00:02:32.200> about<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.740> it's<00:02:32.980> also<00:02:33.130> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
great about it is that it's also a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.010 
great about it is that it's also a
sporty<00:02:33.730> watch<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.240> for<00:02:34.420> water<00:02:34.660> sports

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
sporty watch and for water sports

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.410 
sporty watch and for water sports
enthusiasts<00:02:35.800> it's<00:02:36.340> perfect<00:02:36.760> because<00:02:37.090> it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
enthusiasts it's perfect because it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.530 
enthusiasts it's perfect because it
actually<00:02:37.750> has<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> water<00:02:38.740> resistance<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.580> 300

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
actually has a water resistance of 300

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.330 
actually has a water resistance of 300
meters<00:02:40.690> which<00:02:41.530> makes<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.920> suitable<00:02:42.100> for

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
meters which makes it suitable for

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.200 
meters which makes it suitable for
diving<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.440> got<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.710> surf<00:02:45.310> indicator<00:02:45.970> so

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
diving and it's got a surf indicator so

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.940 
diving and it's got a surf indicator so
you<00:02:46.300> can<00:02:46.420> see<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.690> small<00:02:47.020> sub<00:02:47.350> dial<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
you can see the small sub dial on the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.520 
you can see the small sub dial on the
face<00:02:48.190> I'll<00:02:48.880> zoom<00:02:49.210> in<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.990> little<00:02:50.230> bit

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
face I'll zoom in on that a little bit

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.340 
face I'll zoom in on that a little bit
so<00:02:50.800> what<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.030> do<00:02:52.180> with<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.990> using

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
so what you can do with that and using

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.380 
so what you can do with that and using
the<00:02:53.470> small<00:02:53.770> screw<00:02:54.430> down<00:02:54.550> crown<00:02:54.910> here<00:02:55.210> is<00:02:55.270> you

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
the small screw down crown here is you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.020 
the small screw down crown here is you
can<00:02:55.510> actually<00:02:55.690> set<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.350> tide<00:02:56.880> depending<00:02:57.880> on

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
can actually set the tide depending on

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.240 
can actually set the tide depending on
where<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.630> are<00:02:58.660> for<00:02:59.170> high<00:02:59.290> or<00:02:59.470> low<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.920> then

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
where you are for high or low and then

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.910 
where you are for high or low and then
it<00:03:00.430> will<00:03:00.610> cycle<00:03:00.880> throughout<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.600> day

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
it will cycle throughout the day

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.230 
it will cycle throughout the day
indicating<00:03:02.920> higher<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.520> low<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:03.850> that's<00:03:04.060> you

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
indicating higher and low so that's you

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.760 
indicating higher and low so that's you
know<00:03:04.270> helpful<00:03:04.750> if<00:03:04.810> you're<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.960> surfer<00:03:05.380> it's

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
know helpful if you're a surfer it's

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.660 
know helpful if you're a surfer it's
just<00:03:05.950> kind<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.250> neat<00:03:06.430> little<00:03:06.550> feature<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
just kind of a neat little feature the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.770 
just kind of a neat little feature the
glass<00:03:09.670> here<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.090> actually<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> hardened

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
glass here is actually a hardened

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.230 
glass here is actually a hardened
mineral<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:12.130> helps<00:03:12.460> keep<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.790> cost<00:03:13.030> of

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
mineral so it's a helps keep the cost of

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.750 
mineral so it's a helps keep the cost of
the<00:03:13.330> watch<00:03:13.510> down<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.890> not<00:03:15.040> as<00:03:15.190> scratch

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the watch down it's not as scratch

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.670 
the watch down it's not as scratch
resistant<00:03:16.330> as<00:03:16.480> say<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> sapphire<00:03:17.200> crystal

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
resistant as say a sapphire crystal

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.380 
resistant as say a sapphire crystal
would<00:03:17.800> be<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.400> that's<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.700> potentially<00:03:19.209> one

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
would be so that's a potentially one

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.110 
would be so that's a potentially one
other<00:03:19.540> downside<00:03:20.110> but<00:03:20.709> overall<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.880> know<00:03:21.970> it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
other downside but overall you know it's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.520 
other downside but overall you know it's
a<00:03:22.150> durable<00:03:22.510> timepiece<00:03:23.020> and<00:03:23.290> if<00:03:23.410> you're

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
a durable timepiece and if you're

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.320
