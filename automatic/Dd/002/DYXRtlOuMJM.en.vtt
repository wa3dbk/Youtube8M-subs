from like Mexican drinks and it's very
similar<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.900> isn't<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:31.349> pretty<00:04:31.440> how<00:04:31.740> they

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
similar to that isn't it pretty how they

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.950 
similar to that isn't it pretty how they
set<00:04:32.039> it<00:04:32.130> up<00:04:32.160> for<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.400> bit<00:04:32.550> all<00:04:32.910> pretty<00:04:33.150> little<00:04:33.389> in

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
set it up for a bit all pretty little in

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.719 
set it up for a bit all pretty little in
reality<00:04:34.500> even<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:34.889> I<00:04:35.009> didn't<00:04:35.280> like<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.400> it's

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
reality even if I didn't like it it's

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.820 
reality even if I didn't like it it's
pretty<00:04:36.030> enough<00:04:36.300> but<00:04:36.360> I'm<00:04:37.259> still<00:04:37.530> trying<00:04:37.680> to
