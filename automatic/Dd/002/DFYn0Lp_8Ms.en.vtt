00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
so on me so I decide to you turn and I

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
so on me so I decide to you turn and I
go<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.540> gyarados<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.370> gyarados<00:00:41.370> can

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
go into gyarados because gyarados can

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.060 
go into gyarados because gyarados can
take<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.030> nice<00:00:42.989> attacker<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> he<00:00:43.920> actually

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
take a nice attacker to and he actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
take a nice attacker to and he actually
goes<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> icy<00:00:44.969> wind<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.809> isn't<00:00:46.110> very

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
goes with the icy wind which isn't very

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.779 
goes with the icy wind which isn't very
powerful<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.860> gyarados<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
powerful so gyarados can take a lot of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.660 
powerful so gyarados can take a lot of
them<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.210> he<00:00:48.300> does<00:00:48.480> lower<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.899> speed<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:49.530> is

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
them but he does lower my speed which is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
them but he does lower my speed which is
somewhat<00:00:50.670> unfortunate<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> do

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
unfortunately for him he misses and that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.080 
unfortunately for him he misses and that
turns<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.930> pretty<00:00:58.140> nice<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.680> me<00:00:58.800> and

into and he goes seed flare and does

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
into and he goes seed flare and does
about<00:01:24.000> half<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> gyarados<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
about half the gyarados and that's just

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
about half the gyarados and that's just
not<00:01:26.159> good<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> stone<00:01:27.659> edge<00:01:27.930> and

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.870 
goes down but it's getting guards really
low<00:02:54.360> health<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.310> not<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.519> big<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
low health so it's not that big of a

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.640 
low health so it's not that big of a
deal<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> go<00:02:57.510> back<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.810> Acrobat<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.530> I'm

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
it'll hurt a lot but it won't hurt a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.060 
it'll hurt a lot but it won't hurt a
registeel<00:03:02.700> because<00:03:03.150> registeel<00:03:03.690> resists<00:03:04.230> fine

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
registeel because registeel resists fine

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.390 
registeel because registeel resists fine
and<00:03:05.550> that's<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.570> not<00:03:06.870> good<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.920> I'm<00:03:08.040> gonna<00:03:08.160> go

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
and that's just not good so I'm gonna go

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.759 
and that's just not good so I'm gonna go
for<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> taunt<00:03:08.970> because<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:10.200> know<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.620> don't

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
for a taunt because you know I don't

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.290 
for a taunt because you know I don't
think<00:03:11.040> registeel<00:03:11.370> has<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> whole<00:03:11.820> lot<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:11.970> moves

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
think registeel has a whole lot of moves

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.590 
think registeel has a whole lot of moves
that<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.690> really<00:03:12.810> hurt<00:03:13.019> crobat<00:03:13.440> anyway<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
that can really hurt crobat anyway and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.300 
that can really hurt crobat anyway and
now<00:03:15.600> he<00:03:15.780> can't<00:03:16.110> set<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:16.320> his<00:03:16.500> stealth<00:03:16.739> rock<00:03:17.040> so

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
now he can't set up his stealth rock so

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.949 
now he can't set up his stealth rock so
that's<00:03:17.430> pretty<00:03:17.640> nice<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.450> I'd<00:03:18.570> go<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
that's pretty nice so I'd go for a

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.990 
that's pretty nice so I'd go for a
u-turn<00:03:19.320> just<00:03:19.620> get<00:03:19.739> some<00:03:19.890> damage<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.579> while

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
u-turn just get some damage on it while

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360 
u-turn just get some damage on it while
I<00:03:21.030> switch<00:03:21.390> out<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.739> into<00:03:22.890> gyarados

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
I switch out and I go into gyarados

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
I switch out and I go into gyarados
again<00:03:23.700> just<00:03:24.150> because<00:03:24.450> I'm<00:03:24.780> pretty<00:03:25.230> sure

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
again just because I'm pretty sure

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.430 
again just because I'm pretty sure
gyarados<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:25.950> resist<00:03:26.340> or<00:03:26.810> immune<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:28.079> any

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
gyarados can resist or immune to any

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.250 
gyarados can resist or immune to any
attack<00:03:28.890> registeel<00:03:29.400> really<00:03:29.670> has<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.930> he<00:03:31.170> goes

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
attack registeel really has so he goes

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.050 
attack registeel really has so he goes
for<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.530> iron<00:03:31.860> head<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:32.280> gyarados<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.820> course

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
for the iron head and gyarados of course

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.740 
for the iron head and gyarados of course
um<00:03:33.299> resist<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.530> that's<00:03:34.680> pretty<00:03:34.980> nice<00:03:35.750> I'm

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
um resist that so that's pretty nice I'm

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
um resist that so that's pretty nice I'm
gonna<00:03:36.870> go<00:03:37.019> for<00:03:37.230> dragon<00:03:37.590> dance<00:03:37.769> here<00:03:37.980> again

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
gonna go for dragon dance here again

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.610 
gonna go for dragon dance here again
because<00:03:38.640> that's<00:03:38.910> what<00:03:39.090> gyarados<00:03:39.510> does<00:03:39.840> dragon

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
because that's what gyarados does dragon

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.580 
because that's what gyarados does dragon
dance<00:03:40.860> his<00:03:41.040> stuff<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.660> he<00:03:42.660> goes<00:03:42.989> back<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:43.530> a

dance his stuff and he goes back in a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.759 
dance his stuff and he goes back in a
shame<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.400> that's<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.700> real<00:03:45.209> problem<00:03:45.769> but

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
shame in and that's a real problem but

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.009 
shame in and that's a real problem but
um<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:47.970> said<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.390> don't<00:03:48.570> add<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.810> still

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
um like I said it's don't add you still

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.470 
um like I said it's don't add you still
to<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.350> k<00:03:49.530> off<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.280> hit<00:03:50.489> two<00:03:50.790> times<00:03:51.120> with

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
to it k off so if I hit two times with

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.830 
to it k off so if I hit two times with
stone<00:03:51.690> edge<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.260> should<00:03:52.590> KO<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.600> I'm<00:03:54.600> actually

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
stone edge it should KO it I'm actually

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.300 
stone edge it should KO it I'm actually
doesn't<00:03:55.320> look<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.590> it's<00:03:55.739> too<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:55.980> was

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
doesn't look like it's too it was

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.740 
doesn't look like it's too it was
unfortunate<00:03:56.670> but<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.209> just<00:03:57.390> want<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.570> get<00:03:57.660> as

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
unfortunate but I just want to get as

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.039 
unfortunate but I just want to get as
much<00:03:57.870> damage<00:03:58.230> on<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.680> as<00:03:58.799> possible<00:03:59.400> um<00:04:00.090> maybe

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
much damage on it as possible um maybe

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.140 
much damage on it as possible um maybe
he'll<00:04:01.350> go<00:04:01.530> with<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.709> leech<00:04:01.950> seed<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.970> he

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
he'll go with the leech seed and he

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.910 
he'll go with the leech seed and he
actually<00:04:03.329> does<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.019> miss<00:04:04.290> with<00:04:04.470> stone<00:04:04.680> edge

same effect I see the u-turn so I'm kind

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.600 
same effect I see the u-turn so I'm kind
of<00:05:29.199> confused<00:05:29.379> maybe<00:05:29.740> doesn't<00:05:30.069> have<00:05:30.189> payback

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610

but<00:05:31.569> I'm<00:05:31.779> just<00:05:32.229> gonna<00:05:32.349> go<00:05:32.469> for<00:05:32.589> the<00:05:32.770> focus

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
but I'm just gonna go for the focus

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.579 
but I'm just gonna go for the focus
blast<00:05:33.279> and<00:05:33.699> you<00:05:34.629> didn't<00:05:34.839> predict<00:05:35.169> that<00:05:35.319> and<00:05:35.529> go

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:35.589 
blast and you didn't predict that and go

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:37.079 
blast and you didn't predict that and go
in<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.740> gengar<00:05:35.919> you<00:05:36.279> wanted<00:05:36.520> a<00:05:36.580> registeel

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
because focus blast super effective

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.510 
because focus blast super effective
