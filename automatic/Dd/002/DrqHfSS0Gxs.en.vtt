00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
of blue which i think is a really hard

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.539 
of blue which i think is a really hard
color<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> show<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> cool<00:01:34.920> thing<00:01:35.130> about<00:01:35.250> these

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
color to show the cool thing about these

color to show the cool thing about these
lip<00:01:36.270> pencils<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.310> almost<00:01:38.549> layer<00:01:39.150> them

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
lip pencils is you can almost layer them

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
lip pencils is you can almost layer them
so<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.650> apply<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.250> first<00:01:41.460> layer<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so if you apply your first layer and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.550 
so if you apply your first layer and
you're<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.630> happy<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> color

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you're not really happy with the color

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
you're not really happy with the color
payoff<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> want<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.329> opaque

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
payoff or you want it to be more opaque

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.740 
payoff or you want it to be more opaque
you<00:01:46.079> almost<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.920> wait<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.060> set<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you almost can wait for these to set and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170 
you almost can wait for these to set and
then<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.500> add<00:01:49.710> another<00:01:50.220> layer<00:01:50.640> over<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
then you can add another layer over the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.530 
then you can add another layer over the
top<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.920> makes<00:01:53.220> them<00:01:53.490> shinier<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
top and that makes them shinier and it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.050 
top and that makes them shinier and it
also<00:01:54.689> makes<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> color<00:01:55.590> even<00:01:56.070> deeper<00:01:56.460> than

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
also makes the color even deeper than

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
also makes the color even deeper than
the<00:01:57.659> original<00:01:58.110> one<00:01:58.649> coat<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.280> had<00:01:59.579> and

you can also apply these if you like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
you can also apply these if you like
more<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.399> sheer<00:02:02.670> color<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.780> apply<00:02:04.079> them

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
more of a sheer color you can apply them

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.380 
more of a sheer color you can apply them
more<00:02:04.590> sheer<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.759> their<00:02:05.909> pencils

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
more sheer but because their pencils

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.320 
more sheer but because their pencils
you're<00:02:06.540> not<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> need<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.580> lip<00:02:08.580> liner<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
you're not going to need a lip liner and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.090 
you're not going to need a lip liner and
they're<00:02:09.929> satin<00:02:10.560> finish

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
they're satin finish

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.290 
they're satin finish
so<00:02:11.280> you're<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.850> going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> need<00:02:12.180> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so you're really not going to need a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.250 
so you're really not going to need a
gloss<00:02:12.630> over<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.230> top<00:02:13.260> either<00:02:14.300> now<00:02:15.300> what<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> was

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
gloss over the top either now what I was

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.130 
gloss over the top either now what I was
kind<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.560> testing<00:02:17.040> them<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:18.210> not

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
kind of testing them on more was not

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.990 
kind of testing them on more was not
really<00:02:19.410> wearability<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.160> didn't<00:02:20.430> expect<00:02:20.820> them

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
really wearability I didn't expect them

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.840

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
to last a super long time but I did

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.360

feel<00:02:40.830> dry<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.850> didn't<00:02:42.540> need<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.720> balm

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
feel dry at all I didn't need a balm

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.290 
feel dry at all I didn't need a balm
underneath<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:44.310> applied<00:02:44.700> them<00:02:44.910> directly

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
underneath I just applied them directly

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.510 
underneath I just applied them directly
from<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.600> tube<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.260> they<00:02:46.710> did<00:02:46.860> not<00:02:47.010> feel<00:02:47.280> dry

probably<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.450> me<00:02:48.690> my<00:02:49.350> biggest<00:02:49.590> complaint

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
probably for me my biggest complaint

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.400 
probably for me my biggest complaint
with<00:02:50.400> lip<00:02:50.610> products<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.720> drying<00:02:52.050> and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
with lip products is the drying and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.040 
with lip products is the drying and
obviously<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.890> love<00:02:53.190> matte<00:02:53.520> lip<00:02:54.360> products<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
obviously I love matte lip products and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.110 
obviously I love matte lip products and
so<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.980> tends<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.400> happen<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.730> lot<00:02:56.760> with

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
so that tends to happen a lot with

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.320 
so that tends to happen a lot with
mattes<00:02:57.740> these<00:02:58.740> are<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.160> extremely<00:02:59.790> shiny

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
mattes these are not extremely shiny
