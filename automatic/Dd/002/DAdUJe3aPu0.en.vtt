00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
anyway the American artwork just looks

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.180 
anyway the American artwork just looks
silly<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.239> me<00:03:17.390> he's<00:03:17.989> too<00:03:18.170> round<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.920> he<00:03:18.980> looks

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
silly to me he's too round and he looks

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.410

I<00:03:20.450> definitely<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:21.230> Japan's<00:03:21.620> artwork<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.100> him

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
more but I think the only reason they

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.090 
more but I think the only reason they
changed<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.380> look<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> art<00:03:24.920> was<00:03:25.069> to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
changed the look of the art was to

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.039 
changed the look of the art was to
