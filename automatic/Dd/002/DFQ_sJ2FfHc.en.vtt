00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.650
 and I am concession we are to every day 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.210
 also we have seen everyone in 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.550
 the movie 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:29.550
 the piece that seems precious to me the voice 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 Now it 's so cute portamacetas 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.800
 how much time and in a little time you know 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.610
 because Armenian because it has everything about 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.640
 relief then it's like it gives you is 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.760
 easier to be able to paint clear the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.890
 edge of the arabesque and then after 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 immediately and then the regional and 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.640
 grip 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.670
 it does not break is a precious piece of 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.469
 English because that piece is a feeder 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.809
 of birds you can hang them or what 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.410
 you can support in the yard and lose 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.110
 eat the little birds cantÃº and me 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.509
 I really like it as a centerpiece 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 one 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.810
 with a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.890
 a base for cake plate if you 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 located above and a candle as the center of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.200
 table for some event for some 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.930
 party depends how you can paint 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.930
 Is another option 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.380
 this piece are pressures action 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.590
 completely a total beauty if the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.280
 teapot that is one of the new designs 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.380
 has segments and then with gasco 7 for 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.390
 everything romantic the truth that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.140
 It gave me quite an idea to look like you're 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.789
 with racists that the girls are going 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 to do everything look 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.429
 today we are not going to make nib left them 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.979
 rest of the blooming then suit 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.950
 a cup and what I'm going to do was if 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.549
 look is to mark the middle of the cup for 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.890
 make those fallen pinkies 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:10.080
 I mark the other half again and from there 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:14.190
 half then always 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.810
 help yourself with some a cap or something that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.700
 have between one pencil point and the other 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.799
 we are using a pencil that is also 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.140
 for porcelain like carbon dioxide 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.390
 when we trace it, let's say the carbon is 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.870
 for porcelain 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.220
 this pencil also then what does 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.500
 is to see right away how I have the guide 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.720
 so that I can make the roses 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 about that guide and do not notice that a 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.940
 plum line and not blunting or something 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.800
 so 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.440
 as the fallen roses are already in the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.380
 cup what I'm going to do is maybe to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.810
 a personalized mug I 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.530
 a heart drew a heart by hand 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.660
 raised 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.069
 and another thing that I wanted to show you before 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.920
 of making the heart that is very 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.709
 important herminia for roses i 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 I'm going to make a circle look and on that 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.040
 circle 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.350
 I'm going to support another circle that's where 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.930
 I'm going to deposit the shadow with the brush 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.069
 and the dark color and / or the shadow I'm going to 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.170
 have here below and here below if why 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.260
 because if we do the circle and 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.540
 we make a the rose is left distorted 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:34.040
 clear then started with a color 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.040
 a light pink 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.820
 millions of roses say look how fast 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.560
 they leave a space and I'm doing 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.560
 another circle next 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.030
 I do see how easy three or four times and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.490
 immediately mojo in the dark and what 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.650
 I do is make a center for one side 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.740
 a center for the other so that no 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.240
 they are all looking for the same side 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.680
 once I did the centrio there 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:08.640
 supported I make the shade below and there 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.800
 look at how in this way fast and 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.470
 I have four bases of roses and the only thing 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.280
 What I have left is to make some meals 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.139
 envelopes look how easy 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.500
 he supported the brush and with the bounce of the brush 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.240
 01 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.180
 What I do is do until we can 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.590
 go because like it's so tiny to 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.900
 see if we can take it a little I want 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.770
 make a cradle in the middle look to see 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.190
 see there looks beautiful if I do not make a 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.889
 little bit bigger there because there 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.550
 then I mojo in the dark and I'm going to 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:47.220
 to support the brush there and make the center 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.890
 and there I will do the bottom part 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.320
 these are the shadows you notice that the 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.280
 roses are one of the colors that do not 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.450
 they have a lot of brightness before going to the oven 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.290
 but later when they come out of the oven 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.290
 notice that I 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.810
 I am using a light pink and a 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.990
 purple and then after I do all 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.640
 those foods that wrap and end 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.020
 to arm the cocoon the more 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.650
 funny little girls left talked 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.569
 but they are I do not know if those counted and there is no 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.610
 that tell them you have to do them and ready 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:30.229
 I'm going to erase this one because here I had 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:33.650
 thought to do something else look once you 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.930
 the winds have fallen there must be more a 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.990
 Once I have all the roses made 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.050
 what I do is just wet in the green 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.900
 which in this case is a green lime and I do 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.680
 two little leaves from one side of the other is 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.680
 that only 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.669
 he is quickly painting on ceramics 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:06:02.569
 goes to an oven of how many 780 degrees 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:04.339
 degrees but the pigments are 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.389
 cons of the pigments so it is 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:10.789
 exact light pink gone with vehicle 220 and 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.770
 exact nail essence that are what 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.990
 it is also used to put the paint 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.479
 about porcelain and going to put the same 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.139
 look how bright is everything 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:23.749
