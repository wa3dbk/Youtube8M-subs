 Argentina played its first two games 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.390
 and he came home because his players 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.920
 they had to attend their jobs 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.570
 finally they returned to montevideo few 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.470
 hours before the decisive showdown 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.470
 before uruguay 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.480
 in 1922 the Uruguayan team withdrew 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.790
 of the tournament dissatisfied with the work 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.010
 arbitration in the match that lost 1-0 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.220
 against Paraguay the same thing did the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.020
 Chilean team in 1942 after a 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.180
 controversial arbitration decision in which 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.070
 It became necessary the indicated penalty 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.580
 initially in his duel in front of 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.680
 Argentina 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.600
 the lack of arbitrators in the first 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.910
 edition of the tournament made the technical 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.070
 Chilean Carlos Fanta and the player 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.080
 Brazilian sidnei polish is also

 Dress in black and run a pair 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.680
 of matches 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.690
 in addition to the four selections that 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.879
 they started the tournament little by little they 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.190
 they were incorporating the rest 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:52.640
 Paraguay in 1921 Bolivia in 1926 and Peru 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:58.069
 in 1927 much later they did 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:02.379
 ecuador in 1939 colombia in 1945 and 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.379
 venezuela in 1967 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.599
 1967 was the only year in which 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.299
 they played qualifiers for the 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.459
 classification to the tournament colombia and chile 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.040
 on the one hand and Paraguay and Ecuador on the 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.400
 another at the end were chile and paraguay in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.959
 those who qualified for the tournament 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.310
 curiously that was the last year with 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.310
 the system of all against all 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.590
 besides that it stopped being called 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.819
 South American championship for 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.310
 later in the 1975 edition 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.890
 call itself an America's Cup 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.720
 for a long time not all 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.620
 South American teams could 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.780
 participate was in 1986 when the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.760
 conmebol established a rule where 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.330
 the attendance of their 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.330
 10 federations 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.299
 from the America 's Cup 1987 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.430
 conmebol demands each country organizer 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.660
 create a pet representative of 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.290
 tournament 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.510
 as of 1993 in addition to the 10 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.910
 South American teams are also 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.290
 invite two selections plus the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.480
 Guest selections are 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.190
 preferably of the concacaf but in 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.110
 some occasion is also opted for 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.190
 selections of the Asian confederation 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.190
 as japan 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.620
 Currently the tournament is held every 4 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.780
 years since the 2007 edition but with 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.240
 reason for the centenary of the America's Cup 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.990
 in 2016 there will be an edition 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.520
 special held in the usa is also the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.110
 the first time the tournament is held 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.110
 outside the South American continent 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.980
 since it is allowed to invite two 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.930
 selections to the tournament with jamaica are already 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.510
 six those who have ever participated 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.740
 in the cup america mexico costa rica 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:56.550
 honduras usa and japan are the other 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.680
 since 1991 the champion has as a prize 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.539
 besides the trophy attending the cup 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.120
 confederations representing their 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.550
 confederation in case the champion 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.130
 is not a conmebol team will attend 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.169
 the runner-up is why Mexico 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.960
 send your best players to the cup 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:19.060
 of gold belonging to the concacaf 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:22.180
 in the editions of 1924 and 1953 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.069
 paraguay was the headquarters however it could not 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.919
 act as host for the lack of 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:30.340
 infrastructures being thus the venues 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.020
 Uruguay and Peru respectively yes the 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.449
 organizing federation of both 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.870
 editions was that of Paraguay was not 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.440
 until 1999 when he was finally able to exercise 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.110
 of host 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.960
 the america cup played in chile in 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.420
 reality had to be played in Brazil but 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.420
 the confederations cup in 2013 the 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.510
 World Cup in 2014 and Olympics 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.850
 in 2016, it was advisable to change the 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.800
 headquarters so chile was offered to 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.800
 host the 2015 edition 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.360
 Chile with 82 is the selection that 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.909
 matches has lost in the history of the 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.839
 copa america japan is the only one that has not 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.489
 won no match 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:17.580
 Uruguay has never lost a game of 

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:20.899
 the america cup being host 31 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.899
 wins and 7 draws 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:28.020
 150 minutes is what the match lasted 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:30.419
 longest of the tournament was in 1919 between 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.509

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.350
 regulatory and two extra times of 30 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:40.460
 minutes each 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:44.240
 the tournament with the most goals was 1945 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:49.840
 with 135 goals the least one had 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.840
 it was the 1921 with only 14 annotations 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.590
 with 68 matches the national stadium of 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.210
 santiago de chile- is the field where 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.760
 Cup games have been played 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.889
 america is followed by the centennial stadium 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.790
 from montevideo with 65 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.590
 Argentina-Brazil is the most duel 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.810
 repeated in the history of the cup 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.570
 America 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.760
 since there are still more curiosities missing 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.790
 decided not to do it very long and put them 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.770
 in another video nothing more friends I hope that 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:23.660
