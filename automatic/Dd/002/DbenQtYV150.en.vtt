00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.469

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.670
 This sheet on and Polytechnic the more accurately 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.039
 and knowing the area of ​​courage 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.070
 Well, here let's start with perhaps if 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.640
 layer like this, it basically you or to 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.279
 cartoons 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480
 spacious platform here but that is from 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.580
 of this column before 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.019
 long distance so thats there 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.720
 add kim crowd 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.700
 by month, well, that is, as if the station 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.130
 soaks herself a lot of people this is by the way her 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.630
 big plus although boredom rice was hinged 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.600
 this is such from not loaded station 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.210
 because on the forest there is not much 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 residential buildings up at the base of the park and so 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.730
 Further, that's why they called the hinged 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.860
 Well, that's different station because us 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.160
 such green stenochka here and they usually 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.649
 such gray stone is such and such 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.859
 us the main difference forest others 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.010
 stations well here it is standard red 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.659
 Bottom line here is the black line are our 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.299
 advertisements are here on the sides 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.700
 here is a white bollard such from us 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.580
 rounded roof is more accurate ceiling but it 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 almost at all stations that's how 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.990
 You see here, too, on the third floor of this 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.049
 dusty rounded ceiling we are in that 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 we are the same side of course 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.130
 well of course come on now appeared on 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.009
 Polytechnic here by the way I want to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.900
 say that soon I will finish the first 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.520
 line that is, it remains 2 releasing it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.170
 will be at a technical academic 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.420
 Devyatkino civil avenue and all 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.759
 The first opinion is worthy I will correct 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.770
 Some bugs and then I can release 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.630
 card 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.009
 Well, our station looks like this 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.439
 courage area 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.659
 But with this way, where are you? 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.850
 we have no speakers, well, that is, without 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.799
 Columns here and she such from us already 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.610
 open station is something new in 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.979
 my project 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.380
 Well every little bit will not work 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.399
 do so here in magic 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.500
 to a friend with five meter block there somewhere i'm 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.509
 I do not know half a meter is worth a lamp 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.920
 that's so because of the size I was 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.370
 hard to build a little bit wrong 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.230
 it turned out well, here we have a chandelier 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.400
 when you can say so these lamps 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:24.530
 huge here is a fitness lamp on the sides 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.349
 Well, the station itself is a piece 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.049
 Some turned out high and that's also on 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.209
 the article then I do not know here pointers 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.489
 let's say such a station is in everything 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.480
 warming direction to the veterans avenue 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.170
 and to the right of 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.150
 Nine, that's how this whole thing looks 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.610
 basically 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.040
 so here on the bench still available 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.829
 in the middle and let's now a little bit 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.310
 back in 2004 lady in 2001 i 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.140
 don't remember the accident happened here is one of 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.879
 tunnels flooded that is between now 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.310
 forest and flesh courage flooded in 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.109
 tunnel and then build such logic 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.010
 tunnel well it doesn't look like nike to me 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.170
 as usual well here's the chorus in the subway 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.709
 flooded here and how would the train rode 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.269
 Veterans Avenue just the forest 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.389
 here there was a shooter and and there of course already 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.519
 closed well here and remains a mystery 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.440
 abandoned way in the metro spb 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.989
 that is, this one that flooded and do not know 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.209
 what's not happening now and u have it shut down 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.939
 everything turns out mothballed 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.030
 or was flooded either there just 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.709
 dummy without a referee even archers well 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.720

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.849
 I will study history for me just that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.799
 very interesting here as we were 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.540
