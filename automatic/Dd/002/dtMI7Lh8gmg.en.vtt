change this as I indicated in the
software<00:05:32.550> I'll<00:05:32.700> do<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.150> let's<00:05:33.720> go<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.070> fully

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
software I'll do that let's go to fully

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.420 
software I'll do that let's go to fully
light<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.760> and<00:05:35.970> apply<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:37.230> this<00:05:37.710> will<00:05:37.950> just

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
light it and apply so this will just

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.290 
light it and apply so this will just
mean<00:05:38.670> once<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.330> changes<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:41.300> lighting

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
mean once it changes that the lighting

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.440 
mean once it changes that the lighting
will<00:05:42.540> stay<00:05:42.780> on<00:05:43.050> all<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:44.640> time<00:05:44.880> now<00:05:45.150> this<00:05:45.240> will

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
will stay on all the time now this will

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.630 
will stay on all the time now this will
take<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:45.870> little<00:05:46.140> while<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.440> update<00:05:46.920> and<00:05:47.220> just

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
take a little while to update and just

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.150 
take a little while to update and just
hang<00:05:47.880> with<00:05:47.910> me<00:05:48.120> here<00:05:48.350> until<00:05:49.350> it<00:05:49.500> does<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.070> you

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
hang with me here until it does so you

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.710 
hang with me here until it does so you
can<00:05:50.310> see<00:05:50.550> actually<00:05:50.880> how<00:05:51.060> long<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.540> does

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
can see actually how long it does

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.780 
can see actually how long it does
actually<00:05:51.930> take<00:05:52.260> so<00:05:52.590> that's<00:05:53.220> how<00:05:53.370> long<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.670> took

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
actually take so that's how long it took

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.720 
actually take so that's how long it took
it's<00:05:54.390> updated<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.050> let's<00:05:55.230> go<00:05:55.440> and<00:05:55.710> turn<00:05:56.340> it<00:05:56.520> off

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
it's updated so let's go and turn it off

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.480 
it's updated so let's go and turn it off
completely<00:05:57.210> takes<00:05:57.930> a<00:05:58.050> few<00:05:58.230> seconds<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:59.340> do

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
completely takes a few seconds to do

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.740 
completely takes a few seconds to do
this<00:05:59.730> and<00:06:00.680> once<00:06:01.680> it's<00:06:02.670> turned<00:06:03.060> off<00:06:03.330> I'll<00:06:03.600> go

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
this and once it's turned off I'll go

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.470 
this and once it's turned off I'll go
back<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.140> breathing<00:06:04.560> and<00:06:04.740> then<00:06:05.130> change<00:06:06.090> the

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480
