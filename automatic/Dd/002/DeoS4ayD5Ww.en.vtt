and houses coming in a future DLC now of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
and houses coming in a future DLC now of
course<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> reason<00:00:35.280> why<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:35.730> saying<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
course the reason why I'm saying this is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
course the reason why I'm saying this is
because<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> recent<00:00:37.170> addition<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
because of the recent addition of the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
because of the recent addition of the
new<00:00:38.760> houses<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.510> rocks<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.960> added<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
new houses that rocks are added with the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.479 
new houses that rocks are added with the
independence<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.309> dlc<00:00:41.790> patch<00:00:42.649> 1.15<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
independence a dlc patch 1.15 now of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
independence a dlc patch 1.15 now of
course<00:00:44.700> there's<00:00:45.030> no<00:00:45.210> confirmation<00:00:45.690> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
course there's no confirmation that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.900 
course there's no confirmation that
rocks<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.530> ever<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.920> adding<00:00:47.280> houses<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
rocks are will ever be adding houses in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
rocks are will ever be adding houses in
terms<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.660> 10<00:00:48.840> car<00:00:49.110> garage<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.680> even<00:00:49.920> mansions

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
terms of 10 car garage or even mansions

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
terms of 10 car garage or even mansions
but<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.629> only<00:00:51.870> assume<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.770> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
but one can only assume that this is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.860 
but one can only assume that this is
coming<00:00:53.309> very<00:00:53.489> soon<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> reason<00:00:54.719> why<00:00:54.809> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
coming very soon now the reason why I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.270 
coming very soon now the reason why I
think<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.039> recent

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
think this is because of the recent

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.729 
think this is because of the recent
addition<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.210> six-car<00:00:57.870> garage<00:00:57.899> houses

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
addition of these six-car garage houses

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
addition of these six-car garage houses
that<00:00:59.219> rocks<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.609> randomly<00:01:00.059> added<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.960> patch

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that rocks are randomly added with patch

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.939 
that rocks are randomly added with patch
1.15<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.000> Independence<00:01:03.600> Day<00:01:03.660> DLC<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
1.15 and the Independence Day DLC now I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
1.15 and the Independence Day DLC now I
don't<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.369> anyone<00:01:05.939> could<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.270> ever

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
don't think anyone could have ever

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.560 
don't think anyone could have ever
thought<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.130> independent<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> DLC

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
thought that in the independent is a DLC

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.440 
thought that in the independent is a DLC
we<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.290> receive<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.880> eight<00:01:12.090> new

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
we would receive I think it's eight new

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.550 
we would receive I think it's eight new
houses<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> them<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.360> pretty<00:01:15.689> ok

houses and a lot of them are pretty ok
like<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.070> said<00:01:17.250> before<00:01:17.400> another<00:01:17.759> video<00:01:18.030> there

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
like I said before another video there

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
like I said before another video there
are<00:01:18.689> six<00:01:18.960> car<00:01:19.140> garages<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.130> some

being<00:01:41.220> added<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.820> GT<00:01:42.360> online<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:43.320> personally

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
being added in GT online now personally

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.889 
being added in GT online now personally
I<00:01:44.159> did<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.700> buy<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.329> these<00:01:45.479> houses

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
I did not buy one of these houses

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.289 
I did not buy one of these houses
because<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.890> lower<00:01:47.130> end<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.759> guess

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
because they are the lower end I guess

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.240 
because they are the lower end I guess
of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.540> real<00:01:48.990> estate<00:01:49.229> available<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.860> GTA

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
of the real estate available in GTA

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
of the real estate available in GTA
online<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.720> near<00:01:51.869> future<00:01:52.079> roxxor

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
online but in the near future roxxor

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
online but in the near future roxxor
might<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.189> adding<00:01:53.579> mansions<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.299> bigger

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
might be adding mansions and bigger

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
might be adding mansions and bigger
houses<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.890> GTA<00:01:56.280> online<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.579> are

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
houses to GTA online that are

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
houses to GTA online that are
purchasable<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.840> us<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> players<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
purchasable for us the players now the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.709 
purchasable for us the players now the
reason<00:01:59.070> why<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> say<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.520> because<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.450> just

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
reason why I say this is because it just

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.859 
reason why I say this is because it just
makes<00:02:01.500> sense<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> don't<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.369> when

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
makes sense now I don't know when

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
makes sense now I don't know when
they'll<00:02:03.869> add<00:02:04.200> these<00:02:04.500> houses<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.219> what<00:02:05.850> random

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
they'll add these houses or what random

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.949 
they'll add these houses or what random
DLC<00:02:07.049> they'll<00:02:07.200> throw<00:02:07.500> them<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.030> think

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
DLC they'll throw them on to but I think

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.040 
DLC they'll throw them on to but I think
that<00:02:10.170> 1.15<00:02:11.009> patch<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.300> houses<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.810> came

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that 1.15 patch and the houses I came

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.840 
that 1.15 patch and the houses I came
with<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
with it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.490 
with it
are<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.970> great<00:02:14.510> step<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> right<00:02:15.470> direction

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
are a great step in the right direction

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.220 
are a great step in the right direction
to<00:02:16.190> what<00:02:16.310> people<00:02:16.760> want<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.060> see<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.450> think<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
to what people want to see I think the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.660 
to what people want to see I think the
direction<00:02:18.350> Russia's<00:02:18.920> gonna<00:02:19.070> be<00:02:19.130> taking<00:02:19.460> is

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
direction Russia's gonna be taking is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.880 
direction Russia's gonna be taking is

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
good transition because GTL n is set

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.400 
good transition because GTL n is set
before<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:50.000> story<00:02:50.360> mode<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.930> know<00:02:51.110> maybe

and<00:02:53.540> Franklin<00:02:53.990> did<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.350> would<00:02:54.680> play<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.890> really

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
and Franklin did it would play a really

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.670 
and Franklin did it would play a really
good<00:02:55.490> role<00:02:55.880> play<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.240> think<00:02:56.630> if<00:02:56.780> rocks<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.500> really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
good role play I think if rocks I really

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.260 
good role play I think if rocks I really
did<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.400> know<00:02:58.520> there's<00:02:58.730> plenty<00:02:59.240> of

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
did that and I know there's plenty of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.950 
did that and I know there's plenty of
houses<00:02:59.600> around<00:02:59.990> Los<00:03:00.800> Santos<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:02.120> people<00:03:02.780> can

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
houses around Los Santos that people can

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.380

choose<00:03:03.170> from<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.680> are<00:03:04.330> ten-car<00:03:05.330> garage

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
choose from that are ten-car garage

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.750 
choose from that are ten-car garage
worthy<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.740> are<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:07.130> big

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
worthy that are that big

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.520 
worthy that are that big
so<00:03:08.120> hopefully<00:03:08.330> Rockstar<00:03:08.900> does<00:03:09.140> take<00:03:09.380> these

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
so hopefully Rockstar does take these

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.810 
so hopefully Rockstar does take these
things<00:03:09.740> into<00:03:09.920> consideration<00:03:09.950> when<00:03:10.670> they<00:03:10.700> do

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
things into consideration when they do

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.030 
things into consideration when they do
decide<00:03:11.360> they<00:03:11.840> want<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.110> add<00:03:12.260> mansions<00:03:12.800> or<00:03:12.860> if

decide they want to add mansions or if

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.350 
decide they want to add mansions or if
they<00:03:13.190> ever<00:03:13.400> decide<00:03:13.760> they<00:03:14.030> want<00:03:14.210> to<00:03:14.240> add

they ever decide they want to add

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.030 
they ever decide they want to add
mansions<00:03:14.840> because<00:03:15.350> it's<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.590> very<00:03:15.830> big

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
mansions because it's a very big

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.310

possibility they may be coming in maybe
