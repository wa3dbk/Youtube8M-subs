the microphone has down we're actually

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.639 
the microphone has down we're actually
it's<00:00:36.660> probably<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> design<00:00:37.410> element

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it's probably just a design element

then<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> course<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> microphone<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.360> down

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
then of course the microphone is down

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.369 
then of course the microphone is down
there<00:00:43.160> moving<00:00:44.160> around<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.579> back<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.690> says<00:00:45.960> HD

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
there moving around the back it says HD

have this extent here which is very

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
have this extent here which is very
funny<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.820> provides<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.750> good<00:01:00.930> amount

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
funny about that provides a good amount

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
funny about that provides a good amount
of<00:01:01.289> weight<00:01:01.530> although<00:01:01.739> Adam<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> are<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the HTC hd2 which is presumably the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
the HTC hd2 which is presumably the
predecessor<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> hd7<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.759> made<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> jump

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

from<00:01:33.439> HD<00:01:34.439> 22<00:01:35.540> hd2<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.720> HD<00:01:37.020> 7<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.979> very

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
from HD 22 hd2 to HD 7 so very

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
from HD 22 hd2 to HD 7 so very
similar-looking<00:01:38.850> devices<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.689> first<00:01:39.930> glance

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
similar-looking devices at first glance

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.499 
similar-looking devices at first glance
but<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.560> course<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.100> hd7<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.729> adorned<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
but of course the hd7 is adorned a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.139 
but of course the hd7 is adorned a
little<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.110> mostly<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.740> chrome<00:01:44.149> have

different designs and obviously the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.789 
different designs and obviously the
hardware<00:01:47.220> buttons<00:01:47.520> seem<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.390> style

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.649 
hardware buttons seem to be out of style
now<00:01:49.799> they're<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.280> capacitive<00:01:50.729> box

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
now they're going for capacitive box

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.489 
now they're going for capacitive box
on<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.499> back<00:01:52.679> here<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.609> many<00:01:53.909> similarities

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
both have the dual LED flash and you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.740 
both have the dual LED flash and you
won't<00:01:58.229> find<00:01:58.469> any<00:01:58.859> markings<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.759> HTC<00:02:00.299> Sense<00:02:00.509> or

can click get more and that should
launch<00:02:44.670> us<00:02:44.910> into<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:46.140> choices<00:02:46.379> so<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.829> can<00:02:46.980> do

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
launch us into the choices so we can do

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.180

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
really hasn't done that much to make

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.789 
really hasn't done that much to make
this<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.400> better<00:03:14.880> experience<00:03:15.470> it's<00:03:16.470> basically

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
this a better experience it's basically

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.470 
this a better experience it's basically

so you can get a sense for what they

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.129 
so you can get a sense for what they
look<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:29.060> it's<00:03:30.060> my<00:03:30.299> possible<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.989> we're

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
look like it's my possible that we're
