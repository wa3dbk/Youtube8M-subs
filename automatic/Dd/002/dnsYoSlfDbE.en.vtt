00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
that's the main reason why the Irish are
stands<00:01:39.990> above<00:01:40.140> any<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.650> eventing<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
stands above any for the eventing and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.620 
stands above any for the eventing and
going<00:01:41.369> across<00:01:41.549> country<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.479> comes

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
going across country because it comes

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.899 
going across country because it comes
naturally<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> him<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.700> guy

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
naturally to him because like this guy

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
naturally to him because like this guy
is<00:01:44.970> three<00:01:45.390> weeks<00:01:45.570> ridin<00:01:45.990> done<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
is three weeks ridin done and how the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.399 
is three weeks ridin done and how the
country<00:01:47.220> goes<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.939> labor<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> head<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.320> them

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
country goes and labor the head of them
