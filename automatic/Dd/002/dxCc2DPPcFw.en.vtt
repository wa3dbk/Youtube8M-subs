00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 1 Do drivers compete with each other 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 in economy cars with 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 traditional engine and here bye 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.170
 doer out of competition in europe his 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.170
 prefer more than half 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 motorists and in Russia already the third 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.740
 advantages and disadvantages of the engine on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.350
 heavy fuel weigh it zinkevich 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 gasoline or diesel car enthusiasts have long been 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.350
 divided into two camps and each 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.720
 own truth 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.210
 so what 's to stop your 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.009
 the choice today in europe is more than half 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.739
 diesel cars 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.100
 but there is a milder climate and the quality of diesel fuel 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.649
 better with us during the bitter cold 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.820
 unpretentious for food gasoline engines 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.559
 make it easier of course 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.489
 However, this does not mean that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.890
 diesel engines are not adapted for winter 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.170
 diesel today is not what it was 5 and only 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.480
 especially 10 years ago and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.850
 automakers are constantly working on 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.430
 eliminating its shortcomings here 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 diesel car then he 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.790
 not as pronounced as before, and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.979
 feel my only when standing next 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.350
 Now let's get into the car with the car 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.270
 contrary to the opinion of the motor 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.850
 almost no noise but what about 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 characteristics try to ride to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.909
 impressive 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.580
 vigorous overclocking good dynamics 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.250
 movements today are almost all diesel 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.290
 engines come with turbocharging from that y 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.869
 them so high torque 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.060
 but how much do they cost compared to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 gasoline if we consider two 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 car in the same configuration then 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 diesel car will 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.790
 5-10 percent more expensive than a car 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.159
 with gasoline engine yes all the same 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.470
 diesel engine is more expensive but it 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.479
 more durable and this is also important to 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.850
 the same diesel engine more economical 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.270
 consumes fuel and in traffic it is not 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.490
 equal 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.280
 therefore, considering all its characteristics 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.430
 it is ideal for cars 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 urban cars and for large 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.689
 SUVs and of course for real 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.119
 SUVs and what to do if diesel 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.030
 but I want to have enough money only on what you have 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.770
 how to determine the state of the motor when 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.429
 choosing a diesel car first 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.439
 queue pay attention to holo 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.420
 on start-up the car should not be 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.219
 warmed up is an important criterion for assessing 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.500
 diesel engine operation 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.409
 This is due to the fact that when working 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.230
 temperature to recognize already existing 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.109
 his problems are almost impossible but this 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.930
 not all check the availability of service 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.829
 make sure the car is on time 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.180
 passed from him and be sure to spend 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.359
 independent engine diagnostics 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.129
 Choosing a used diesel engine requires 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.409
 more serious 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.870
 because if it breaks, the repair will be 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.299
 cost expensive diesel engine 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.109
 long made his way to the passenger 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.480
 cars 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.079
 but today it is one of the most practical 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.079
