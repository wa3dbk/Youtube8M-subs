00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 I greet everyone on my life channel 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 very glad you looked my name is 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.109
 Anya and in this video I would like 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.910
 execute a long-standing query which 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.650
 did not arrive in private messages in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.380
 comments you wrote on this one 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.289
 makeup which is now on me for the first time 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.060
 saw in the video the answer to all the troll day 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.400
 Significant and you so liked in principle 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.769
 nothing special is the most that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 there is minimalism except of course 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.990
 probably glued cilia all very 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 just done and now show as if 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.289
 you are interested please stay with 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 me as a tonal basis I am very 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.010
 I like to use moisturizer with 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.260
 tonal effect secret perfect 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.059
 tones my shoes are natural beige 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.640
 and don't use brushes I always 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 impose his fingers imperfections 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.879
 I open with the help only and in shade 25 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.769
 now you will be very well 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.699
 There is only one used makeup 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.699
 palette of shadows 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.070
 it is already known to all and you about t 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.680
 A ton of makeup does not need to focus on 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.280
 shadows they must be completely invisible 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.199
 and neutral nudes all attention will be 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.199
 concentrated on the arrow in the eyelashes 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.280
 Here is such a brush as a toffee fold 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.770
 century I add a little darker shadows 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.869
 in order to open visually 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.810
 I have a low eyelid so I 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.430
 have a little higher draw 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.820
 the crease of a century than me 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.820
 there is 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.600
 don't forget to draw the lower eyelid for 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.420
 I used this one so you are different 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.210
 mocha palette shade 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.399
 do a smooth feathering in order to 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.799
 draw such a clear bright arrow i 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.549
 chose a pencil 22 carats of gold 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.470
 Ivan in shades of brown is possible on camera 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.939
 it will be transmitted as black on 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.310
 actually from dark brown pencil 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.890
 with paid sparkles while i'm 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.979
 drew arrows sharpened him probably 1 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.020
 5 mode is that it is very soft but with 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.659
 In this he does not smear the butter for 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.060
 this is probably I love these pencils by 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.640
 Of course large flow very quickly 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.280
 grind out unfortunately and have to 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.480
 buy again and again but in principle for 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.430
 this amount can not buy all the attention 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.430
 in this makeup riveted on the arrows on 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.200
 eyes so make sure that 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.569
 while you draw this arrow 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.250
 gu pencil very well ground if you 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.230
 a little too far with the shadows 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.540
 use some light powder in 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.010
 my case is pretty budget 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.170
 color trend from avon 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.239
 i take my wide brush for 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.940
 feathering and a little powder all 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.790
 century eyebrows in this makeup I do a little 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.010
 brighter than usual because such 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.470
 bright arrows and eyes should be 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.170
 decent framing as mating 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.959
 powder and 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:03:00.860
 I use the color trend on the sofa and big 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:03:03.340
 brush from the world neubivaemy rouge from 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.340
 bourgeois 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.930
 if the highlighter on the upper eyelid and on 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.580
 cheekbones i use 24 carats of gold 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.120
 I did this, I use an overhead 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.129
 eyelashes more precisely bunches at me it besides 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.340
 firms toffee do not forget to work 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.470
 prepare immediately glue and tweezers from me 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.720
 tweezers are such a little beveled and 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.599
 flat so it is very convenient to stick 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.080
 eyelash- like damn glue i said 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.790
 make a mistake 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.220
 in fact I use resin for 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.920
 eyelashes because it hypoallergenic and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.720
 does not smell and does not annoy the clave they 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.450
 I'm pretty sensitive and so 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.190
 what am i doing the first thing that is an ulcer about and 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.290
 your eyelashes with the most ordinary 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.049
 tweezers and impose 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.739
 literally one or two very thin layers 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.099
 carcasses 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.010
 my case is super, so it extends 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.349
 does the volume here do not need to create 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.269
 very strong volume in order to 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.870
 these bunches here were no different from yours. 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.790
 cilia 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.819
 so what we need to do what 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.709
 effect to achieve the longest eyelashes 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.980
 should you be on the outer corner 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.889
 eyes and to the inner corner they should 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.400
 go shorter and shorter that I loved her 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:18.500
 buy two packs and eyelash risk 8 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.090
 millimeters and 10 millimeters 10 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.560
 millimeters respectively goes to the edge 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.780
 a8 is everything else 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.789
 these cilia are pretty fragile 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.389
 so you need to handle them very much 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.599
 neatly 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.259
 you take tweezers for the line of the flocks you 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:35.060
 here it is written copan pull take the whole 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.229
 strip you will be comfortable with it 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.650
 if you stick and for example on the lid 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:44.870
 in this way from the cap you already 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:49.370
 tweezers at the base of the cilia 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.349
 just pull them down and so you 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.110
 must watch to tweezers captured 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.930
 the ladder is full if you pull 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.760
 one thing she just comes off you pull 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.750
 just for everything so neatly 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.900
 shoot further you need to take up 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.960
 the tips of the eyelashes are like that 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.229
 after that, dipped in the glue 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.090
 tip if you have a surplus then you have it 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.770
 just like this, wipe somewhere 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.710
 on maybe on a piece of paper that is where 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.600
 lookup brought on a row so procrastinate 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.150
 I'm already applying to my eyelashes 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.070
 as close as possible to the skin 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.500
 why I like these particular eyelashes 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.280
 namely toffee choose my seat 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.220
 cheaper 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.380
 it's very simple if you paid 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.630
 attention is usually on the stairs which 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.520
 sell sources in single bundles 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:44.220
 koch edges have them cut off 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.000
 this will convince me artificially not personally 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.820
 like her immediately see people notice 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.020
 the effect is not the same and these cilia 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.760
 create pretty 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.480
 natural effect because they 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:01.170
 tapering ends just like our own 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.270
 native eyelashes also yeti look very 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.340
 naturally and so we stick 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.460
 almost all of the upper eyelid bundles 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.460
 eyelashes 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.400
 im something on makeup and i use pretty 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.910
 same bright shine in pink 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 nectar 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.290
 that 's what tinker can do 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.840
 simple but pretty 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.370
 spectacular and hope and and you enjoyed 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.560
 be sure to leave comments to me 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.310
 it will be interesting to read them all 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.310
 bye Bye
