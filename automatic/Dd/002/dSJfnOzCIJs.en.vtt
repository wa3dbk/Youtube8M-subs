00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
with the differences of the new and the

with the differences of the new and the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
haven't watched that one either I will

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.269 
haven't watched that one either I will
be<00:00:21.689> comparing<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> ultimate

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
be comparing this one to the ultimate

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.939 
be comparing this one to the ultimate
effect<00:00:23.400> starts<00:00:23.939> Vader<00:00:24.150> lightsaber<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.650> stay

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
effect starts Vader lightsaber so stay

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.890 
effect starts Vader lightsaber so stay
tuned<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.609> later<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.779> this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
tuned for that one later on in this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.690 
tuned for that one later on in this
video<00:00:28.310> I<00:00:29.310> don't<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:31.009> comparison<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
video I don't have the comparison to the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.330 
video I don't have the comparison to the
old<00:00:33.030> basic<00:00:33.390> lightsaber<00:00:33.870> because<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:35.190> like

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
old basic lightsaber because just like

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
old basic lightsaber because just like
the<00:00:35.460> other<00:00:35.610> reviews<00:00:36.149> they're<00:00:36.870> almost<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the other reviews they're almost the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.220 
the other reviews they're almost the
same<00:00:37.850> except<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:38.879> some<00:00:39.239> minor<00:00:39.270> differences

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
same except for some minor differences

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
same except for some minor differences
here<00:00:40.980> I'll<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> comparison<00:00:42.149> right

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
here I'll get into the comparison right

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.869 
here I'll get into the comparison right
now<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> side-by-side<00:00:43.789> comparison<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
now so use a side-by-side comparison of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
now so use a side-by-side comparison of
the<00:00:45.120> ultimate<00:00:45.780> effects<00:00:46.110> which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the ultimate effects which is on the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.190 
the ultimate effects which is on the
right<00:00:47.149> compared<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> new<00:00:48.690> basic

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
right compared to the new basic

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.410 
right compared to the new basic
lightsabers<00:00:51.050> here<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> belt<00:00:52.469> clips<00:00:52.829> are

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
lightsabers here the belt clips are

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.360 
lightsabers here the belt clips are
similar<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.140> looks<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.530> bigger<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
similar this one looks a bit bigger the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520 
similar this one looks a bit bigger the
one<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> painted<00:00:58.320> these

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
one to the right of the painted these

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.490 
one to the right of the painted these
two<00:00:58.890> differently<00:00:59.489> um<00:01:00.829> as<00:01:01.829> far<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.579> design

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
two differently um as far as design

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.609 
two differently um as far as design
exactly<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> same<00:01:05.900> there's<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.380> line

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
exactly the same there's a bit of a line

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
exactly the same there's a bit of a line
here<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> basic<00:01:08.520> live<00:01:08.729> saber<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.210> don't

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
here for the basic live saber I don't

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
here for the basic live saber I don't
know<00:01:09.659> why<00:01:09.930> um<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:13.110> looks<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
know why um it looks like the the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
know why um it looks like the the
lengths<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> design<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.540> exactly<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
lengths of the design are exactly the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.890 
lengths of the design are exactly the
same<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.530> well<00:01:17.240> here<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.540> some<00:01:18.720> minor

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
same as well here there are some minor

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.770 
same as well here there are some minor
differences<00:01:19.460> there's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> bit<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:21.119> detail

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
differences there's a bit more detail

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
differences there's a bit more detail
with<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> ultimate<00:01:22.650> effects<00:01:23.090> there<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.119> some

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
with the ultimate effects there are some

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.230 
with the ultimate effects there are some
letters<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.020> don't<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
letters here I don't know what the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
letters here I don't know what the
functionality<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> those<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:28.049> um<00:01:28.430> letters

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
functionality of those like um letters

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.660 
functionality of those like um letters
are<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.979> just<00:01:31.979> comment<00:01:32.369> below<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
are if you do know just comment below I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.289 
are if you do know just comment below I
would<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:34.640> otherwise<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:36.000> are

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
would like to know otherwise there are

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.950 
would like to know otherwise there are
no<00:01:36.479> differences<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:38.579> button<00:01:38.970> very

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
no differences in that the button very

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.760 
no differences in that the button very
similar<00:01:41.570> but<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.049> has<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
similar but this one has more of a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
similar but this one has more of a
bubble<00:01:44.220> look<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.450> clear

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
bubble look to it because it's clear

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.130 
bubble look to it because it's clear
while<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> same<00:01:48.240> paint

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
while this one just is the same paint

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.910 
while this one just is the same paint
scheme<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:53.840> they're<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.229> same<00:01:55.470> shine

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
scheme and they're about the same shine

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.850 
scheme and they're about the same shine
I<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.460> say<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:57.659> much<00:01:57.930> differences<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
I would say not much differences in the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.420 
I would say not much differences in the
shine<00:02:00.110> there<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> there's<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.979> line<00:02:02.189> going

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
shine there is a there's a line going

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
shine there is a there's a line going
through<00:02:02.549> here<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.390> screw<00:02:04.549> this<00:02:05.549> screw<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.030> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
through here a screw this screw is for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.170 
through here a screw this screw is for
the<00:02:06.960> battery<00:02:07.409> pack<00:02:10.099> here<00:02:11.099> there's<00:02:11.340> more<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the battery pack here there's more of a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.360 
the battery pack here there's more of a
metal

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
metal

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.580 
metal
piece<00:02:15.000> over<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.410> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
piece over here this just like that a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.890 
piece over here this just like that a
looks<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> screw<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.870> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900

design<00:02:23.970> there's<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:24.750> some<00:02:24.930> lines<00:02:25.200> through

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
design there's like some lines through

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.360 
design there's like some lines through

meant to be rubber grips looks like the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.510 
meant to be rubber grips looks like the
same<00:02:31.739> length<00:02:33.590> here<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.770> bottom<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> hill

same length here the bottom of the hill
it's<00:02:36.209> black<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.440> an<00:02:37.590> opening<00:02:37.739> for

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
it's black and there is an opening for

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.470 
it's black and there is an opening for
the<00:02:38.250> speaker<00:02:40.100> whereas<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.370> function<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.270> not

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the speaker whereas that function is not

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.880 
the speaker whereas that function is not
necessary<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.650> one<00:02:43.950> arm<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:46.260> there's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
necessary for this one arm this there's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.320 
necessary for this one arm this there's
a<00:02:46.950> difference<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.400> with<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.880> belt<00:02:48.120> clip

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
a difference here with the belt clip

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.300 
a difference here with the belt clip
obviously<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.260> basic<00:02:49.440> lightsabers<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
obviously the basic lightsabers have the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.110 
obviously the basic lightsabers have the
belt<00:02:50.489> clip<00:02:50.670> where<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:52.050> does<00:02:52.350> not<00:02:53.120> here's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
belt clip where this one does not here's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.210 
belt clip where this one does not here's
a<00:02:54.180> side-by-side<00:02:54.510> comparison<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.890> blade

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
a side-by-side comparison for the blade

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.150 
a side-by-side comparison for the blade
length<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> new<00:02:58.140> basic<00:02:58.530> lightsaber

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
length for the new basic lightsaber

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.449 
length for the new basic lightsaber
which<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.580> bottom<00:02:59.940> one<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.600> about<00:03:01.530> maybe

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
which is the bottom one it's about maybe

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.240 
which is the bottom one it's about maybe
like<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> half<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.540> an<00:03:03.690> inch<00:03:03.870> longer<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.220> not

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
like a half of an inch longer but not

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.360 
like a half of an inch longer but not
much<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.940> difference<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:07.440> hilt<00:03:07.709> as<00:03:08.010> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
much of a difference on the hilt as I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.390 
much of a difference on the hilt as I
said<00:03:08.700> they're<00:03:09.000> exactly<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> same<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:11.040> far<00:03:11.340> as

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
said they're exactly the same as far as

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.000 
said they're exactly the same as far as
the<00:03:11.550> length<00:03:12.440> otherwise<00:03:13.440> there<00:03:13.709> aren't<00:03:13.890> too

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
the length otherwise there aren't too

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.860 
the length otherwise there aren't too
many<00:03:14.040> differences<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:15.120> course<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.720> main

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
many differences of course the main

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.600 
many differences of course the main
difference<00:03:16.319> between<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.950> ultimate<00:03:17.340> effects

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
difference between the ultimate effects

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.569 
difference between the ultimate effects
and<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.820> basic<00:03:18.120> lightsabers<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.870> uh<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:20.400> have

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
and the basic lightsabers is uh you have

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.699 
and the basic lightsabers is uh you have
the<00:03:20.760> speaker's<00:03:21.239> because<00:03:22.079> there<00:03:22.230> are<00:03:22.350> sound

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the speaker's because there are sound

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.660 
the speaker's because there are sound
and<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.730> also<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.870> blade<00:03:25.739> light<00:03:26.070> LED

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and you also have the blade light LED

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.000 
and you also have the blade light LED
lights<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:28.340> otherwise<00:03:29.870> until<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.230> come<00:03:31.860> out

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
lights so otherwise until I come out

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.670 
lights so otherwise until I come out
