00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hello everyone today I want to make a video 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:11.040
 a story about my morning and skin care 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 I hope the evening video will not be very 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.089
 long but if all the same and again and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.670
 go bust and I will share this video on 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.789
 two parts that's why if you're interested 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.550
 stay with me just a few 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.189
 words about my skin before i 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 go to the main talk about 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.550
 means of care means my skin 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 normal 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 with a tendency to dryness with rashes and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 basically rash me well somewhere in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.579
 the area that's exactly not even soon 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.399
 it turns out somewhere under the cheekbones and in these 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.440
 areas and means laptop colors 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.700
 few stars sometimes we i 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.050
 creeps out at me not extended 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.760
 I have no problems with it 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
 points i thought like on his most 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.250
 because it’s in my nose area 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.870
 subtly it is probably all the same merit 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.940
 Genetics in my mom's skin is thin 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 as such, I do not have wrinkles but 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.770
 I have such mimic wrinkles here 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.600
 in this eye area, this is probably where 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.909
 high boredom cold point here 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.780
 here on the forehead, in principle, there is nothing and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.909
 here's one thing in the cube area 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 so this is about my skin 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.009
 And now let's move on to their care 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.990
 remedies your morning care story 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.210
 for the skin, I'll start here with such a tool and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.750
 which is called for the snout but if you don't 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.689
 seen or not heard what it is I 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.220
 did a separate video review on this 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.360
 I will leave a reference at the bottom 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.970
 so who is interested necessarily 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.890
 go see right I want to say 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.950
 that I still like her 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.369
 I use it every day very satisfied 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.740
 results in a few words if you 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.720
 don't know what it is i mean it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.790
 of essence 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.310
 a device for cleansing the skin and also for 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.140
 anti-aging changes then 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.880
 eat it not only cleans but also it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 massages the skin due to this goes 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.799
 rush of blood to the surface of the skin and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.210
 respectively, there is a production of collagen 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.540
 skin smoothes out 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.310
 and it becomes softer and smoother with 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.460
 for my moon i use this 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.360
 a scab from derma and maybe you already 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.010
 have seen 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.230
 I bought it so it cleared to find 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 and with such a blue line that is it 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.960
 for dry and for normal skin 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.390
 she goes is called inches and chondroitin 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.560
 cleanse will be a holon of cassettes that is with 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.800
 pink acid 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.390
 I usually wear one pumping on the moon lights 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.340
 means cleansing the face and usually leave 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.890
 funds on the skin while I brush my teeth so 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.140
 way does not seem to angle of damage during acid 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.540
 it penetrates the skin more deeply and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.490
 protecting this moisturizing effect me to 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 this at least seems to me he 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.210
 more powerful since all such means 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.530
 on the skin remains for a long time 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.440
 the following means after we i 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.980
 Clean your face I do not use any more 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.250
 than in terms of cleansing that is if i 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.850
 good to clean the skin in the evening then to me 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.310
 principle no longer need to clear on 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.740
 I do not use thin and usually I 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.040
 I pass now to such a serum and 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.540
 there is serum with vitamin c in me 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.910
 by the way plans to do a separate review 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.750
 on her if anyone is interested 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.900
 subscribe to the channel 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.470
 do it later I mean to her already 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.710
 I use somewhere two or three weeks 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.830
 so I put this serum on dry 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.780
 skin literally give a few there 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.500
 seconds soak so here 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.480
 looks like a bottle here pipette i'm her 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.480
 keep by the way in this packaging in order 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.230
 to 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.939
 protect from color from sunlight 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.219
 after I have it literally 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.079
 imbibed with it probably leaves 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.099
 just a few seconds she is very 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.799
 absorbs quickly 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.280
 depending on the needs of your skin 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.200
 if i have any rashes then i 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.870
 I use just such a serum that's it 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:18.600
 serum from the cavity Choice 2% 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.090
 2 percent strength acid adore this 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.970
 the product also seems to review 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.759
 very very strongly in pretty and 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.479
 I think that this is exactly the product he does not 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.220
 helped fight my rash if u 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.280
 my skin feels fine and 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.500
 rash of me as if I don’t have that 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.310
 I pass immediately to the day cream 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.919
 guilty cream at the moment i use 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.080
 cream from the company an inch and now 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.509
 I have several of them and I am 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.970
 I pretty much want more 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:54.000
 experiment with other creams and 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.030
 sera later that is like water 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.720
 taking advantage of what i have now 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.289
 We will find this cream 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.650
 one percent alpha linden dreams mean 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:10.680
 this cream it is just meant for 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.180
 to make your skin more elastic 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.639
 for moisturizing and for skin regeneration and 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.270
 I like the only thing I want to say 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.400
 what if your skin is very very dry then 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.209
 most likely you will not be enough 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.649
 moisture 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:30.129
 I think that this cream will not give you 

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:31.749
 sufficient moisture I noticed that in 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.129
 those moments when I had very skin 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:35.199
 strong I had to 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.849
 use something else on top because 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.909
 that a few hours later I turned 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:43.379
 skin that's just not enough moisture started 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:45.279
 even like to have girls 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.679
 combination skin or oily skin 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:50.139
 this cream seems to me very much 

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:53.979
 good to come because as I say 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.240
 Here he does not give this fat and he does not 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:00.689
 overloads the skin after i 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.539
 used moisturizer i turn 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:06.519
 cream with aids protection 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:10.929
 then this step I basically doubt 

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:13.330
 never miss probably us for 

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:15.490
 last few years of this on 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.019
 principle did not happen at the moment i 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.309
 use means two creams and y1 

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:24.519
 desert essence in such a green 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:28.899
 wrapping it goes for sensitive and 

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:32.559
 it sp for dry skin is only 15 and 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:35.079
 2 otmaochil Dima City class which 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:40.449
 called sunset aspect 28 

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:43.959
 with coconut smell usually means this me 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:47.289
 I use in those days when the weather is not very 

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:49.240
 it's hot and i know i won't be 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.519
 much sun and this cream since 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.079
 he look for protection a little higher I 

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:56.800
 used those days when i know to 

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:59.409
 being on the street a little longer and when I 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.199
 need more protection by the way here 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:06.069
 this one here cream it goes for for all types 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:06.729
 skin and including for combination 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.089
 skin 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.319
 these creams I really like you especially 

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:13.749
 this desert essence 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:16.919
 he gives extra moisture to my 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:19.019
 I have several skins 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:21.429
 sunscreen that was bought 

00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:23.550
 natural so let's say that's why I 

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:26.589
 I will also do a separate video now 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:31.169
 spring is coming on March 8 all 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:33.999
 by the way and with the last holiday on March 8 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:36.309
 that's why if someone plans here 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:40.930
 groove somewhere to go and the question will arise 

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:42.459
 what cream is protection buy i 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.379
 I will do a separate review 

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:47.499
 so who are interested in subscribing to 

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:49.029
 my channel to be aware of means 

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:54.309
 after i used these 

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:56.919
 creams i mean give time to it all 

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:59.499
 the case was absorbed and then already on ours or 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:04.709
 makeup either without makeup depending on 

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:04.709
 moods and if i have time
