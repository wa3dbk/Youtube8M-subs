to be unique to this generation because

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179 
to be unique to this generation because
our<00:01:03.480> parents<00:01:03.719> didn't<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.890> our

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
our parents didn't do this our

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
our parents didn't do this our
grandparents<00:01:05.760> didn't<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.360> why<00:01:06.630> why<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
grandparents didn't do this why why is
it<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.530> seeing<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.159> today's<00:01:08.520> day

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it that we're seeing this in today's day

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
it that we're seeing this in today's day
and<00:01:08.760> age<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.720> delayed<00:01:10.049> adulthood

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and age I think it's delayed adulthood

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380

we<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.400> hunger<00:01:12.000> Princeton

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
we have this hunger Princeton

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.880 
we have this hunger Princeton
gratification<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> doesn't<00:01:13.590> work

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.310 
gratification and when it doesn't work
our<00:01:14.490> parents<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:15.090> taking<00:01:15.270> us<00:01:15.540> back<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.140> one

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
our parents are taking us back so at one

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.440 
our parents are taking us back so at one
point<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> turn<00:01:17.369> 18<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.790> went

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
point I think when you turn 18 you went

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.270 
point I think when you turn 18 you went
to<00:01:18.540> college<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> join<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> military<00:01:19.860> or

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
to college or you join the military or

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.440 
to college or you join the military or
you<00:01:20.460> got<00:01:20.580> married<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> did<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.330> these

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you got married or you did all these

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
you got married or you did all these
things<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> moved

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
things and then that's kind of moved

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.670 
things and then that's kind of moved
back<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.850> maybe<00:01:24.119> 22<00:01:24.570> 23<00:01:25.020> depending<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.590> how

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
back to maybe 22 23 depending on how

challenges I think the key thing is to

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.710 
challenges I think the key thing is to
take<00:04:51.040> calculated<00:04:51.520> risks<00:04:51.700> in<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.480> face<00:04:52.690> of
