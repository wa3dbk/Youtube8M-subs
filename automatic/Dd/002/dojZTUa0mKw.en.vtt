00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.340

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.640
 quiet soul I need someone

 Take care of my village smurf sorry the unit 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.820
 of burned is what is his name 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.250
 Benedict 16 llull but if it is nothing more and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.020
 none other than Joseph Ratzinger dad 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.000
 the vicar of Christ the supreme 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.070
 pontiff of the universal church the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.410
 primacy of italy the archbishop 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.630
 Metropolitan of the province of Rome 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.820
 successor of the prince of the apostles the 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.770
 patriarch of the west the sovereign of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.600
 state of the vatican city and 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.790
 servant of the servants of Christ 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.310
 who brings it here do not tell me I do not 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.410
 say that among the 265 people who have 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.210
 occupied your position you decided to be the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.500
 fourth in throwing the towel true 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.990
 after having examined before God 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.659
 Repeatedly my conscience has arrived 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.810
 to the certainty that by old age 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.760
 I no longer have the strength to exercise 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.830
 properly the ministry 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.780
 or already but that about age was like 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.880
 to have said it before being elected 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.610
 I say because when they chose it I had 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.290
 78 years of compliments that made it 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
 in the fifth oldest dad at the moment 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.470
 of good choice but age 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.570
 it tightens na na and still one said uy 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.490
 if he's the oldest dad in history 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 because it will but more than a century ago if 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.900
 the medical advances of now lion 13 it 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.900
 he threw Dad's 25 years and went out with the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.250
 tennis ahead at 93 but the 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 thing is that before it was 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.300
 elected you already thought about retirement 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.280
 but despite the criticism he accepted that the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.020
 Cardinals will fight ahead as 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.120
 taking to dance to the fat one to the one of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.710
 pray now it was enough for him to try 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.050
 fill the space that Juan Pablo second 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.850
 had left mission similar to that of 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.500
 stand on a stage to try to 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.180
 entertain the audience with a couple of 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.670
 maracas after a concert of 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.280
 youtube with all its paraphernalia maybe 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 if criticism of his appointment does not 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.290
 they were just for their age not also for their 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.180
 closeness to his predecessor yes and therefore everything 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.370
 he pointed out that he would only try to continue 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.380
 with the work of the Polish and keep their 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.250
 secrets instead of pushing reforms 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.070
 that the church needed 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.450
 to church and suddenly balls that you 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.190
 bust in the face the bomb of the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 pedophilia and it comes to light that when 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.970
 you were prefect of the congregation 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.130
 for the doctrine of faith he concealed the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.970
 abuses suffered by 200 deaf children in 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.500
 us at the hands of a priest and then we 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.720
 we learned that when he was archbishop in 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.670
 Germany authorized a priest to continue 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.470
 his work is that pastoral despite 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.230
 he had been expelled from the bishopric of 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.390
 essen for abusing minors is why 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.250
 that she better not even mention her position 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.410
 on issues such as AIDS, abortion, 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.120
 artificial fertilization the celibacy of 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.060
 cures the role of women in the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.590
 church euthanasia and homosexuality 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.090
 because in all the cases neither place gave 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.670
 discussion and kept the closed 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.170
 used so much so that it punished more to 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.420
 the progressive voices that to the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.459
 pedophiles yes and because the first 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.590
 they ended up expelled from the church already 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.080
 the latter as nothing more if he's 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.800
 condemned to withdraw from public life to 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.780
 withdraw from non-public public life 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.780
 not because the thing was to remove them from the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.820
 public life the case is that if still 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.950
 I said I'm leaving the church better 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.210
 of how I found it then low but the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.860
 cochinero in the ethical 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.750
 economically it is more present than 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.820
 never and being that you yourself had 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.830
 said in 2010 that a dad can 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.960
 resign in a moment of serenity but 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.030
 not in a moment of danger because as 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.450
 that when resigning it was wrong with own and 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.160
 strangers' no 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.780
 but he did what he did and now the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.870
 great question who will be the next 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.790
 dad yes yes yes because if the withdrawal was 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.950
 something that has been going on for a long time 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.989
 I guess he also fixed the stage 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.130
 so that the succession is as fast as 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.950
 possible not so things here between us 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.840
 who is the good no I can not good to 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.580
 see I give name is that such norberto 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.549
 rivera who norberto the veto no no me 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.830
 Archbishop of Mexico sounds not 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.489
 disque memory that is on the list 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.820
 of the 117 papables is not Ubico 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.650
 the little brunette 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.650
 and that looks like pedro picapiedra 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.260
 ah 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.930
 and already because in addition to thinking if it will be a 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.760
 Australian an African a 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.620
 Latin American or an Italian and that 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.110
 occupy your position it will be important to know 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.790
 What name do you choose if and why? 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.710
 that the prophecies say that the last 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.240
 dad will be called pedro you have to be a 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.610
 live and have a list of 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.760
 suggestions because if I were dad I 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.220
 nor would side or maybe not so 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.900
 I would already have sympathies gained because dad 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.990
 Smurf sounds good but it's not name 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:10.100
 Christian or maybe something eighties yes 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.940
 as for pareo or for power eo or for 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.990
 patita ea 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.070
 nobody remembers the neon group 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.740
 nicasio or what is going to put in the 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.570
 cineclub the flying doctor or other 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.820
 law that deals with or whoever is 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.530
 little doctor with that title I do not think 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.690
 that try a true submarine 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.580
 u and who is still angry because in the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.190
 double date it was the least graceful 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.960
 that in whom already the doctor to the 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.450
 next get one to which leave 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.700
 get out on the grass not because then 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.680
 is the movie is cool the doctor tries 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.510
 of a pilot who miraculously saves from 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.550
 crash to a plane loaded with 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.260
 passengers and the subsequent conflict that 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.110
 faces when each one comes to light 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.870
 detail of the incident to monkeys and who 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.380
 then the boy and conflicts come out or is 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.960
 the denzel washington not the gift chifli ya 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.240
 military friend knows iron man out 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.640
 doing the lawyer or strip strips and 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.160
 it even comes out with goldman or the 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.440
 very walter sobchak of the great law 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.600
 lebowski interpreting a kind of 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.580
 modern shaman who walks to the rhythm of 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.070
 best music of the movie then 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.169
 It's worth it if the doctor's story is 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.240
 very good the performance of al denzel is 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.840
 impeccable reason why it was worth a 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.389
 nomination 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.730
 search and address for robert zemeckis 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.530
 who knows something already to this business 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.330
 get the audience to stay 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.760
 captivated during the two hours with 18 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.919
 minute - long tape and is therefore 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.560
 eat a sandwich milestone of content not 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:38.380
 identifiable 2 grapes and three pieces of 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.540
 melon a bread miniature juice of oranges 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.960
 synthetic and a bag of peanuts 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:47.020
 he already knows plane food comes out there 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.570
 I fall then miss to make it more 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.260
 before I started the flight 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:57.150
 I would let you fasten it in your seat 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.150
 miss lady one that the
