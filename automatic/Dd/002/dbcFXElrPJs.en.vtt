00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:52.280
 We'll mix all the ingredients. 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.280
 in a jar as wide as love 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.890
 There are people who prefer to buy that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.729
 clear box that comes looking 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.729
 milk carton 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.810
 Who does not like honey? 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.040
 I even tried to find out if you can use sugar. 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.430
 brown 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:26.110
 if the person has some of the sub 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.160
 for disc recording is can use 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.000
 overcome car or even sweetener in 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.670
 powder 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.060
 It just has some sweeteners and leaves 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.370
 that taste with great taste 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.640
 understood then you have to know is to choose 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.459
 which of these products will be the ideal 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.280
 to your taste buds and then to the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.040
 shredded coconut without sugar 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.360
 it is easy to find and I have one 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.980
 little resistance to grated coconut 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.470
 conventional first one I think 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.280
 He has handbag powder soap and body 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.950
 report on sugar does not mean that I 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.019
 I chose this from my mother, that's why I 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.280
 I opted to add or the grated coconut 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.299
 fresh 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.620
 we will mix and heal until we 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.620
 very homogeneous study 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.049
 ready after we mix and stand 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.019
 that way then look what 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.370
 People are going to have a refractory or 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.689
 a tray 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.629
 one you prefer you can use the oil of 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.390
 coconut and I counted on a gasoline 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.879
 I put very little margarine for the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.280
 tray and let's make bread type balls 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.920
 of cheese 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.299
 Now we'll make the balls for you. 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.310
 You want to make square put in 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.319
 Docs, no problem, no. 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.629
 I'll make balls like it's a 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:08.540
 cheese bread or brigadeiro cheese 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:10.150
 understood lightweight as well because I think 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.200
 When I went to the oven 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.650
 she will be very cute 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:23.030
 It's always good to be careful she does not 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:28.030
 made with pasta of brigadier is not that 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.699
 he stays garranah mother she looks good 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.560
 Then you have to have a 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:40.580
 delicacy and then we 'll put in the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:43.580
 oven for approximately 15 minutes or 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:49.220
 until golden started began to brown 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:51.199
 you can turn it off 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.250
 now that all the 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.770
 marbles 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.449
 We are going to take to the oven is something that 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.210
 I stopped talking, it's important that the 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.940
 oven is preheated that already 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.870
 facilitates the cooking process of the 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.470
 knock 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.470

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.860
