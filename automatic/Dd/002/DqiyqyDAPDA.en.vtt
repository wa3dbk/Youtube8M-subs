00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.530
 something weird easy 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 of what saves me fag but 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.270

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:01.420
 I do is that it is something that does not have time 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.690

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.640

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:06.740

 but it is that the court is like 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.969
