00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello friends, I promised to show 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.160
 rain in california but here rain here is a puddle 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.169
 here is the office plaza where we are here our office 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.589
 there are clouds well what else will you show 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:24.900
 trees stand students stand they 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.289
 they are somehow not intelligent stand 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.560
 we are not allowed this smoking is expected 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.980
 what the weekend is coming 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.660
 Friday is Friday night 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 saturday with some sunday 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.690
 a serious storm will be a lot of water will leak 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690
 and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.460
 lay out the high pressure area here 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.610
 she didn't let the mountain 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.170
 rain clouds in us here without mushrooms 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.530
 stayed this year but even so 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.269
 storm which will pass over the weekend 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 the amount of water she needs somewhere 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.659
 reaches 30 percent what is from 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 of what you need therefore no matter how 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.860
 solves some global problems with 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 water but anyway some here 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.149
 not global can be solve some 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.090
 deferment gives for more complex problems 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.860
 look in the mountains in themselves somewhere in there 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 one and a half to two times more precipitation falls 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.909
 than here, but it is clear they sort of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.100
 stand in the way of these clouds and this too 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.170
 important because when it snows there is 100 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.479
 id he goes too i will vault and so 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 further, that is, let us hope that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.690
 all the way and you for a long time 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.700
 california 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.869
 and that is, you saw a little rain judging 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.840
 because I saw it there is practically no 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.470
 because we are waiting even for this scum 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.819
 where they call the rain so well you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.849
 how old i am three months 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.709

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.300
 Minsk Belarus as there in Minsk from 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.910
 Belarus with rain 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.270
 there in this period always if not snow 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.060

 this boy is with him too 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.340
 he is with him all the time that is so people 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.950
 likes boys different understandable but in this 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.960
 there were rains in the fall just before 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.480
 leaving no just before leaving u 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.670
 we were golden autumn warm and without 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.450
 the rains are not very very very golden 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.080
 autumn rains have mushrooms so I do not mushroom 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.330
 that's what nothing can say so and you 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.310
 from where 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.160
 oh Chersky 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.380
 well listen so embroider say something 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.000
 You know, the recordings have not seen everything yet. 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.070
 already say listen know what 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.860
 obviously channel is interesting because something like this a 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.800
 how do i watch a holiday here give me 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.470
 so they screamed everyone says how could you 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.390
 In general, this is a good and corrupt 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.070
 some plundering event 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.190
 countries and there and very negative 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.170
 the ratio of I honestly did not expect well 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.390
 as if from the side but more rosy I 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.540
 probably you can compose 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.959
 say that there is no event this 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.570
 good good she will patina lead 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.250
 here before the world is not well dude start-up 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.530
 tv it will look like summer on 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.640
 fine but for the Sochi residents themselves 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.040
 of course a disaster 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.799
 Well, not that there happened that the city 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.600
 completely destroyed it was quiet like 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.700
 the city I would now yeah dirt no light 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.510
 no water and so on give why 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.410
 no water bought years all these are outdated 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.660
 plumbing money under their 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.580
 stood out for them to fix the ball 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.800
 money like we usually disappeared somewhere 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.660
 if they didn't touch everything would be fine but 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.690
 since this is our dream he has already rotted 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.740
 but it is necessary to fix not repaired done 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.200
 because what are subordinate 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.730
 that is to say roughly touched interesting 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.650
 people who just Angelou you no one 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.420
 touch but well well and something 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.340
 in which spent left in the city already 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.130
 the dish got i 'm not taking it 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.410
 on foot, but I realized there was no money. 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.230
 to repair roads for landscaping so on 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.120
 and and repaired the roads made it green but 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.120
 repaired as we love that is, asphalt 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.160
 laying on a wet surface what if 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.990
 didn't hold it hoists and so on i mean 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.230
 money spent on the result 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.230
 practically 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.740
 that is, for residents a small holiday 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.930
 small holiday at the moment 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:41.900
 as far as I know yesterday 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:46.430
 before fully and here in this talk about 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.050
 that is, well, really bad there is not complete 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.050
 q how was this time when people arrived 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:58.940
 it's kind of petty 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:05:02.750
 part of what the close objects are facades 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.280
 beautiful 3 of course there are shortcomings then 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.529
 there are walk around beautifully in the city and there 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.149
 all but if the drop wants 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.149
 the other side is not very 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.179
 Well it you will observe whether 5 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.559
 or shoot down open it look 

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:20.139
 I want it all the more guys say 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:23.289
 beautiful did not see can I see not 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.080
 saw i look at look now mine 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.059
 the impression was that the comments 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.619
 If on Russian television and article 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.889
 by American it might be something else 

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:34.809
 it turned out but I looked at the Russian and 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.059
 comment was very politicized i 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:40.569
 would say that all the same this is not very 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:42.039
 political world buddy but closed 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.969
 there were inappropriate comments addressed to 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:47.830
 some countries secondly significant 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.379
 part of the sight it was political 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.389
 the figures who stood there in the stands and 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.159
 so on then there are somehow so you 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.779
 perceived political context 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:01.749
 kept there with couples holiday sports yes 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:04.779
 Thank you said that here is the version of Russia 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:06.399
 ready to slide remember live recording 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.439
 already corrected that is aground 

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:10.659
 another version came to download and 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:13.599
 watch this rumors i can't say i 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.580
 I watched how I started and beads 14 not 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.469
 twist records could twist straight 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.839
 I do not have a broadcast in the morning to face 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.699

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.909
 I tell the truth or not Well friends 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.559
 then from the Olympic snow in Sochi 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:29.319
 back to the rain 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:32.579
 which could be snow because what 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:37.089
 it's raining friends it's like 

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:40.209
 broken off and the snow failed here 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:42.999

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:46.689

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:56.430
 this ice can be ice like 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.430
 does not see the road
