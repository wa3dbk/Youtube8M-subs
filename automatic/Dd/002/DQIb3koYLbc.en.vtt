00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
running fixed up idols pretty good now

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.770 
running fixed up idols pretty good now
once<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.840> warmed<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.970> then<00:01:35.970> doing<00:01:36.479> some

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
once it's warmed up and then doing some

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
once it's warmed up and then doing some
research<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.680> actually<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.189> issue<00:01:38.340> with

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
research and it's actually an issue with

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.429 
research and it's actually an issue with
the<00:01:38.729> spiked<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.689> cold<00:01:39.869> blooded<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the spiked it's a little cold blooded it

have<00:02:36.800> enough<00:02:37.040> power<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.580> fifth<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.060> put

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
have enough power and fifth if I put

have enough power and fifth if I put
enough<00:02:38.480> put<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.050> 15<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.769> front<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.360> am

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
enough put a 15 on the front but I am

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.410 
enough put a 15 on the front but I am
actually<00:02:41.810> thinking<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.620> one<00:02:43.610> taller<00:02:43.970> on

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
actually thinking of going one taller on

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.090 
actually thinking of going one taller on
the<00:02:44.450> front<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:46.690> maybe<00:02:47.690> two<00:02:48.500> taller<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
the front and maybe two taller on the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.710 
the front and maybe two taller on the
rear<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:51.670> keep<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.790> little<00:02:52.970> bit<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.209> power<00:02:53.450> there

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
rear so keep a little bit of power there

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.210 
rear so keep a little bit of power there
but<00:02:54.019> gained<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> little<00:02:54.739> bit<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.950> top-end

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
but gained a little bit of top-end

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.570 
but gained a little bit of top-end
because<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.030> quite<00:02:56.769> quite<00:02:57.769> peppy<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.280> first

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
because it is quite quite peppy in first

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.660 
because it is quite quite peppy in first
gear<00:03:00.580> I'd<00:03:01.580> fire<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.120> up<00:03:02.239> now<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:03.130> no<00:03:04.130> gas<00:03:04.310> tank

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
gear I'd fire it up now but no gas tank

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.970 
gear I'd fire it up now but no gas tank
on<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.180> it'd<00:03:05.239> be<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.450> little<00:03:05.660> difficult<00:03:07.570> but

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
on it so it'd be a little difficult but

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.520 
on it so it'd be a little difficult but
yeah<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.660> work<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.690> progress<00:03:12.049> it's

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
yeah it's a work in progress it's

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.780 
yeah it's a work in progress it's
getting<00:03:12.799> there<00:03:12.829> doesn't<00:03:13.489> really<00:03:13.610> need

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
getting there doesn't really need

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.840 
getting there doesn't really need
anything<00:03:14.239> major<00:03:14.450> but<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:15.430> we<00:03:16.430> just<00:03:16.549> want<00:03:16.790> to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
anything major but that we just want to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.220 
anything major but that we just want to
make<00:03:16.940> sure<00:03:17.000> everything<00:03:17.570> on<00:03:17.750> it's<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.049> good

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230
