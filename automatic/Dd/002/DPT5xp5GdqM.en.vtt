get an idea of how well it's playing I
mean<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.930> did<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.079> benchmark<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
mean I did a little benchmark and it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
mean I did a little benchmark and it
goes<00:00:56.430> anywhere<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:57.059> 35<00:00:57.690> frames<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.140> second<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
goes anywhere from 35 frames a second to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
about 60 frames a second right now I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.180 
about 60 frames a second right now I
would<00:01:01.379> venture<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> say<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.039> probably

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
would venture to say it's probably

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
up all the way the only thing that i

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.600 
up all the way the only thing that i
scaled<00:02:37.290> down<00:02:37.350> was<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.709> textures<00:02:38.250> i<00:02:38.430> took

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
scaled down was the textures i took

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.009 
scaled down was the textures i took
those<00:02:38.760> two<00:02:38.970> medium<00:02:39.330> rather<00:02:39.540> than<00:02:39.750> large

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
those two medium rather than large

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.990 
those two medium rather than large
although<00:02:40.950> i<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.250> taken<00:02:41.519> them<00:02:41.610> up<00:02:41.640> too<00:02:41.790> large

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
although i have taken them up too large

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.729 
although i have taken them up too large
and<00:02:42.390> too<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.560> test<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.610> looked<00:02:44.850> like

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
and too just a test and it looked like

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.500 
and too just a test and it looked like
the<00:02:46.739> frame<00:02:46.980> frame<00:02:47.430> per<00:02:47.640> second<00:02:48.000> drop<00:02:48.150> was<00:02:48.360> only

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
the frame frame per second drop was only

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.680 
the frame frame per second drop was only
three<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.440> wasn't<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.769> much<00:02:49.860> at<00:02:50.130> all<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:51.480> this

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
three it wasn't that much at all on this

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.290 
three it wasn't that much at all on this
particular<00:02:52.650> part<00:02:53.190> i've<00:02:53.850> run<00:02:54.060> through<00:02:54.239> it

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
particular part i've run through it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.199 
particular part i've run through it
before<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.660> i<00:02:54.750> got<00:02:54.959> roughly<00:02:55.880> 40<00:02:56.880> frames<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
before and i got roughly 40 frames a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.800 
before and i got roughly 40 frames a
second<00:02:57.630> 35<00:02:58.350> 40<00:02:58.650> frames<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.100> it's<00:02:59.810> really

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
second 35 40 frames so it's really

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.150 
second 35 40 frames so it's really
really<00:03:01.319> darn<00:03:01.709> good<00:03:02.040> I'm<00:03:02.430> impressed<00:03:02.959> early<00:03:03.959> I

of<00:05:13.880> be<00:05:14.030> overall<00:05:14.449> playability<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.470> gave<00:05:16.370> it<00:05:16.490> to

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
of be overall playability I gave it to

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.670 
of be overall playability I gave it to
be<00:05:16.669> because<00:05:16.910> there<00:05:17.660> are<00:05:17.810> parts<00:05:18.169> that<00:05:18.260> have<00:05:18.650> a

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
be because there are parts that have a

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.210 
be because there are parts that have a
lot<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.860> grass<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.220> tend<00:05:19.729> to<00:05:19.789> be<00:05:19.880> problematic

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
lot of grass that tend to be problematic

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.379 
lot of grass that tend to be problematic
the<00:05:22.220> more<00:05:22.400> crafts<00:05:22.639> you<00:05:22.820> have<00:05:22.940> in<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.150> game

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
the more crafts you have in this game

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.990 
the more crafts you have in this game
the<00:05:23.600> frame<00:05:23.840> rate<00:05:24.050> dropped<00:05:24.289> as<00:05:24.440> low<00:05:24.470> as<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:25.000> eight

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
the frame rate dropped as low as a eight

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.490 
the frame rate dropped as low as a eight
frames<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.419> second<00:05:26.780> for<00:05:26.930> me<00:05:26.990> at<00:05:27.080> one<00:05:27.199> point<00:05:27.229> in

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
frames a second for me at one point in

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.469 
frames a second for me at one point in
time<00:05:27.530> but<00:05:27.860> that's<00:05:28.639> not<00:05:28.850> really<00:05:29.030> saying<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.360> lot

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
time but that's not really saying a lot

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.050 
time but that's not really saying a lot
because<00:05:29.539> on<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.930> macbook<00:05:30.139> pro<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:31.400> same<00:05:31.639> area

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
because on the macbook pro the same area

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.420 
because on the macbook pro the same area
the<00:05:32.990> frame<00:05:33.199> rate<00:05:33.380> dropped<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.680> 16<00:05:34.070> frames<00:05:34.280> a

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
the frame rate dropped to 16 frames a

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.129 
the frame rate dropped to 16 frames a
second<00:05:34.699> so<00:05:34.850> it<00:05:34.940> wasn't<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.300> much<00:05:35.419> lower<00:05:36.850> but

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
second so it wasn't that much lower but

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.360 
second so it wasn't that much lower but
yeah<00:05:39.139> like<00:05:39.289> I<00:05:39.380> said<00:05:39.590> I<00:05:39.620> gave<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:39.949> game<00:05:40.070> of<00:05:40.220> B

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370
