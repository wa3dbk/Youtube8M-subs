00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.809
 the identity that also gives you the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.000
 gastronomy the idiosyncrasy has to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:05.299
 see with cultural facts with customs 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.140
 different things like for example a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.569
 plant that is dedicated to recycling everything 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.280
