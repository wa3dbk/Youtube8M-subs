00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
I like that they put a good bit of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
I like that they put a good bit of
detail<00:01:15.600> into<00:01:15.900> him<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.890> did<00:01:17.070> make<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
detail into him and they did make it to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.969 
detail into him and they did make it to
where<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> minifig<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.689> ride<00:01:19.020> him<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
where a minifig can ride him so you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.859 
where a minifig can ride him so you
can't<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.400> put<00:01:20.670> Harry<00:01:20.909> Potter<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.270> there

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.740

let's see the feet down there so he's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
let's see the feet down there so he's
really<00:01:30.869> cool<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:34.100> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.640> old<00:01:36.000> style<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
really cool and this is the old style of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.219 
really cool and this is the old style of
Dement<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> old<00:01:39.689> ones<00:01:39.990> were

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
Dement or you can see the old ones were

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.560 
Dement or you can see the old ones were
green<00:01:40.890> instead<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.579> gray<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> new<00:01:42.329> ones

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
green instead of gray like the new ones

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
green instead of gray like the new ones
and<00:01:43.250> then<00:01:44.250> these<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> old<00:01:45.329> bodies<00:01:46.490> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and then these are the old bodies and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.980 
and then these are the old bodies and
see<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> arms<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.299> attached<00:01:48.659> differently

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
see the arms are attached differently

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.969 
see the arms are attached differently
completely<00:01:51.990> different<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.470> than<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> new

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
completely different on than the new

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.569 
completely different on than the new
ones<00:01:54.409> honestly<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> old<00:01:56.040> Dementors

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
ones honestly I like the old Dementors

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.800 
ones honestly I like the old Dementors
better<00:01:56.880> than<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.570> new<00:01:57.689> ones<00:01:58.700> however<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.630> old

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
better than the new ones however the old

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.469 
better than the new ones however the old
ones<00:02:01.110> didn't<00:02:01.469> come<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> stand<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
ones didn't come with a stand like the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.480 
ones didn't come with a stand like the
new<00:02:03.600> ones<00:02:03.810> do<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.280> try<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
new ones do so you just have to try to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.039 
new ones do so you just have to try to
get<00:02:05.700> them<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.969> stand<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.540> little<00:02:06.750> piece

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
get them to stand on this little piece

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.999 
get them to stand on this little piece
here<00:02:07.940> which<00:02:09.080> sometimes<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.410> pain<00:02:10.619> I've

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here which sometimes can be a pain I've

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.390 
here which sometimes can be a pain I've
had<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> little<00:02:11.340> practice<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
had a little practice at that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.760 
had a little practice at that
here<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.540> tower<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770

here is the tower that you get in the
set<00:02:16.980> though<00:02:17.360> which<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.810> kind<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.080> cool

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
