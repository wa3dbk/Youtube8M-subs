 made a hole 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.090

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:28.340
 eight centimeters ok 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:30.380
 and here I did the following one plate 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.160
 with aluminum coming loose on 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.370
 to which it releases an aluminum plate and 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.550
 an inside reinforcement out here 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.460
 other reinforcement than the screw where 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.840
 I learned this shine plate upon 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.840
 exalted 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.900

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.370
 the engine that engine 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.370
 I went on an aluminum plate 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:06.530
 in loup along with the antenna path 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 I learned that I drilled with a drill 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:23.300
 and it holds you know if you can see 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:23.300
 in with screws and a plate - s 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:33.770
 and here I made a sales tip where 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:43.430
 will get in the pipe here and try to show 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:46.790
 for you underneath as funk I can 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:54.820
 demonstrate everything I think I do not know if it is 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:02:00.530
 giving you to see who we are going now 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 I get that I put the grid 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.040
 I come here in a row 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.080
 just did not reflect 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.080
 to set big here 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.959
 Ok, it turned on 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.910
 we have reduced this function but 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.150
 one as well as one works 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.210
 the movement is this 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.210
 the tour 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.750
 only you have the help team 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.750
 for power 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.560
