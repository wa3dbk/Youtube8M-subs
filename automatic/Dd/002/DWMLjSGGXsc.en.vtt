00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
we've made the game we've also have a

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.430 
we've made the game we've also have a
number<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.640> special<00:02:11.880> blocks<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.690> teachers

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
number of special blocks that teachers

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.520 
number of special blocks that teachers
can<00:02:13.530> add<00:02:14.120> into<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.210> game<00:02:15.420> world<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:16.050> control

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
can add into the game world to control

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.740 
can add into the game world to control
what<00:02:16.650> their<00:02:16.800> students<00:02:17.100> can<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:17.430> can't<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.880> for

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
what their students can or can't do for

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.800 
what their students can or can't do for
example<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.350> have<00:02:19.590> border<00:02:20.340> blocks<00:02:20.610> if<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
example we have border blocks if the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.210 
example we have border blocks if the
teachers<00:02:22.140> want<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> prevent<00:02:22.650> their<00:02:22.860> students

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
teachers want to prevent their students

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
teachers want to prevent their students
from<00:02:23.490> going<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> certain<00:02:24.330> area<00:02:24.630> they<00:02:25.200> lay

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
from going to a certain area they lay

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.870 
from going to a certain area they lay
down<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> bunch<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.920> border<00:02:26.220> blocks<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.730> then

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
down a bunch of border blocks and then

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.220 
down a bunch of border blocks and then
the<00:02:26.970> students<00:02:27.300> will<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.720> able<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.960> cross

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the students will not be able to cross

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.590 
the students will not be able to cross
them<00:02:28.560> they<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.700> things<00:02:29.910> like<00:02:30.120> change<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
them they can do things like change the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.230 
them they can do things like change the
spawn<00:02:30.870> point<00:02:31.170> or<00:02:31.410> set<00:02:31.830> up<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.100> teleport<00:02:32.790> system

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
spawn point or set up a teleport system

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.510 
spawn point or set up a teleport system
so<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.410> these<00:02:34.500> teleport<00:02:35.040> blocks<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
so we have these teleport blocks a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.350 
so we have these teleport blocks a
teacher<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:36.090> drop<00:02:36.840> down<00:02:37.140> they<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:38.330> they<00:02:39.330> can

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
teacher can drop down they can they can

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.240 
teacher can drop down they can they can
name<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.020> they<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.620> name<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.860> whatever<00:02:40.950> they

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
name this they can name it whatever they

name this they can name it whatever they
want<00:02:41.459> save<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.450> then<00:02:42.570> they<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.870> use<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
want save it and then they can use it to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.050 
want save it and then they can use it to
teleport<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.950> other<00:02:44.130> teleport<00:02:44.670> blocks<00:02:44.910> around

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
teleport to other teleport blocks around

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.790 
teleport to other teleport blocks around
the<00:02:45.270> world<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.930> at<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> moment<00:02:46.320> we're<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.680> a

teachers<00:03:23.510> write<00:03:24.510> as<00:03:24.630> much<00:03:24.840> text<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.350> they<00:03:25.500> want

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
teachers write as much text as they want

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.340 
teachers write as much text as they want
and<00:03:25.950> get<00:03:26.610> their<00:03:26.910> content<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.630> their<00:03:27.810> subject

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
and get their content get their subject

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.949 
and get their content get their subject
matter<00:03:28.410> into<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.130> game<00:03:29.340> world<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.480> we<00:03:30.600> have<00:03:30.750> a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
matter into the game world so we have a

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.660 
matter into the game world so we have a
ton<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.320> features<00:03:31.620> like<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.519> big

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
ton of features like this but the big

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.610 
ton of features like this but the big
point<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.690> really<00:03:33.780> easy<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.410> get

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
point is that it's really easy to get

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.130 
point is that it's really easy to get
going<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.130> started<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.760> we're<00:03:36.269> working<00:03:36.630> on<00:03:36.750> a

going get started and we're working on a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.550 
going get started and we're working on a
very<00:03:37.769> large<00:03:38.070> library<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.790> content<00:03:39.320> we<00:03:40.320> want

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.340 
me increase my speed so we get there a
little<00:04:16.890> quicker<00:04:17.190> I'm<00:04:18.150> going<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.450> turn<00:04:19.140> on

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
little quicker I'm going to turn on

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.590 
little quicker I'm going to turn on
building<00:04:19.860> mode<00:04:20.180> I'm<00:04:21.180> going<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.360> turn<00:04:21.480> on

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
building mode I'm going to turn on

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.240 
building mode I'm going to turn on
long-distance<00:04:22.049> building<00:04:22.740> i'm<00:04:22.890> also<00:04:23.070> going<00:04:23.190> to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
long-distance building i'm also going to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.570 
long-distance building i'm also going to
turn<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.610> our<00:04:23.940> fill<00:04:24.450> tool<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.740> can<00:04:25.860> let<00:04:26.490> me

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
turn on our fill tool and you can let me

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.100 
turn on our fill tool and you can let me
get<00:04:26.700> some<00:04:26.850> blocks<00:04:27.090> here<00:04:27.860> get<00:04:28.860> some<00:04:29.040> wood<00:04:30.110> i'll

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
get some blocks here get some wood i'll

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.770 
get some blocks here get some wood i'll
do<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.380> search

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.350 

so<00:04:36.590> with<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.400> with<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.700> fill<00:04:38.030> tool<00:04:38.300> lon<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:40.360> can

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
so with the with the fill tool lon I can

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.190 
so with the with the fill tool lon I can
very<00:04:41.930> quickly<00:04:42.670> block<00:04:43.670> out<00:04:43.850> areas<00:04:44.419> that<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.930> I

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
very quickly block out areas that the I

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.490 
very quickly block out areas that the I
want<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.070> my<00:04:46.850> players<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.270> play<00:04:47.510> in<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.440> can

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
want to my players to play in so I can

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:01.519 
want to my players to play in so I can
do<00:04:51.680> things<00:04:51.919> like<00:04:52.100> this<00:04:54.190> whoops

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.069 

so<00:05:02.069> you<00:05:02.129> can<00:05:02.219> see<00:05:02.339> it's<00:05:02.459> very<00:05:02.519> easy<00:05:03.029> it's<00:05:03.989> very

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:04.079 
so you can see it's very easy it's very

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:07.249 
so you can see it's very easy it's very
quick<00:05:04.439> and<00:05:04.589> easy<00:05:04.739> to<00:05:04.979> create<00:05:05.639> structures<00:05:06.359> so

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
quick and easy to create structures so

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.839 
quick and easy to create structures so
the<00:05:07.409> idea<00:05:07.529> is<00:05:07.739> most<00:05:08.099> teachers<00:05:08.489> don't<00:05:08.519> have<00:05:08.789> the

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
the idea is most teachers don't have the

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.479 
the idea is most teachers don't have the
time<00:05:09.059> to<00:05:09.119> create<00:05:09.599> these<00:05:09.949> intricate<00:05:10.949> world's

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:11.489 
time to create these intricate world's

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:14.389 
time to create these intricate world's
block<00:05:12.059> by<00:05:12.239> block<00:05:12.389> by<00:05:12.629> block<00:05:12.779> but<00:05:13.529> by<00:05:13.739> using<00:05:13.769> our

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:14.399 
block by block by block but by using our

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:18.469 
block by block by block but by using our
building<00:05:14.969> tools<00:05:15.769> it<00:05:17.029> simplifies<00:05:18.029> the<00:05:18.209> whole

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
building tools it simplifies the whole

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.539 
building tools it simplifies the whole
process<00:05:18.719> it<00:05:19.109> makes<00:05:19.289> it<00:05:19.409> a<00:05:19.469> lot<00:05:19.589> faster<00:05:19.889> to<00:05:20.399> get

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:20.549 
process it makes it a lot faster to get

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:23.779 
process it makes it a lot faster to get
their<00:05:21.119> content<00:05:21.689> into<00:05:22.019> the<00:05:22.109> game<00:05:22.579> so<00:05:23.579> we're

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
their content into the game so we're

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.219 
their content into the game so we're
doing<00:05:23.909> a<00:05:24.119> lot<00:05:24.269> to<00:05:24.569> work<00:05:24.839> with<00:05:24.869> different

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
doing a lot to work with different

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.739 
doing a lot to work with different
teachers<00:05:25.679> all<00:05:25.919> over<00:05:25.949> the<00:05:26.249> world<00:05:26.399> to<00:05:27.179> kind<00:05:27.689> of
