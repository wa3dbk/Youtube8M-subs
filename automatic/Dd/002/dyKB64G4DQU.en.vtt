00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.760 

so<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.560> limit<00:01:11.460> alarm<00:01:12.060> run<00:01:12.510> alarm<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.650> when

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
so we got limit alarm run alarm is when

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.289 
so we got limit alarm run alarm is when
I<00:01:13.799> beat<00:01:14.130> swing<00:01:14.430> limit<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> where<00:01:15.119> that's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
I beat swing limit is where that's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.820 
I beat swing limit is where that's
clipping<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.130> roses<00:01:17.130> pair<00:01:17.390> their<00:01:18.390> game<00:01:18.869> low

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
clipping and roses pair their game low

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.060 
clipping and roses pair their game low
freeing<00:01:20.159> C<00:01:20.369> pass<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:23.240> your<00:01:24.240> bass<00:01:24.450> boost

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
freeing C pass so your bass boost

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.450 
freeing C pass so your bass boost
frequency<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.460> boost<00:01:27.030> volume<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
frequency your boost volume and then the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.429 
frequency your boost volume and then the
control<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.390> controls<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.079> big

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
control that controls you know how big

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
control that controls you know how big
of<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.590> bush<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.340> narrow<00:01:32.579> or

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
of a bush you know if it's narrow or

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.350 
of a bush you know if it's narrow or
wide<00:01:34.130> clip<00:01:35.130> limit<00:01:37.759> basically<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> stops<00:01:39.180> am

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
wide clip limit basically that stops am

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.850 
wide clip limit basically that stops am
far<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> stalling<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> it's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
far from the stalling so you it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.600 
far from the stalling so you it's
basically<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.850> Diddy<00:01:42.150> wonders<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:43.610> this

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
basically what Diddy wonders for this

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.210 
basically what Diddy wonders for this
Empire<00:01:45.030> does<00:01:45.270> itself<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.740> doesn't<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> require

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
Empire does itself it doesn't it require

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.270 
Empire does itself it doesn't it require
it<00:01:47.700> basically<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.750> keep<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:50.130> can

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it basically if you keep this on you can

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.639 
it basically if you keep this on you can
turn<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> game<00:01:50.729> pull<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.530> will

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
turn the game pull that out and you will

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.789 
turn the game pull that out and you will
get<00:01:52.710> no<00:01:53.009> more<00:01:53.189> parent<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.799> then

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
get no more parent of this here then

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.380 
get no more parent of this here then
what<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.299> had<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.899> know

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
what you would do if you had you know

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.020 
what you would do if you had you know
there's<00:02:00.390> no<00:02:00.540> way<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:00.990> power<00:02:01.350> than

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
there's no way you get more power than

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.039 
there's no way you get more power than
what<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> should<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:06.049> it's

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
what it you should get out of it so it's

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.469 
what it you should get out of it so it's
the<00:02:07.110> best<00:02:07.350> example<00:02:07.500> would<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:09.179> Empire

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the best example would be the Empire

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.480 
the best example would be the Empire
that's<00:02:09.690> 2,000<00:02:10.259> watts<00:02:10.440> normal<00:02:12.379> 20

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's 2,000 watts normal 20

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.940 
that's 2,000 watts normal 20
what's<00:02:14.210> clipping<00:02:14.660> that's<00:02:15.260> not<00:02:15.470> good<00:02:15.710> it's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
what's clipping that's not good it's

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.240 
what's clipping that's not good it's
just<00:02:16.040> distorted<00:02:16.700> sound<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.230> song<00:02:18.470> it's

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
just distorted sound so this song it's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.700 
just distorted sound so this song it's
gonna<00:02:19.430> give<00:02:19.640> out<00:02:19.760> its<00:02:19.970> 3,500<00:02:20.630> walk<00:02:22.420> that's<00:02:23.420> it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
gonna give out its 3,500 walk that's it

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.070 
gonna give out its 3,500 walk that's it
but<00:02:24.710> that'll<00:02:25.010> be<00:02:25.040> clean<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.780> no<00:02:26.780> matter<00:02:26.960> how

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
but that'll be clean and no matter how

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.450 
but that'll be clean and no matter how
much<00:02:27.230> she<00:02:27.470> turn<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.770> gain<00:02:27.920> up<00:02:27.950> above<00:02:28.250> that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
much she turn the gain up above that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.770 
much she turn the gain up above that
it's<00:02:28.880> not<00:02:29.030> gonna<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:29.210> above<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.570> because

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
it's not gonna go above that because

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.180 
it's not gonna go above that because
he'll<00:02:30.020> just<00:02:30.080> limit<00:02:30.470> itself<00:02:30.680> Marie<00:02:30.920> itself

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
he'll just limit itself Marie itself

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.350 
he'll just limit itself Marie itself
back<00:02:31.340> him<00:02:31.820> it's<00:02:32.600> like<00:02:33.160> best<00:02:34.160> example<00:02:34.550> be<00:02:34.730> boses

fuses and a milk glass fuses and when
you<00:02:39.170> push<00:02:39.380> them<00:02:39.500> too<00:02:39.650> hard<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.950> glass<00:02:40.220> fuse

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
you push them too hard the glass fuse

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.920 
you push them too hard the glass fuse
will<00:02:40.640> line<00:02:40.820> up<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.210> stop<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.600> from<00:02:41.690> learning

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
will line up and stop you from learning

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.750 
will line up and stop you from learning
the<00:02:42.080> damage<00:02:42.380> basically<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.310> same<00:02:43.460> as<00:02:43.610> what's

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the damage basically the same as what's

the damage basically the same as what's
on<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.060> now<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.930> got<00:02:45.760> seven<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.850> these<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.180> it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
on this now I got seven of these of it

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.980 
on this now I got seven of these of it
aging<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:49.730> keep<00:02:49.970> some<00:02:52.030> papers<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.300> here's<00:02:53.810> the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
aging so keep some papers and here's the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.400 
aging so keep some papers and here's the
remote<00:02:54.170> control<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:55.600> yeah<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:58.280> on<00:02:58.430> here

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
remote control for it yeah so on here

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.900 
remote control for it yeah so on here
you<00:03:00.410> got<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> limit<00:03:00.950> which<00:03:01.220> tells<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.760> when

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
you got a limit which tells you when

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.270 
you got a limit which tells you when
it's<00:03:02.000> clipping<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.590> run<00:03:05.710> feels<00:03:06.710> nice

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
it's clipping and the run feels nice

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.240 
it's clipping and the run feels nice
got<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:07.850> nice<00:03:08.000> long<00:03:08.210> cable<00:03:08.570> right<00:03:08.720> -<00:03:08.980> which<00:03:09.980> just

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
got a nice long cable right - which just

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.440 
got a nice long cable right - which just
plugs<00:03:10.520> into<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.600> vs<00:03:11.990> mm<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:13.210> now<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.300> one

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
plugs into on the vs mm and now the one

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.270 
plugs into on the vs mm and now the one
just<00:03:14.660> plugs<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.230> over<00:03:15.410> here<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:20.830> only<00:03:21.830> issue

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
just plugs in over here the only issue

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.030 
just plugs in over here the only issue
with<00:03:22.460> this<00:03:22.700> amplifier<00:03:23.060> is<00:03:23.450> all<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.470> LEDs<00:03:24.860> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
with this amplifier is all the LEDs and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.370 
with this amplifier is all the LEDs and
that<00:03:25.190> they're<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.180> being<00:03:26.930> shown<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.320> the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
that they're like being shown in the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.530 
that they're like being shown in the
face<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:27.860> torch<00:03:28.190> especially<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.300> one<00:03:29.420> on

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
face of a torch especially the one on

this the blue LED is just so freakin
bright<00:03:31.960> elysion<00:03:32.960> that's<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.350> 1g<00:03:34.330> it's<00:03:35.330> got<00:03:35.510> a

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
bright elysion that's on 1g it's got a

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.630 
bright elysion that's on 1g it's got a
nice<00:03:36.760> reflective<00:03:37.760> silver<00:03:38.120> riding<00:03:39.490> and<00:03:40.490> it's

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
good it's a nice looking amplifier

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.450 
good it's a nice looking amplifier
I've<00:03:43.550> looked<00:03:43.700> inside<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:45.470> holy

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
I've looked inside it and holy
