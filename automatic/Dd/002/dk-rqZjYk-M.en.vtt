00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.189
 I am high pc 9 and this is my server that 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.350
 consists of mini games let's go to the 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.370
 zone this is the space where it would appear 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.870
 beginning 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.150
 I do not put all the information in the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.230
 description of hamas since I do not 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.570
 they work without ja martín I'll put it on 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.340
 I'll put it also hamas but 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.900
 I will not put good then it is the area 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 minigames an area of ​​plots and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.869
 nice constructions that apart 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.040
 It will also be where you can build 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.579
 our other your own 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.350
 labyrinths and I introduce inside what 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.880
 that is being the room of all 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
 labyrinths that now you will see all of the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 Parkour what you want and then an area 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.670
 pvp that I have closed for now 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.829
 because she is not ready or anything like that 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.969
 well then we are here in the in the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.329
 mini area costs salt which is what 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.179
 parkour and what are the labyrinths that 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.829
 enough guys now teach you some 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.680
 well here you have something of 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.480
 information by the sides and such and such 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.460
 we came 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.909
 You see for example this, nothing starts 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.680
 the parkour and such that at the beginning it is not 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.550
 just to cover just keep following 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.550
 a little bit and so on 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.690
 if I'm a little clumsy I do not feel anything 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.180
 you can go around there and well then 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.080
 what are you going as you go from 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.080
 level on anything 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.429
 good 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.850
 as the levels go by 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.850
 we will give you 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.750
 For example , gold bullion what 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.020
 be good here you have requirements for 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.020
 do 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.859
 for winds of type are the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.259
 of clouds that are not really so 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.000
 easy as the mid-level ones look 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.679
 and the difficult ones that actually go a 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.649
 little in proportion to the size too 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.810
 so then, for example, we come to 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.520
 first and here we see a little the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.799
 description of each type that will see the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.329
 law and that if you see something a book what 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.280
 comentéis and other good are the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.470
 labyrinths up and down and the area of 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.910
 classic mazes worth for example a 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.879
 classic labyrinth because this is the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.200
 first that we will find is very very 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.510
 simple and is that the best I know by heart 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.610
 but as good then go past 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.489
 If you look, you see, he just gave us a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.739
 ingot tells us at what level 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.220
 we have at what level we have gone and we 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.720
 leads to the next maze okay no me 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.360
 I want to spend a lot more so that I do not 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.230
 see 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.000
 and now let's go back not here 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.350
 leads us 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.200
 Ward meaning eggs let's go back there 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.940
 so you can see now the other guy is 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.490
 everything has still served to build or be 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.610
 I need your help to go 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.100
 building I will not hesitate to give you the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.590
 creative and that you help me always and 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.990
 when it does not do it's silly 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.840
 the classic style and the habit goes up and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.720
 low that is another model that my good 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.820
 Cree's friend was thinking and is 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.280
 pretty good is you see up and down 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.830
 stairs and so on that is like more 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.540
 variant no I do not know to me really I 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.060
 quite like if you have other other 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.560
 ideas and such good now below 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.350
 I'm going to teach you to another kind of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.900
 labyrinths what 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.350
 I'm starting to try to see what 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.330
 such are we here in the other guy that 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.010
 You can also build yourselves 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.870
 consists of elongated labyrinths worth 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.570
 that is not the typical maze of doing 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.480
 a monkey zig zags so to speak it is worth 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.040
 a little bit of going up to go down to give 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.230
 buttons that are calling you other 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.290
 sites and others you see is not very decorated 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.410
 at the moment it is not that there is practice 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.750
 very much 23 because that especially here what 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.550
 it looks a little decoration and everything 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.560
 that you must all be very bland but 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.780
 good because not yet this is the first 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.580
 what we do about this guy is worth and good 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.170
 I hope that if you have good ideas they have 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.900
 want to enter the server do not doubt in 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.180
 do what 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.180
 and nothing, I'm waiting here
