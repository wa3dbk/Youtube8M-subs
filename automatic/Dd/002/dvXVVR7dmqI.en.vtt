guys on how to make a tree farm now this
is<00:00:07.379> not<00:00:08.010> an<00:00:08.189> automatic<00:00:08.370> tree<00:00:08.880> farm<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.450> just

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
is not an automatic tree farm it's just

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.660 
is not an automatic tree farm it's just
a<00:00:09.840> tree<00:00:10.050> farm<00:00:10.320> sorry<00:00:10.920> can't<00:00:11.400> make<00:00:11.490> an

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
a tree farm sorry can't make an

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.060 
a tree farm sorry can't make an
automatic<00:00:12.090> one<00:00:12.240> pretty<00:00:12.570> hard<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.620> yeah

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
automatic one pretty hard but yeah

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.770 
automatic one pretty hard but yeah
basically<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.120> some<00:00:15.570> birch

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
basically all it is just some birch

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.620 
basically all it is just some birch
trees<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.710> pattern<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.220> shown<00:00:17.699> very<00:00:18.330> easy

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
trees and a pattern like shown very easy

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.359 
trees and a pattern like shown very easy
to<00:00:18.810> mine<00:00:19.050> very<00:00:19.439> easy<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> get<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
to mine very easy to get all you have to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.210 
to mine very easy to get all you have to
do<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.699> dig<00:00:20.880> up<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:23.039> very

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
do is just dig up like this it's very

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.290 
do is just dig up like this it's very
simple<00:00:24.380> so<00:00:25.380> yeah<00:00:25.740> let's<00:00:25.949> get<00:00:26.070> started<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.150> guys

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
simple so yeah let's get started so guys

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.060 
simple so yeah let's get started so guys
your<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.840> step<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> go<00:00:28.500> ahead<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.890> find

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
your first step is to go ahead and find

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
your first step is to go ahead and find
a<00:00:29.189> forest<00:00:29.490> biome<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:29.880> find<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> birch<00:00:30.779> tree<00:00:30.810> so

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
a forest biome and find a birch tree so

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.269 
a forest biome and find a birch tree so
that<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:31.800> birch<00:00:32.009> tree

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that you can get some birch tree

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.430 
that you can get some birch tree
saplings<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.510> might<00:00:33.719> want<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.050> more<00:00:34.260> than

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
saplings you might want to get more than

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.160 
saplings you might want to get more than
one<00:00:34.620> because<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.130> farm<00:00:35.370> probably<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.170> going

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
one because your farm probably is going

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.560 
one because your farm probably is going
to<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.380> bigger<00:00:37.559> than<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.129> tree<00:00:38.570> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to be bigger than just one tree so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.450 
to be bigger than just one tree so
basically<00:00:40.350> find<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> good<00:00:41.100> flat<00:00:41.430> area

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
basically find out a good flat area

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.000 
basically find out a good flat area
right<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> good<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.890> ahead

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
right here is a good one and go ahead

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
right here is a good one and go ahead
and<00:00:44.129> place<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.640> piece<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.059> dirt<00:00:45.300> down<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:45.960> I'm

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and place a piece of dirt down now I'm

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.180 
and place a piece of dirt down now I'm
just<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> use<00:00:46.440> dirt<00:00:46.649> instead<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.980> grass

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
just going to use dirt instead of grass

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
just going to use dirt instead of grass
because<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> looks<00:00:47.789> weird<00:00:48.059> find<00:00:48.960> your<00:00:49.079> dirt

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
because that looks weird find your dirt

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.819 
because that looks weird find your dirt
and<00:00:49.620> basically<00:00:50.039> place<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.440> pattern<00:00:52.680> like

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and basically place it in a pattern like

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
and basically place it in a pattern like
this<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.760> between<00:00:54.090> there<00:00:54.270> always

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this with two in between there always

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
this with two in between there always
has<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> between<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.520> else<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> will

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
has to be two in between or else it will

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
has to be two in between or else it will
not<00:00:57.000> work<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> looks<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.410> then

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
not work so if it looks like this then

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
not work so if it looks like this then
chances<00:00:59.879> are<00:00:59.969> something's<00:01:00.359> wrong<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.050> let's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
chances are something's wrong so let's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
chances are something's wrong so let's
go<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.129> by<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.850> way<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.059> hate<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.570> the

thing<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.170> birch<00:02:04.500> trees<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> reason<00:02:05.219> why

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
thing about birch trees the reason why

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.560 
thing about birch trees the reason why
you<00:02:05.340> want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.790> use<00:02:05.909> them<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> use

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you want to use them and have to use

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.960 
you want to use them and have to use
them<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.840> because<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.380> grow<00:02:07.970> like

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
them is because they do not grow like

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.180 
them is because they do not grow like
for<00:02:09.780> instance<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.530> grow<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.920> this

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
for instance they do not grow like this

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.580 
for instance they do not grow like this
and<00:02:11.599> why<00:02:12.599> would<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.780> want<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.290> your<00:02:13.349> tree

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and why would you want this in your tree

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.660 
and why would you want this in your tree
