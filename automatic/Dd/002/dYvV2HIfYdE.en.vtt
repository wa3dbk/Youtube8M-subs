Kenda just like that let's click pop
whole<00:00:37.950> bunch<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.930> magnesium<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:41.210> see<00:00:42.210> how

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
whole bunch of magnesium you see how

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.100 
whole bunch of magnesium you see how
easy<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.770> scrape<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.789> all

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
easy it is to scrape it up and it's all

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.709 
easy it is to scrape it up and it's all
stays<00:00:46.110> together<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.190> need<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> knife

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
stays together so I don't need a knife

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.330 
stays together so I don't need a knife
if<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.559> inside<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.510> can<00:00:51.510> still

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
if I don't have one inside I can still

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.910 
if I don't have one inside I can still
make<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> fire<00:00:58.879> okay<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.420> lot<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
make a fire okay that's a lot of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.070 
make a fire okay that's a lot of
magnesium<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.910> gonna<00:01:03.120> put<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.660> dry

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
magnesium now I'm gonna put this dry

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.000 
magnesium now I'm gonna put this dry
sticks<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:05.489> top<00:01:05.820> hole<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.170> so

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
sticks on top hole on the side of it so

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.359 
sticks on top hole on the side of it so
I<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.720> move<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.049> closer<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.950> very

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
I can just move it up closer it's very

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.810 
I can just move it up closer it's very
very<00:01:11.700> important<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:13.560> dry<00:01:14.010> like

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
very important to have very dry like

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.810 
very important to have very dry like
glass<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.659> nice<00:01:15.930> stand-up<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.920> start<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> file

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
glass or nice stand-up to start the file

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.289 
glass or nice stand-up to start the file
like<00:01:18.119> something<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.009> is<00:01:20.009> easy<00:01:20.460> catches<00:01:21.119> on

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
like something that is easy catches on

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.660 
like something that is easy catches on
fire<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> magnesium<00:01:23.159> over

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
fire you see all that magnesium over

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.620 
fire you see all that magnesium over
there<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:23.970> side

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
there on the side

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
there on the side
now<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.590> stack<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> book<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
now I'm gonna stack it on the book on a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.260 
now I'm gonna stack it on the book on a
block<00:01:27.210> spot<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:28.350> top<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.950> magnesium<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.030> let's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
block spot on top of magnesium and let's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.539 
block spot on top of magnesium and let's
see<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.869> gonna<00:01:31.079> work<00:01:33.829> here<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.369> it

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
see if it's gonna work here go that's it

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.560 
see if it's gonna work here go that's it
no

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.090 

that's<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.550> pretty<00:01:43.550> easy<00:01:44.000> it's<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:45.140> fire<00:01:45.620> now

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
that's it pretty easy it's on fire now

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.380 
that's it pretty easy it's on fire now
make<00:01:46.370> sure<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.820> edit<00:01:47.420> slowly<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:49.340> state<00:01:49.700> lit

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
make sure you edit slowly to state lit

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.900 
make sure you edit slowly to state lit
on<00:01:50.570> fire<00:01:53.560> something<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.950> easy<00:01:55.220> catching<00:01:55.610> on

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
on fire something that easy catching on

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:04.660 
on fire something that easy catching on
