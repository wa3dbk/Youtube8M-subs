not useless and for the tests that we

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.710 
not useless and for the tests that we
did<00:03:15.769> on<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.070> car<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:16.970> come<00:03:17.239> on<00:03:17.269> in<00:03:17.540> here

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
made them a little better but possibly

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.870 
made them a little better but possibly
that<00:03:30.680> was<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.859> same<00:03:31.040> result<00:03:31.579> you<00:03:31.670> would<00:03:31.760> have

that was the same result you would have

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
their garage to think that it's going to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.170 
their garage to think that it's going to
fix<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.949> scratch<00:04:34.220> for<00:04:34.250> them<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:35.120> know

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
fix the scratch for them you know

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.670 
fix the scratch for them you know
sometimes<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.930> best<00:04:36.110> thing<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.410> fix<00:04:36.590> the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
sometimes the best thing to fix the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.809 
sometimes the best thing to fix the
scratch<00:04:36.919> is<00:04:37.099> actually<00:04:37.370> going<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.550> be<00:04:37.610> get<00:04:37.789> a

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
scratch is actually going to be get a

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.640 
scratch is actually going to be get a
can<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.180> touch-up<00:04:38.509> paint<00:04:38.720> get<00:04:39.259> a<00:04:39.289> bottle<00:04:39.500> of

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
can of touch-up paint get a bottle of

can of touch-up paint get a bottle of
touch-up<00:04:39.830> paint<00:04:40.190> they<00:04:40.370> even<00:04:40.580> have<00:04:40.699> touch-up

paints<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.449> little<00:04:41.599> pens<00:04:41.810> now<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.319> so<00:04:42.830> it

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
paints and little pens now and so it

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.200 
paints and little pens now and so it
takes<00:04:43.099> some<00:04:43.310> hard<00:04:43.520> labor<00:04:43.699> for<00:04:43.819> you<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.060> get
