00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
going to think he's gonna predict my

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.630 
going to think he's gonna predict my
switch<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.230> i<00:02:37.260> try<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.709> wish<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.400> free

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
switch and i see the thunder wave so we

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.039 
switch and i see the thunder wave so we
actually<00:02:40.350> try<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.769> predict<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> switch<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.049> i

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
actually try to predict the switch and i

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.660 
actually try to predict the switch and i
really<00:02:43.620> don't<00:02:43.829> want<00:02:43.950> him<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.130> thunder<00:02:44.430> way<00:02:44.519> of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.890 
to predict my switch with thunder wave
he's<00:02:59.610> actually<00:02:59.760> gonna<00:02:59.970> let<00:03:00.150> me<00:03:00.240> kill<00:03:00.480> hypno

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.089 
that makes it a little less useful than
it<00:05:38.419> was<00:05:38.509> before<00:05:38.659> and<00:05:39.110> i'm<00:05:39.500> going<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.979> switch

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
it was before and i'm going to switch

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.580 
it was before and i'm going to switch
out<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.550> i<00:05:40.639> decide<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.479> switch<00:05:41.599> out<00:05:41.870> into<00:05:42.259> size

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
out and i decide to switch out into size

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.640 
out and i decide to switch out into size
or<00:05:42.860> because<00:05:43.729> i<00:05:44.060> can<00:05:44.330> hurt<00:05:45.259> him<00:05:45.289> with<00:05:45.500> either

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
or because i can hurt him with either

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.920 
or because i can hurt him with either
you<00:05:45.919> turn<00:05:46.099> or<00:05:46.479> bullet<00:05:47.479> punch<00:05:47.659> and<00:05:47.870> i'm

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
you turn or bullet punch and i'm

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.629 
you turn or bullet punch and i'm
thinking<00:05:48.080> he<00:05:48.380> probably<00:05:48.620> will<00:05:49.069> switch<00:05:49.250> out<00:05:49.460> so

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
thinking he probably will switch out so

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.820 
thinking he probably will switch out so
i<00:05:49.669> decided<00:05:49.969> to<00:05:50.030> go<00:05:50.150> for<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.330> u-turn<00:05:50.690> but<00:05:51.620> he

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
i decided to go for the u-turn but he

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.040 
i decided to go for the u-turn but he
actually<00:05:51.979> doesn't<00:05:52.490> he<00:05:52.909> lets<00:05:53.090> me<00:05:53.210> you<00:05:53.900> know

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
actually doesn't he lets me you know

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.230 
actually doesn't he lets me you know
kill<00:05:54.740> his<00:05:54.919> Abomasnow<00:05:55.610> so<00:05:55.819> that<00:05:55.940> was<00:05:56.060> rather

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
kill his Abomasnow so that was rather

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.959 
kill his Abomasnow so that was rather
curious<00:05:56.810> i<00:05:56.930> don't<00:05:57.080> know<00:05:57.250> why<00:05:58.250> he<00:05:58.699> doesn't

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
curious i don't know why he doesn't

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.369 
curious i don't know why he doesn't
switch<00:05:59.150> out<00:05:59.330> here<00:05:59.659> especially<00:05:59.840> because<00:06:00.289> he

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
switch out here especially because he

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.070 
switch out here especially because he
protects<00:06:00.919> and<00:06:01.099> sees<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.370> u-turn<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:02.210> he

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
protects and sees the u-turn and he

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.860 
protects and sees the u-turn and he
still<00:06:03.349> decides<00:06:03.680> not<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:03.979> switch<00:06:04.159> out<00:06:04.370> um<00:06:04.870> I

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
still decides not to switch out um I

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.420 
still decides not to switch out um I
guess<00:06:06.319> well<00:06:06.740> he<00:06:06.919> didn't<00:06:07.099> really<00:06:07.130> have

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
guess well he didn't really have

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.589 
guess well he didn't really have
anything<00:06:07.669> it<00:06:07.880> was<00:06:07.969> just<00:06:08.000> that<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.330> turn

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
anything it was just that you turn

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.520 
anything it was just that you turn
anymore<00:06:09.219> but<00:06:10.219> still<00:06:11.150> he<00:06:11.990> sacrificed

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
anymore but still he sacrificed

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.339 
anymore but still he sacrificed
Abomasnow<00:06:13.159> there<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:13.870> even<00:06:14.870> though<00:06:15.050> he<00:06:15.199> knew

going to really hurt someone lacks at

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.560 
going to really hurt someone lacks at
all<00:07:12.610> and<00:07:13.620> as<00:07:14.620> you<00:07:14.740> can<00:07:14.889> see<00:07:14.919> it<00:07:15.160> does<00:07:15.340> maybe<00:07:15.610> 60

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
all and as you can see it does maybe 60

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.090 
all and as you can see it does maybe 60
damage<00:07:16.930> Omo<00:07:17.740> 60<00:07:18.700> damage<00:07:19.120> to<00:07:19.570> my<00:07:19.720> almost<00:07:20.350> 500

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
damage Omo 60 damage to my almost 500

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.350 
damage Omo 60 damage to my almost 500
and<00:07:23.280> so<00:07:24.280> that<00:07:24.550> doesn't<00:07:24.820> do<00:07:24.880> a<00:07:24.910> whole<00:07:24.970> lot<00:07:25.090> he

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
and so that doesn't do a whole lot he

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.750 
and so that doesn't do a whole lot he
actually<00:07:25.510> gets<00:07:25.690> the<00:07:25.960> critical<00:07:26.650> hit<00:07:26.860> on<00:07:27.580> the

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
actually gets the critical hit on the

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.700 
actually gets the critical hit on the
next<00:07:28.120> Blizzard<00:07:28.540> but<00:07:28.720> doesn't<00:07:29.139> matter<00:07:29.380> at<00:07:29.680> all

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710 
next Blizzard but doesn't matter at all

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.650
