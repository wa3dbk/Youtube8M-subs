00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.970
 Today I'm going to show you how to do it. 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 a coke in the west, right? 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.730
 you'll even need the logical break 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.220
 and you will need the help 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.460
 so we're going to go look here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.359
 ae Grandpa right coke 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:34.710
 he's he has several repositories not 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:40.040
 sang using that on the scene but left 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.040
 the other one that has there is also loading 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:51.050
 a little 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:54.120
 one that also has it's mold more 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.600
 Will you need it between board that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.340
 It's also free, the two are free. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.850
 to activate themes 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.610
 So you'll see here you'll find the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:13.380
 rock as a theme as if it were a 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:18.330
 Theme and you only with baby quince back 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:24.689
 here's spring and ready but actually 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.740
 it is not a touch because it only 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:33.390
 took andrÃ© clock that apple puts to the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.090
 season type iphone 4 if i'm not mistaken 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.579
 his processor was made for 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.970
 rotate 1 gigahertz helicopters field 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:48.149
 800 megahertz for why 800 megahertz a 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.189
 performance is good enough and gives 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.630
 more battery so here you will not 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.020
 because it was meant to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 change at this frequency and will not 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.590
 will not degrade from any 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.509
 The only way you can spend more could be 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.670
 It 's really easy there, I'll do it for you now. 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.030
 especially on the most 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.680
 old you will feel a difference in 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.079
 velocity 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.079
 and that's what I said
