00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.940
 Good day to all with you 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 iron answer and i dmitry today we 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.839
 talk to you about this injustice, 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.490
 appliances as monoblocks 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.740
 at the moment when people come in 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.080
 shop first thing they prefer 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 purchase a bulky system unit with 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.420
 huge amount of peripherals and just 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.220
 a lot of incomprehensible some wires 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.810
 second type of equipment that acquire 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.230
 people are laptops 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.290
 yes here are missing in all sorts 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.140
 cable and it is very small therefore it takes 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.300
 limited amount of space but he has 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 very small 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.870
 screen diagonal and from this work on 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.780
 it will not be very comfortable today 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.170
 The theme of our review will be a candy bar from 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.030
 samsung with a poetic name 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.039
 300 aa two fishes 01 wonderful 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.930
 the name came up with marketers of this 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.390
 firms oh well so what we have with us 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.729
 great budget candy bar with no 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.869
 less budget casing is made in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.810
 glossiness plus its appearance in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.590
 that he looks more like a monitor than 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.869
 on candy bar 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.850
 and the minus of this plastic is precisely in 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 that despite the fact that we got 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.430
 candy bar right out of the box that came 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.229
 he himself turned out to be the plant itself 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.570
 scratched basically the design is very 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.759
 good i loved them 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.920
 navigating such a moment is that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.070
 all equipment is laid 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.270
 namely, all the iron is not in the monitor itself and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.450
 it is in the leg that is because of this 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.439
 the stand became very elastic 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.420
 monitorchik very easy 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.420
 that is, this design will be much 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.000
 better phenomenon 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.909
 look on your desktop than more 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 his big brothers 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.640
 connection interface on the left side 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.540
 screen we see 2 yusb port output for 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.649
 speakers and microphone input and slot for 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.929
 sd card 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.540
 there are two more behind 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.810
 additional slots for usb 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.730
 stub wait for me it says 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.650
 that our candy bar does not have digital 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.239
 output in order to connect 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.440
 extra tv or any 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.750
 monitor on the very legs in which 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.910
 built in motherboard again 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.530
 so two usb output ethernet output 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:42.370
 power cable and here is such an echo 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.040
 from the last plays at 2 to connect 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.330
 do not judge the keyboard right away 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.220
 samsung company 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.420
 those that did not disdain to use 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.049
 old input from on 2 this they realized 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.680
 just to turn on the candy bar 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.920
 from the keyboard that is, the keyboard has 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.930
 button on and off monoblock 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.959
 if it were and usb input naturally 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.880
 This would be the possibility of this model 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.269
 it was right hand side 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.700
 dvd drive located naturally 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.329
 recorder stands the same as in 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.930
 laptops 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.549
 thanks to this, you can install 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.489
 normal drive without fear that you have it 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.350
 will fall and be scratched or damaged 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.350
 somehow center top 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.190
 webcam with quality 09 is located 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.160
 megapixels 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.600
 it is certainly not enough but for 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.239
 chat on skype 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.560
 should be enough what is located 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.739
 inside our 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.410
 monoblock here stands dual-core 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.030
 processor with a frequency of 2 and a half 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.700
 gigahertz 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.370
 it is quite nice also integrated 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.530
 intel hd graphics 2000 video card 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.620
 that will allow you to watch videos in hd 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.819
 as an install application for 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.730
 processing and 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.430
 editing a small home video or 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.680
 photos we have here four gigabytes 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.689
 RAM which you can 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.099
 demonstrate unfolding the candy bar 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.889
 the back 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.870
 and removing the protective cover here we see that 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.470
 set one memory bar for 4 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.139
 gigabyte ddr3 and the ability to install and 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.960
 another as there is an available slot and 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.810
 if you wish you can deliver there 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.840
 one more planku expanding overall 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.210
 RAM up to 8 gigabytes here 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.419
 500 hard drive 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.930
 gigabyte also we see that quite 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.240
 enough space for installation 2 but 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.190
 the samsung company thought that 500 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.320
 quite enough somewhere with them 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.430
 I agree because now there is a very 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.169
 many cloud technologies and servers 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.530
 who will provide ready to provide 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:57.460
 you any amount of volume on remote 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.530
 servers and this is probably correct in 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.229
 this model is installed awning film 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.620
 matrix full hd resolution with led 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:08.110
 backlit and this is a wonderful quality 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.020
 Pictures I do not know how to allow 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.349
 color rendition see you but i can 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.050
 say exactly what she pleases here on 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.909
 beautiful bright saturated colors 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.400
 viewed comfortably plus for 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:24.310
 yourself and see exactly what the screen is matte 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.500
 not glossy it will allow for any 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.870
 lighting see exactly the information with 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.789
 screen and not its reflection 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.009
 the operating system costs windows 8 on 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.930
 so the screen is not fully touch 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.750
 realize the power of windows 8 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.740
 opportunities it does not seem but 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.409
 mouse 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.810
 everything works very very decent and 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.870
 well you can connect via 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.050
 extra outlet 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.930
 some kind of your own columns but for viewing 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.230
 films that are enough 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.680
 already 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.790
 how can you summarize this issue 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.190
 samsung company prepared 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.880
 really good product for small 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.460
 office 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.030
 Yes, and for the big, probably, too , for 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.220
 houses 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.450
 if you don't want to play any 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.960
 serious toys 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.000
 if you are not interested in the connection 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.860
 additional devices such as 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.560
 televisions and projectors 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.930
 This version is for you to 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.210
 surfing in order to 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.080
 consider films on it 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.090
 its full as a media center this one 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.480
 of the best options with all the more its price 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.980
 attractive enough before i like 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.050
 most of you are skeptical attitude to 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.780
 monoblock think that this technique is very 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.270
 hard to repair it is impossible 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.070
 bring to the upgrade but also the system blocks 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.040
 Now I'm not talking about Gretel because 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.350
 iron changes very quickly and behind this 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.780
 not for a long time not hijacking but 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.660
 monoblock there are clear advantages we 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.790
 we see that they are compact huge plus I 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.920
 I see that they are absolutely silent 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.900
 if any noise comes out tone 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.330
 very minimal of all this possible 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.370
 make one conclusion that this model 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.960
 Samsung can serve as an excellent 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.060
 alternative to replace the classic 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.820
 computer or laptop 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.400
 Today we are overlooked by monoblock 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.120
 samsung with a great name 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.060
 300 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.280
