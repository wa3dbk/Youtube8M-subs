00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
continuous protection some bug spray and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.370 
continuous protection some bug spray and
active<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.420> stay<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.750> some<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
your running around with each and you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.160 
your running around with each and you
get<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.910> water<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.240> stuff<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:27.600> like<00:02:27.660> try

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.370 
it's probably going to come off anyway
and<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.620> will<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.640> um<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.390> one's<00:02:33.600> an<00:02:33.690> SPF<00:02:34.110> 30
