this<00:00:10.380> past<00:00:10.650> winter<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.460> had<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> bucket<00:00:12.690> loader

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
this past winter we had a bucket loader

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.029 
this past winter we had a bucket loader
that<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.740> dumped<00:00:14.130> about<00:00:14.660> 52<00:00:15.660> acres<00:00:16.080> worth<00:00:16.410> of

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
that that dumped about 52 acres worth of

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.390 
that that dumped about 52 acres worth of
limestone<00:00:17.699> riprap<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.560> bottom<00:00:19.949> here<00:00:20.310> in

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
limestone riprap on the bottom here in

substrate<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:24.779> oyster<00:00:25.140> larvae<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.340> what

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
substrate for oyster larvae and so what

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.290 
substrate for oyster larvae and so what
we<00:00:26.670> did<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.119> went<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> these<00:00:28.050> these

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
we did was we went out and these these

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.700 
we did was we went out and these these
riprap<00:00:30.300> pieces<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.019> riffraff<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.590> been

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
riprap pieces of riffraff have been

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.610 
riprap pieces of riffraff have been
piled<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.250> into<00:00:32.880> mounds<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:34.380> sort<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
piled up into mounds that are sort of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.979 
piled up into mounds that are sort of
placed<00:00:35.040> checkerboard<00:00:35.730> fashion<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
placed checkerboard fashion on the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.680 
placed checkerboard fashion on the
seafloor<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.730> we've<00:00:38.910> randomly<00:00:39.180> picked

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
seafloor and so we've randomly picked

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930 
seafloor and so we've randomly picked
some<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> these<00:00:40.050> mounds<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:41.010> sample<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
some of these mounds to sample and the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.779 
some of these mounds to sample and the
way<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.270> sample<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.930> oysters<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.890> after<00:00:44.610> we

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
way we sample for oysters is to after we

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.549 
way we sample for oysters is to after we
pit<00:00:45.059> randomly<00:00:45.539> picked<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> mounds<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.350> place

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
pit randomly picked the mounds we place

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
pit randomly picked the mounds we place
a<00:00:46.590> quadrat<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> mounds<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.570> divers

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
a quadrat on the mounds and then divers

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
a quadrat on the mounds and then divers
excavate<00:00:49.890> those<00:00:50.340> pieces<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.360> limestone

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
excavate those pieces of limestone

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.950 
excavate those pieces of limestone
riprap<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:53.160> put<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.850> mesh<00:00:54.030> bags<00:00:54.329> bring

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
riprap we put them in mesh bags bring

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900 
riprap we put them in mesh bags bring
them<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.770> boat<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.370> then<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.640> put<00:00:56.820> them

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
them up on the boat and then we put them

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
them up on the boat and then we put them
on<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.170> call<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> calling<00:00:58.859> table

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
on that what we call a calling table

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920 
on that what we call a calling table
where<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.910> spread<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.329> back<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
where we spread them back out in the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.720 
where we spread them back out in the
quadrat<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.829> start<00:01:02.100> counting<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
quadrat and then we start counting and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
quadrat and then we start counting and
measuring<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> oysters<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.899> have

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
measuring all the oysters that have

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
measuring all the oysters that have
settled<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.890> those<00:01:05.309> pieces<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.760> riprap<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
settled on those pieces of riprap and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.760 
settled on those pieces of riprap and
we're<00:01:06.510> seeing<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.990> incredibly<00:01:07.650> high

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
we're seeing just incredibly high

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.940 
we're seeing just incredibly high
numbers<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.909> probably<00:01:09.360> settled<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.170> June<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
numbers that probably settled in June of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.539 
numbers that probably settled in June of
this<00:01:11.250> year

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
this year

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.920 
this year
Oster<00:01:12.420> populations<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.799> historic<00:01:14.520> lows

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
Oster populations are at historic lows

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.240 
Oster populations are at historic lows
compared<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> hundred<00:01:16.409> years<00:01:16.590> ago<00:01:16.680> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
compared to a hundred years ago so

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.240 
compared to a hundred years ago so
they're<00:01:17.490> commercially<00:01:18.150> important<00:01:18.570> species

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
they're commercially important species

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.800 
they're commercially important species
served<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> backbone<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.420> seafood

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
served as the backbone of the seafood

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
served as the backbone of the seafood
industry<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.380> North<00:01:22.560> Carolina<00:01:23.180> several

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
industry in North Carolina several

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.730 
industry in North Carolina several
centuries<00:01:24.420> ago<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.460> serve<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.700> critical

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
centuries ago and serve as critical

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.359 
centuries ago and serve as critical
habitat<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.770> fish<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.850> crabs<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.750> also

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
habitat for fish and crabs and also

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.890 
habitat for fish and crabs and also
filter<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> tremendous<00:01:32.880> amount<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.270> water<00:01:33.479> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
filter a tremendous amount of water so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
filter a tremendous amount of water so
they<00:01:34.020> serve<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> lot<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> different<00:01:34.950> functions

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
they serve a lot of different functions

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
they serve a lot of different functions
and<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.759> creating<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.360> reefs<00:01:36.689> we're<00:01:37.500> hoping

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and so creating these reefs we're hoping

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.679 
and so creating these reefs we're hoping
that<00:01:38.040> they'll<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.430> only<00:01:38.540> perpetuate<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that they'll not only perpetuate the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.300 
that they'll not only perpetuate the
reef<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> larvae<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.130> are

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
reef here but then the larvae that are

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.819 
reef here but then the larvae that are
spawned<00:01:41.729> from<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.210> reef<00:01:42.479> will<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.350> dispersed

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
spawned from this reef will be dispersed

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
spawned from this reef will be dispersed
to<00:01:44.009> other<00:01:44.070> areas<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.850> are<00:01:45.000> actually<00:01:45.329> open<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to other areas that are actually open to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.960 
to other areas that are actually open to
fishing<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.350> particular<00:01:46.740> area<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.579> open

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
fishing this particular area is not open

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
fishing this particular area is not open
to<00:01:48.000> fishing<00:01:48.240> well<00:01:49.140> there's<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> tremendous

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to fishing well there's a tremendous

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.249 
to fishing well there's a tremendous
amount<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.399> moisture<00:01:51.390> settlement<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> just

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
amount of moisture settlement as I just

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.749 
amount of moisture settlement as I just
mentioned<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:52.710> also<00:01:52.860> tremendous<00:01:53.430> amount<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
mentioned but also tremendous amount of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.429 
mentioned but also tremendous amount of
fish<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.180> we're<00:01:54.329> seeing<00:01:54.540> some<00:01:54.689> Sheepshead

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
fish so we're seeing some Sheepshead

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.950 
fish so we're seeing some Sheepshead
swimming<00:01:55.860> around<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.759> are

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
swimming around down there that are

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.289 
swimming around down there that are
recreationally<00:01:57.960> important<00:01:58.439> fish<00:01:59.180> you<00:02:00.180> know
