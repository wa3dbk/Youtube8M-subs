00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
in some hard strokes and we've popped

what are your thought processes through
these<00:01:16.300> first<00:01:16.600> hundred<00:01:17.020> 200<00:01:17.590> meters<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.190> think

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
these first hundred 200 meters I think

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.219 
these first hundred 200 meters I think
the<00:01:18.759> main<00:01:18.970> thing<00:01:19.000> from<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.540> coaxing<00:01:19.899> point<00:01:20.140> of

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
the main thing from a coaxing point of

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.840 
the main thing from a coaxing point of
view<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.649> really<00:01:20.890> make<00:01:21.009> sure<00:01:21.160> that<00:01:21.369> you<00:01:21.640> get

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
view is to really make sure that you get

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.550 
view is to really make sure that you get
off<00:01:21.970> straight<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.750> you're<00:01:23.050> not<00:01:23.170> having<00:01:23.320> to

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
off straight and you're not having to

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.080 
off straight and you're not having to
stare<00:01:23.860> because<00:01:24.040> every<00:01:24.399> time<00:01:24.550> you<00:01:24.729> use<00:01:24.910> your

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
stare because every time you use your

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.120 
stare because every time you use your
rudder<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.840> are<00:01:25.960> effectively<00:01:26.440> breaking<00:01:26.860> the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
rudder you are effectively breaking the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.530 
rudder you are effectively breaking the
boat<00:01:27.280> that's<00:01:27.550> how<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.729> rudder<00:01:28.000> works<00:01:28.240> it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
boat that's how the rudder works it

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.450 
boat that's how the rudder works it
stops<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.080> boat<00:01:29.229> so<00:01:29.830> that's<00:01:30.009> not<00:01:30.130> something

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
stops the boat so that's not something

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.070
