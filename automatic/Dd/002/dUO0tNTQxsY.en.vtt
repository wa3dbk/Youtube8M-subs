I<00:04:16.950> think<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.010> reason<00:04:18.250> why<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.430> still<00:04:18.730> out<00:04:18.910> is

I think the reason why the still out is

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.849

because<00:04:19.209> he<00:04:19.299> didn't<00:04:19.510> say<00:04:19.630> a<00:04:19.660> game<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.680> know<00:04:20.799> I

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
because he didn't say a game you know I

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.070 
because he didn't say a game you know I
didn't<00:04:21.100> say<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.760> know<00:04:21.850> another<00:04:22.150> playoff<00:04:22.780> game

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
them to accomplish something special

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.560 
them to accomplish something special
they<00:06:19.380> captured<00:06:20.040> that<00:06:20.160> last<00:06:20.670> week<00:06:20.970> and<00:06:21.150> trust

me that's no fun big effect on there and

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.270 
me that's no fun big effect on there and
I<00:06:24.630> think<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:24.930> other<00:06:25.080> thing<00:06:25.320> is<00:06:25.470> let's<00:06:26.010> give
