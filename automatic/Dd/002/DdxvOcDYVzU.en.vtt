earth<00:02:39.319> was<00:02:39.500> flat<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.950> people<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:40.430> fell<00:02:40.670> off

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
earth was flat and people like fell off

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.800 
earth was flat and people like fell off
I<00:02:41.030> mean<00:02:41.150> don't<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.629> there<00:02:41.750> would

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
I mean don't you think that there would

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.180 
I mean don't you think that there would
at<00:02:41.959> least<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.260> someone<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.590> had<00:02:42.769> fallen<00:02:42.950> off

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
at least be someone that had fallen off

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.860 
at least be someone that had fallen off
by<00:02:43.400> now<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:43.790> don't<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.480> think<00:02:44.540> we<00:02:44.690> would<00:02:44.840> have

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
by now and don't you think we would have

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.520 
by now and don't you think we would have
heard<00:02:45.049> about<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:46.360> exactly<00:02:47.360> they<00:02:47.810> fell<00:02:48.080> off<00:02:48.290> and

heard about it exactly they fell off and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.650 
heard about it exactly they fell off and
we're<00:02:49.310> not<00:02:49.400> gonna<00:02:49.610> hear<00:02:49.940> about<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.360> cuz

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
we're not gonna hear about it cuz

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.350 
we're not gonna hear about it cuz
they're<00:02:50.959> gone<00:02:51.430> okay<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:52.579> still<00:02:52.849> somebody

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
were going to the edge of earth and so

that mean people go missing all the time
and<00:03:14.329> they<00:03:14.540> fall<00:03:14.780> off<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.230> edge<00:03:18.519> know<00:03:19.519> if<00:03:20.090> you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
and they fall off the edge know if you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.800 
and they fall off the edge know if you
go<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.870> place<00:03:21.310> wendover<00:03:22.310> nevada<00:03:22.880> mm-hmm

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
go to this place wendover nevada mm-hmm

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.129 
go to this place wendover nevada mm-hmm
so<00:03:24.440> it's<00:03:24.739> near<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.700> Great<00:03:25.910> Salt<00:03:26.120> Lake<00:03:26.299> up<00:03:26.959> near

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
so it's near the Great Salt Lake up near

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.270 
so it's near the Great Salt Lake up near
Utah<00:03:27.739> okay<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:30.380> used<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:30.950> be<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.069> big

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
Utah okay and there used to be a big

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.449 
Utah okay and there used to be a big
salt<00:03:31.519> lake<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:32.720> all<00:03:33.200> dried<00:03:33.739> up<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:34.280> it's

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
salt lake and it's all dried up so it's

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.819 
salt lake and it's all dried up so it's
just<00:03:34.730> salt<00:03:35.030> all<00:03:35.299> over<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.810> place<00:03:35.989> really

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
just salt all over the place really

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.430 
just salt all over the place really
really<00:03:37.250> flat<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:39.459> some<00:03:40.459> people<00:03:40.760> say<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:42.260> can

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
really flat and some people say you can

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.069 
really flat and some people say you can
see<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.069> Earth's<00:03:43.459> curving<00:03:43.940> but<00:03:44.389> clearly<00:03:44.600> you

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
see the Earth's curving but clearly you

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.610 
see the Earth's curving but clearly you
look<00:03:45.319> out<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.799> it's<00:03:46.370> just<00:03:46.549> so<00:03:46.700> far<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:48.560> you

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
look out and it's just so far that you

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.930 
look out and it's just so far that you
just<00:03:48.799> don't<00:03:48.950> see<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.190> anymore<00:03:52.209> but<00:03:53.209> i<00:03:54.790> just<00:03:55.790> i

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
just don't see it anymore but i just i

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.670 
just don't see it anymore but i just i
mean<00:03:55.970> i<00:03:56.180> think<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.660> know<00:03:56.840> people<00:03:57.380> have

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
mean i think that you know people have

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.599 
mean i think that you know people have
been<00:03:57.859> around<00:03:58.569> long<00:03:59.569> enough<00:03:59.599> now<00:04:00.349> that<00:04:00.709> we

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
been around long enough now that we

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.129 
been around long enough now that we
there<00:04:02.000> what<00:04:02.180> we<00:04:02.599> would<00:04:02.750> have<00:04:02.840> heard<00:04:02.989> of

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
there what we would have heard of

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.660 
there what we would have heard of
someone<00:04:03.650> falling<00:04:04.160> off<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.670> edge<00:04:04.700> oh<00:04:06.340> like<00:04:07.340> at

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
someone falling off the edge oh like at

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.490 
someone falling off the edge oh like at
least<00:04:08.139> someone<00:04:09.139> Magellan<00:04:11.019> he<00:04:12.019> went<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.349> other

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
least someone Magellan he went the other

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.940 
least someone Magellan he went the other
way<00:04:13.840> towards<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.470> arctica<00:04:17.500> he<00:04:18.500> didn't<00:04:18.739> fall

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
way towards and arctica he didn't fall

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.360 
way towards and arctica he didn't fall
off<00:04:19.099> the<00:04:19.280> edge<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.549> earth

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370

want to send me a picture from the edge

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.900 
want to send me a picture from the edge
of<00:04:42.500> Earth<00:04:42.650> don't<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:43.160> think<00:04:43.310> they<00:04:43.639> would<00:04:43.790> have

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
of Earth don't you think they would have

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.360 
of Earth don't you think they would have
some<00:04:44.540> some<00:04:44.930> company<00:04:45.380> would<00:04:45.680> have<00:04:45.770> gotten<00:04:45.979> gone

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
in there and turned that into a theme

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.719 
in there and turned that into a theme
park<00:04:47.810> or<00:04:48.169> something<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:49.040> don't<00:04:49.250> be<00:04:49.400> at<00:04:49.580> your

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
park or something you don't be at your

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.600 
park or something you don't be at your
birth<00:04:49.960> no<00:04:50.960> but<00:04:51.110> like<00:04:51.229> on<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.800> edge<00:04:51.949> what<00:04:52.430> like

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
birth no but like on the edge what like

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.409 
birth no but like on the edge what like
you<00:04:52.729> get<00:04:52.850> to<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.030> edge<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.330> obviously

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
you get to the edge and obviously

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.070 
you get to the edge and obviously
