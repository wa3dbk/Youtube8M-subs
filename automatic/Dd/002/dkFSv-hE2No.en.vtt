00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this and yeah just the way I learned is

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.969 
this and yeah just the way I learned is
not<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:24.090> unique<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.830> way

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979

got that guy

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.510 
got that guy
up<00:02:09.610> right<00:02:10.479> down<00:02:10.780> right<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:12.670> right<00:02:13.510> down<00:02:13.780> right

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
see you guys it's it's all method it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.800 
see you guys it's it's all method it
looks<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.560> don't<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.100> you'll<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:18.810> what

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
looks like I don't a but you'll see what

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.900 
looks like I don't a but you'll see what
i'm<00:02:19.930> doing<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:20.530> actually<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.160> same<00:02:21.400> old<00:02:21.670> same

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
i'm doing is actually the same old same

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.540 
i'm doing is actually the same old same
old<00:02:21.970> but<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.660> know<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.170> way<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.740> faster<00:02:24.040> ways<00:02:24.370> by

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
old but I know the way is faster ways by

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.620 
old but I know the way is faster ways by
the<00:02:24.640> way<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.790> learned<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.210> probably<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the way I learned is probably the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.250 
the way I learned is probably the
easiest<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.500> fastest<00:02:27.400> way<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.640> learn<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
easiest and fastest way to learn but you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.590 
easiest and fastest way to learn but you
don't<00:02:29.680> if<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.250> don't<00:02:30.700> solve<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> cube<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
don't if you don't solve the cube the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.810 
don't if you don't solve the cube the
fastest<00:02:32.020> time<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.500> yeah<00:02:32.770> like<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.040> said<00:02:33.220> oh<00:02:33.400> I

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
fastest time so yeah like I said oh I

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.870 
fastest time so yeah like I said oh I
average<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.210> two<00:02:35.200> minutes<00:02:35.550> 20<00:02:36.550> seconds

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
average like two minutes 20 seconds
