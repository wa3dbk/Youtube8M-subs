00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
2 weeks after 2 weeks you'll see it's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.760 
2 weeks after 2 weeks you'll see it's
about<00:01:04.229> half<00:01:05.119> fermented<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:07.170> not<00:01:07.439> fully

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
about half fermented it's not fully

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.240 
about half fermented it's not fully
fermented<00:01:08.330> at<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.570> point<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.530> important

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
fermented at this point it's important

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.499 
fermented at this point it's important
to<00:01:11.850> take<00:01:12.090> your<00:01:12.119> pile<00:01:12.979> break<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.159> apart<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:15.360> can

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to take your pile break it apart you can

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.830 
to take your pile break it apart you can
see<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.960> there's<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.560> fermented<00:01:17.840> bits

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
see there there's your fermented bits

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
see there there's your fermented bits
that<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.320> doing<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.710> work<00:01:19.920> breaking<00:01:20.400> down

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that are doing your work breaking down

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450 
that are doing your work breaking down
the<00:01:20.970> doors<00:01:21.420> making<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.710> nutrients<00:01:23.250> in

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the doors making it so the nutrients in

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
the doors making it so the nutrients in
that<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:23.939> fully<00:01:24.330> available<00:01:24.479> for

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that when you are fully available for

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200 
that when you are fully available for
your<00:01:25.290> garden<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.490> want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
your garden so you want to take that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.520 
your garden so you want to take that
pile<00:01:27.509> take<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.619> apart<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:29.820> week<00:01:30.090> mark

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
pile take it apart at the two week mark

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
pile take it apart at the two week mark
so<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.450> we<00:01:33.450> wet<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.369> at<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:36.000> point

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so that you can we wet it at this point

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810 
so that you can we wet it at this point
you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.439> heat<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> pile<00:01:38.460> there

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you can see that heat in the pile there

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
you can see that heat in the pile there
there<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.329> steam<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:41.240> very<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.600> hot<00:01:43.049> this

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
there so steam it's very very hot this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
there so steam it's very very hot this
fermentation<00:01:45.840> process<00:01:46.380> heats<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
fermentation process heats up and it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.609 
fermentation process heats up and it
breaks<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.479> nutrients<00:01:48.960> eliminar

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
breaks down the nutrients eliminar

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.030 
breaks down the nutrients eliminar
and<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.299> need<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.079> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.350> turn

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and so now you need to just kind of turn

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.850 
and so now you need to just kind of turn
that<00:01:53.340> pile<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.259> water<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.530> down<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.860> it's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that pile and water it down so it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.359 
that pile and water it down so it's
ready<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> next<00:02:00.180> two<00:02:00.509> weeks<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
ready for the next two weeks of

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.050 
ready for the next two weeks of
fermentation

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.650 

as<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.869> put<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.110> pile<00:02:07.619> back<00:02:08.090> together<00:02:09.090> in

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
as you put that pile back together in

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.590 
as you put that pile back together in
its<00:02:09.959> cone<00:02:10.380> shape<00:02:10.740> work<00:02:11.670> around<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> edges<00:02:12.569> of

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
its cone shape work around the edges of

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
its cone shape work around the edges of
the<00:02:12.959> pile<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.680> put<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.120> bits<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.990> manure<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the pile to put the bits of manure that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.670 
the pile to put the bits of manure that
didn't<00:02:17.190> get<00:02:17.490> fully<00:02:17.880> fermented<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.470> ones

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
didn't get fully fermented like the ones
