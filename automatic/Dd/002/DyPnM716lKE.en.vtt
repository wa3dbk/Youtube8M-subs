different one they're very moist writing

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.450 
different one they're very moist writing
about<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> same<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:28.769> they're<00:00:29.039> nice<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
about the same time they're nice and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.160 
about the same time they're nice and
light<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.300> doesn't<00:00:30.599> weigh<00:00:30.689> down<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:30.960> hair

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
light so it doesn't weigh down your hair

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.959 
light so it doesn't weigh down your hair
but<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> same<00:00:31.859> time<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.399> moisturize<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
but at the same time it is moisturize it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.990 
but at the same time it is moisturize it
so<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> feels<00:00:33.540> nice<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:33.899> silky<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.710> soft<00:00:35.010> also

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so it feels nice and silky and soft also

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.790 
so it feels nice and silky and soft also
I<00:00:36.030> find<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> ends<00:00:37.050> don't<00:00:37.170> look<00:00:37.559> too

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
I find that the ends don't look too

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
I find that the ends don't look too
crazy<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.149> I'm<00:00:39.360> shampoo<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
crazy with the with this I'm shampoo and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.150 
crazy with the with this I'm shampoo and
conditioner<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.290> sometimes<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.980> can

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
conditioner because sometimes you can

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160 
conditioner because sometimes you can
get<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.210> shampoos<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.930> really

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
get like some shampoos can really

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
get like some shampoos can really
emphasize<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> dry<00:00:44.219> ends<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:44.969> them

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
emphasize the dry ends and make them

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.639 
emphasize the dry ends and make them
look<00:00:45.300> even<00:00:45.450> more<00:00:45.750> frizzy<00:00:46.170> whereas<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
look even more frizzy whereas this

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.959 
look even more frizzy whereas this
doesn't<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:47.850> really

lotion and I don't know why it's called
lotion<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.390> actually<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.930> spray

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380

don't know why they have that on the
bottle<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.280> anyway<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.119> basically

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
bottle but anyway this is just basically

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960 
bottle but anyway this is just basically
a<00:01:15.869> liquid<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.220> spread<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
a liquid that it's a spread and if you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
a liquid that it's a spread and if you
can<00:01:18.119> see<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> spray<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.860> spray<00:01:20.130> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159

all<00:01:20.310> over<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.670> hair<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.090> concentrate<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
all over my hair I concentrate on the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.630 
all over my hair I concentrate on the
roots<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> volumizing<00:01:23.340> spray

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
roots because it is a volumizing spray

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.270 
roots because it is a volumizing spray
so<00:01:24.119> there's<00:01:24.960> definitely<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> pros

thing<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.920> don't<00:02:35.100> know<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.400> does<00:02:35.550> that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
thing but I don't know if it does that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.880 
thing but I don't know if it does that
but<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.150> definitely<00:02:36.330> does<00:02:36.660> hide<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.290> floor<00:02:37.530> so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
but it definitely does hide the floor so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.680 
but it definitely does hide the floor so
really<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.330> bit<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
really like that it's a bit on the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.090 
really like that it's a bit on the
expensive<00:02:39.900> side<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.890> don't<00:02:41.040> actually

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
expensive side and you don't actually

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.890 
expensive side and you don't actually
get<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.640> much<00:02:41.760> product<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.570> don't<00:02:42.780> need

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
probably need to apply all the way like

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.990 
probably need to apply all the way like
all<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.980> way<00:03:38.070> through<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.400> hair<00:03:38.580> just<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
all the way through the hair just the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.300 
all the way through the hair just the
ends<00:03:39.209> because<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> cream<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.620> would

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
ends because it is a cream so it would

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.680 
ends because it is a cream so it would
make<00:03:41.340> your<00:03:41.670> hair<00:03:41.910> low<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.239> only<00:03:42.540> if<00:03:42.660> you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
make your hair low but only if you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.569 
make your hair low but only if you
approach<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.230> route<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> ends<00:03:44.459> this

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
approach the route but to the ends this

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.550 
approach the route but to the ends this
is<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> miracle<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.540> really<00:03:45.810> does<00:03:46.019> do<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.350> job

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
is a miracle it really does do the job

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.500 
is a miracle it really does do the job
and<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.400> think<00:03:47.610> it's<00:03:47.760> really<00:03:47.970> nice<00:03:48.180> kind

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510

like<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.420> then<00:03:51.540> finally<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.079> have<00:03:52.560> this

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
like that and then finally I have this

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.370 
like that and then finally I have this
hair<00:03:53.070> mask<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.670> don't<00:03:54.299> really<00:03:54.510> do<00:03:54.690> hair<00:03:54.930> masks

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.069 
hair mask I don't really do hair masks
while<00:03:55.530> maybe<00:03:56.070> once<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.730> two<00:03:56.940> weeks<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.480> once<00:03:57.900> in

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
while maybe once in two weeks or once in

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.720 
while maybe once in two weeks or once in
a<00:03:58.170> month<00:03:58.350> I'm<00:03:58.620> really<00:03:58.860> bad<00:03:59.010> at<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.310> even

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
a month I'm really bad at that even

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.520 
a month I'm really bad at that even
though<00:03:59.820> my<00:04:00.000> hair<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.390> super<00:04:00.630> dry<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:00.989> super
