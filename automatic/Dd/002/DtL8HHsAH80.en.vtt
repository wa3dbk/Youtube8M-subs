PNG gif penchev but the purpose of this

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.220 
PNG gif penchev but the purpose of this
tutorial<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.090> show<00:02:38.269> you<00:02:38.450> how<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.720> save<00:02:39.080> it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
tutorial is to show you how to save it

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.620 
tutorial is to show you how to save it
as<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.680> searchable<00:02:40.220> PDF<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:42.400> either<00:02:43.400> PDF<00:02:43.760> RTF

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
as a searchable PDF so either PDF RTF

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.680 
as a searchable PDF so either PDF RTF
HTML<00:02:45.440> or<00:02:45.590> text<00:02:45.910> these<00:02:46.910> all<00:02:47.120> actually<00:02:47.480> are

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
HTML or text these all actually are

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.210 
HTML or text these all actually are
pretty<00:02:48.170> much<00:02:48.290> similar<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.100> actually

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
pretty much similar so we can actually

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.600 
pretty much similar so we can actually
search<00:02:49.610> text<00:02:50.360> in<00:02:50.510> any<00:02:50.959> one<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.290> these<00:02:51.500> options

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
search text in any one of these options

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.240 
search text in any one of these options
what<00:02:52.610> we<00:02:52.730> will<00:02:52.850> actually<00:02:53.150> keep<00:02:53.300> PDF<00:02:53.870> option<00:02:54.260> in

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
what we will actually keep PDF option in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.350 
what we will actually keep PDF option in
there<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.900> want<00:02:56.900> actually<00:02:57.050> change<00:02:57.440> my<00:02:58.360> parts

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
there I want actually change my parts

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.080 
there I want actually change my parts
will<00:02:59.780> actually<00:03:00.080> keep<00:03:00.230> does<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.370> as<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.970> is

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
will actually keep does that as it is

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.850 
will actually keep does that as it is
but<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.690> always<00:03:02.840> change<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.620> like

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
but you can always change it to like

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.130 
but you can always change it to like
where<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.220> want<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.459> stow<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
where you want to stow that the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.990 
where you want to stow that the
resultant<00:03:06.680> scan<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:08.570> UM<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.950> will<00:03:10.519> just<00:03:10.760> press

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
resultant scan to UM I will just press

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.979 
resultant scan to UM I will just press
ok<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.600> now<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.470> actually<00:03:12.680> going<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.489> scan

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
ok and now it's actually going to scan

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:23.199 
ok and now it's actually going to scan
my<00:03:17.079> book<00:03:18.079> page<00:03:18.549> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.229 

it's<00:03:23.959> pretty<00:03:24.290> it's<00:03:24.680> pretty<00:03:24.799> fast<00:03:25.459> time<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:26.120> me

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
it's pretty it's pretty fast time for me

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.899 
it's pretty it's pretty fast time for me
I<00:03:26.269> guess<00:03:26.680> because<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.920> have<00:03:28.069> nothing<00:03:28.640> else<00:03:28.730> to

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
I guess because I have nothing else to

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.610 
I guess because I have nothing else to
do<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.180> guess

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
do I guess

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.490 
do I guess
so<00:03:30.980> once<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.760> scan<00:03:32.359> actually<00:03:32.840> gets<00:03:33.049> finished

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
so once the scan actually gets finished

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.059 
so once the scan actually gets finished
this<00:03:33.859> finish<00:03:34.400> button<00:03:34.760> actually<00:03:34.939> gets<00:03:35.299> enabled

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
this finish button actually gets enabled

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.619 
this finish button actually gets enabled
now<00:03:38.140> when<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.170> click<00:03:39.500> finish<00:03:40.299> will<00:03:41.299> actually

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
now when I click finish will actually

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.270 
now when I click finish will actually
just<00:03:41.810> save<00:03:43.239> my<00:03:44.239> document<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:45.109> my<00:03:45.409> to<00:03:46.159> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
just save my document to my to the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.830 
just save my document to my to the
location<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.849> I've<00:03:47.000> selected<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:49.840> that's

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
location that I've selected so that's

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.449 
location that I've selected so that's
the<00:03:51.109> Desa<00:03:51.459> that's<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:53.859> scan<00:03:54.859> file<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
the Desa that's the scan file that the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.539 
the Desa that's the scan file that the
print<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:58.939> scanner<00:03:59.359> actually<00:03:59.689> has<00:03:59.810> pretty

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
print that scanner actually has pretty

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.490 
print that scanner actually has pretty
so<00:04:01.549> now<00:04:01.700> let's<00:04:02.269> let's<00:04:02.689> see<00:04:02.840> what's<00:04:03.109> in<00:04:03.290> there

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
so now let's let's see what's in there

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.770 
so now let's let's see what's in there
in<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.889> in<00:04:04.189> that<00:04:04.220> file<00:04:04.609> so<00:04:05.450> when<00:04:05.599> you're

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
in the in that file so when you're

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.759 
in the in that file so when you're
double<00:04:06.079> click<00:04:06.260> on<00:04:06.379> it

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
double click on it

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.619 
double click on it
that's<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.579> file<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.879> text<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.480> can

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
that's a file and that the text you can

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.890 
that's a file and that the text you can
actually<00:04:11.750> select<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.530> text<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.700> what<00:04:14.629> if<00:04:14.750> I

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
actually select the text so what if I

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.229 
actually select the text so what if I
want<00:04:15.109> to<00:04:15.200> search<00:04:15.409> it<00:04:15.650> hang<00:04:15.799> it<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:16.340> any<00:04:16.699> text<00:04:17.060> I

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
want to search it hang it so any text I

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.650 
want to search it hang it so any text I
will<00:04:17.509> just<00:04:17.870> go<00:04:18.049> say<00:04:19.000> maybe<00:04:20.000> just<00:04:20.150> search<00:04:20.599> for

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
will just go say maybe just search for

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.659 
will just go say maybe just search for
things<00:04:21.049> because<00:04:21.650> they're<00:04:21.949> suppose<00:04:22.310> for<00:04:22.520> us

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
things because they're suppose for us
