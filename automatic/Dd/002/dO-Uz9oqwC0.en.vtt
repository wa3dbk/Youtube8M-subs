 so many things to clean 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 some things I have to tick you off or 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.299
 uncheck what you want while 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
 lady here beware some operations 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.960
 are very long run so the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.460
 repairs and reconstructions and if 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.740
 you put a lot of things there that has 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:25.140
 took a lot of time with me 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.950
 I would like to appear but if we can 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.220
 leave checks 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.170
 that's it then while you run 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.460
 now be careful now to leave 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.189
 all open applications so I 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.009
 not going to do it because otherwise we 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.930
 could I could not film and so 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.460
 in fact it takes a little time 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 it's true it depends how long 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.119
 how long you have the most 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.950

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.810

 your trash to empty the cache and 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.890
