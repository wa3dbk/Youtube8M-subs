00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:13.632
 Forty years ago this week, three men boarded a space capsule 

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.833
 launched by a huge rocket and left Earth: 

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:23.866
 Ron Evans, Harrison Schmitt and Gene Cernan, three NASA astronauts. 

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.232
 It was the last Apollo mission. 

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:30.499
 Half a million people were in Cape Canaveral to watch the launch. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.733
 When they returned, twelve days later, they had completed the longest Apollo missions, 

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:43.266
 had picked up one hundred and eleven kilograms of rocks and soil, and helped to unravel the history of the moon. 

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:48.999
 In the Taurus Littrow Valley, Gene and Harrison made three outings, spending twenty-two hours outside. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 They dug three meters below the surface to collect the samples. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:03.400
 They measured lunar gravity and used seismometers, decoded the inner nature of the moon's mantle and nucleus. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.566
 On board the lunar rover they traveled thirty-six kilometers, 

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.999
 and the broken wing of their vehicle did not disturb them; 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.733
 they repaired it with an extra card and duck tape. 

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:21.566
 They returned with seven hundred and forty-one samples of different rocks and soil. 

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:27.132
 Much of what we know about the moon is due to Apollo 17. 

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:34.566
 Gene Cernan, the commander, as he was standing on the Moon for the last time, said in a determined voice: 

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:43.899
 "As I take the last step of humanity on the lunar surface I would like to say what I think the story will hold, 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.766
 that America's challenge today has shaped the destiny of tomorrow's humanity. " 

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:57.332
 The crew landed safely in the South Pacific on December 19, 1972. 

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:02.499
 These three men inspired me, and all humanity too. 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.333
 Their footprints are the last ones we made on the moon. 

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:12.233
 They challenge us and inspire us both. 

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:17.033
 I pay tribute to the crew of Apollo 17 for the risks they took, 

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:23.466
 the discoveries they made, and for the future they made possible for us all.
