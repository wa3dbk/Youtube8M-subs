I would recommend if you are driving

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.380 
I would recommend if you are driving
here<00:02:02.080> when<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.860> find<00:02:03.130> parking<00:02:03.399> try<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.210> look

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
for a parking lot with a flat weight

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.040 
for a parking lot with a flat weight
especially<00:02:07.149> if<00:02:07.509> you're<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.810> be<00:02:07.899> here

especially if you're going to be here
for<00:02:08.259> more<00:02:08.500> than<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.709> couple<00:02:08.950> hours<00:02:09.340> because

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
for more than a couple hours because

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.080 
for more than a couple hours because
parking<00:02:11.019> at<00:02:11.140> meters<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.680> going<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.310> be<00:02:12.640> really

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
parking at meters is going to be really

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:28.410 
parking at meters is going to be really
really<00:02:13.300> expensive

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.360 

so<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.930> admit<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.830> not<00:02:31.040> my

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
so I have to admit that this is not my

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.000 
so I have to admit that this is not my
expertise<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.420> really<00:02:33.140> don't<00:02:33.410> like<00:02:33.560> bartering

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
expertise I really don't like bartering

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.880 
expertise I really don't like bartering
because<00:02:34.580> I'm<00:02:34.880> kind<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.450> pushover<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.230> also

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
because I'm kind of a pushover and also

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.830 
because I'm kind of a pushover and also
I<00:02:36.920> don't<00:02:37.070> like<00:02:37.400> arguing<00:02:37.790> about<00:02:37.880> money<00:02:38.360> like<00:02:38.750> I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
I don't like arguing about money like I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.880 
I don't like arguing about money like I
think<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.110> kind<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.320> awkward<00:02:39.530> especially

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
think it's kind of awkward especially

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.460 
think it's kind of awkward especially
when<00:02:40.370> everything<00:02:40.700> here's<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.060> cheap<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:42.350> if

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
when everything here's so cheap but if

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.960 
when everything here's so cheap but if
it's<00:02:42.620> something<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.430> are<00:02:43.610> really<00:02:43.640> good

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
it's something that you are really good

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.370 
it's something that you are really good
at<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.300> should<00:02:44.480> really<00:02:44.630> give<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.930> try<00:02:45.110> like

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380

browse<00:02:59.690> before<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.230> buy<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.130> chances<00:03:01.550> are

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
browse before you buy so the chances are

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.490

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
expensive than their competitors so the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.590 
expensive than their competitors so the
best<00:03:10.280> way<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.490> find<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.820> good<00:03:10.940> deal<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.330> to

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
best way to find a good deal is to

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.290 
best way to find a good deal is to
browse<00:03:12.230> most<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.010> stores<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.670> then<00:03:14.090> come

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
browse most of the stores and then come

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.170 
browse most of the stores and then come
back<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.660> make<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> decision<00:03:14.990> so<00:03:15.830> also<00:03:16.790> keep<00:03:17.030> in

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
back and make a decision so also keep in

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.730 
back and make a decision so also keep in
mind<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.600> inventory<00:03:18.140> here<00:03:18.350> moves

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
mind that the inventory here moves

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.250 
mind that the inventory here moves
really<00:03:19.070> quickly<00:03:19.240> which<00:03:20.240> means<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.750> if<00:03:20.990> you

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
really quickly which means that if you

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.110 
really quickly which means that if you
like<00:03:21.470> an<00:03:21.620> item<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:22.100> should<00:03:22.130> probably<00:03:22.520> buy<00:03:23.060> it

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
like an item you should probably buy it

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.850 
like an item you should probably buy it
because<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.870> next<00:03:23.989> time<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.320> come<00:03:24.440> back<00:03:24.620> it's

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
because the next time you come back it's

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:35.690 
because the next time you come back it's
probably<00:03:25.010> not<00:03:25.280> going<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:25.550> there

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
