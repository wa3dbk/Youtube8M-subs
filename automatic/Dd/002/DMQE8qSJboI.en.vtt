00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.790
 Rare compounds derived from forest mold products 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.879
 amf 26 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:18.430
 Because it is difficult to supply a large amount from 10 years while being expected as a new anticancer drug 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:26.500
 Pharmaceutical manufacturer has discontinued development 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:32.340
 But this exactly the Tokyo University of Science to be mass-produced by the material of the same structure in artificial and synthetic 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 Joint research team of gackt cancer research group succeeded 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:43.830
 It is futuristic to lose day 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:46.550
 2005 Cancer Study Group with the cancer cells of 39 lines 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:54.410
 I did screening 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:01:01.340
 As a result, amf 26 performs protein modification of protein and selection of transport destination etc. 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.800
 It has very similar properties to the substance Brefeldine a, which inhibits the action of the Golgi body 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.760
 I understand that 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:14.180
 Actually af 20 log 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:16.090
 First of all we checked whether it would inhibit this room in the same way as the level signature book 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.270
 Here is that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.780
 It is in a drug-free state 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.680
 Sparkly white 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:30.120
 Will be observed for the time being is throb rhythmically 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.860
 If it falls by 125 against it 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.390
 The young way is gradually getting slower and eventually the cytoplasm 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 Splurge 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:51.510
 amf 26 is a protein that works in the Golgi apparatus 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:58.159
 It enters between the protein binds that arf 1 and gef 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:06.120
 Inhibits the activation of arf 1 and kills cancer cells 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:10.340
 Cancer Research meeting was to experiment with work on the cancer cells by using the amf 26 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.340
 It is the result of administering to Yumoto's mouse 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 If you do nothing, cancer cells will grow more and more 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:27.720
 If administered, cancer cells will be lost 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 It is a change in weight due to administration. At the beginning, weight decreases slightly but gradually recovers. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:37.440
 Indicates no major side effects 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:43.860
 Anti-cancer agents that target band Gorge is Toka anything because it is not so far 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:47.830
 Could it not be possible to mass-produce by artificial synthesis without using natural keys? 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.760
 Joint research began from such a thought 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.640
 Tokyo University of Science, was challenged in organic synthesis 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:03.560
 Professor Shiina we made 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.730
 m Jiang Pa aka mf 26 shows the form which chained two hexagonal contracts as shown in this section 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.520
 I will take you 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:15.690
 This is first what Fu in the count sense because it is has become a basic skeleton 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.840
 Is it the first problem whether it can make the form which is stuck ? 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.849
 Then this molecule is 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.849
 Other N that on a lot of carbon but is the carbon of the one one of arbitration 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.690
 There is an integrated price 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.110
 Many isomers exist 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.500
 Pan Sony has 4 hands to join 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:43.280
 The direction of the hand is important in the stereochemistry 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.720
 Do atoms bound to carbon point towards you 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.490
 It becomes a separate substance depending on whether it is facing backwards 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.740
 The one with two ways is called asymmetric carbon 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.030
 In this case seven 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:05.770
 Because there is a part called the asymmetric carbon 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:10.850
 Because it is 2-7 Pledge child that is 128 kinds of isomers are present only one we in the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.130
 As there is only one thing we want, there is a point how to rust it 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.480
 big 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:23.150
 The raw material is a challenging task 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:29.419
 We use a substance in a chain-like state, though we say that we are on a straight chain without sand 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.560
 We use a method called d Rusall's reaction on the sand molecule and put a rope in between 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.100
 Connecting to 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.860
 I will 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:42.610
 Though we've been led to as the chain and take a look all the way from the end 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.760
 I made this part and this part approach now 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:51.660
 In this state of approaching 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:57.220
 Because it was this is actually stable ones in the second it was examined stability 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:01.000
 The solid angle we wanted could not be synthesized at first 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.430
 The resulting substance is different in the three-dimensional structure of this part 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.569
 8 types 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.440
 I could get only a few of the things I wanted 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:15.990
 However 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:21.070
 Where I made such an effort to change the shape a little by putting a catalyst there 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:26.800
 If you mix a metal called aluminum into this 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:30.040
 The purple part is aluminum, but this is just ahead 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.450
 It was thought to be stable in the second 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:38.080
 This form is actually changing to the most stable form 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:47.919
 It could be obtained as a large amount of material 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:52.580
 There are 14 processes in the synthesis, but the productivity is very high with an average 90% weekly rate and a 20% overall collection rate 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:56.020
 Was able to synthesize the target substance in 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:02.500
 This is the case in the world of hope system 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:07.210
 It's a common thing, but it's like a magical powder and it's mixed as a catalyst now 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:11.680
 If that was not taken until the come take a lot of climbing we the periodic table is not contained within the head 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:16.009
 You because of that this spring of how easy the station and generally use a limited number of Dokora sides of the periodic table 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:21.050
 We know empirically, but in this case also reaction 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:24.529
 Attalla I'm sure that if aluminum is not it nice is that it is through discussion 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.830
 I came out, but I thought too 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.820
 Also of the splendidly it was actually carried out Te 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:39.040
 When we got a lot of purpose us 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:43.080
 It has the same biological activity as amf 26, which is derived from the whole m power 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:47.400
 I made the golgi splinter 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:52.580
 I'd go song of sign class put those obtained in the first time there as an inhibitor 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:55.620
 The first-in-class tweets have a tremendous commercial impact. 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:01.110
 I'm really important is that it is still the most 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:03.009
 In the sense such as this to in the first-in-class in Kusui to the Golgi targeting 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.119
 Compounds are really drug discovery 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:11.210
 And the research goes very well and the future 

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:16.639
 We think in the way that it is very wonderful if it is on the seawall 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.780
 Paper published in chemistry there Journal of Medicine published the American Chemical Society 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.820
 And 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:30.000
 I decorated the cover as a cover article 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:30.000
 The American Chemical Society has press coverage on the Internet as an important topic 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:44.220
 Development of new anti-cancer drug which gave up at once by this achievement started 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:51.020
 We are also planning efficacy and safety tests that we have tied up with pharmaceutical manufacturers 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:51.020
 Please feel free to contact us in here If you are interested about the use of the results
