00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
then I'm gonna raise the spiritual

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.660 
then I'm gonna raise the spiritual
energy<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.480> she<00:00:12.570> feels<00:00:12.870> better<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.610> I

energy so she feels better and so all I
have<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.740> say<00:00:16.920> soul

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
have to do to do that is I say soul

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.010 
have to do to do that is I say soul
energy<00:00:18.390> please<00:00:19.109> raise<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:21.660> hand<00:00:21.869> will

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
energy please raise and the hand will

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.529 
energy please raise and the hand will
start<00:00:22.260> spinning<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.220> clockwise<00:00:23.460> motion<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
start spinning in a clockwise motion and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.050 
start spinning in a clockwise motion and
I'll<00:00:25.470> notice<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> there's<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.430> field<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
I'll notice that there's a field that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.540 
I'll notice that there's a field that
will<00:00:27.180> start<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> build<00:00:27.750> off<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.529> her<00:00:28.920> body<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
will start to build off of her body and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.749 
will start to build off of her body and
what<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> soul<00:00:31.109> energy

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
what that is is the soul energy

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.430 
what that is is the soul energy
radiating<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> outside<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.960> body<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
radiating to the outside of the body and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
radiating to the outside of the body and
that's<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.160> feel<00:00:35.399> her<00:00:36.000> soul

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that's what we want to feel her soul

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.930 
that's what we want to feel her soul
feels<00:00:36.750> should<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.620> five<00:00:37.950> feet<00:00:38.280> away<00:00:38.730> from

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
feels should be like five feet away from

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.690 
feels should be like five feet away from
her<00:00:39.180> body<00:00:39.390> radius<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.590> she<00:00:41.370> should<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
her body radius so she should have a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.229 
her body radius so she should have a
very<00:00:42.059> strong<00:00:42.600> soul<00:00:43.469> projection<00:00:44.160> aura<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
very strong soul projection aura it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
very strong soul projection aura it
should<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.600> very<00:00:45.870> powerful<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:46.920> we're

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
should be very powerful and so we're

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
should be very powerful and so we're
raising<00:00:47.309> those<00:00:47.640> energies<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.420> apparently

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
raising those energies and apparently

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.970 
raising those energies and apparently
that's<00:00:49.289> relatively<00:00:49.890> deficient<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.789> her<00:00:51.000> so

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
that's relatively deficient in her so

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.250 
that's relatively deficient in her so
I'm<00:00:52.980> even<00:00:53.129> gonna<00:00:53.780> assist<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> other

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
I'm even gonna assist with the other

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
I'm even gonna assist with the other
hand<00:00:55.530> I'll<00:00:55.710> allow<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> double<00:00:56.910> dose

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
hand I'll allow it to do a double dose

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
hand I'll allow it to do a double dose
and<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:58.320> now

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and so right now

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.939 
and so right now
energies<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.280> kicking<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.730> pretty<00:00:59.940> good<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
energies are kicking up pretty good and

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
energies are kicking up pretty good and
what<00:01:01.949> they'll<00:01:02.100> notice<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> sensation<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
what they'll notice is a sensation of

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.679 
what they'll notice is a sensation of
calm<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> peace<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.479> don't

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
calm and a peace that they don't

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.250 
calm and a peace that they don't
normally<00:01:06.960> feel<00:01:10.580> sometimes<00:01:11.659> okay<00:01:12.659> Wow<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
normally feel sometimes okay Wow here we

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.980 
normally feel sometimes okay Wow here we
go<00:01:13.490> real<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.640> sometimes<00:01:15.360> they'll<00:01:15.840> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
go real good sometimes they'll be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050 
go real good sometimes they'll be
blockages<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.430> encounter<00:01:17.729> when

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
blockages that you will encounter when

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.429 
blockages that you will encounter when
you're<00:01:18.180> trying<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.780> technique<00:01:19.049> if

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you're trying to do this technique if

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.590 
you're trying to do this technique if
you<00:01:19.830> feel<00:01:20.280> somehow<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:21.420> being

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you feel somehow that you're being

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.760 
you feel somehow that you're being
blocked<00:01:22.369> simply<00:01:24.020> slow<00:01:25.020> down<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.409> when

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
blocked simply slow down you know when

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.070 
blocked simply slow down you know when
you<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> point<00:01:26.310> where<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> stop

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
you get to a point where you can stop

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
you get to a point where you can stop
stop<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.259> you're<00:01:28.380> doing<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.100> treat

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
stop what you're doing and then treat

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.569 
stop what you're doing and then treat
for<00:01:30.030> blockages<00:01:30.619> continue<00:01:31.619> raising<00:01:31.829> until

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
for blockages continue raising until

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.740 
for blockages continue raising until
maximum<00:01:33.090> thank<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.159> okay<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.570> while<00:01:36.570> that's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
maximum thank you okay so while that's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.620 
maximum thank you okay so while that's
working<00:01:37.759> I'll<00:01:38.759> show<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> how<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
working I'll show you how to do the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
working I'll show you how to do the
blockages<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.200> case<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.560> feel<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.979> don't<00:01:41.250> get

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
blockages in case I feel I don't get

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.620 
blockages in case I feel I don't get
that<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.780> any<00:01:43.079> blockages<00:01:43.619> here<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.640> just

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that I have any blockages here but just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.700 
that I have any blockages here but just
you<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.470> how<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
you know just to show you how the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
you know just to show you how the
technique<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.280> done<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.479> were

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
technique is done if there were

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.780 
technique is done if there were
blockages<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.530> say<00:01:49.680> please<00:01:49.860> remove<00:01:50.430> all

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
blockages I would say please remove all

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
blockages I would say please remove all
blockages<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.369> then<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.490> would<00:01:53.579> start<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
blockages and then it would start to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
blockages and then it would start to
spend

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
spend

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.340 
spend
and<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.270> might<00:01:57.480> be<00:01:57.510> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.930> bit<00:01:58.230> of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and so there might be a little bit of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.640 
and so there might be a little bit of
resistance<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.130> blockage<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.020> much<00:02:01.260> and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
resistance or blockage but not much and

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.410 
resistance or blockage but not much and

it is okay great okay all right so can

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.230 
it is okay great okay all right so can
you<00:02:46.950> speed<00:02:47.220> up<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> process

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
you speed up the process

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.990 
you speed up the process
all<00:02:49.170> right<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:51.840> moves<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.200> little<00:02:52.410> bit

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
all right and so it moves a little bit

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.370 
all right and so it moves a little bit
and<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.180> feel<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.540> energy<00:02:54.690> starting<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> become

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
and I feel the energy starting to become

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.590 
and I feel the energy starting to become
very<00:02:55.940> kind<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.440> active<00:02:59.090> to<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.120> about<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> best

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
very kind of active to be about the best

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.559 
very kind of active to be about the best
way<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:00.930> explain<00:03:01.080> it

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.220 

as<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.319> energy<00:03:08.560> raises<00:03:09.900> from<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.019> soul

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
as the energy raises from the soul

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.280 
as the energy raises from the soul
radiating<00:03:11.980> outward<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.329> outside<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
radiating outward to the outside of the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.119 
radiating outward to the outside of the
body<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.959> I'll<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.230> let<00:03:17.379> the<00:03:17.439> finger<00:03:17.829> spin

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
body and I'll just let the finger spin

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.479 
body and I'll just let the finger spin
until<00:03:18.340> such<00:03:18.730> time<00:03:18.969> as<00:03:18.999> it<00:03:19.480> wants<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.260> stop<00:03:20.530> or<00:03:21.430> I

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
until such time as it wants to stop or I

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.250 
until such time as it wants to stop or I
can<00:03:21.999> say<00:03:22.209> please<00:03:22.689> continue<00:03:23.290> until<00:03:23.739> done

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
can say please continue until done

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
fine

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.000 
fine
once<00:03:30.189> this<00:03:30.879> feel<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.599> soul<00:03:32.379> has<00:03:32.590> been<00:03:32.739> brought

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
once this feel the soul has been brought

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.429 
once this feel the soul has been brought
back<00:03:33.280> out<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:34.150> know<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.389> radiate<00:03:34.840> from<00:03:35.319> the

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
back out you know to radiate from the

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.580 
back out you know to radiate from the
inner<00:03:35.829> being<00:03:36.129> out<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.879> outer<00:03:37.060> being

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
inner being out to the outer being

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.259 
inner being out to the outer being
they'll<00:03:38.590> feel<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.859> much<00:03:39.249> more<00:03:39.519> sense<00:03:39.849> of<00:03:40.000> calm

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
they'll feel a much more sense of calm

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.559 
they'll feel a much more sense of calm
and<00:03:40.659> tranquility<00:03:41.439> now<00:03:42.069> we'll<00:03:42.250> go<00:03:42.400> into<00:03:42.569> more

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
and tranquility now we'll go into more

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.979 
and tranquility now we'll go into more
methods<00:03:44.079> of<00:03:44.290> solar<00:03:45.040> retrieval<00:03:45.699> and<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
methods of solar retrieval and and

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.390 
methods of solar retrieval and and
because<00:03:47.230> that's<00:03:47.379> what<00:03:47.530> this<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.099> type<00:03:48.370> of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
because that's what this is is a type of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.670 
because that's what this is is a type of
soul<00:03:48.760> retrieval<00:03:49.060> but<00:03:49.870> there's<00:03:50.109> there's<00:03:50.379> more

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
soul retrieval but there's there's more

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.959 
soul retrieval but there's there's more
advanced<00:03:51.519> methods<00:03:51.909> of<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:53.079> is<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.319> very

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:53.969 
advanced methods of this this is a very

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.289 
advanced methods of this this is a very
standard<00:03:54.989> treatment<00:03:56.849> so<00:03:57.849> there<00:03:57.969> wasn't<00:03:58.269> a

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
standard treatment so there wasn't a

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.849 
standard treatment so there wasn't a
whole<00:03:58.449> lot<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.629> intricacy<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.620> doesn't

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
whole lot of intricacy and it doesn't

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.009 
whole lot of intricacy and it doesn't
have<00:03:59.949> to<00:04:00.099> be<00:04:00.189> intricate<00:04:00.639> you<00:04:00.849> know<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:01.659> right

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
have to be intricate you know this right

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.080 
have to be intricate you know this right
here<00:04:02.199> will<00:04:02.379> work<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:02.739> most<00:04:03.189> any<00:04:03.400> situation

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
here will work for most any situation

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.059 
here will work for most any situation
that<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.840> run<00:04:05.019> across<00:04:05.109> it's<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.739> simply<00:04:06.040> a

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
that you run across it's just simply a

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.800 
that you run across it's just simply a
matter<00:04:06.129> of<00:04:06.370> testing<00:04:06.639> and<00:04:07.030> doing<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.449> testing

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
matter of testing and doing and testing

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.020 
matter of testing and doing and testing
and<00:04:07.930> doing<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.349> then<00:04:08.949> it'll<00:04:09.430> clear<00:04:09.699> right<00:04:09.879> out

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
and doing and then it'll clear right out

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.429

still mounting as I'm removing all the
other<00:05:48.710> ones<00:05:48.950> so<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.610> source<00:05:49.850> of<00:05:50.180> where<00:05:50.750> the

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
other ones so the source of where the

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.270 
other ones so the source of where the

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.090 
contaminants are coming from may still

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
be active because she may still be

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.150 
be active because she may still be
detoxing<00:05:55.820> negative<00:05:56.210> energies<00:05:56.570> so<00:05:57.470> I<00:05:57.740> asked

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
detoxing negative energies so I asked

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.730 
detoxing negative energies so I asked
how<00:05:58.340> are<00:05:58.370> you<00:05:58.520> feeling<00:05:58.820> right<00:05:58.850> now<00:05:59.620> okay

the<00:06:04.460> room<00:06:04.669> let's<00:06:05.120> check<00:06:05.330> for<00:06:05.540> that<00:06:05.660> now<00:06:06.460> has

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
the room let's check for that now has

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.310 
the room let's check for that now has
the<00:06:07.669> room<00:06:07.880> and<00:06:08.090> all<00:06:08.180> people<00:06:08.540> involved<00:06:09.080> been

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
the room and all people involved been

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.990 
the room and all people involved been
completely<00:06:09.710> removed<00:06:10.130> of<00:06:10.280> any<00:06:10.430> contaminants

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
completely removed of any contaminants

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.460 
completely removed of any contaminants
okay<00:06:11.900> great<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:13.010> we<00:06:13.130> get<00:06:13.280> a<00:06:13.310> check<00:06:13.610> yes<00:06:13.880> on<00:06:14.120> that

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
okay great so we get a check yes on that

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.219 
okay great so we get a check yes on that
very<00:06:15.470> simple<00:06:15.919> protocol<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:17.000> go<00:06:17.150> through<00:06:17.510> we

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
very simple protocol to go through we

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.430 
very simple protocol to go through we
check<00:06:18.470> each<00:06:18.500> one<00:06:18.890> of<00:06:19.010> them<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.690> we<00:06:20.690> go<00:06:20.870> from

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
check each one of them and we go from

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.150 
check each one of them and we go from
spiritual<00:06:22.010> to<00:06:22.790> emotional<00:06:23.540> to<00:06:23.900> physical<00:06:24.500> to

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
spiritual to emotional to physical to

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.850 
spiritual to emotional to physical to
energetic<00:06:25.700> and<00:06:26.030> then<00:06:26.510> to<00:06:26.690> other<00:06:26.870> after<00:06:27.710> we've

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
energetic and then to other after we've

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.620 
energetic and then to other after we've
checked<00:06:27.890> the<00:06:28.280> five<00:06:28.520> main<00:06:28.820> categories<00:06:29.030> and

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
checked the five main categories and

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.750 
checked the five main categories and
everything<00:06:29.930> comes<00:06:30.169> up<00:06:30.350> clean<00:06:30.590> then<00:06:31.400> we<00:06:31.550> move

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
everything comes up clean then we move

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.900 
everything comes up clean then we move
on<00:06:31.940> to<00:06:32.240> our<00:06:32.390> soul<00:06:32.810> repair<00:06:33.229> technique<00:06:34.040> which<00:06:34.729> is

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
on to our soul repair technique which is

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.610 
on to our soul repair technique which is
the<00:06:35.120> last<00:06:35.270> part<00:06:35.600> where<00:06:35.780> we<00:06:35.870> raise<00:06:36.110> the<00:06:36.410> soul

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
the last part where we raise the soul

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.250 
the last part where we raise the soul
energy<00:06:37.030> to<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.150> outside<00:06:38.510> of<00:06:38.600> the<00:06:38.660> body<00:06:38.870> if<00:06:39.110> we

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
energy to the outside of the body if we

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260 
energy to the outside of the body if we
run<00:06:39.440> in<00:06:39.560> you<00:06:39.860> can<00:06:40.010> check<00:06:40.250> for<00:06:40.400> blockages<00:06:40.610> first

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
run in you can check for blockages first

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.770 
run in you can check for blockages first
okay<00:06:42.140> before<00:06:43.010> you<00:06:43.580> start<00:06:43.970> working<00:06:44.210> on<00:06:44.479> the

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
okay before you start working on the

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.500 
okay before you start working on the
soul<00:06:45.110> I<00:06:45.410> kind<00:06:46.190> of<00:06:46.280> intuitively<00:06:46.910> know<00:06:47.210> from

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
soul I kind of intuitively know from

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.840 
soul I kind of intuitively know from
other<00:06:47.690> techniques<00:06:48.530> that<00:06:48.680> you<00:06:49.430> know<00:06:49.520> there<00:06:49.700> was

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
other techniques that you know there was

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.430 
other techniques that you know there was
either<00:06:50.060> very<00:06:50.390> little<00:06:50.720> blockage<00:06:51.140> or<00:06:51.260> no

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
either very little blockage or no

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.560 
either very little blockage or no
blockage<00:06:51.860> at<00:06:52.010> all<00:06:52.160> so<00:06:52.760> I<00:06:52.790> could<00:06:53.090> go<00:06:53.240> ahead<00:06:53.390> and

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
blockage at all so I could go ahead and

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.630 
blockage at all so I could go ahead and
raise<00:06:53.870> those<00:06:54.229> energies<00:06:54.650> and<00:06:55.160> then<00:06:55.340> do<00:06:55.490> the

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
raise those energies and then do the

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.930 
raise those energies and then do the
unblocking<00:06:56.270> later<00:06:57.020> but<00:06:57.860> you<00:06:58.310> may<00:06:58.460> will<00:06:58.700> feel

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
unblocking later but you may will feel

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.090 
unblocking later but you may will feel
comfortable<00:06:59.210> with<00:07:00.140> doing<00:07:00.290> the<00:07:00.500> unblocking

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
comfortable with doing the unblocking

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.430 
comfortable with doing the unblocking
first<00:07:01.460> and<00:07:01.790> then<00:07:02.419> trying<00:07:02.750> to<00:07:02.810> raise<00:07:03.050> the<00:07:03.229> soul

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
first and then trying to raise the soul

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.740 
first and then trying to raise the soul
energies<00:07:03.890> that's<00:07:04.460> kind<00:07:04.790> of<00:07:04.850> like<00:07:04.970> treating

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
energies that's kind of like treating

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.750 
energies that's kind of like treating
all<00:07:05.960> resistances<00:07:06.710> first<00:07:07.010> like<00:07:07.310> we<00:07:07.430> did<00:07:07.580> at<00:07:07.729> the

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
all resistances first like we did at the

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.180 
all resistances first like we did at the
beginning<00:07:07.880> of<00:07:08.240> the<00:07:08.330> video<00:07:08.630> and<00:07:09.410> that's<00:07:09.979> very

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
beginning of the video and that's very

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.020 
beginning of the video and that's very
important<00:07:10.669> to<00:07:10.729> treat<00:07:10.910> all<00:07:11.090> resistances<00:07:11.690> for

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
important to treat all resistances for

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.150 
important to treat all resistances for
and<00:07:12.120> you<00:07:12.210> can<00:07:12.330> do<00:07:12.420> the<00:07:12.540> same<00:07:12.750> thing<00:07:13.020> with<00:07:14.010> the

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
and you can do the same thing with the

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.760 
and you can do the same thing with the
unblocking<00:07:14.910> of<00:07:15.060> the<00:07:15.150> soul<00:07:15.390> before<00:07:16.170> you<00:07:16.530> raise

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
unblocking of the soul before you raise

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.320 
unblocking of the soul before you raise
the<00:07:16.980> soul<00:07:17.190> energy<00:07:17.550> but<00:07:17.790> it's<00:07:17.940> not<00:07:18.120> always

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
the soul energy but it's not always

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.600 
the soul energy but it's not always
necessary<00:07:19.280> sometimes<00:07:20.280> it's<00:07:20.460> not<00:07:20.550> necessary

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
necessary sometimes it's not necessary

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.240 
necessary sometimes it's not necessary
at<00:07:21.270> all<00:07:21.420> because<00:07:22.140> they<00:07:22.710> may<00:07:22.860> not<00:07:22.920> have<00:07:23.070> a

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
at all because they may not have a

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.310 
at all because they may not have a
problem<00:07:23.580> with<00:07:23.820> communication<00:07:24.510> from<00:07:24.960> the<00:07:25.020> soul

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.320 
problem with communication from the soul

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.080 
problem with communication from the soul
to<00:07:25.620> the<00:07:25.710> outside<00:07:26.040> of<00:07:26.070> the<00:07:26.220> body<00:07:26.370> it<00:07:26.790> just<00:07:26.970> may

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.090 
to the outside of the body it just may

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.120 
to the outside of the body it just may
be<00:07:27.120> weak<00:07:27.480> and<00:07:27.780> so<00:07:28.320> it<00:07:28.500> just<00:07:28.710> may<00:07:28.800> need<00:07:29.040> this

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
be weak and so it just may need this

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.780 
be weak and so it just may need this
energy<00:07:29.640> raised<00:07:29.880> so<00:07:30.780> that<00:07:30.930> it<00:07:31.050> can<00:07:31.170> radiate

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
energy raised so that it can radiate

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:38.150 
energy raised so that it can radiate
appropriately<00:07:33.470> so<00:07:34.470> that<00:07:35.100> covers<00:07:35.370> a<00:07:35.550> basic<00:07:37.160> 20

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 
appropriately so that covers a basic 20

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.480 
appropriately so that covers a basic 20
to<00:07:38.310> 30<00:07:38.580> minute<00:07:38.910> session<00:07:39.300> with<00:07:40.050> divine<00:07:40.980> gesture

to 30 minute session with divine gesture
remember<00:07:42.390> you<00:07:42.510> can<00:07:42.630> also<00:07:42.780> use<00:07:43.170> your<00:07:43.380> rod<00:07:43.620> or

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.190 
remember you can also use your rod or

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.420 
remember you can also use your rod or
your<00:07:44.520> pendulum<00:07:45.169> to<00:07:46.169> do<00:07:46.290> the<00:07:46.470> exact<00:07:46.860> same<00:07:47.100> thing

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.430 
your pendulum to do the exact same thing

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.130 
your pendulum to do the exact same thing
the<00:07:48.060> only<00:07:48.150> difference<00:07:48.270> is<00:07:48.600> I'm<00:07:48.780> just<00:07:48.990> using

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.140 
the only difference is I'm just using

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.710 
the only difference is I'm just using
divine<00:07:49.530> gesture<00:07:50.010> versus<00:07:50.880> a<00:07:50.910> row<00:07:51.300> or<00:07:51.600> a

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 
divine gesture versus a row or a

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.070 
divine gesture versus a row or a
pendulum<00:07:52.050> you<00:07:52.890> shouldn't<00:07:53.280> be<00:07:53.930> dependent<00:07:54.930> on

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 
pendulum you shouldn't be dependent on

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.900 
pendulum you shouldn't be dependent on
the<00:07:55.320> tool<00:07:55.530> you<00:07:56.100> should<00:07:56.280> be<00:07:56.400> able<00:07:56.550> to<00:07:56.790> do

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:56.910 
the tool you should be able to do

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.300 
the tool you should be able to do
everything<00:07:57.210> without<00:07:57.990> any<00:07:58.200> help<00:07:58.680> from<00:07:58.860> anyone

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.310 
everything without any help from anyone

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.990 
everything without any help from anyone
except<00:08:00.150> for<00:08:00.390> all<00:08:00.900> that<00:08:01.230> is<00:08:01.410> so<00:08:02.130> you<00:08:02.640> can't<00:08:02.880> even
