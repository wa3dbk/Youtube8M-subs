00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.730
 to make this necklace we are going to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 need the following materials 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.189
 inks to alcohol polymer clay 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.230
 white or translucent a piece of felt 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.360
 white alcohol 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.000
 liquid clay of cat or brand 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 heat gun this is optional in 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 case you want to give it a finish 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 bright to the collar 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.300
 we start by cutting a piece of felt 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.210
 the size of our ink applicator 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.370
 If you do not have an applicator you can use 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.800
 the piece of felt directly or 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.980
 make a homemade applicator with a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.380
 piece of wood or cardboard and cro 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
 we stick the felt on the applicator and 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.850
 pour some drops of different 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.740
 colors of alcohol inks with a couple 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.740
 of drops of each color is enough 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.740
 two 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.020
 we finished with a few drops of alcohol 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.149
 to dilute the ink 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.280
 Now we apply the ink on a 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.049
 Thick sheet of white clay or 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.880
 translucent performing movements 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.880
 circular and tapping 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.060
 i 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.659
 to lighten the colors a little 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.229
 Take a few drops of alcohol and dry with 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.229
 a washcloth 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 yes 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.489
 we continue to apply ink until 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.489
 we are happy with the result 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.880
 Now let's cut the shape of the necklace 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.200
 for this we can draw a template 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.180
 place it on the sheet and cut 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.820
 around with a small cutter or a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.410
 scalpel but we can also cut the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.310
 clay with cutters of different 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.310
 Shapes and sizes 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.230
 Y 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.620
 the finish that I chose is with clay 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.540
 cat brand liquid or even if it 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.590
 you prefer you can leave it mates without 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.900
 apply liquid clay or varnish 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.010
 We spread a layer of liquid kato with 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.010
 finger on all pieces 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.110
 Y 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 Y 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.010
 Y 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.709
 Y 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.650
 we bake about 15 minutes to the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.790
 temperature indicated by the manufacturer of 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.140
 the brand of clay that we are 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.300
 using 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.030
 When leaving the oven the pieces will be 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.860
 blanquecinas so that the Catholic remains 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.110
 transparent and bright 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.819
 you have to hit him with the heat gun and 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.510
 we will see how it is acquiring an aspect 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.510
 crystalline 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.430
 Y 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.050
 to make the back of the pieces the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.629
 we place on a clay sheet 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.379
 medium thick black and we paste them with 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.379
 liquid clay 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.860
 you 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.020
 we cut around with a cutter leaving 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.020
 a small margin 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.189
 two 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.360
 now we raise the margin that we have 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.500
 left and we're hitting the 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.500
 side of the pieces 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.580
 we cut the excess with a knife 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 yes 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.520
 i 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.770
 we give texture to the back and the 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.500
 side with a sponge or with a 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.270
 coarse grain sandpaper in this case I have 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.460
 used a sponge that you can find 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.650
 in pet stores since it is used 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.600
 as aquarium filter is a material 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.760
 very cheap and it comes in handy for 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.920
 get texture that besides giving it a 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.360
 most interesting aspect to the piece we 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.080
 will help hide errors or 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.080
 imperfections 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.940
 finally we return to bake about 20 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.599
 minutes at the temperature indicated by the 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.599
 maker 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.460
 and that's how our necklace looks 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.460
 finished 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.610
 Below you can see two videos in 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.130
 I show you how to make two more 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.690
 necklaces in polymer clay 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.360
 using the mica shift technique in 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:04.150
 the first and stamped chevron in the 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.250
 second I hope you like them and see you 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.080
