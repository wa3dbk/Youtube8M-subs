finally<00:00:12.030> getting<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.690> new<00:00:13.170> computer<00:00:13.590> okay<00:00:14.099> now

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
finally getting a new computer okay now

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.680 
finally getting a new computer okay now
take<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.610> look<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.030> right<00:00:15.269> here<00:00:15.299> take<00:00:15.660> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
take a look at this right here take a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.890 
take a look at this right here take a
look<00:00:15.780> take<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> look<00:00:16.619> at<00:00:16.859> him<00:00:17.600> okay<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.660> that's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
look take a look at him okay so that's

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.599 
look take a look at him okay so that's
the<00:00:19.109> computer<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.680> i<00:00:19.710> currently<00:00:19.830> use<00:00:20.220> will

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the computer that i currently use will

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.759 
the computer that i currently use will
get<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> little<00:00:21.000> bit<00:00:21.119> closer<00:00:21.390> i've<00:00:22.380> been<00:00:22.590> using

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
get a little bit closer i've been using

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.470 
get a little bit closer i've been using
this<00:00:23.010> computer<00:00:23.519> probably<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
this computer probably for about the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.170 
this computer probably for about the
last<00:00:24.510> eight<00:00:24.900> months<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> bad

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
last eight months or so it's not a bad

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
last eight months or so it's not a bad
computer<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.590> gets<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> job<00:00:29.099> done

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
computer you know it gets the job done

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.490 
computer you know it gets the job done
it's<00:00:29.760> definitely<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.660> definitely<00:00:31.109> not

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it's definitely it's definitely not

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.330 
it's definitely it's definitely not
horrible<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:34.130> probably<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
horrible but this thing is probably the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.010 
horrible but this thing is probably the
slowest<00:00:36.440> rendering<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.309> worst<00:00:39.020> okay

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
slowest rendering the worst okay

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.770 
slowest rendering the worst okay
basically<00:00:40.590> I'm<00:00:40.680> trying<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> stay<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
basically I'm trying to stay here so I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
basically I'm trying to stay here so I
can't<00:00:43.200> run<00:00:43.410> 60<00:00:43.860> frames<00:00:44.100> per<00:00:44.219> second<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.820> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
can't run 60 frames per second on this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
can't run 60 frames per second on this
because<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.480> computer<00:00:45.930> literally<00:00:46.410> can't

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
because the computer literally can't

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.260 
because the computer literally can't
handle<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> might<00:00:47.489> explode<00:00:47.969> every

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
handle I think it might explode every

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
handle I think it might explode every
time<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> try<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> run<00:00:48.960> 60<00:00:49.320> frames<00:00:49.530> per<00:00:49.680> second

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
time I try to run 60 frames per second

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
time I try to run 60 frames per second
on<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.280> livestream<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> can't<00:00:51.989> render

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
on my livestream also it can't render

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319 
on my livestream also it can't render
videos<00:00:52.590> while<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> live<00:00:53.460> stream<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:53.969> also

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
videos while I live stream that's also

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.689 
videos while I live stream that's also
something<00:00:54.510> that's<00:00:54.690> annoying<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> this

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
something that's annoying so this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
something that's annoying so this
computer<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.780> given<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> me<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> gift<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
computer was given to me as a gift and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.380 
computer was given to me as a gift and
this<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> gift<00:00:59.489> from<00:00:59.550> Hector<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.180> don't<00:01:00.329> know

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this was a gift from Hector I don't know

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.819 
this was a gift from Hector I don't know

duty ghosts marathon live stream when we

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.469 
duty ghosts marathon live stream when we
ran<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.860> long<00:01:05.280> long<00:01:05.640> time<00:01:05.909> ago<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.390> I've

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
ran that a long long time ago so I've

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
ran that a long long time ago so I've
been<00:01:06.600> using<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.960> computer<00:01:07.439> since<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
been using this computer since then so

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
been using this computer since then so
probably<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.760> probably<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.840> 12<00:01:10.680> probably<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
probably like probably got 12 probably a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.359 
probably like probably got 12 probably a
year<00:01:11.729> almost<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.830> Hector<00:01:13.830> didn't<00:01:14.070> want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> do

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
year almost so Hector didn't want to do

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.109 
year almost so Hector didn't want to do
his<00:01:14.549> shift<00:01:14.869> his<00:01:15.869> shift<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.409> 12<00:01:16.890> a.m.<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.820> six

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
his shift his shift was 12 a.m. to six

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
his shift his shift was 12 a.m. to six
a.m.<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> morning<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> 24<00:01:19.860> hour

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
a.m. in the morning it was a 24 hour

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.249 
a.m. in the morning it was a 24 hour
livestream<00:01:20.430> hence<00:01:21.150> hence<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> marathon

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
livestream hence hence the marathon

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.800 
livestream hence hence the marathon
stream<00:01:22.619> term<00:01:23.060> um<00:01:24.060> he<00:01:24.330> didn't<00:01:24.509> want<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
stream term um he didn't want to do a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.590 
stream term um he didn't want to do a
shift<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:26.310> doubling<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.119> already<00:01:27.360> had

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
shift so I was doubling up I already had

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.560 
shift so I was doubling up I already had
done<00:01:27.780> my<00:01:27.990> shift<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> basically<00:01:29.430> went<00:01:30.150> 12

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
done my shift so I basically went 12

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
done my shift so I basically went 12
hours<00:01:30.869> straight<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> went<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:31.950> six<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
hours straight so I went from six to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.310 
hours straight so I went from six to
twelve<00:01:32.759> i<00:01:32.970> believe<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.780> i<00:01:33.810> also<00:01:33.930> took

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
twelve i believe and then i also took

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.069 
twelve i believe and then i also took
twelve<00:01:35.250> six<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:35.970> went<00:01:36.150> 12<00:01:36.570> hours<00:01:36.869> straight

playing call of duty ghosts now remember
this<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.750> first<00:01:39.780> came<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this was when it first came out so it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
this was when it first came out so it
was<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.070> was<00:01:41.189> bearable<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.820> maybe<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> wasn't

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
was it was bearable or maybe it wasn't

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.789 
and the computer just like basically
shut<00:03:13.510> down<00:03:13.689> and<00:03:13.840> crumble<00:03:14.139> on<00:03:14.230> itself<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.769> that

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
shut down and crumble on itself so that

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.559 
shut down and crumble on itself so that
was<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> pretty<00:03:15.250> nice<00:03:15.459> computer<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.269> could<00:03:16.450> do

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
was a pretty nice computer it could do

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.969 
was a pretty nice computer it could do
all<00:03:16.689> the<00:03:16.810> things<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.229> my<00:03:17.379> new<00:03:17.530> computers
