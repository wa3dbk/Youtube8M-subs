00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello to all today I have you 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.990
 prepared a good little video on the 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.070
 top of the pecs so I know he 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.019
 a few months ago I had made you a 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.129
 video about the inside of the pecs in you 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.139
 saying that unfortunately it was 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.430
 not possible to target only this 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.780
 area there for the top of the pectoral 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.860
 thankfully it's different and 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.570
 today I promise you I will 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.280
 give you real advice from 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.990
 tips that you will be able to integrate 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.670
 at your sessions to make sure that 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.020
 your workouts be more effective 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.550
 then it's funny because in 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.740
 watching a little bit the videos on 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.180
 youtube that deal with the subject I have 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.949
 not found one that covered 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.359
 bases that essentially 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.249
 precisely so that you can 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.109
 modify your sessions and make sure 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:41.300
 that it be more effective to throw a 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.620
 take a look at the big breastplate at 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.929
 what does it look like with our schemas 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.530
 favorite the pectoralis major these compounds of 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.629
 two chefs 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.550
 the chief the sternal chief pardon who 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.530
 insert which fits on the sternum 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.390
 and the clavicular head am who we 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.979
 interested today which fits on 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.300
 The collarbone 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.039
 listen well to the sentence I'm going to 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.409
 give to have a contraction 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.129
 complete to stimulate at best a 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.109
 muscle group 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.449
 the trajectory of your 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.340
 movement is aligned with the fibers 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.040
 muscular take a quick look 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.350
 in the sense of muscle fibers for the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.909
 part of life that read the part 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.049
 clavicular she leaves from inside the 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.329
 arm and she arrives on the collarbones 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.340
 the fibers are not horizontal 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.170
 the fibers go slightly upwards 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.159
 so what does that mean ah 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.600
 means that when you do a 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.549
 movement for the top of the pectorals 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.740
 it is absolutely not necessary that your 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.939
 elbow is raised to the maximum 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.859
 contrary it will have to go down 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.140
 slightly elbows to make 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.600
 so that the angle between the arm and the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.070
 bust is slightly closed we have 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.659
 tend to forget that the principle of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
 bodybuilding the principle of your sessions 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.490
 cdh stretched a muscle to the maximum but 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.020
 also to contract it to the maximum and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.700
 unfortunately if the trajectory of 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.049
 your movement 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.329
 is not aligned with the fibers 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.399
 muscular you will not go there went 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.680
 pull or to contract the maximum 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.929
 that's why it's so important 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.939
 begins to be concretely translated into 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.020
 the exercises you use for the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.679
 top of the pecs throw a little bang 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.079
 look at the execution of a spread of a 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.819
 spread inclined with the futures the 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.769
 most of the time we tend to go out 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.349
 elbows to the maximum to make 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.930
 so that the handles of the elbows and the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.269
 shoulders be aligned to my eyes is to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.860
 my taste is a mistake it is necessary that the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.290
 trajectory of movement precisely either 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.700
 adapted to the fiber trajectory 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.560
 muscle and for that it will have to 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.760
 close a little bit your elbows so 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.950
 when you do your movement 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.019
 to spread aside instead of spreading on the side 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.299
 we will have to remove germs between 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.549
 on the bench and that's a tip that's 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.140
 applicable on all movements for 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.329
 the top of the pectorals throw a small 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.849
 look what it looks like on a 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.140
 developed inclined to the bar in general 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.880
 we develop it is inclined we have 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.250
 tendency to get down the bar at 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.780
 high level of clavicles 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.069
 elbows up to once again 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.350
 for this exercise 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.780
 in my eyes it's a small mistake and 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.430
 blow it will have to change the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.260
 trajectory make sure that the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.060
 elbows be slightly tucked in and out 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.440
 blow down the bar higher level 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.510
 of the chest to make sure 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.870
 precisely that the top of the payx oit and 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.840
 drawn 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.130
 and then contract to the maximum and this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.209
 which is interesting with the tips 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.980
 that I have just given you is that they 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.549
 are applicable for all groups 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.590
 muscle 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.819
 take a look at the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.299
 meaning of the fibers for bathing 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.950
 pectorals 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
 we tend to believe that the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.780
 optimal trajectory for the bottom of the 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.850
 pectorals 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.959
 it's a horizontal trajectory 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.489
 once it's a mistake 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.380
 the optimal trajectory is a 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.480
 trajectory that goes down this 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.980
 way you will be able to move away 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.500
 insertions as much as possible ie 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.299
 stretch the muscle to the maximum and 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.709
 to bring closer the insertions the more 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.380
 possible that is to say contracted on 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.630
 maximum muscle and 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.210
 allow you to continue to progress 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.930
 by optimally stimulating each 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.000
 muscle group 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.350
 I hope you will have appreciated 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.890
 these little tips on the top of 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.200
 pectorals 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.850
 do not hesitate to change the position of 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.860
 your elbows accordingly a to do 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.990
 in order to optimize the contraction of the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.520
 top of the pecs test it in your 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.870
 next chest session tell me this 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.540
 as you think in the comments 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.310
 if you liked a little like on the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.320
 video do not hesitate to share it well 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.390
 sure subscribe to the channel we get 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.230
 See you soon for more tips 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.230
 the other muscle groups
