00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.870 
and zoom in here for you guys so this
obviously<00:01:25.500> doesn't<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.189> stock<00:01:26.460> head<00:01:26.729> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
obviously doesn't have the stock head on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.140 
obviously doesn't have the stock head on
it<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.479> an<00:01:27.630> upgraded<00:01:28.020> head<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.490> which

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it it has an upgraded head and which

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.700 
it it has an upgraded head and which
does<00:01:30.390> actually<00:01:30.630> offer<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.320> more

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
does actually offer a little bit more

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.399 
does actually offer a little bit more
top<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.490> well<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.820> low<00:01:33.000> whine<00:01:33.150> power<00:01:33.409> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
top and as well as low whine power so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.260 
top and as well as low whine power so
that<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> upgraded<00:01:35.070> head<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> said

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that is the upgraded head like I said

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.810 
that is the upgraded head like I said
often<00:01:36.540> 28<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> pull<00:01:38.640> start

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
often 28 in there this is a pull start

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
often 28 in there this is a pull start
motor<00:01:39.060> fire<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.590> quick

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
motor fire is up really really quick

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.270 
motor fire is up really really quick
often<00:01:41.759> two<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> three<00:01:42.240> pulls<00:01:42.450> max<00:01:42.979> fires<00:01:43.979> rate

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
often two to three pulls max fires rate

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
often two to three pulls max fires rate
of<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.270> running<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.720> Bob<00:01:45.869> Byron<00:01:46.439> 20

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
of this was running to Bob Byron 20

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.710 
of this was running to Bob Byron 20
percent<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.060> said<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.450> it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
percent and like I said it's it's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
percent and like I said it's it's
honestly<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.439> great<00:01:49.500> motor<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> jam

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
honestly a great motor it's got the jam

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.810 
honestly a great motor it's got the jam
and<00:01:51.600> gp3<00:01:52.140> pipe<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.399> motor<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and gp3 pipe on there this motor just

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.499 
and gp3 pipe on there this motor just
rips<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.479> pipe<00:01:55.340> also<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.640> also<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
rips with that pipe also it also has the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.649 
rips with that pipe also it also has the
servos<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.469> all<00:01:58.619> obviously<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.700> so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
servos which are all obviously there so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
one right there both servos are actually

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.070 
one right there both servos are actually
really<00:02:14.040> nice<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.580> quick<00:02:14.849> servos<00:02:15.269> like<00:02:15.989> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
really nice really quick servos like I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.240 
really nice really quick servos like I
said<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.349> want<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> go<00:02:16.590> check<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> video

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
you'll see this whole thing in action

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.320 
you'll see this whole thing in action
here<00:02:19.250> over<00:02:20.250> all<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.610> suspensions<00:02:21.150> they've

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
here over all the suspensions they've

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.110 
here over all the suspensions they've
got<00:02:21.540> 30<00:02:22.050> 40<00:02:22.500> weight<00:02:22.769> oil<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.030> is

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
got 30 40 weight oil and it's so it is

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.220 
got 30 40 weight oil and it's so it is
definitely<00:02:24.269> set<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> little<00:02:24.750> bit<00:02:24.840> stiffer

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230

little bit more overall if you take a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.280 
little bit more overall if you take a
look<00:02:40.019> at<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.200> bottom<00:02:40.380> as<00:02:40.620> well<00:02:42.019> there<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.140> can

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
look at the bottom as well there you can

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.500 
look at the bottom as well there you can
zoom<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.799> little<00:02:43.860> bit<00:02:44.099> here<00:02:44.420> bottom<00:02:45.420> is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
zoom out a little bit here bottom is

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.479 
zoom out a little bit here bottom is
obviously<00:02:45.810> very<00:02:45.870> nice<00:02:46.260> hardly<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> scratch<00:02:47.099> on

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
obviously very nice hardly a scratch on
