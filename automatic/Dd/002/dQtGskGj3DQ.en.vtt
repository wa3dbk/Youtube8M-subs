by serial number the engine dates in

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.109 
by serial number the engine dates in
1922<00:01:24.540> however<00:01:25.740> from<00:01:26.740> what<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:26.979> heard<00:01:27.399> and<00:01:27.729> talk

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
1922 however from what I heard and talk

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.249 
1922 however from what I heard and talk
to<00:01:28.240> people<00:01:29.490> didn't<00:01:30.490> heavy<00:01:30.640> Kazon<00:01:31.270> until<00:01:31.540> 24<00:01:32.080> we

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
to people didn't heavy Kazon until 24 we

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.880 
to people didn't heavy Kazon until 24 we
meet<00:01:32.500> when<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.950> EK<00:01:33.220> came<00:01:33.490> out<00:01:33.670> so<00:01:34.890> I'm

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
meet when the EK came out so I'm

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.600 
meet when the EK came out so I'm
thinking<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:38.100> didn't<00:01:39.100> mean<00:01:39.190> they<00:01:39.460> had

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
thinking that didn't mean they had

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.570 
thinking that didn't mean they had
Webster's<00:01:40.119> before<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.660> UK's<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.280> guess

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
Webster's before the UK's so I guess

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.550 
Webster's before the UK's so I guess
maybe<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.030> an<00:01:43.240> EK<00:01:43.570> conversion<00:01:44.229> that's<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
maybe it's an EK conversion that's the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
maybe it's an EK conversion that's the
way<00:01:44.649> after<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.070> Webster<00:01:45.550> died<00:01:45.759> I<00:01:45.789> don't<00:01:46.030> know

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
way after the Webster died I don't know

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270 
way after the Webster died I don't know
you<00:01:49.270> know<00:01:49.300> it's<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.320> ruffle<00:01:50.679> contention<00:01:51.100> but

pleased with it it's a tough me a big
engine<00:03:45.630> doesn't<00:03:46.630> look<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.020> big<00:03:47.230> when<00:03:47.560> we

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
engine doesn't look so big when we

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.449 
engine doesn't look so big when we
sitting<00:03:47.980> on<00:03:48.040> four<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.780> it's<00:03:49.780> pretty<00:03:49.930> big<00:03:51.450> no

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
sitting on four but it's pretty big no

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.410 
sitting on four but it's pretty big no
that's<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.550> big<00:03:54.700> cylinder<00:03:59.010> yeah<00:04:00.180> intake<00:04:01.180> valve

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
that's a big cylinder yeah intake valve

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.970 
that's a big cylinder yeah intake valve
is<00:04:01.600> free<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.170> exhaust<00:04:02.500> valve<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.280> stuck<00:04:04.980> so

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
is free the exhaust valve is stuck so

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.250 
is free the exhaust valve is stuck so
it's<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.760> real<00:04:07.000> careful<00:04:07.390> pot<00:04:07.540> rotating<00:04:08.170> it

opposite<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.170> magneto<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.830> don't<00:04:22.070> know<00:04:22.360> before

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
opposite the magneto I don't know before

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.330 
opposite the magneto I don't know before
I<00:04:23.390> understand<00:04:23.930> that's<00:04:24.050> kind<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.440> uncommon<00:04:24.920> for

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
I understand that's kind of uncommon for

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.860 
I understand that's kind of uncommon for
the<00:04:25.460> smaller<00:04:25.880> engines<00:04:26.450> like<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.690> two

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
the smaller engines like the two

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.970 
the smaller engines like the two
horsepower<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.860> don't<00:04:28.700> know<00:04:28.820> if<00:04:29.000> it's<00:04:29.150> as

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
horsepower I don't know if it's as

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.410 
horsepower I don't know if it's as
uncommon<00:04:30.980> on<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.130> larger<00:04:31.760> engines<00:04:32.120> i'm<00:04:32.270> not

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
uncommon on the larger engines i'm not

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.060 
uncommon on the larger engines i'm not
sure<00:04:32.690> but<00:04:34.450> as<00:04:35.450> far<00:04:35.630> as<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.960> EK<00:04:36.380> conversion

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
sure but as far as the EK conversion

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.540 
sure but as far as the EK conversion
goes<00:04:38.440> i'm<00:04:39.440> pretty<00:04:39.830> sure<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.130> whole<00:04:40.310> mag

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
goes i'm pretty sure the whole mag

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.340 
goes i'm pretty sure the whole mag
bracket<00:04:41.090> was<00:04:41.270> different<00:04:41.900> if<00:04:42.080> you're<00:04:42.200> using

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
bracket was different if you're using

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.500 
bracket was different if you're using
webster<00:04:42.890> magneto<00:04:43.340> or<00:04:43.960> even<00:04:44.960> even<00:04:45.710> if<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:45.980> I

webster magneto or even even if it I

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.760 
webster magneto or even even if it I
don't<00:04:47.510> even<00:04:47.600> know<00:04:47.810> if<00:04:47.840> they<00:04:47.990> made<00:04:48.170> a<00:04:48.200> Webster

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
don't even know if they made a Webster

don't even know if they made a Webster
magneto<00:04:49.250> that<00:04:49.730> was<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.540> used<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.900> spark<00:04:51.200> plug

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
magneto that was that used to spark plug

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.380 
magneto that was that used to spark plug
if<00:04:52.070> there<00:04:52.250> are<00:04:52.340> igniter<00:04:52.730> or<00:04:53.000> what<00:04:53.150> about<00:04:53.210> what

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
if there are igniter or what about what

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.860 
if there are igniter or what about what
they<00:04:53.540> are<00:04:54.310> but<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.430> looks<00:04:55.610> pretty<00:04:55.790> original<00:04:56.390> no

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
they are but it looks pretty original no

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.450 
they are but it looks pretty original no
as<00:04:57.020> far<00:04:57.050> as<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.560> know<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.740> way<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.980> dirt<00:04:58.220> news

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
as far as you know the way the dirt news

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.260 
as far as you know the way the dirt news
on<00:04:58.610> top<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.060> everything<00:05:00.580> but<00:05:01.580> I<00:05:01.850> mean<00:05:02.060> it<00:05:02.180> was

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
on top and everything but I mean it was

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.080 
on top and everything but I mean it was
to<00:05:02.390> say<00:05:02.570> that<00:05:02.720> didn't<00:05:02.990> happen<00:05:03.820> three<00:05:04.820> years

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
to say that didn't happen three years

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.200 
to say that didn't happen three years
after<00:05:05.330> was<00:05:05.660> bought<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.350> who<00:05:06.710> knows<00:05:10.210> everything

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
after was bought so who knows everything

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.170 
after was bought so who knows everything
moves<00:05:11.600> you<00:05:12.440> Magneto's<00:05:13.430> not<00:05:13.580> frozen<00:05:13.940> or

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
moves you Magneto's not frozen or

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.180 
moves you Magneto's not frozen or
anything<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:15.620> hopefully<00:05:16.240> it'll<00:05:17.240> be<00:05:17.330> alright

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
anything and hopefully it'll be alright

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.770 
anything and hopefully it'll be alright
and<00:05:20.410> it's<00:05:21.410> pretty<00:05:21.920> paint<00:05:22.760> is<00:05:22.910> pretty<00:05:23.210> sparse

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
and it's pretty paint is pretty sparse

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.290 
and it's pretty paint is pretty sparse
on<00:05:23.990> here<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.470> little<00:05:25.430> bit<00:05:25.610> of<00:05:25.760> blue<00:05:25.910> paint<00:05:26.120> left

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
on here a little bit of blue paint left

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.150 
on here a little bit of blue paint left
on<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.540> fly<00:05:26.780> wheels<00:05:27.169> but<00:05:27.440> I'm<00:05:27.740> certainly<00:05:28.040> not

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
on the fly wheels but I'm certainly not

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.470 
on the fly wheels but I'm certainly not
going<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.370> paint<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.760> I<00:05:28.910> don't<00:05:29.060> like<00:05:29.210> to<00:05:29.240> paint

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
going to paint it I don't like to paint

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.240 
going to paint it I don't like to paint
engines<00:05:31.540> so<00:05:32.540> yeah<00:05:32.750> it's<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.410> little<00:05:33.980> bit<00:05:34.220> of

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
engines so yeah it's a little bit of

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.700 
engines so yeah it's a little bit of
that<00:05:34.340> Hercules<00:05:35.270> decal<00:05:35.720> left<00:05:36.070> not<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.100> lot

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
that Hercules decal left not a lot

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.040 
that Hercules decal left not a lot
I'm<00:05:39.640> happy<00:05:40.060> with<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.240> I<00:05:40.570> don't<00:05:40.720> know<00:05:40.810> what<00:05:40.960> I'm

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
I'm happy with it I don't know what I'm

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.580 
I'm happy with it I don't know what I'm
gonna<00:05:41.200> able<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.530> get<00:05:41.770> get<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.310> out<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.520> here
