with the controls are that a shooting

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.709 
with the controls are that a shooting
people<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> hip<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.480> almost<00:00:48.480> impossible

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
people from the hip is almost impossible

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.650 
people from the hip is almost impossible
to<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> good<00:00:50.610> shot<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.480> little

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to like get it good shot that little

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.389 
to like get it good shot that little
reticle<00:00:52.200> in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> middle<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> screen<00:00:53.070> is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
reticle in the middle of the screen is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.330 
reticle in the middle of the screen is
absolutely<00:00:54.120> useless<00:00:54.450> unless<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.469> you're<00:00:56.250> in

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
absolutely useless unless you you're in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
absolutely useless unless you you're in
slo-mo<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.379> basically<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> kill

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
slo-mo so you basically have to kill

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.420 
slo-mo so you basically have to kill
everyone<00:00:59.610> in<00:00:59.940> slo-mo<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> gun<00:01:01.739> anyway<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
everyone in slo-mo with the gun anyway I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.179 
everyone in slo-mo with the gun anyway I
mean<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:03.210> using<00:01:03.809> swordplay<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.829> until

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
mean when using swordplay which is until

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.819 
mean when using swordplay which is until
later<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.459> the<00:01:05.549> demo<00:01:05.939> um<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:07.170> works<00:01:07.469> perfectly

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
later in the demo um it works perfectly

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.620 
later in the demo um it works perfectly
but<00:01:08.459> if<00:01:08.639> you<00:01:08.759> don't<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.209> you<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.509> you're

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
but if you don't if you when you're

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.809 
but if you don't if you when you're
using<00:01:09.749> a<00:01:09.929> gun<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.889> just<00:01:11.189> impossible<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
using a gun it's just impossible to

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.300 
using a gun it's just impossible to
early<00:01:12.270> aim<00:01:12.479> from<00:01:12.749> the<00:01:12.899> hip<00:01:13.109> and<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> do

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
early aim from the hip and when you do

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
early aim from the hip and when you do
aim<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> hip<00:01:15.029> you<00:01:15.179> only<00:01:15.329> get<00:01:15.569> one<00:01:15.600> point

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
aim from the hip you only get one point

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.589 
aim from the hip you only get one point
so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.829> don't<00:01:17.429> see<00:01:17.609> the<00:01:17.729> real<00:01:17.909> purpose<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.569> that

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:18.599 
so I don't see the real purpose in that

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.230 
so I don't see the real purpose in that
I<00:01:18.929> really<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.889> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.340> although

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I really think that you know although

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.089 
I really think that you know although
aiming<00:01:21.599> from<00:01:21.749> the<00:01:21.869> hip<00:01:22.109> isn't<00:01:22.409> really<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:23.099 
aiming from the hip isn't really the

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:24.589 
aiming from the hip isn't really the
purpose<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.639> game<00:01:23.849> and<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.149> really<00:01:24.359> want

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:24.599 
purpose of the game and you really want

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.719 
purpose of the game and you really want
to<00:01:24.719> do<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.289> slow<00:01:25.679> mo<00:01:25.920> that's<00:01:26.189> kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.609> like

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to do this slow mo that's kind of like

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
to do this slow mo that's kind of like
the<00:01:27.029> reason<00:01:27.359> for<00:01:27.569> you<00:01:27.719> know<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.079> bullet<00:01:28.380> time

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the reason for you know the bullet time

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.249 
the reason for you know the bullet time
but<00:01:29.399> up<00:01:29.609> I<00:01:29.880> still<00:01:30.359> think<00:01:30.389> a<00:01:30.689> meal<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:31.049> hip

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
but up I still think a meal the hip

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.260 
but up I still think a meal the hip
should<00:01:31.529> be<00:01:31.649> somewhat<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.429> an<00:01:32.520> option<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
should be somewhat of an option and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.870 
should be somewhat of an option and
should<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> bit<00:01:34.289> easier<00:01:34.679> to<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:35.069> i<00:01:35.310> don't

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
should be a bit easier to do i don't

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.620 
should be a bit easier to do i don't
know<00:01:35.969> i<00:01:36.209> also<00:01:36.599> found<00:01:36.899> with<00:01:37.169> a<00:01:37.200> wall<00:01:37.679> running<00:01:38.009> um

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
know i also found with a wall running um

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.050 
know i also found with a wall running um
like<00:01:39.630> unlike<00:01:40.049> traditional<00:01:40.729> games<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:41.999> you

like unlike traditional games are you
also<00:01:42.240> wall<00:01:42.630> run<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.109> know<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:44.219> old

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
prince of persia zon gamecube um you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.879 
prince of persia zon gamecube um you
don't<00:01:47.759> jump<00:01:48.239> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.689> wall<00:01:48.989> run<00:01:49.319> like<00:01:49.649> if

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
don't jump and then wall run like if

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.099 
don't jump and then wall run like if
there's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.249> gap<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.299> actually<00:01:51.509> wall

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
there's a gap you have to actually wall

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:55.519 
there's a gap you have to actually wall
run<00:01:52.549> first<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.299> found<00:01:54.959> that<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.139> bit<00:01:55.349> odd

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:55.529 
run first now i found that a bit odd

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:57.709 
run first now i found that a bit odd
because<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.429> other<00:01:57.090> games<00:01:57.450> were<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
because you know other games were you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.529 
because you know other games were you
all<00:01:57.989> run<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.829> jump<00:01:59.609> and<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.149> hit

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
all run you have to jump and then hit

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.139 
all run you have to jump and then hit
the<00:02:00.719> wall<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:01.529> wall<00:02:01.770> run<00:02:02.069> but<00:02:02.819> on<00:02:02.969> this

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the wall and then wall run but on this

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.139 
the wall and then wall run but on this
game<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.409> first<00:02:04.590> time<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.429> do<00:02:05.849> wall

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
game like the first time you do wall

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.749 
game like the first time you do wall
running<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:07.049> what<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.590> sort<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> but

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
running that's what you do sort of but

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.899 
running that's what you do sort of but
this<00:02:09.479> when<00:02:10.079> you<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:11.099> later<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.670> demo

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
this when you get later on the demo

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.580 
this when you get later on the demo
where<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.329> to<00:02:12.450> jump<00:02:12.689> over<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.959> gap<00:02:13.290> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
where you have to jump over a gap and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.000 
where you have to jump over a gap and
then<00:02:13.769> we'll

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
then we'll

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.720 
then we'll
run<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.489> doesn't<00:02:15.239> do<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.390> properly<00:02:16.489> than<00:02:17.489> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
run it doesn't do it properly than that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.670 
run it doesn't do it properly than that
I<00:02:17.939> gotta<00:02:18.239> say<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:18.540> enjoyed<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.379> i<00:02:19.500> have

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
I gotta say I really enjoyed it i have

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.589 
I gotta say I really enjoyed it i have
played<00:02:20.040> through<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.310> demo<00:02:20.610> at<00:02:20.879> least<00:02:21.090> six<00:02:21.420> or

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
played through this demo at least six or

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.080 
played through this demo at least six or
seven<00:02:21.930> times<00:02:21.959> now<00:02:22.470> i<00:02:22.500> really<00:02:22.950> can't<00:02:23.400> wait<00:02:23.760> for

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
seven times now i really can't wait for

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.589 
seven times now i really can't wait for
the<00:02:24.180> game<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.659> holy<00:02:25.500> hope<00:02:25.829> they<00:02:26.040> adjust<00:02:27.030> some<00:02:27.569> of

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
the game I holy hope they adjust some of

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.850 
the game I holy hope they adjust some of
the<00:02:27.780> control<00:02:28.470> issues<00:02:28.829> I<00:02:28.860> have<00:02:29.189> though<00:02:29.459> um<00:02:29.760> oh

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the control issues I have though um oh

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.199 
the control issues I have though um oh
that<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.220> controller<00:02:32.610> she's<00:02:32.819> worked

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
that the controller she's worked

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.720 
that the controller she's worked
perfectly<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.110> slo-mo<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.040> really<00:02:35.310> cool

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
perfectly in slo-mo it's a really cool

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
perfectly in slo-mo it's a really cool
effect<00:02:35.879> although<00:02:36.480> i<00:02:36.959> could<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.349> getting<00:02:37.680> old

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
effect although i could see getting old

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.589 
effect although i could see getting old
after<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.430> while<00:02:38.610> which<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:38.940> why<00:02:39.180> i<00:02:39.209> think<00:02:39.360> that

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
after a while which is why i think that

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.380 
after a while which is why i think that
the<00:02:39.840> aiming<00:02:40.290> from<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> hip<00:02:40.859> should<00:02:41.220> be

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
the aiming from the hip should be

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.970 
the aiming from the hip should be
improved<00:02:42.390> slightly<00:02:42.840> though<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:43.829> see

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
improved slightly though you can see

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
improved slightly though you can see
here<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.430> pretty<00:02:44.579> are<00:02:44.849> hard<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.540> aim<00:02:45.569> from

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
here it's pretty are hard to aim from

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.610 
here it's pretty are hard to aim from
the<00:02:46.019> hip<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:47.209> amy<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.540> slow<00:02:48.870> mo<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.470> hip

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the hip but amy and slow mo from the hip

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.039 
the hip but amy and slow mo from the hip
is<00:02:49.739> pretty<00:02:49.980> good<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:51.120> improve<00:02:51.720> your<00:02:51.750> health

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
is pretty good you improve your health

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.819 
is pretty good you improve your health
by<00:02:52.409> drinking<00:02:52.950> um<00:02:53.720> alcohol<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.560> can<00:02:55.620> see

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
by drinking um alcohol as you can see

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.220 
by drinking um alcohol as you can see
there<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.220> i'm<00:02:57.150> also<00:02:57.389> wondering<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:58.079> there's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
there and i'm also wondering if there's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.770 
there and i'm also wondering if there's
going<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.440> be<00:02:58.500> any<00:02:58.849> weapon<00:02:59.849> changing<00:03:00.659> in<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
going to be any weapon changing in the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.050 
going to be any weapon changing in the
game<00:03:01.049> because<00:03:01.230> i<00:03:01.349> think<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.859> that<00:03:02.370> should<00:03:02.909> be

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
game because i think that that should be

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.599 
game because i think that that should be
necessary<00:03:03.930> although<00:03:04.290> there<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.430> your

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
necessary although there that your

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.670 
necessary although there that your
pistol<00:03:06.030> has<00:03:06.180> unlimited<00:03:06.750> ammo<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:07.379> i<00:03:07.409> don't

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
pistol has unlimited ammo so i don't

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.009 
pistol has unlimited ammo so i don't
think<00:03:07.980> they're<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.760> do<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.180> i<00:03:09.420> think

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
think they're going to do that i think

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.360 
think they're going to do that i think
that<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.260> know<00:03:10.440> there<00:03:11.099> should<00:03:11.250> be<00:03:11.340> a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
that you know there should be a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.369 
that you know there should be a
different<00:03:11.879> variety<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.420> weapons<00:03:12.720> so

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
different variety of weapons so

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.110 
different variety of weapons so
hopefully<00:03:13.560> that's<00:03:14.040> different<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.940> game

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
hopefully that's different in the game

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.390 
hopefully that's different in the game
but<00:03:15.959> from<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.260> demo<00:03:16.680> i<00:03:16.859> think<00:03:17.069> they<00:03:17.159> could

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
but from the demo i think they could

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.390 
but from the demo i think they could
have<00:03:18.079> buried<00:03:19.079> up<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.440> demo<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.799> little<00:03:20.040> bit<00:03:20.220> i

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
have buried up the demo a little bit i

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.949 
have buried up the demo a little bit i
don't<00:03:20.849> know<00:03:20.910> if<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.299> very<00:03:21.510> beginning

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
don't know if this is the very beginning

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.119 
don't know if this is the very beginning
of<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.079> game<00:03:22.260> because<00:03:22.680> there's<00:03:22.859> lots<00:03:23.040> of

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
of the game because there's lots of

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.129 
of the game because there's lots of
tutorials<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:24.209> i<00:03:24.239> think<00:03:24.389> that's<00:03:24.660> where<00:03:24.870> they

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
tutorials so i think that's where they

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.659 
tutorials so i think that's where they
put<00:03:25.169> it<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.799> know<00:03:25.889> it's<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.310> very<00:03:26.549> very

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
put it you know it's just a very very

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.300 
put it you know it's just a very very
start<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.480> game<00:03:27.660> though<00:03:28.590> i<00:03:28.620> have<00:03:28.949> big

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
start of the game though i have big

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.220 
start of the game though i have big
hopes<00:03:29.579> especially<00:03:30.239> since<00:03:30.449> this<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> published

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
hopes especially since this is published

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.729 
hopes especially since this is published
by<00:03:31.470> Bethesda<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:33.690> know<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.049> can't<00:03:34.560> really

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
by Bethesda and you know I can't really

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.330 
by Bethesda and you know I can't really
see<00:03:35.069> them<00:03:35.280> screwing<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.180> up<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.530> hope<00:03:38.280> that

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
see them screwing this up so I hope that

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.629 
see them screwing this up so I hope that
it's<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.120> lot<00:03:39.269> better<00:03:39.480> with<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.870> controls<00:03:40.319> and

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
it's a lot better with the controls and

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.970 
it's a lot better with the controls and
