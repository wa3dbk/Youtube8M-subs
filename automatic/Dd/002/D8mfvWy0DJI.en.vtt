00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
actually my Lagoona came with a little

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.819 
actually my Lagoona came with a little
bit<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> mistake<00:01:42.000> they<00:01:42.689> put<00:01:42.930> her<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> box

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
bit of a mistake they put her in the box

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
bit of a mistake they put her in the box
too<00:01:43.920> early<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.399> paint<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.270> her<00:01:45.420> lips

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
too early because paint from her lips

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.380 
too early because paint from her lips
smudged<00:01:46.290> onto<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> packaging<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
smudged onto the packaging so I think I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
smudged onto the packaging so I think I
might<00:01:48.570> keep<00:01:48.810> her<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> box<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> new

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
might keep her in the box and get a new

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
might keep her in the box and get a new
one<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
one because I think that's a kind of a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780
