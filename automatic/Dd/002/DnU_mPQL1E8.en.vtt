kangaroo<00:00:25.619> enclosure<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.130> suggested<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:26.789> your

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
kangaroo enclosure I suggested by your

kangaroo enclosure I suggested by your
lambda<00:00:27.150> Torres<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.340> decided<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.550> put<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
lambda Torres I decided to put the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.240 
lambda Torres I decided to put the
kangaroo<00:00:30.330> enclosure<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.679> next<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.980> coil

kangaroo enclosure right next to coil
enclosure<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.149> fits<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.630> both<00:00:33.989> animals

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
enclosure this fits because both animals

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.819 
enclosure this fits because both animals
originate<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.309> Australia<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.469> also<00:00:37.469> decided

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to have this little indentation in the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.090 
to have this little indentation in the

usually<00:01:07.680> live<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.299> Australia's<00:01:09.299> deserts<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
usually live in Australia's deserts and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
usually live in Australia's deserts and
grasslands<00:01:10.380> however<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.130> game<00:01:11.340> their

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
grasslands however in this game their

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
grasslands however in this game their
classes<00:01:12.210> living<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.750> semi<00:01:13.020> desert<00:01:13.260> which<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
classes living in a semi desert which is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.550 
classes living in a semi desert which is
I<00:01:14.640> guess<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.150> mix<00:01:15.299> between<00:01:15.659> desert<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
I guess a mix between desert and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.539 
I guess a mix between desert and
grassland<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> fits<00:01:18.259> kangaroos<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.549> part

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
grassland so it fits kangaroos are part

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
grassland so it fits kangaroos are part
of<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.820> family<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.330> mammals<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.960> give<00:01:22.500> birth

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799

you know it comes out to feed and all
that<00:01:52.610> stuff<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:53.150> that's<00:01:54.140> where<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.470> lives

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
that stuff but that's where it lives

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.899 
that stuff but that's where it lives
that's<00:01:54.920> where<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.159> stays<00:01:55.340> that's<00:01:55.640> where<00:01:55.790> it's

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
that's where it stays that's where it's

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.550 
that's where it stays that's where it's
safe<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.509> usually<00:01:57.409> doesn't<00:01:57.830> come<00:01:57.950> out<00:01:57.979> much

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
safe and usually doesn't come out much

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.880 
safe and usually doesn't come out much
so<00:02:00.790> also<00:02:01.790> another<00:02:02.330> fact<00:02:02.860> kangaroos<00:02:03.860> are

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
so also another fact kangaroos are

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.310 
so also another fact kangaroos are
herbivorous<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.880> they<00:02:05.270> live<00:02:05.540> for<00:02:05.869> up<00:02:06.140> to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
herbivorous and they live for up to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.249 
herbivorous and they live for up to
twenty<00:02:06.710> three<00:02:06.920> years<00:02:07.720> you've<00:02:08.720> probably<00:02:08.989> seen

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
twenty three years you've probably seen

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.440 
twenty three years you've probably seen
a<00:02:09.319> kangaroo<00:02:09.590> fight<00:02:10.009> before<00:02:10.190> but<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.300> way

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
a kangaroo fight before but the way

a kangaroo fight before but the way
kangaroos<00:02:11.900> fight<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.410> they<00:02:13.010> lean<00:02:13.250> back<00:02:13.459> on

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
kangaroos fight is they lean back on

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.059 
kangaroos fight is they lean back on
their<00:02:13.819> tail<00:02:14.030> which<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> strong<00:02:15.170> heavy<00:02:15.680> tail

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
their tail which is a strong heavy tail

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.340 
their tail which is a strong heavy tail
and<00:02:16.400> then<00:02:17.030> they<00:02:17.180> box<00:02:17.450> each<00:02:17.630> other<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:18.110> their

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
and then they box each other with their

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.390 
and then they box each other with their
sort<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.160> arms<00:02:19.900> fun<00:02:20.900> fact<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.500> group<00:02:22.280> of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
sort of arms fun fact a group of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.740 
sort of arms fun fact a group of
kangaroos<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.090> called<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.420> mob<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:25.540> decided<00:02:26.540> to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
kangaroos is called a mob I decided to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.460 
kangaroos is called a mob I decided to
use<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.050> little<00:02:27.260> space<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.769> had<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.760> path

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
use this little space I had in the path

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.780 
use this little space I had in the path
for<00:02:30.470> some<00:02:30.620> nice<00:02:30.769> decorations<00:02:31.459> with

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
for some nice decorations with

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.660 
for some nice decorations with
semi-desert<00:02:32.269> trees<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.930> foliage<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.670> this

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
semi-desert trees and foliage and this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.039 
semi-desert trees and foliage and this
is<00:02:34.790> actually<00:02:34.940> my<00:02:35.209> favorite<00:02:35.360> bit<00:02:35.690> about<00:02:35.870> this

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
is actually my favorite bit about this

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.289 
is actually my favorite bit about this
enclosure<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.650> made<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.069> don't<00:02:37.310> know<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.790> it's

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
enclosure I made I don't know so it's

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.420 
enclosure I made I don't know so it's
just<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.660> think<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:39.110> looks<00:02:39.140> really<00:02:39.350> nice<00:02:39.709> you'll

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
just I think it looks really nice you'll

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.740 
just I think it looks really nice you'll
probably<00:02:40.670> see<00:02:40.850> on<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.060> screen<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.450> second

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
probably see on the screen in a second

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.900 
probably see on the screen in a second
when<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:41.900> look<00:02:42.110> at<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.290> close<00:02:42.470> up<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.760> looks

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
when I look at it close up but it looks

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.910 
when I look at it close up but it looks
much<00:02:44.090> less<00:02:44.330> early<00:02:44.660> closure<00:02:44.959> itself<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.560> don't

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
much less early closure itself I don't

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.979 
much less early closure itself I don't
know<00:02:46.100> why<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.580> i'm<00:02:47.239> not<00:02:47.450> actually<00:02:47.630> entirely

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
know why and i'm not actually entirely

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.690 
know why and i'm not actually entirely
sure<00:02:48.319> what<00:02:48.530> what<00:02:49.040> what<00:02:49.310> do<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.459> think<00:02:49.640> about

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
sure what what what do you think about

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.390

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
look nicer because I'm not entirely sure

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:08.910 
look nicer because I'm not entirely sure
about<00:03:00.109> this<00:03:00.380> one
