faith<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:35.590> think<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.400> PT<00:02:36.760> it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
faith this is think in this PT it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.979 
faith this is think in this PT it
actually<00:02:37.840> shows<00:02:38.080> well<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:39.250> battery<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.760> do

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
actually shows well the battery can do

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.660 
actually shows well the battery can do
this<00:02:40.989> one<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.440> show<00:02:41.650> man<00:02:42.190> make<00:02:42.459> life

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
this one I can show man make life

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.600 
this one I can show man make life
possible<00:02:44.459> makes<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.670> noise<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:48.160> need<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
possible makes that noise just need a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.430 
possible makes that noise just need a
few<00:02:49.000> slits<00:02:49.300> that's<00:02:49.720> also<00:02:53.730> fru<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.050> tried<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.260> get

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
few slits that's also fru I tried to get

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.979 
few slits that's also fru I tried to get
this<00:02:56.650> because<00:02:57.100> other<00:02:57.640> pcs<00:02:58.420> are<00:02:58.450> kind<00:02:58.930> of

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
this because other pcs are kind of

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.009 
this because other pcs are kind of
crappy<00:02:59.820> except<00:03:00.820> for<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.030> link<00:03:01.269> PT<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.840> that's

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
crappy except for the link PT and that's

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.710 
crappy except for the link PT and that's
all<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.950> competition<00:03:03.610> for<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:06.510> like<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.660> said
