 it has nothing 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.110
 the ecofaber company was founded in 1998 in the province of Ragusa in its own 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.710
 founders carlos neck and francesco ristuccia 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.630
 have succeeded and transformed it in just over 10 years in one of the companies 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.179
 more solid at the forefront of the horticultural nursery industry 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.010
 liberated nationally 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.320
 in the production of plants grafted the constant investment of innovation 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.930
 technology and the use of an expert state 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.980
 they allowed the ecofaber to develop a very high one 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.420
 professionalism that is expressed in research in experimentation in 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.620
 quality control on all stages of production as well as having 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.010
 consolidated the best quality standards in the cultivation of plants 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.150
 conventional and organic and in the production of grafted plants than today 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.100
 the ecofaber 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.480
 is able to express the most mature heart know-how about 20 million ne 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.790
 pachino per. are produced and every year on the farm in the modica territories 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.019
 be distributed to the professional market 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.590
 and for some years also to the hobbyist where they come with the brand 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.920
 cecassion moving from an analysis of the world scenario of the sector 8 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.909
 nursery but above all from the maximum attention paid to its evolution 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.679
 technique 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.369
 the ecofaber focused on the application of innovative solutions above all 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.729
 ecofaber ais definitively promised the use of containers from production 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.660
 in polystyrene 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.770
 preferring those in recyclable plastic this solution achieves the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.160
 result of a very low environmental impact since the seed tray 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.330
 in plastic it easily re-enters the recycling chain but also optimizes 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.840
 the technical and agronomic aspects of the abuse cultivation of a container into 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.799
 plastic with pyramidal cavity 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.399
 equipped with grooves it guarantees a smooth surface of the socket 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.250
 same 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 allows a perfect extraction of the seedling and therefore a better one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.950
 maintenance of the root hair portion in addition to an excellent one 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.860
 drainage creates high air circulation 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.690
 still focusing on continuous evolution and the development of new ones 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.520
 ecofaber products has chosen to specialize also in breeding in 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.590
 ice cubes 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.920
 where the maximum technological innovation is applied this allows 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.209
 to obtain plants with very ramified roots, the more fibrous therefore less 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.779
 transplant stress greater strength 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.469
 and earlier plants to the development of these new solutions are of value 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.150
 added the skills that ecofaber has matured over time and that reach the 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.889
 highest level of specialization 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.320
 in the grafting phase 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.320
 with all the tense care that this delicate technique requires from the 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.379
 ancient tradition 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.230
 therefore ecofaber presents itself as a model company in the world of research 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.359
 ortovivaistica 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.560
 being able to exploit the excellent synergy 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.340
 between his lent little ass and his grafted plant you can do so 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.450
 have a unique serially innovative product reliability 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.930
 of ecofaber plants and finally guaranteed by the entire cultivation chain 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.919
 assumes the character of a process 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.309
 not simply agricultural but if I industrialize myself thanks to the application of 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.109
 a strict production protocol and an equally rigorous control of 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.419
 quality 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.290

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.660
 fully technologized apparatus 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.280
 but above all constantly monitored in terms of health and hygiene for 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.820
