you<00:00:55.339> can<00:00:55.460> also<00:00:55.579> create<00:00:55.970> new<00:00:56.239> layers<00:00:56.449> down<00:00:56.720> here

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
you can also create new layers down here

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.860 
you can also create new layers down here
as<00:00:57.170> such<00:00:58.089> let's<00:00:59.089> highlight<00:00:59.329> that<00:00:59.629> you<00:00:59.750> can

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
as such let's highlight that you can

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.079 
as such let's highlight that you can
delete<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.199> that<00:01:00.440> way<00:01:00.589> as<00:01:00.739> well<00:01:00.970> let's<00:01:01.970> go

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
delete it that way as well let's go

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.359 
delete it that way as well let's go
ahead<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.239> use<00:01:03.079> this<00:01:03.290> new<00:01:03.559> duplicate<00:01:04.159> layer

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
ahead and use this new duplicate layer

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.609 
ahead and use this new duplicate layer
as<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:05.360> can<00:01:05.509> see<00:01:05.720> we've<00:01:05.899> just<00:01:06.140> created<00:01:06.380> a

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
as you can see we've just created a

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.219 
as you can see we've just created a
layer<00:01:06.830> eh<00:01:06.860> let's<00:01:07.160> move<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.430> out<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.170> now<00:01:09.170> we

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
layer eh let's move it out and now we

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.779 
layer eh let's move it out and now we
have<00:01:09.350> two<00:01:09.860> sets<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.399> tubes<00:01:10.729> up<00:01:11.030> here<00:01:12.580> let's<00:01:13.580> go

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
have two sets of tubes up here let's go

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.609 
have two sets of tubes up here let's go
ahead<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:14.030> drag<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.840> trash<00:01:15.080> can<00:01:15.320> you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
ahead and drag that to the trash can you

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.590 
ahead and drag that to the trash can you
can<00:01:15.770> also<00:01:15.920> edit<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.610> current<00:01:16.970> shader<00:01:17.240> we

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
can also edit the current shader we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.230 
can also edit the current shader we
won't<00:01:17.780> be<00:01:17.869> doing<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.410> this<00:01:18.500> video<00:01:19.240> you

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
won't be doing that in this video you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.540 
won't be doing that in this video you
can<00:01:20.390> also<00:01:20.600> duplicate<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.770> layers<00:01:22.100> current

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
can also duplicate a layers current

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.270 
can also duplicate a layers current
settings<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.420> instance<00:01:23.780> its<00:01:24.020> resolution<00:01:24.679> and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
settings for instance its resolution and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.029 
settings for instance its resolution and
local<00:01:26.000> symmetry<00:01:26.450> let's<00:01:27.440> go<00:01:27.590> ahead<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:27.800> do

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
local symmetry let's go ahead and do

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.090 
local symmetry let's go ahead and do
that<00:01:28.070> now<00:01:28.720> let's<00:01:29.720> pick<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.800> oh<00:01:32.890> let's<00:01:33.890> pick

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
that now let's pick the oh let's pick

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.249 
that now let's pick the oh let's pick
the<00:01:34.250> tube<00:01:34.490> layer<00:01:34.759> here<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.509> tube<00:01:35.750> layer<00:01:35.960> has<00:01:36.229> a

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
the tube layer here the tube layer has a

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.620 
the tube layer here the tube layer has a
resolution<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:37.220> two<00:01:37.580> times<00:01:37.849> we've<00:01:38.300> increased

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
resolution of two times we've increased

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.770 
resolution of two times we've increased
at<00:01:38.869> once<00:01:39.080> so<00:01:39.349> that<00:01:39.380> means<00:01:39.770> all<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.780> voxels

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
at once so that means all the voxels

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.190 
at once so that means all the voxels
have<00:01:41.989> been<00:01:42.200> doubled<00:01:43.009> effectively<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:45.080> let's

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
have been doubled effectively so let's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.830 
have been doubled effectively so let's
go<00:01:45.319> ahead<00:01:45.349> and<00:01:45.709> copy<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:46.849> so<00:01:47.450> now<00:01:47.569> we<00:01:47.630> have

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
go ahead and copy that so now we have

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.020 
go ahead and copy that so now we have
that<00:01:47.959> new<00:01:48.140> layer<00:01:48.349> and<00:01:48.729> just<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.849> demonstrate

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
that new layer and just to demonstrate

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.630 
that new layer and just to demonstrate
this<00:01:50.539> you<00:01:51.170> don't<00:01:51.319> see<00:01:51.560> any<00:01:51.770> tubes<00:01:52.130> up<00:01:52.399> here

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
this you don't see any tubes up here

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.180 
this you don't see any tubes up here
that's<00:01:53.239> because<00:01:53.599> all<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:53.959> did<00:01:54.080> was<00:01:54.140> copy<00:01:54.500> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
that's because all we did was copy the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.370 
that's because all we did was copy the
current<00:01:55.550> layer<00:01:55.789> which<00:01:56.630> was<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.989> to<00:01:57.140> blair

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
current layer which was the to blair

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.570 
current layer which was the to blair
with<00:01:57.429> its<00:01:58.429> settings<00:01:58.880> no<00:01:59.509> volume<00:02:00.020> was<00:02:00.580> copied

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
with its settings no volume was copied

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.290 
with its settings no volume was copied
over<00:02:01.869> all<00:02:02.869> right<00:02:03.080> next<00:02:03.890> up<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:04.910> copy

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
over all right next up you can copy

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.869 
over all right next up you can copy
symmetry<00:02:06.050> over<00:02:06.560> any<00:02:06.890> access<00:02:07.459> let's<00:02:07.729> go<00:02:07.819> ahead

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
symmetry over any access let's go ahead

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.150 
symmetry over any access let's go ahead
and<00:02:07.970> do<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.119> now<00:02:08.330> as<00:02:08.660> well<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.739> activate<00:02:09.979> that

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
and do that now as well to activate that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
and do that now as well to activate that
tube<00:02:10.520> layer<00:02:10.729> again<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:12.700> turn<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:13.849> symmetry

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
tube layer again and turn on symmetry

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.820 
tube layer again and turn on symmetry
across<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.750> z<00:02:14.989> axis<00:02:16.720> ok<00:02:17.720> let's<00:02:18.410> hit<00:02:18.560> that

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
across the z axis ok let's hit that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.220 
across the z axis ok let's hit that
button<00:02:19.129> there<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:20.209> can<00:02:20.360> see<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.750> it

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
button there and you can see that it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.070 
button there and you can see that it
created

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080

I'm<00:02:23.380> YouTube<00:02:23.800> over<00:02:24.070> on<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:24.310> side<00:02:24.370> across<00:02:24.820> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
I'm YouTube over on this side across the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.840 
I'm YouTube over on this side across the
z-axis<00:02:25.270> let's<00:02:25.990> hit<00:02:26.710> s<00:02:26.950> again<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.460> turn<00:02:27.670> on

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
z-axis let's hit s again and turn on

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.960 
z-axis let's hit s again and turn on
symmetry<00:02:28.300> across<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.780> x<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.580> hit<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.820> again

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
symmetry across the x and hit that again

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.180 
symmetry across the x and hit that again
and<00:02:31.300> now<00:02:31.630> we<00:02:31.690> have<00:02:31.810> those<00:02:32.230> over<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.160> side

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and now we have those over on that side

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.780 
and now we have those over on that side
as<00:02:33.550> well<00:02:34.500> okay<00:02:35.500> next<00:02:35.740> up<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.550> little

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
as well okay next up you have a little

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880 
as well okay next up you have a little
icon<00:02:37.450> down<00:02:37.630> here<00:02:37.690> now<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.350> increased

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
icon down here now for increased

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.730 
icon down here now for increased
resolution<00:02:39.070> let's<00:02:39.730> go<00:02:39.850> ahead<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.120> that

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
resolution let's go ahead and do that

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.870 
resolution let's go ahead and do that
and<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:44.980> see<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.280> tubes<00:02:45.550> that<00:02:45.730> are<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and you can see the tubes that are a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.340 
and you can see the tubes that are a
little<00:02:46.060> little<00:02:46.870> finer<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.380> detail<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:50.170> can

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
little little finer in detail you can

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.150 
little little finer in detail you can
also<00:02:50.530> now<00:02:50.950> decrease<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.750> resolution<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.980> an

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
also now decrease the resolution of an

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.030 
also now decrease the resolution of an
object<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.820> clone<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> new<00:02:56.020> layer<00:02:56.350> let's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
object and clone it to a new layer let's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.230 
object and clone it to a new layer let's
go<00:02:57.100> ahead<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.400> that<00:03:00.030> alright<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.209> let's

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
go ahead and do that alright and let's

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.400 
go ahead and do that alright and let's
hide<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.530> original<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.310> Blair<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:05.260> can

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
hide the original to Blair and you can

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.010 
hide the original to Blair and you can
see<00:03:05.650> here<00:03:05.830> over<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.280> Fox<00:03:06.520> tree<00:03:06.850> we<00:03:07.720> just

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
see here over on the Fox tree we just

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.050 
see here over on the Fox tree we just
increase<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.470> resolution<00:03:08.890> from<00:03:09.310> two<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.790> four

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
increase the resolution from two to four

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.150 
increase the resolution from two to four
but<00:03:10.870> what<00:03:11.020> we<00:03:11.200> have<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.440> layer<00:03:11.650> hidden<00:03:12.010> up

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
but what we have that layer hidden up

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.460 
but what we have that layer hidden up
and<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.550> can<00:03:12.700> see<00:03:12.910> here<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.870> decreased

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
and you can see here that it's decreased

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.600 
and you can see here that it's decreased
it<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.830> cloned<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> new<00:03:15.820> layer<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:17.610> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
it and cloned it to a new layer and the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.420 
it and cloned it to a new layer and the
last<00:03:18.850> one<00:03:19.420> will<00:03:19.930> allow<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.830> clear<00:03:21.250> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
last one will allow you to clear the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.670 
last one will allow you to clear the
volume<00:03:21.880> from<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.450> current<00:03:22.630> layer<00:03:22.959> let's<00:03:23.590> go

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
volume from a current layer let's go

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.440 
volume from a current layer let's go
ahead<00:03:23.740> and<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.459> new<00:03:25.180> tube

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
ahead and do that with that new tube

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.740 
ahead and do that with that new tube
layer<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:25.900> just<00:03:26.170> cloned<00:03:27.420> there<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.600> go

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
layer that we just cloned there you go

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.710 
layer that we just cloned there you go
pretty<00:03:29.590> basic<00:03:29.860> stuff<00:03:30.150> there<00:03:31.150> are<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.390> number<00:03:31.450> of

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
pretty basic stuff there are a number of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.350 
pretty basic stuff there are a number of
right<00:03:32.350> click<00:03:32.560> options<00:03:33.040> which<00:03:33.250> have<00:03:33.550> remained

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
right click options which have remained

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.140 
right click options which have remained
exactly<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:35.110> same<00:03:35.610> from<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.760> previous

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
exactly the same from the previous

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
exactly the same from the previous
versions<00:03:38.910> however<00:03:39.910> there<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.510> one<00:03:40.540> new

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
versions however there is one new

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.110 
versions however there is one new
feature<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.830> I<00:03:42.160> have<00:03:42.340> not<00:03:42.519> yet<00:03:42.730> discussed

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
feature that I have not yet discussed

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.509 
feature that I have not yet discussed
let's<00:03:43.450> let's<00:03:44.110> get<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.500> here<00:03:44.769> we<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.459> to

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
let's let's get to it here we want to

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.460 
let's let's get to it here we want to
pick<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> thin<00:03:46.090> surface<00:03:46.360> here<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.170> think

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
pick a thin surface here and I think

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.820 
pick a thin surface here and I think
these<00:03:48.660> boards<00:03:49.660> here<00:03:49.870> will<00:03:50.050> do<00:03:50.200> nicely<00:03:50.530> for

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
these boards here will do nicely for

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.759 
these boards here will do nicely for
that<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.459> let's<00:03:51.730> go<00:03:51.910> ahead<00:03:52.620> yeah<00:03:53.620> that's

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
that so let's go ahead yeah that's

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.920 
that so let's go ahead yeah that's
delete<00:03:54.070> some<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.340> these<00:03:54.400> layers<00:03:54.670> here<00:03:54.930> okay

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
delete some of these layers here okay

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.590 
delete some of these layers here okay
let's<00:03:56.350> pick<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.709> thin<00:03:56.980> surface<00:03:57.310> layer<00:03:57.850> as<00:03:58.180> I

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
let's pick the thin surface layer as I

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.210 
let's pick the thin surface layer as I
named<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:59.640> let's<00:04:00.640> go<00:04:00.820> ahead<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.120> select

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
named it let's go ahead and select

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.300 
named it let's go ahead and select
without<00:04:03.220> symmetry<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:05.560> increase<00:04:06.010> tool

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
without symmetry on the increase tool

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.270 
without symmetry on the increase tool
and<00:04:07.269> what<00:04:07.480> we're<00:04:07.630> going<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.930> do<00:04:08.080> is<00:04:08.260> just<00:04:08.860> poke

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and what we're going to do is just poke

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.729 
and what we're going to do is just poke
a<00:04:09.310> hole<00:04:09.430> through<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.820> notice<00:04:10.600> that<00:04:10.840> their<00:04:11.290> cube

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
a hole through it notice that their cube

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.460 
a hole through it notice that their cube
here<00:04:12.100> indicates<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.030> i<00:04:13.209> am<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.720> volume<00:04:14.260> mode

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
here indicates that i am in volume mode

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.580 
here indicates that i am in volume mode
that's<00:04:15.130> what<00:04:15.459> i<00:04:15.489> want<00:04:15.760> for<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.209> moment

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
that's what i want for the moment

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
alright so I'm going to hold ctrl and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.930 
alright so I'm going to hold ctrl and
I'm<00:04:19.630> going<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.930> sculpt<00:04:20.470> in<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.709> layer<00:04:20.940> let's

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
I'm going to sculpt in that layer let's

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.379 
I'm going to sculpt in that layer let's
go<00:04:22.150> ahead<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.390> see<00:04:23.760> there

you

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.960 
you
in<00:04:28.090> volume<00:04:29.050> mode<00:04:29.260> I'm<00:04:29.560> editing<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:30.610> volume

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
in volume mode I'm editing the volume

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.260 
in volume mode I'm editing the volume
all<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.180> way<00:04:31.450> through<00:04:31.780> here<00:04:32.050> in<00:04:32.470> surface<00:04:32.980> mode

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
all the way through here in surface mode

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.490 
all the way through here in surface mode
we're<00:04:34.270> going<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.450> edit<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:34.960> side<00:04:35.200> over<00:04:35.320> here

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
we're going to edit this side over here

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.010 
we're going to edit this side over here
now<00:04:35.680> in<00:04:36.150> surface<00:04:37.150> mode<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.540> will<00:04:37.720> not<00:04:37.870> happen

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
now in surface mode that will not happen

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.590 
now in surface mode that will not happen
so<00:04:38.440> let's<00:04:38.650> go<00:04:38.800> ahead<00:04:38.910> click<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.060> cube<00:04:40.389> and

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
so let's go ahead click that cube and

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.120 
so let's go ahead click that cube and
you'll<00:04:40.720> see<00:04:40.930> now<00:04:41.050> it's<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.260> wavy<00:04:41.500> line<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.950> wavy

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
you'll see now it's a wavy line the wavy

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.030 
you'll see now it's a wavy line the wavy
line<00:04:42.490> represents<00:04:43.150> surface<00:04:43.660> mode<00:04:43.870> let's<00:04:44.710> hold

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
line represents surface mode let's hold

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.750 
line represents surface mode let's hold
down<00:04:45.190> control<00:04:45.610> again<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:47.550> sculpt<00:04:48.550> there

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
down control again and sculpt there

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.480 
down control again and sculpt there
you'll<00:04:49.510> notice<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.930> it's<00:04:50.320> not<00:04:50.500> puncturing<00:04:51.370> a

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
you'll notice that it's not puncturing a

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.879 
you'll notice that it's not puncturing a
hole<00:04:51.730> through<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:53.110> if<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.440> look<00:04:53.620> on<00:04:53.800> the

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
hole through but if you look on the

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.659 
hole through but if you look on the
other<00:04:54.010> side<00:04:54.310> we've<00:04:55.150> got<00:04:55.389> this<00:04:55.600> crazy<00:04:56.020> little

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
other side we've got this crazy little

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.040 
other side we've got this crazy little
protrusion<00:04:57.669> going<00:04:58.210> all<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.450> way<00:04:58.570> through<00:04:58.840> and

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
protrusion going all the way through and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.390 
protrusion going all the way through and
if<00:04:59.980> we<00:05:00.330> change<00:05:01.330> back<00:05:01.510> over<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.870> volume<00:05:02.200> mode

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
if we change back over to volume mode

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.820 
if we change back over to volume mode
you'll<00:05:03.400> see<00:05:03.700> that<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:04.000> was<00:05:04.150> actually

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.490 

going<00:05:07.700> all<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.030> way<00:05:08.120> through<00:05:08.450> and<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:09.140> created

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
going all the way through and it created

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.000 
going all the way through and it created
a<00:05:09.800> new<00:05:10.390> volume<00:05:11.390> there<00:05:11.600> so<00:05:13.210> that's<00:05:14.210> how<00:05:14.980> some<00:05:15.980> of

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
a new volume there so that's how some of

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.880 
a new volume there so that's how some of
the<00:05:16.190> tools<00:05:16.370> function<00:05:17.230> inside<00:05:18.230> surface<00:05:18.680> mode

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
the tools function inside surface mode

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.920 
the tools function inside surface mode
let's<00:05:19.130> take<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.370> look<00:05:19.610> at<00:05:19.730> one<00:05:20.180> last<00:05:20.450> thing<00:05:20.690> here

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
let's take a look at one last thing here

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.840 
let's take a look at one last thing here
let's<00:05:22.420> go<00:05:23.420> back<00:05:23.720> over<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.290> side

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
let's go back over to this side

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.800 
let's go back over to this side
demonstration<00:05:25.850> purposes<00:05:26.270> again<00:05:26.540> we're<00:05:26.720> going

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
demonstration purposes again we're going

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.870 
demonstration purposes again we're going
to<00:05:26.900> hold<00:05:27.080> down<00:05:27.170> shift<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.770> smooth<00:05:28.040> let's<00:05:28.760> go

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
to hold down shift the smooth let's go

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.020 
to hold down shift the smooth let's go
ahead<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.150> just<00:05:29.330> move<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:29.930> up<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.260> i<00:05:30.800> have

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
ahead and just move that up and i have

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.610 
ahead and just move that up and i have
smoothing<00:05:32.030> set<00:05:32.540> to<00:05:32.660> 100<00:05:33.110> at<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.320> moment

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
smoothing set to 100 at the moment

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.560 
smoothing set to 100 at the moment
you'll<00:05:34.400> notice<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.730> it's<00:05:35.030> just

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
you'll notice that it's just

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.110 
you'll notice that it's just
annihilating<00:05:36.350> that<00:05:36.500> pacer<00:05:36.920> now<00:05:37.760> let's<00:05:37.970> go

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
annihilating that pacer now let's go

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.510 
annihilating that pacer now let's go
ahead<00:05:38.300> activate<00:05:38.900> surface<00:05:39.350> mode<00:05:39.590> and<00:05:39.800> over<00:05:40.430> on

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
ahead activate surface mode and over on

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.710 
ahead activate surface mode and over on
this<00:05:40.670> side<00:05:40.730> we're<00:05:41.000> going<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.180> hold<00:05:41.360> down<00:05:41.480> shift

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
this side we're going to hold down shift

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.480 
this side we're going to hold down shift
again<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.590> we're<00:05:42.710> going<00:05:42.740> to<00:05:42.860> smooth<00:05:43.190> this<00:05:43.310> out

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
again and we're going to smooth this out

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.420 
again and we're going to smooth this out
you'll<00:05:44.120> notice<00:05:44.540> that<00:05:44.570> it's<00:05:45.080> not

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
you'll notice that it's not

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.129 
you'll notice that it's not
destroying<00:05:48.430> any<00:05:48.850> of<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.300> volume<00:05:49.509> it's<00:05:49.810> trying

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
destroying any of the volume it's trying

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.600 
destroying any of the volume it's trying
to<00:05:50.229> maintain<00:05:50.380> it<00:05:50.800> while<00:05:50.949> smoothing<00:05:51.280> the

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
to maintain it while smoothing the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.719 
to maintain it while smoothing the
surface<00:05:51.820> at<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.960> same<00:05:53.169> time<00:05:53.410> if<00:05:54.250> we<00:05:54.430> go<00:05:54.550> and

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
surface at the same time if we go and

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.210 
surface at the same time if we go and
hit<00:05:54.820> those<00:05:54.970> edges<00:05:55.389> you'll<00:05:56.380> see<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:56.800> it's

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
hit those edges you'll see it it's

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.840 
hit those edges you'll see it it's
smooth<00:05:57.580> is<00:05:58.680> quite<00:05:59.680> nicely<00:05:59.889> here<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:02.850> attempts

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
smooth is quite nicely here it attempts

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.379 
smooth is quite nicely here it attempts
to<00:06:03.880> keep<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.300> volume<00:06:08.310> all<00:06:09.310> right<00:06:09.520> hope<00:06:10.270> you

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
to keep the volume all right hope you

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.970 
to keep the volume all right hope you
enjoy<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.780> video
