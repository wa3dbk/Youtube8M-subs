there<00:00:00.870> are<00:00:01.020> several<00:00:01.350> buffing<00:00:01.890> systems<00:00:02.310> on<00:00:02.490> the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
there are several buffing systems on the

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.309 
there are several buffing systems on the
market<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.149> they're<00:00:03.300> all<00:00:03.449> pretty<00:00:03.750> much<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
market and they're all pretty much the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:04.789 
market and they're all pretty much the
same

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799

of a stacked series of cloth disks and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.529 
of a stacked series of cloth disks and
we<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.150> two<00:00:15.509> abrasives<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.820> coarsest<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
we have two abrasives the coarsest is

particular ones that I'm using here are
those<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.119> made<00:01:33.299> by<00:01:33.560> Beal<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.850> only

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
those that are made by Beal the only

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.450 
those that are made by Beal the only
difference<00:01:36.960> between<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.470> Beal<00:01:37.710> system<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
difference between the Beal system and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
difference between the Beal system and
several<00:01:38.700> others<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.049> market<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
several others that are on the market is

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.120 
several others that are on the market is
in<00:01:41.430> how<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.840> disks<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:43.110> attached<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:44.009> the

a threaded hole in the end of the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.190 
a threaded hole in the end of the
mandrel<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.520> systems<00:01:57.180> use<00:01:57.630> wheels

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
mandrel the other systems use wheels

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
mandrel the other systems use wheels
that<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.770> held<00:01:59.040> together<00:01:59.280> by<00:01:59.579> two<00:01:59.759> washers

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that are held together by two washers

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179 
that are held together by two washers
with<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> hole<00:02:00.990> through<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.469> center<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.979> them

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
with a hole through the center of them

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.510 
with a hole through the center of them
and<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:03.360> slide<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> mandrel<00:02:04.770> rod<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and they slide over a mandrel rod with a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.920 
and they slide over a mandrel rod with a
nut<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.090> hold<00:02:06.299> them<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.630> place

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
nut to hold them in place

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.440 
nut to hold them in place
so<00:02:07.829> that's<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.250> big<00:02:08.459> difference<00:02:08.489> these<00:02:09.239> are

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
so that's the big difference these are

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.470 
so that's the big difference these are
just<00:02:09.629> easier<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> put<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.950> take<00:02:10.979> off<00:02:11.340> can't

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
just easier to put on and take off can't

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.890 
just easier to put on and take off can't
anything<00:02:12.930> faster<00:02:13.440> than<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.690> prefer<00:02:15.690> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
anything faster than that I prefer to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.949 
anything faster than that I prefer to
run<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.500> wheels<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.459> lathe<00:02:17.930> because<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
run the wheels in the lathe because I
