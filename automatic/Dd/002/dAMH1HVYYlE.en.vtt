00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
and if you have it configured correctly

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.089 
and if you have it configured correctly
you<00:03:49.400> can<00:03:49.549> have<00:03:49.729> your<00:03:49.970> team<00:03:50.269> audio<00:03:50.629> and<00:03:51.099> the

game audio all going through that basic

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.129 
game audio all going through that basic
headset<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.479> would<00:03:56.629> be<00:03:56.750> one<00:03:56.959> way<00:03:57.109> of

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
headset so this would be one way of

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.819 
headset so this would be one way of
configuring<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:58.310> headset<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.689> work<00:04:00.139> with<00:04:00.530> your

so that's how I have it set up there is

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.970 
so that's how I have it set up there is
a<00:05:02.030> couple<00:05:02.390> other<00:05:02.450> ways<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:03.020> do<00:05:03.169> it<00:05:03.320> with<00:05:03.560> say

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
a couple other ways to do it with say

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.159 
a couple other ways to do it with say
like<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.250> Playstation<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.390> cam<00:05:05.690> if<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:06.020> have

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
like a Playstation I cam if you have

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.790 
like a Playstation I cam if you have
that<00:05:06.410> but<00:05:07.220> it's<00:05:07.580> not<00:05:07.910> gonna<00:05:08.300> be<00:05:08.390> quite<00:05:09.380> as<00:05:09.590> good

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
that but it's not gonna be quite as good

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.950 
that but it's not gonna be quite as good
if<00:05:10.040> you're<00:05:10.250> gonna<00:05:10.910> have<00:05:11.180> noise<00:05:11.510> coming<00:05:11.930> from

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
if you're gonna have noise coming from

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.440 
if you're gonna have noise coming from
your<00:05:12.200> TV<00:05:12.440> speakers<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.370> your<00:05:13.790> team's<00:05:14.090> voice

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
your TV speakers and your team's voice

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.180 
your TV speakers and your team's voice
coming<00:05:14.900> through<00:05:14.930> your<00:05:15.200> TV<00:05:15.350> speakers<00:05:15.890> it's

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
coming through your TV speakers it's

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.480 
coming through your TV speakers it's
just<00:05:16.400> no<00:05:16.550> real<00:05:17.030> way<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:18.350> make<00:05:18.560> that<00:05:18.740> work<00:05:19.040> clean

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
just no real way to make that work clean

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.520 
just no real way to make that work clean
so<00:05:20.500> for<00:05:21.500> me<00:05:21.590> what<00:05:22.010> I've<00:05:22.130> been<00:05:22.490> doing<00:05:23.530> isn't

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
so for me what I've been doing isn't

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.050 
so for me what I've been doing isn't
directly<00:05:25.130> running<00:05:25.669> it<00:05:25.820> into<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:28.520> cable<00:05:28.910> right

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
directly running it into the cable right

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.730 
directly running it into the cable right
here<00:05:29.120> because<00:05:29.840> I've<00:05:29.990> been<00:05:30.110> using<00:05:30.290> a<00:05:30.500> set<00:05:30.710> of

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
here because I've been using a set of

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.550 
here because I've been using a set of
computer<00:05:31.310> speakers<00:05:31.790> that<00:05:32.690> give<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.140> better

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
computer speakers that give a better

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.630 
computer speakers that give a better
audio<00:05:34.840> than<00:05:35.840> your<00:05:36.020> standard<00:05:36.260> TV<00:05:36.500> speakers<00:05:37.340> so

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
headphone jack so I just plug my

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.920 
headphone jack so I just plug my

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
headphone into here and that does the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.010 
headphone into here and that does the
same<00:05:56.960> thing<00:05:57.520> so<00:05:58.520> hopefully<00:05:59.030> this<00:05:59.540> kind<00:05:59.900> of

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
same thing so hopefully this kind of

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.370 
same thing so hopefully this kind of
helps<00:06:00.440> people<00:06:01.040> clarify<00:06:01.729> how<00:06:02.510> you<00:06:02.570> can<00:06:03.020> record
