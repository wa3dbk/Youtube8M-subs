00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.800
 dish that's right makes him a little boy 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.739
 but I set sail and finally 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.820
 in the supplies a workbook like 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:35.780

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.550
 school what are we going to go to 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.680
 compensation 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.720
 next in terms of the organization 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.709
 school all not on my little queer 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.060
 cold this is my iphone because 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.640
 I write my schedule in or 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.160
 on my agenda too but hey I know 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.750
 more but average on their agenda 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.190
 so there is less time so 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.930
 like that when I do not want the setting to 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.000
 day for the next day because I 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.250
 pick up copies 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.150
 I can after all that is 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.030
 organization of the entire plaster band 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.980
 the evening when I hear often I 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.209
 account after I'm going a little strong Tuesday 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.340
 by the news 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.110
 then my homework I prepare my bag I 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.510
 me shower and I am very pure at 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.010
 next day of the blow because if I 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.479
 did all that in the morning that would be a 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.710
 little bit hard because there are people 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:35.550
 who see there is that an organization 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.550
 still 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.950
 this little school organization tag and 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.600
 let's put us killer because I think 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.530
 that it was important to say it 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.150
 and that's after when it comes to when 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.330
 I go to bed I go to bed around 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.250
 from 9.30 pm to 10 pm, knowing that I had 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.200
 billion to fall asleep I do little by 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:02.060
 near 22:30 23h to 7h so it's 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.100
 still a good sleep and material 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.610
 I have time to do everything I have 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.990
 to do that's it here it is the end of 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.150
 this video I hope it will have you 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.169
 more and I'll see you again soon 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.169
 as I like to say 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.370
 it
