00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.160
 however no sound 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.419
 state 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.350
 good 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.350
 the 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.350
 Well 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 we're together here today because 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 the scaneagle system transferring 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.300
 the defense equipment organization 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.300
 army 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.510
 tiles in small round because plane that 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.590
 up to a maximum of six thousand meters 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.830
 can fly 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.660
 can fly at least 70 km and up to 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.660
 can stay for a maximum of twenty hours 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.900
 jeroen 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.180
 fly by day and by nature 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.610
 daylight camera on board 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.900
 the camera wanted to be sent live 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.730
 So we can directly send the images 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.620
 analyzed and information about it 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.270
 make available to arrive then do 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.560
 we can also be used for 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.570
 national operations 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.130
 we gained experience with the smaller 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.080
 system the smaller brother there 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.430
 and also with this system the scan that how 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.870
 can indeed hear the wagered from 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.860
 national operations 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.050
 data will be after use 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 transferred to the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.600
 client and what is not needed 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.060
 abortion 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.650
 soon also showed people are not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.630
 recognizable in image 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.190
 we do see the silhouette of a person 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.410
 for example but i do n't know faces 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 recognize we have some experience 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.620
 gained last year with the ocean 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.210
 have a shield mission with the previous one 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.550
 system the analogy we agree 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.010
 extensively flown 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.720
 around somalia and also this system will be in 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.590
 future possible uses 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.590
 for other missions 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.249
 here 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.500
 here
