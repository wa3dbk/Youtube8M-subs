00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
doing this video and hopefully

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.940 
doing this video and hopefully
successfully<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:55.050> what<00:02:56.050> I'd<00:02:56.170> suggest<00:02:56.380> is

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
successfully but what I'd suggest is

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.880 
successfully but what I'd suggest is
this<00:02:57.640> vertical<00:02:57.910> mount<00:02:58.330> here<00:02:58.780> as<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.710> can<00:02:59.740> see

I actually it's gone into wireless
charging<00:03:02.110> now<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:03.970> suggest<00:03:04.410> adjusting

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
charging now but I suggest adjusting

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.520

this vertical mount based on where the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.420 
this vertical mount based on where the
wireless<00:03:08.920> charger<00:03:09.370> actually<00:03:10.290> identifies
