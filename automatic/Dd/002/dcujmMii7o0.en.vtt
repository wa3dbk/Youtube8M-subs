I believe the red dot is right there you

may you may see a little speck that's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.300 
may you may see a little speck that's

not an Omega case back has been opened

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
or not there's a little complex

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.990 
or not there's a little complex
Omega<00:03:29.870> symbol<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.160> get<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:32.350> focus<00:03:33.350> here<00:03:34.000> Omega

chrono<00:03:44.090> diver<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.450> actually<00:03:44.720> quite<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:44.989> thick

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
chrono diver is actually quite a thick

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.789 
chrono diver is actually quite a thick
watch<00:03:45.709> when<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> value<00:03:46.640> movements<00:03:47.120> not<00:03:47.269> thin

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
watch when the value movements not thin

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.580 
watch when the value movements not thin
so<00:03:48.799> it's<00:03:49.100> quite<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:49.670> bit<00:03:49.850> chunkier<00:03:50.450> than<00:03:50.590> the

so it's quite a bit chunkier than the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.610 
so it's quite a bit chunkier than the
regular<00:03:52.370> 300<00:03:52.880> meter<00:03:53.060> diver<00:03:55.810> nice<00:03:56.810> watch

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
regular 300 meter diver nice watch

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.870 
regular 300 meter diver nice watch
I<00:03:58.299> personally<00:03:59.299> prefer<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.160> blue<00:04:01.160> sorry<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
I personally prefer the blue sorry the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.900 
I personally prefer the blue sorry the
black<00:04:02.060> dial<00:04:02.360> version<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.440> non-bond<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.370> think

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
black dial version the non-bond I think

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.449 
black dial version the non-bond I think
over<00:04:05.570> this<00:04:05.780> one<00:04:06.019> but<00:04:06.620> with<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.860> sword<00:04:07.070> hands

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
over this one but with the sword hands

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.970 
over this one but with the sword hands
this<00:04:08.239> one<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.570> maybe<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.900> little<00:04:08.930> bit<00:04:09.260> too<00:04:09.500> too

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
this one is maybe a little bit too too

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.000 
this one is maybe a little bit too too
blue<00:04:10.310> I'm<00:04:11.090> not<00:04:11.329> sure<00:04:11.450> about<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.750> blue<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.200> the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
blue I'm not sure about the blue and the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.729 
blue I'm not sure about the blue and the
red<00:04:13.480> but<00:04:14.480> it's<00:04:14.810> still<00:04:14.989> quite<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.290> nice<00:04:15.470> watch

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
red but it's still quite a nice watch

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.500 
red but it's still quite a nice watch
and<00:04:15.950> I<00:04:16.010> think<00:04:16.190> it's<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:16.940> very<00:04:17.150> well<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.419> the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
and I think it's it's very well on the

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
and I think it's it's very well on the
wrist<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:18.229> for<00:04:18.500> me

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.410 

so<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:27.370> actually<00:04:27.550> where<00:04:27.880> is<00:04:27.970> quite<00:04:28.210> big

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
so and actually where is quite big

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.690 
so and actually where is quite big
because<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.720> its<00:04:28.930> thickness<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.140> Omega<00:04:35.700> 3

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
because of its thickness so the Omega 3

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
because of its thickness so the Omega 3
meter<00:04:37.030> Crona<00:04:37.360> diver<00:04:37.630> C<00:04:38.470> master<00:04:39.540> would<00:04:40.540> you

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
meter Crona diver C master would you

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.140 
meter Crona diver C master would you
rather<00:04:40.900> you
