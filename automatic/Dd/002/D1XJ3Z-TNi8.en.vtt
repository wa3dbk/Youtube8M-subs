how high your leveled up the horse she

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.080 
how high your leveled up the horse she
gets<00:05:39.229> a<00:05:39.320> little<00:05:39.410> bit<00:05:39.620> quicker<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.820> think

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
gets a little bit quicker and I think

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.760

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.350 
that's neat to have kind of like a level
up<00:05:43.010> thing<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.430> think<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:44.030> get<00:05:44.180> different

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
up thing and think you get different

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.540 
up thing and think you get different
guns<00:05:44.780> and<00:05:45.020> stuff<00:05:45.110> as<00:05:45.350> you<00:05:45.500> rank<00:05:45.740> up<00:05:45.919> so<00:05:46.430> they
