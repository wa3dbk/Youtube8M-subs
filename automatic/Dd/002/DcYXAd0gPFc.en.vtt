00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.839
 what's up everybody talks to them mark mex and 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.879
 one guys this time I bring you a 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.370
 video a little different is not about the 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.760
 driver and but basically it's about 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.480
 what console to buy from the new 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.760
 console generation that is 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.040
 basically the xbox 720 or the play 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.000
 station 4 so good guys 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.920
 we started as you know pc 4 was already 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.780
 officially presented by sony but the 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.150
 date on which the new xbox will be announced 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.710
 officially by microsoft is 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.810
 practically around the corner 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 As you know, it is May 21, that is, 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.420
 We are basically nothing one week 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.310
 that this new xbox is presented like this 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.260
 that good I will bring much more information 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.910
 when the new Xbox is present but 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.280
 I will try to give the pros and 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.899
 against possible prices and 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.210
 technical specifications of each 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.829
 console with the information that there is up 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.320
 now so that all of you can 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.630
 give a better idea when buying 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.340
 one of these two consoles so the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.710
 guys, I recommend you watch the video 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.240
 complete because I did a lot of research and 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.960
 I found things that could be 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.119
 quite 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.619
 interesting especially for 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.020
 people who like 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.670
 colors tours and good guys we started 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.500
 with the new xbox and is that there are several 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.009
 names for this xbox some say that if 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.229
 xbox 720 others that xbox infinite others 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.990
 that xbox merge or else you just 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.550
 will call xbox and well it was rumored that 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.830
 you will always have to be connected to 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.360
 internet but this let's say that recently 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.280
 they confirmed it is a rumor 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.500
 totally false will not always have to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.470
 be connected to the internet something that if 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.350
 let 's say it 's a pretty latent rumor is 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.390
 that xbox is not going to allow games 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.610
 second-hand because it's basically going to 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.039
 have a video game or nothing else 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.420
 for a console you will be allowed 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.060
 second- hand games as I said 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.220
 so it's also good to see if 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.590
 this is confirmed or not in the next three 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.289
 and a guys likewise will have a kinect 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 2.0 that basically what it will do is that 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.350
 will disappear the garlic that I had or that 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.450
 has the kinect 1.0 of the xbox 360 at 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.220
 detect human movements on the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.230
 control has not come out any kind of 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.570
 image about this but it is speculated that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.370
 it will be very similar to the control of the xbox 360 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.379
 except for the type 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.239
 which they say has been improved for 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.090
 that is more ergonomic and that also 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.769
 will prolong the life of the batteries a 16 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.780
 percent in terms of 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.129
 specifications are said to bring a 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.420
 cpu from 8 cores to 1.6 gigahertz very 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.180
 similar to pc 4 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.159
 however we will see that the cpu of pc 4 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.319
 it will be much more good it will not be much more 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.500
 but it will be more powerful than the xbox 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.120
 to play but he got the xbox 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.829
 let's say it will be more efficient for 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.829
 do other tasks like surfing in 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.540
 internet see netflix browse in some 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.450
 applications like the lab the machine and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.870
 more let's say that in that it is going to center 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.640
 a little more the cpu of the xbox and not 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.410
 so much in gaming but let's say it does not stop 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.440
 of neglecting both the main part 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.379
 which is the video games too 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.069
 will have 8 gb of ram reader 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.190
 blu-ray the USB and ethernet ports 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.220
 corresponding 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.859
 will also come with windows 8 and let's say 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.319
 that the price is speculated that obama 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.389
 basically you already know that it will be 500 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.430
 dollars for the standard version that is 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.829
 the most basic one is obviously going to come out 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.349
 versions with more memory and so on 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.200
 a higher price and by the way guys the 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.480
 list of games xbox 720 will be in the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.739
 description that is all the games that 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.319
 have been confirmed until now 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.579
 will go to the xbox 720 will be a link 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.159
 in the description where you can check 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.760
 and a guy about if we go through the ps4 and 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.799
 PS4 intrigued me because even though 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.079
 is a console that has already been presented 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.209
 publicly in an official way and that's it 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.609
 recognized by are and all that and I've 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.950
 I've been doing a lot of research and I noticed that 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.769
 there is much more information about the new xbox 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.109
 that of playstation 4 so it's something 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.760
 let's say a little weird what most calls the 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.680
 attention of this console is that in 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.150
 effect will be somewhat more powerful for 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.120
 four and two games that the xbox like what 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.700
 I said earlier the cpu of the xbox is going 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.150
 to focus a little more on the others 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.680
 applications and the pc 4 cpu will be 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.630
 basically more focused on gaming but 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.940
 as I said no for other tasks like 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.210
 it will be that of the xbox in terms of command 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.860
 dualshock 4 is something truly 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.150
 Novelty as it will incorporate a screen 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.820
 tactile 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.310
 it is also right now the image 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.800
 in the video will be very light will have 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.530
 motion sensors a light bar 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.870
 led and even terrera some speakers 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.340
 integrated and good guys the date of 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.460
 launch of this console is expected 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.259
 that is in November specifically the 22 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.919
 of that month is basically the date that 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.440
 it is rumored that it will go on sale and 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.690
 let's say that the xbox more or less also 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.699
 It's going to be in November but hey 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.310
 let's leave the best for last guys and 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.860
 it's basically a news or rather a 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.870
 rumor that will surely cause a bit of 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.090
 smoke not much controversy 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.979
 if true, this rumor is 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.139
 news since I was reading that there 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.530
 a possibility that new call of 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.169
 duty ghosts you can leave exclusively 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.810
 to give new xbox I the personal not 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.750
 I think this is true because if I do not 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.150
 wrong you can preorder the call of 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.949
 duty cost for play 3 and well I think 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.139
 that it would be quite absurd that it is allied 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.539
 for the playstation3 and not for the 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.910
 playstation 4 but let's say there is the 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.870
 rumor that the new kolo touré can 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.390
 make the new cost 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.700
 exclusive for a console so I'm going 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.470
 guys will have to wait and see good 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.260
 I do not personally say that I already have very 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.080
 defined what console I'm going to buy and 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.300
 is basically that the new Xbox 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.180
 As you know then I what more more more 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.280
 more game and basically what I've played 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.380
 since a few months the only thing you play 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.750
 a few months ago until today is call of 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.210
 Duty and how do you know then Microsoft or its 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.160
 arrangements with the people of kolo touré 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.590
 and then they get the games before good in 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.510
 the eggs take out the new maps before 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.670
 let's say you give them a lot of 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.280
 preference to xbox users like this 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.500
 that's good basically that's why 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.940
 I bought the new xbox but it's me 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.040
 also very much like to buy 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.080
 ask for the playstation 4 so good to me 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.240
 I imagine that when I have money something 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.910
 Well, I'm going to buy pc 4 but 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.500
 first the new xbox so one 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.930
 guys well this basically everything I hope 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.670
 that has served them and well as it has already 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.290
 said after the xbox comes out 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.630
 will bring much more information so that 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.490
 you can check it out so good 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.960
 I hope that having helped them and not 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.240
 forget to vote the video to like 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.500
 favorites and comment so good I would 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.110
 dismissal I'm brand next 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.110
 see you in the next video bye bye 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.130
 you 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.290
