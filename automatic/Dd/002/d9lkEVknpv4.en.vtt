to work ranked in the United feel like

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.650 
to work ranked in the United feel like
it's<00:00:35.430> personal<00:00:35.820> relationship<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it's personal relationship and it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.139 
it's personal relationship and it
snowballs<00:00:37.730> especially<00:00:38.730> something<00:00:38.969> as

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
snowballs especially something as

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
snowballs especially something as
emotional<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.600> dancing<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.140> that's<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
emotional as dancing so that's one of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.650 
emotional as dancing so that's one of
the<00:00:41.520> reasons<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.969> obviously<00:00:42.120> stop

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the reasons that we obviously stop

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180 
the reasons that we obviously stop
repeating<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.620> went

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
repeating and we went

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
repeating and we went
a<00:00:44.430> show<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.239> because<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.690> wanted<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
a show like this because we wanted to

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.529 
a show like this because we wanted to
separate<00:00:46.379> our<00:00:46.559> private<00:00:46.920> life<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:48.390> the
