00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.900
 I want to say a third goal 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.039
 continues the series continues but despite 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.400
 all a lot of difficulties during 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.080
 this match 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.079
 wissam me it's clear that I have 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.640
 a lot of difficulties all that is it 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.369
 was very hard it's a game it's been 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.850
 very complicated all of this to be conducted as well 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.740
 in the score it was a bit of May 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.630
 but we have seen that it changes nothing 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 we're beefier so luckily 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 that we came back to the end 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 very soon I manage to score 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.930
 pity I can not manage to fit 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.329
 world the second I think the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 victory was better I think that had a 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.989
 late awakening from Toulouse 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.610
 twenty very good first minutes and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.260
 then a little more difficulty 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.449
 physically but still at the end 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.110
 you managed to come back and almost to 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.750
 win the game 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.640
 yeah it's clear it was very hard 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 physically we had some difficulty in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.540
 start to actually even in the end we got a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.800
 little trouble but we managed to push 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.930
 push to return to the score 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.269
 I think I think that if we would have 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.070
 lost it would not be very good for us 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.680
 we managed to come back and I think we 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 deserved the draw is good damage 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 they could not mark thanks yes 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 that antoine I want to say a return 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.750
 in his old club that went well 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.860
 passed despite everything but I think you 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 leave here with a lot of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.290
 frustration 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.549
 ah yeah take a goal in the five 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710
 last minute it's always very 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.180
 scared when I think we were holding the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.080
 sung the good end we must we must I 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.240
 think to make the break 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.410
 we have a lot of opportunities second half 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.480
 time we have not really been worried 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.770
 and abused 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.840
 of the long game so it was easier 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.640
 for us luckily we cracked 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.760
 physically after we had come 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.710
 look for a point at first 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.330
 these feelings mixed feelings but 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.580
 here it is going to have to progress on it 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.890
 and when we are on a good path 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.570
 we felt it the twenty minutes we were 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.980
 quite difficult on your part and 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.930
 a lot of ball losses but then 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.490
 from the second half it was 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 much better a lot of 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.730
 corrigenda I think from the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.890
 coach and a much larger race team 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.540
 ambitious yeah of course sailing then the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.500
 TFC game is very good 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.660
 a few years they know each other 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.060
 who know each other very well 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.040
 have progressed technically so there 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.990
 here he plays well we had trouble in 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.090
 first half time in the organization 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.860
 so they created a lot of movement 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 we were in trouble a lot 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.100
 loss of bullets we have 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.540
 improved in the second half and that's it 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.280
 that's for sure 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.380
 to rely and here I am anyway 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.390
 I am proud of them 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 of my team today you think that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.930
 the coach must be able to tell you to stay 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.060
 here normally sees I have permission 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.180
 to know ok okay 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.180
 Congratulations
