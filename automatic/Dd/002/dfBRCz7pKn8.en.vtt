00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
don't ask why and so the question of the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
day was if you could choose any

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
day was if you could choose any
superpower<00:00:18.320> from<00:00:19.320> any<00:00:19.619> universe<00:00:20.189> or<00:00:20.880> any

get my drift
this<00:02:16.010> power<00:02:16.280> makes<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.820> hard<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:18.020> not

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
this power makes it hard if not

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.220 
this power makes it hard if not
impossible<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:19.130> be<00:02:19.430> captured<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.840> makes<00:02:21.080> you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
impossible to be captured it makes you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.400 
impossible to be captured it makes you
really<00:02:21.440> hard<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.890> predict<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:24.050> gives<00:02:24.260> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
really hard to predict and it gives you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.410 
really hard to predict and it gives you
