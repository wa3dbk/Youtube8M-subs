00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.249 
there's a new perk called electric
cherry<00:00:09.630> it's<00:00:10.200> located<00:00:10.349> on<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> second<00:00:11.969> level

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
cherry it's located on the second level

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.470 
cherry it's located on the second level
in<00:00:13.259> front<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.590> fur<00:00:13.769> Marie<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:15.150> after<00:00:15.420> you

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
in front of the fur Marie and after you

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.120 
in front of the fur Marie and after you
get<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.440> got<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> group<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.980> zombies

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
get that I just got a group of zombies

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.810 
get that I just got a group of zombies
together<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.710> I<00:00:19.710> thought<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.460> if<00:00:20.760> you

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
together and I thought that if you

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.029 
together and I thought that if you
reload<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.660> them<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.289> would<00:00:22.500> cause<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
reload it on them you would cause a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.370 
reload it on them you would cause a
chain<00:00:23.340> reaction<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.880> kill<00:00:24.029> them<00:00:24.150> all<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:25.019> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
chain reaction to kill them all but I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.970 
chain reaction to kill them all but I
actually<00:00:25.939> got<00:00:27.199> surrounded<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
actually got surrounded right here and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.060 
actually got surrounded right here and
died<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.570> actually<00:00:30.960> works<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.500> lot

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
died and that actually works a lot

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.299 
died and that actually works a lot
better<00:00:32.809> like<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.469> killed<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.980> don't<00:00:35.219> know

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
better like I just killed I don't know

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.660 
better like I just killed I don't know
how<00:00:35.489> many<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.950> that's<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> best<00:00:38.309> way<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.489> do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
how many and that's the best way to do

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.850 
how many and that's the best way to do
it<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.840> there's<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> achievement<00:00:40.590> right

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it so there's the achievement right

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.729 
it so there's the achievement right
there<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> trapped<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.530> time

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
there so for the trapped in time

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.910 
there so for the trapped in time
achievement<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:46.160> sniper<00:00:47.160> trap<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.539> here

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
achievement the sniper trap right here

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.750 
achievement the sniper trap right here
is<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> only<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> needs<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> be

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is the only one that needs to be

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.860 
is the only one that needs to be
upgraded<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.620> mate<00:00:53.149> clicked<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> after<00:00:54.809> I

there<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.290> pretty<00:02:40.470> close<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.920> start

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and feed that 16 times

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.509 
and feed that 16 times
