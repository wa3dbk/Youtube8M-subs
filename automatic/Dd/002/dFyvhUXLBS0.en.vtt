00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570
 arrived means the science center 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.910
 called the world as I understood 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:14.639
 why do you like the world because inside 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.860
 her station is the world that we will go inside 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.150
 consider it in more detail on 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.480
 look what a surprise i think it is not 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.220
 real as punching supposedly 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 as long as I remember 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.750
 drowned 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.750
 here I am not 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.760
 its exact copy on the right which two 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.910
 the parts here are also a little train too 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.150
 sympathetic worth pravoseki japanese 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 level 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.150
 the camera that was used on the station 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.150
 the world has gone down to 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.770
 flash to her then some more camera 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.160
 apparently soviet they are all too 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.780
 Japanese nor Japanese camera 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.979
 used at the station world 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:08.720
 it turns out that this is what is here 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.090
 very dark because they helped 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.130
 turn on the light so sorry but 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.830
 will have to look at it all in the dark 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.100
 in the dark 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:25.610
 on this 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:29.500
 kido space dima japanese know in 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.500
 at the station of peace not used 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.360
 although maybe the Japanese were there 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.640
 maybe they just took a treat 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.760
 our astronauts have milk chocolate 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.270
 white chocolate strawberries in chocolate 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.840
 general dessert all sorts of curry and even 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.010
 conquer 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:57.940
 he is cosmic korea so yaki 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:02.050
 cosmic general kimchi cosmic 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.360
 so this is what is generally grata 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.430
 Any taste is audible of course not to compare with 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:14.680
 this and with what tamales tamales breakfast 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:20.080
 tourists this this what is tofu 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.080
 Yes, not bad eating after an astronaut 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:32.870
 here is our very first spaceship 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:35.720
 east here still east so here you 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.230
 spacecraft mockups are presented 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:44.110
 missiles of various 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.680
 and Russian Soviet American 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.709
 space shuttle 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:56.769
 America is Chinese even I have a tree 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.769
 described and proton 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:09.720
 so what can be an astronaut 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.430
 Japanese and the truth is very dark 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.320
 sleeping, I still do not understand where to include here 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.710
 you could drink to see that fluency 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.710
 there is 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.219
 yes, except for the world station here 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.129
 nothing more so remarkable then 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.129
 not that tower for children all 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 mechanisms
