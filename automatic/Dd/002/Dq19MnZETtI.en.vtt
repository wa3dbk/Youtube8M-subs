of pull it off when the mascara wand is
taken<00:01:46.420> out<00:01:46.509> on<00:01:46.719> three<00:01:47.049> it's<00:01:47.319> very<00:01:47.859> open<00:01:48.359> so

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
taken out on three it's very open so

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.569 
taken out on three it's very open so
that's<00:01:49.659> how<00:01:49.749> you<00:01:49.899> kind<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.349> control<00:01:51.279> how<00:01:51.520> much

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
that's how you kind of control how much

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.819 
that's how you kind of control how much
mascara<00:01:52.149> gets<00:01:52.420> on<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.659> brush<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.139> therefore

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
mascara gets on the brush and therefore

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.949 
mascara gets on the brush and therefore
it<00:01:53.920> goes<00:01:54.069> on<00:01:54.099> the<00:01:54.399> eyes<00:01:54.549> I<00:01:54.909> hope<00:01:55.599> that<00:01:55.810> makes

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
it goes on the eyes I hope that makes

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.719 
it goes on the eyes I hope that makes
sense<00:01:56.099> so<00:01:57.099> I'm<00:01:57.700> going<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.179> demonstrate<00:01:58.659> the
