with the net and then you can proceed

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.370 
with the net and then you can proceed
and<00:00:22.680> start<00:00:22.920> playing<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> rules<00:00:24.810> would<00:00:25.109> go

each<00:00:26.340> person<00:00:26.880> serves<00:00:27.119> two<00:00:27.480> services<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:29.070> I

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
each person serves two services so I

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.870 
each person serves two services so I
would<00:00:29.519> serve<00:00:29.760> first<00:00:30.660> service<00:00:31.309> like<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
would serve first service like this and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.870 
would serve first service like this and
when<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> serve<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.440> ball<00:00:34.590> has<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.950> hit<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.550> side

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
when I serve the ball has to hit my side

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.630 
when I serve the ball has to hit my side
first<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.110> partner's<00:00:37.649> side<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
first and then the partner's side so I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.180 
first and then the partner's side so I
serve<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.469> after<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.500> I'm<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
serve two after that I'm going to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.119 
serve two after that I'm going to
receive<00:00:41.730> two<00:00:44.450> after<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:46.289> keep<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
receive two after that we keep going and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
receive two after that we keep going and
with<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> score<00:00:47.850> until<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:49.280> person<00:00:50.280> reaches<00:00:51.059> 11

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
with the score until a person reaches 11

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
with the score until a person reaches 11
points<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.140> whoever<00:00:52.469> reaches<00:00:52.829> 11<00:00:53.190> points

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
points so whoever reaches 11 points

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
points so whoever reaches 11 points
first<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.390> winner<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.930> game<00:00:55.140> unless

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
first is the winner of the game unless

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.700 
first is the winner of the game unless
the<00:00:56.340> score<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> 1010<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> score<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the score is 1010 so when the score is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.270 
the score is 1010 so when the score is
1010<00:00:59.340> we<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> switch<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.469> service<00:01:01.920> every

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
1010 we have to switch the service every

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.679 
1010 we have to switch the service every
single<00:01:02.670> point<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.809> let's<00:01:04.019> say<00:01:04.170> 1010<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.799> serve

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
single point so let's say 1010 I serve

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.649 
single point so let's say 1010 I serve
1110<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.290> give<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> service<00:01:07.950> away<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.659> on

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
1110 then I give the service away and on

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
1110 then I give the service away and on
juice<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.470> stay<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.710> points<00:01:11.159> apart

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
juice we have to stay two points apart

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.440 
juice we have to stay two points apart
so<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.420> has<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.020> either<00:01:13.200> 12<00:01:13.619> 10<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.159> 13<00:01:14.790> 11<00:01:15.240> or

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so it has to be either 12 10 or 13 11 or

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.039 
so it has to be either 12 10 or 13 11 or
14<00:01:15.479> 12<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> cannot<00:01:17.970> only<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.509> 11

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
14 12 and so on so it cannot only be 11

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.270 
14 12 and so on so it cannot only be 11
10<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.060> by<00:01:21.450> international<00:01:22.080> standards<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
10 so by international standards the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.179 
10 so by international standards the
game<00:01:23.580> has<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.229> match<00:01:25.439> has<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> consist

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
game has to be the match has to consist

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
game has to be the match has to consist
of<00:01:26.340> seven<00:01:26.700> games<00:01:27.000> not<00:01:27.390> seven<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.780> best<00:01:28.110> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of seven games not seven but best of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.859 
of seven games not seven but best of
seven<00:01:28.680> let's<00:01:29.640> say<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> person<00:01:30.360> has<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.540> win

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
seven let's say the person has to win

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.359 
seven let's say the person has to win
either<00:01:31.140> 4<00:01:31.470> 0<00:01:31.770> 4<00:01:31.979> 1<00:01:32.189> 4<00:01:32.430> 2<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.939> 4<00:01:33.329> 3<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.159> most

either 4 0 4 1 4 2 or 4 3 to be most

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219 
either 4 0 4 1 4 2 or 4 3 to be most
simple<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.000> play<00:01:36.180> best<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.540> 5<00:01:36.780> that's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
simple you can play best of 5 that's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.679 
simple you can play best of 5 that's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
be in first three games three zero three

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.639 
be in first three games three zero three
one<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.590> three<00:01:43.860> -<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.049> one<00:01:46.049> more<00:01:46.079> thing<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
one of three - and one more thing to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.730 
one of three - and one more thing to
mention<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.340> single<00:01:47.909> matches<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.899> me

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
mention in single matches so if it's me

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.450 
mention in single matches so if it's me
and<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.759> somebody<00:01:51.149> else<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.720> person<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:53.310> can

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
