that<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.769> somehow<00:00:32.099> ignore<00:00:32.910> perhaps<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.809> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that we somehow ignore perhaps this is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.020 
that we somehow ignore perhaps this is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
because the fix for bad spawns isn't

cover<00:00:50.610> there's<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.180> lot<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.600> different<00:00:51.870> rafts

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
cover there's a lot of different rafts
you<00:00:52.260> could<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.129> rather<00:00:53.399> than

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you could go with it so rather than

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.330 
you could go with it so rather than
making<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.180> three-hour<00:00:54.629> long<00:00:54.960> video<00:00:55.350> analyzing

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
making a three-hour long video analyzing
every<00:00:56.730> inch<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> spawns<00:00:57.449> system<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
every inch of the spawns system and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.110 
every inch of the spawns system and
speculating<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.219> might<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.460> better<00:00:59.820> or

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
speculating on what might be better or

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849 
speculating on what might be better or
what<00:01:00.390> might<00:01:00.629> fix<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> system<00:01:01.530> better<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
what might fix the system better I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.650 
what might fix the system better I
thought<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> would<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.489> more<00:01:02.670> useful<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.149> focus

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
thought it would be more useful to focus

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.230 
thought it would be more useful to focus
on<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> specific<00:01:04.110> issue<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.339> blatantly

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
on a specific issue that is so blatantly

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.210 
on a specific issue that is so blatantly
broken<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.840> battlefield<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.770> really

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
broken in battlefield that it really

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730 
broken in battlefield that it really
just<00:01:08.340> has<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.060> fixed<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.689> soon<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.049> possible

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
just has to be fixed as soon as possible

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410 
just has to be fixed as soon as possible
so<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> placement<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> spawns<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.299> the

balanced<00:01:16.200> certain<00:01:16.500> teams<00:01:16.710> were<00:01:16.890> closer<00:01:17.189> to

other things but it was never an issue
that<00:01:19.350> was<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:20.009> focused<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> too<00:01:21.000> much

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that was really focused on too much

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.999 
that was really focused on too much
because<00:01:21.420> generally<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.200> rounds<00:01:22.590> started

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
because generally when rounds started

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
because generally when rounds started
you<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.490> people<00:01:23.640> trickling<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.600> from

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you would get people trickling in from

you would get people trickling in from
either<00:01:25.110> side<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.549> never

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
either side this was because we never

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.149 
either side this was because we never
had<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.240> round<00:01:27.509> start<00:01:27.840> timer<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.500> ready<00:01:28.950> up

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
had that round start timer the ready up

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
had that round start timer the ready up
button<00:01:29.430> where<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> number<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.150> people<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.600> each

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
team had to hit the ready button and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.340 
team had to hit the ready button and
then<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> got<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.970> 10<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.509> 20<00:01:33.900> people<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
then you got like 10 or 20 people on

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
then you got like 10 or 20 people on
either<00:01:34.500> side<00:01:34.829> spawning<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> ready<00:01:36.270> to

either side spawning in and ready to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
either side spawning in and ready to
fight<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.320> time<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.130> is

fight all at the right time this is

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
fight all at the right time this is
basically<00:01:38.700> shown<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.720> poorly<00:01:40.350> placed

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
basically shown just how poorly placed

just hold that left-click button or the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.680 
just hold that left-click button or the
trigger<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.069> your<00:02:26.220> controller<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.060> fire<00:02:27.390> as

soon as that spawn timer ends and
basically<00:02:29.970> people<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:30.420> gonna<00:02:30.510> start

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
basically people are gonna start

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
basically people are gonna start
dropping<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.440> flies

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.280 
dropping like flies
it<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.610> does<00:02:32.849> beg<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.120> question<00:02:33.300> how<00:02:34.050> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
it really does beg the question how is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.740 
it really does beg the question how is
this<00:02:34.530> still<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.890> thing<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.640> spawn<00:02:36.030> problem

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
this still a thing this spawn problem

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.140 
this still a thing this spawn problem
here<00:02:37.049> was<00:02:37.470> definitely<00:02:37.709> evident<00:02:38.549> as<00:02:38.700> soon<00:02:38.970> as

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
here was definitely evident as soon as

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.300 
here was definitely evident as soon as
the<00:02:39.330> map<00:02:39.569> was<00:02:39.870> released<00:02:40.319> for<00:02:40.530> dragon's<00:02:41.040> teeth

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
the map was released for dragon's teeth

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.949 
the map was released for dragon's teeth
so<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.790> means<00:02:41.970> we've<00:02:42.120> had<00:02:42.330> three<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> half

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
so that means we've had three and a half

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.690 
so that means we've had three and a half
