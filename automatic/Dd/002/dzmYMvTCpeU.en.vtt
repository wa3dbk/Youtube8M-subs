00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.920
 ocher walls do not have several painters 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.820
 that comes here with the foot with this sand to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.820
 make watercolor 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.510
 and all the little houses are painted like this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.510
 also red 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.559

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.200
 and he had his lover killed and served in the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.640
 the heart of such a young man when the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.860
 the heart of the love of your life she threw herself 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.200
 here in these principles and that is why 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 the russian mountains yesterday this color 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 reddish because they were caught 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 with the blood of the baron's wife who was 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.880
 owner of these pieces 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.770

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.460
 beautiful and sunny region and the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 France 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.710
 Let's go to my kitchen to see what 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.710
 We're going to do it today. 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.280
 To make this recipe you will 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.880

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.160
 using here still in green pod pod 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.760
 this kind of fine 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.330
 I cut the tips and then 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.330
 smaller pieces 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.130
 and I do the same thing with washing 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.130
 flattened 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:47.319
 the 11 zucchini the cut into cubes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.319

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.580

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.580

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.180
 ae 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.760
 I will not need two taken 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:52.069
 concassÃ© those are already without skin 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.519
 I'll take the seeds out and cut in 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.519
 cubs 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.030
 the onion also when reducing in pieces 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.030
 minors 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.450
 I'll cover all the vegetables with water. 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:48.010
 put a good pinch of coarse salt and 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.820
 carry on high heat until rising 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.860
 boil many vegetables cook us 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.080
 will prepare our state 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.210
 for you will need three teeth 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.990
 large garlic that cut it into pieces 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.860
 children and places in a pestle a 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.860
 little salt coarse 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.080
 then I get a handful of basil and 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.080
 I also give a punch with the knife 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.750
 I start by crushing the garlic until it 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.750
 turn a folder 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.050
 then add the basil and was 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.000
 stirring well crushing the idea is always 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.000
 do a little like a text 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:49.390
 then we put the olive oil bila plus one 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.390
 little until all homogeneous 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.080
 when you already have a foam on top 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.090
 vegetables and I down fire and let 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.770
 cook slowly for more or less 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.930
 one hour when the vegetables are already 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.790
 almost good that I'm going to put a 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.780
 spaghetti cut it into pieces as well 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.780
 little ones 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.220
 when pasta is already cooked agent 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:44.570
 turn off the fire and put a pistol 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.570
 Move well, just serve. 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.750
 and this soup is traditionally served 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.729
 at the end of summer in France but I do not 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.080
 I think it's not bad to try an umbrella in 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.080
 any time of the year is not
