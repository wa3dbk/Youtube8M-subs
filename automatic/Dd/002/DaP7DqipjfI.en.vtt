you know whatever that way it will soak

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.490 
you know whatever that way it will soak
in<00:04:50.850> all<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.120> color<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.630> it'll<00:04:51.780> stay<00:04:51.870> longer

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
in all the color and it'll stay longer

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.030 
in all the color and it'll stay longer
because<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.580> semi-permanent<00:04:54.390> stuff

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
because this is a semi-permanent stuff

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.550 
because this is a semi-permanent stuff
so<00:04:56.040> it'll<00:04:56.670> wash<00:04:56.880> out<00:04:57.060> a<00:04:57.120> little<00:04:57.300> faster<00:04:57.750> but

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
so it'll wash out a little faster but

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.000 
so it'll wash out a little faster but
if<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.800> leave<00:04:58.950> it<00:04:58.980> in<00:04:59.160> for<00:04:59.190> long<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.850> will<00:05:00.060> stay

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
if you leave it in for long it will stay

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.159 
if you leave it in for long it will stay
for<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.040> while<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:04.970> let's<00:05:05.970> say<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.510> make

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
for a while so let's say it just make

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.020 
for a while so let's say it just make
sure<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.590> use<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:08.190> dumb<00:05:08.520> blonde<00:05:08.790> because

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
sure to use the dumb blonde because

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.730 
sure to use the dumb blonde because
they're<00:05:09.180> really<00:05:09.450> worth<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:10.200> it<00:05:10.350> smells<00:05:10.470> really

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
they're really worth it it smells really

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.700 
they're really worth it it smells really
good<00:05:11.840> so<00:05:12.840> good<00:05:13.080> luck<00:05:13.700> bye
