00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.779
 my little gifts during the month of 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.760
 December that are mainly from 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.170
 Christmas but I'm with my 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.850
 hat because there are not many 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.860
 opportunities in the year to use it 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.859
 you have to be as much as possible and good 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.390
 I also decided to go out here already 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.009
 that the day was so beautiful I do not have 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.050
 face of being locked up recording I want 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.689

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.939
 Christmas but how much we had the board 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.259
 if it was a Saturday and well it was a whole 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.030
 history because the square of cultures 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.670
 they closed it because there was an event of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.370
 we drink together and one rope 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.989
 of my subscribers is their channels of 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.399
 alessandra and I tell them the number of 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.109

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.059

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:53.199

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.750
 and also brought a necklace that as it puts 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.580
 a butterfly but you can see it well 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.920
 I'm not going to take it out because if I'm not going to take 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.170

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.700

 lamela is like this 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.010
 and I found that pretty in drawings like 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 that looks like the cne I told her I know 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.610

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.650

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.960
 good those were Christmas gifts 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.000
 thank you very much abroad for the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.090
 gift was very entertaining too 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.119
 shared on that day and the others are 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.259
 regalitos have made me the baby 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.940
 at Christmas 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.410
 I debase the gifts to her and she 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.240
 he shelters them before time and then 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.030
 inside time we also 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.350
 Well this is not like I had more 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.840
 curiosity to see well in the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.119
 presentation as in paper volantín 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.979
 but after you open it, it stays that way 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.439
 a phrase of plastic as a color 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.960
 cream and the one that comes this is says it 's 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.289
 a moisturizing bar for massages 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.909
 favor days of seeing lavender scent is 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.189
 good or no strong this as it already entered into 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.049
 aromatherapy category and these queen 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.840
 April in I was very curious about 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.700
 try it and good the cne he gave it to me 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.920
 another thing that also came in his 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.860
 gift bag is this the lipstick of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.110
 that 's what of the line or juanes and george 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.670
 and this is gray 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.670
 and I hope you can see it 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.370
 the beginning 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.840
 and I think it 's like he's trying 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.450
 using it under other lipsticks as 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.190
 to see 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.950
 how to change the color a bit more 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.950
 clear and the other that also came is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.110
 this enamel extension 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 none say it is for craquelure 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.620
 white I have not used it yet 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.510
 you, although I like it very much 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.090
 nail things and I did not have any 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.980
 cracked yes I think it's going to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.080
 entertain a lot a lot on the sidewalk by 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.530
 your little gifts and a little kiss also how 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.530
 do what 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.150
 psychological and other gifts that are 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.590
 Christmas is this cart that I loved 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.110
 It has the forms of 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.819
 a cupcake for the coasts printed 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.590
 in the layer as part of the cream 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.530
 this gives me the impression that it is painted 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.570
 by hand because they know as well as the brushes 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.570
 and here I liked it a lot 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.180
 and the other good thing I wanted these glazes 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.250
 two English chain electropop and I wanted 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.349
 mainly the like because they came 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.950
 several pink and I do not have many pink 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.330
 but I think the el viejito pascuero 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.910
 santaclós cone in other countries gave wrong 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.380
 the data and I have it repeated so I'm going 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.540
 to have to go to change it I think that 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.370
 I'm going to change it for braille then 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.610
 came green yellows that also 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.160
 I liked it so much so good we're 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.800
 in Maltese de chai lies and we in what 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.220
 Last I received this Christmas 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.130
 this shirt 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.210
 I gave one of my sisters 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:14.120
 I have here half a turn of this anger 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:17.209
 that are as well fashionable is white 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.720
 so it has this detail forward 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.810
 that like a few threads and trusses and 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.590
 from behind it's like this then they fix it is 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.229
 as well translucent then I do not know 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.699
 still very well how to use it because as 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.440
 I'm not very fond of things 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.900
 translucent is not a style like that 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.610
 I use normally I do not like 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.410
 quite the detail I think it starts 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.650
 with a white tone below it can be left 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.650
 all right 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.130
 As a Christmas gift I had a great time 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.410
 but these days has been a bit chaotic 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.300
 because I was outside some time tomorrow 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.860
 I have a meeting and I wanted them 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.570
 comment on fists with dots 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.460
 they asked me questions in the other 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.950
 what your video tutorial on how 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.930

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.700
