00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 welcome ladies gentlemen to this brand new 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.040
 special video about roller coaster 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.319
 tycoon world 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.179
 I can already guarantee you successfully 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.320
 that these games will be fantastic 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.059
 then you probably have one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.040
 channel already seen and positive 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.170
 comments that post on twitter and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 you name it on all social media I am 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.660
 totally in love with roller coaster 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.830
 tycoon world 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.289
 and it does not interest me the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.970
 multiplayer functions it just concerns me 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.640
 just for the gameplay and there is a video 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 came out and that video is official 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.400
 launched 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.500
 it's not officially on the roller 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.500
 coaster tycoon world a youtube channel 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 but in the van or through a one 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.070
 nice interview and the images i have 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 get caught of it and those images are yours 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.379
 view a game with comments from me 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 like, for example , those skylines 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.950
 we all know but we want to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.200
 just something new and something beautiful and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.750
 as you can see it is graphically common 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 improved and it is just a neck james 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.090
 become here we see how we actually 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.219
 spending a hole in it 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.109
 hole that is actually the same tools that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.570
 had started chose 3 saws 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.180
 here are making some mountain and that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.799
 mountains that yes those that that the oak too 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.510
 remained the same as roller coaster 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.220
 only it is a bit simpler and a lot 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.159
 whole new menu in a whole 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.990
 refreshingly clear menu at the bottom of you 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 I just don't do anything on the side anymore 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.400
 nice everything down well then 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 we go a path rich and the path then comes 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.150
 automatically a bridge that means if we 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.619
 of those hills then it will 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.090
 create a bridge automatically there 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.890
 we are no longer messing around with that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960
 used to be like that with rolling corset 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 strap swings and make your own bridge 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 here it is automatically done to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.970
 jes what the balls with paths 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.799
 my can therefore also very nice turn 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.689
 I would not recommend this for this 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.640
 so to do with that slanted corner 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.560
 it looks nice well this is a bottle 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.930
 runs a bit and wild west theme 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.119
 very graphic horrified him has one 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.710
 barrel put down and the side and mitten 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.880
 a lantern break and a few cactus 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.829
 side by side 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.659
 well it looks very cold in itself 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.340
 but we just need the trees and the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.899
 environment 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.700
 so this is a kind of sphere and I think that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.259
 you're on the side of that sphere and that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.360
 you then just at the very great speed 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.850
 as the star wars' fairground attraction the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.890
 you go around star tours 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.170
 well here see more tricks are drive 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.420
 placed on it and a roller coaster 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.000
 confirmed so you actually make it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.610
 get started 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.620
 from your roller coaster but I see what it 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.660
 station is a bit easy to get one 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.010
 little yes you can't really do it yourself 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 I feel themed 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.760
 but I hope so in the future 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.500
 is going to happen because it really was so flop 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.550
 and I put it down and it is ready 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.130
 I hope you get around it 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.140
 can build some things so that we can 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.870
 little roller coaster 3 atmosphere setting 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.700
 get well here is shamans going up 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.220
 and hoists him then heals me whole 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.640
 make strange but show something 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.600
 very striking if this is then it is 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 that good 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.770
 giel becomes a bit dangerous 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.090
 or an intensive roller coaster 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.530
 but you will see immediately when that 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.209
 add a few corkscrews and 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.350
 very easy tool 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.730
 I believe you have to use your mouse 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.560
 scrolling I don't know exactly how yet 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.260
 that goes but at least you can quite 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.239
 easily make a turn with the degrees 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.920
 and of course that had never happened 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.600
 roller coaster could but we have we 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.010
 all the downloaded attraction we could do that 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.880
 do well 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.120
 but each of you can see it 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.530
 red is selected and that is 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.300
 of course not very realistic I think 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.770
 I don't think this roller coaster is just me 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.209
 think it's just a simple ah man 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.920
 might be that people are going in 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.670
 I would not dare say where you are 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.709
 fall 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.200
 so now simply made and equally 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.459
 quick easy for this video 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.920
 there are also a few high resolution 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.900
 photos actually leaked from through 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.519
 roller coaster tycoon world itself one 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.489
 just after they showed it up 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.769
 the fair at the game fair and first 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.780
 photo that we see is nice and familiar 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.310
 namely see a roller coaster we will see 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.590
 again that same station mark before I have 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.880
 not to nag but I hope that still 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.000
 nice that you have a little varied 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.410
 can do with stations and well nature 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.330
 looks fantastic i see on the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.489
 background such a wild west ferris wheel 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.950
 you who cool us 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.200
 muscles is already equal and back again 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.330
 ferris wheel i really see everything and it 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.060
 just looks beautiful again i am 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.160
 so fall in love with this game we go fast 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.170
 on to the next for oh yes and even more 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.579
 an observation through at the back and 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.769
 you actually see much more i see 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.590
 you in the distance the entrance to it 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.150
 park even I hope that is very much 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.340
 will be varied and you will not 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.780
 only the same input now have this one 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.790
 photos also a very cool 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.010
 I don't know if it's all in the same 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.229
 shot in the same park is possible 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.200
 Seeing pictures again is real 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.090
 terribly gave the benches stand in it 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.979
 grass in itself is nice but I had 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.210
 maybe the benches on the path 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.350
 but yes there you have again whole 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.180
 narrow path 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.919
 so maybe that's nice yes it is 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.870
 is a bit on i think this too 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.780
 rather just but then I actually had 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.280
 would rather have a bit with your bank 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.770
 considering it is a bit out of neighborhood though 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.710
 those are all crazy details 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.450
 everything i see flags i see lanterns 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.600
 posts I see beautiful nature again 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.610
 a large roller coaster in the distance on the right and 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.830
 ferris wheel i see another themed 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.690
 attraction well I do not know if that roof 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.840
 what you see if it costs him a salary or 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.160
 that that is already in the station itself there 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.440
 to the left of it you also see a small one 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.840
 house or it is yes I do not know 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.789
 maybe it just belongs and in 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.070
 such a statue and the afternoon of course 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.530
 that statue that that is last one 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 kind of thematization see that that one 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.430
 mascots of your park 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.680
 so you can choose the mascot for you 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.460
 park and you would have such a strain in it 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.990
 put down 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.180
 well the wounds photos actually quite 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.580
 simple but it looks incredibly beautiful 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.860
 and especially that reflection of that 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.289
 horses of the sun it is really super 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.970
 gift to it this is just no roller 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.349
 coaster tycoon 3 more it's just real 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.849
 a totally new game and that is 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.999
 basically what I hoped for then 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.629
 and yes it is so incredibly beautiful 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:44.839
 done 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.249
 I am impressed with this photo 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:49.399
 the photo we found is therefore one 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.199
 total picture of letter k scarf with 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:52.639
 the horses and one in the background 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.289
 a bit of a fair feeling 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.599
 namely you see a small ferris wheel and 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.189
 that really in youtube ferris wheel really one 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.949
 super big ferris wheel 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:03.770
 who should not miss such a big wheel 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.509
 definitely go to your park and yes 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.679
 beautifully done this again just 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.069
 a Ferris wheel 

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:11.990
 nice placed nice fences with it 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.639
 just looks really good 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.919
 I still miss some nature as irons 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.809
 names trees but that is our job 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.189
 to improve that also very nice that 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:21.469
 small pictures 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.789
 in those top edges of swapping 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.629
 three ferris wheel also say of that 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.979
 carousel 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.169
 see also those little pictures in that 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.569
 laps it also looks super fun from all over 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.979
 very varied photo series may be the last 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.269
 photo is perhaps the least of everything 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.709
 I've seen 

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:35.839
 but what we can see are those 

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:37.849
 dead trees a bit those ghost trees 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.559
 who have come back as you see it 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.360
 in which roller coaster two is already present 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:42.680
 and in part three you now also in this part 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.479
 but the roller coaster is of course 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.490
 awfully weird 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.229
 and not yet finished but I think so 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.149
 this is simply made to leave
