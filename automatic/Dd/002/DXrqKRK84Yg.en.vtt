hey<00:00:01.140> guys<00:00:01.410> in<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.709> story<00:00:02.100> we'll<00:00:02.429> be<00:00:02.550> going

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey guys in this story we'll be going

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.079 
hey guys in this story we'll be going
over<00:00:03.060> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.270> create<00:00:03.680> spawned<00:00:04.680> enemies<00:00:05.279> so

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
over how to create spawned enemies so

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.480 
over how to create spawned enemies so
we're<00:00:06.270> gonna<00:00:06.359> create<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.750> node<00:00:07.069> we're<00:00:08.069> going<00:00:08.370> to

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
we're gonna create a node we're going to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.970 
we're gonna create a node we're going to
have<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:09.090> bunch<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.510> enemies<00:00:09.690> spawn<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.620> one

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
have a bunch of enemies spawn at one

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.530 
have a bunch of enemies spawn at one
time<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.630> then<00:00:12.630> uh<00:00:12.950> we'll<00:00:13.950> wait<00:00:13.980> five<00:00:14.910> seconds

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
time and then uh we'll wait five seconds

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
time and then uh we'll wait five seconds
and<00:00:15.690> make<00:00:15.929> another<00:00:16.289> batch<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.650> enemies<00:00:16.920> bomb

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and make another batch of enemies bomb

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.330 
and make another batch of enemies bomb
and<00:00:18.090> then<00:00:18.869> uh<00:00:18.900> yeah<00:00:19.740> it'll<00:00:19.949> keep<00:00:20.100> looping

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and then uh yeah it'll keep looping

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.620 
and then uh yeah it'll keep looping
through<00:00:20.699> there<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.000> I'll<00:00:21.090> keep<00:00:21.270> spawning

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
through there and I'll keep spawning

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.529 
through there and I'll keep spawning
enemies<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.160> send<00:00:23.460> them<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.240> node

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
enemies and it will send them to a node

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.460 
enemies and it will send them to a node
so<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.769> want<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.189> first<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.289> create<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
so what you want to do first is create a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.420 
so what you want to do first is create a
node<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.510> node<00:00:30.750> 2<00:00:31.080> node<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.309> gonna

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
node one and a node 2 node one is gonna

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.240 
node one and a node 2 node one is gonna
be<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.730> spawn<00:00:32.969> location<00:00:33.600> no.2<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.920> gonna<00:00:35.100> be

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
be your spawn location no.2 is gonna be

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.970 
be your spawn location no.2 is gonna be
where<00:00:35.430> they're<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.710> all<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.890> have

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
where they're going to and all you have

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
where they're going to and all you have
to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.059> create<00:00:39.300> empty

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
to do is go in here and create empty

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.810 
to do is go in here and create empty
game<00:00:40.290> object<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.010> rename<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.489> node

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
game object and you can rename it node

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.650 
game object and you can rename it node
or<00:00:42.140> rename<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> whatever<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.010> want<00:00:44.660> next

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
or rename it whatever you want next

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.490 
or rename it whatever you want next
thing<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.110> want<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.860> uh<00:00:48.350> we'll<00:00:49.350> go

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
thing you want to do is uh we'll go

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.360 
thing you want to do is uh we'll go
check<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.309> AI<00:00:50.730> minions<00:00:51.329> code<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> pretty

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
check out the AI minions code so pretty

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.150 
check out the AI minions code so pretty
much<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.180> uses<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.930> code<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.070> we

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
much this just uses the code that we

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
much this just uses the code that we
used<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.579> other<00:00:56.730> tutorial<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> AI

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
used the other tutorial for the AI

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.590 
used the other tutorial for the AI
follow

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
follow

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
follow
the<00:01:00.600> only<00:01:00.840> difference<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.280> some

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the only difference is I put in some

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
the only difference is I put in some
randoms<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:04.680> code<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:05.040> be

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
randoms here and this code will be

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.630 
randoms here and this code will be
updated<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.619> through<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> tutorials<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
updated as we go through the tutorials a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
updated as we go through the tutorials a
little<00:01:08.850> bit<00:01:08.970> more<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.140> adding<00:01:10.470> in

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
little bit more we're gonna be adding in

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.300 
little bit more we're gonna be adding in
like<00:01:12.110> different<00:01:13.110> positions<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> enemies

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
like different positions of the enemies

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
like different positions of the enemies
so<00:01:14.610> they're<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.150> following<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
so they're not all following in a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.249 
so they're not all following in a
straight<00:01:16.080> line<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:17.630> already<00:01:18.630> went<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
straight line and already went in and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.999 
straight line and already went in and
did<00:01:19.560> random<00:01:20.189> speed<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.880> it'll<00:01:21.409> every<00:01:22.409> time

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
did random speed so it'll every time

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.960 
did random speed so it'll every time
this<00:01:23.159> updates<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.830> change<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> speed<00:01:26.580> at

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this updates it will change the speed at

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.100 
this updates it will change the speed at
which<00:01:27.210> they<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.600> traveling<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.630> yeah<00:01:30.630> that's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
which they are traveling so yeah that's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.649 
which they are traveling so yeah that's
pretty<00:01:31.350> much<00:01:31.979> all<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.729> hasn't<00:01:33.450> really

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
pretty much all that it's hasn't really

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.830 
pretty much all that it's hasn't really
take<00:01:33.840> change<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.500> much<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.720> we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
take change that much so and then we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.770 
take change that much so and then we
have<00:01:36.960> our<00:01:37.079> spawn<00:01:37.350> minions<00:01:38.100> code<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.600> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
have our spawn minions code and this is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.600 
have our spawn minions code and this is
pretty<00:01:39.990> much<00:01:40.079> our<00:01:40.380> other<00:01:40.560> code<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.310> used

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
pretty much our other code that we used

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.450 
pretty much our other code that we used
before<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.060> spawning<00:01:42.570> prefabs

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
before for spawning prefabs

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.359 
before for spawning prefabs
but<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.500> went<00:01:46.500> through<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> we

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
but in this one we went through and we

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.730 
but in this one we went through and we
set<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.450> loop<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.869> lot<00:01:49.079> different<00:01:49.470> so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
set up the for loop a lot different so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.149 
set up the for loop a lot different so
the<00:01:50.040> spawn

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
the spawn

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.399 
the spawn
so<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:51.939> can<00:01:52.149> spawn<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.420> bunch<00:01:52.719> of<00:01:52.840> enemies<00:01:52.960> at

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
so you can spawn a bunch of enemies at

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.770 
so you can spawn a bunch of enemies at
one<00:01:53.619> time<00:01:53.829> so<00:01:54.640> what<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:54.969> will<00:01:55.060> do<00:01:55.240> is<00:01:55.420> it'll<00:01:55.630> go

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
one time so what it will do is it'll go

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.740 
one time so what it will do is it'll go
through<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:57.399> will<00:01:57.549> spawn<00:01:58.299> all<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
through and it will spawn all the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.789 
through and it will spawn all the
enemies<00:01:59.460> every<00:02:00.460> 0.2<00:02:01.060> seconds<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:02.590> that

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
enemies every 0.2 seconds that that

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.539 
enemies every 0.2 seconds that that
makes<00:02:03.009> up<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.630> then<00:02:05.200> yeah<00:02:05.619> it'll<00:02:05.829> spawn<00:02:06.130> them

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
makes up and then yeah it'll spawn them

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.089 
makes up and then yeah it'll spawn them
at<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.850> location<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.899> it'll<00:02:08.679> keep<00:02:08.830> looping

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
at the location and it'll keep looping

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:15.120 
at the location and it'll keep looping
through<00:02:09.550> here<00:02:09.989> until<00:02:10.989> X<00:02:11.380> gets<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.690> 7<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.200> then

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
through here until X gets to 7 and then

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.740 
through here until X gets to 7 and then
once<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.459> gets<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.670> 7<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.330> wait<00:02:16.510> five

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
once it gets to 7 and a wait five

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.339 
once it gets to 7 and a wait five
seconds<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.790> it'll<00:02:18.790> subtract<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:20.440> X<00:02:20.739> and

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
seconds and it'll subtract from X and

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.479 
seconds and it'll subtract from X and
then<00:02:23.349> allow<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.549> go<00:02:25.540> through<00:02:25.569> there<00:02:26.019> again

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
then allow you to go through there again

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.339 
then allow you to go through there again
so<00:02:27.489> it'll<00:02:27.790> subtract<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.510> yeah<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.959> eight<00:02:31.349> but

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
so it'll subtract it yeah to eight but

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.990 
so it'll subtract it yeah to eight but
yeah

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
yeah

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.729 
yeah
so<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.390> those<00:02:34.540> pieces<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.170> code<00:02:35.380> what<00:02:35.650> you

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
so for those pieces of code what you

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.420 
so for those pieces of code what you
want<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.160> first<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:37.349> create<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:39.099> I've

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
want to do first is create a a I've

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.449 
want to do first is create a a I've
minion<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:43.349> don't<00:02:44.349> know<00:02:44.470> why<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.709> had<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
minion I don't know why it had the

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.809 
minion I don't know why it had the
players<00:02:46.030> there<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.860> yeah<00:02:47.980> create<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.579> random

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
players there but yeah create a random

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.280 
players there but yeah create a random
box<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.930> minion<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:51.870> throw<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.110> AI

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
box that is a minion and throw the AI

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.780 
box that is a minion and throw the AI
minions<00:02:53.890> code<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.340> there

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
minions code on there

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.970 
minions code on there
and<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:56.200> don't<00:02:56.350> have<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.530> mess<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:56.859> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
and you don't have to mess with the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.880 
and you don't have to mess with the
target<00:02:57.340> or<00:02:57.459> transform<00:02:58.329> could<00:02:58.600> stall<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
target or transform could stall in the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.970 
target or transform could stall in the
thing<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.630> then<00:03:01.630> uh<00:03:01.660> one<00:03:02.530> other<00:03:02.620> thing<00:03:02.890> you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
thing and then uh one other thing you

thing and then uh one other thing you
want<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.220> do<00:03:03.370> for<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.030> node<00:03:04.780> two<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:06.220> want<00:03:06.430> to

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
want to do for the node two you want to

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.330 
want to do for the node two you want to
take<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.970> with<00:03:07.150> node<00:03:07.810> two<00:03:08.139> so<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.100> don't

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
take it with node two so if you don't

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.520 
take it with node two so if you don't
know<00:03:09.400> what<00:03:09.519> Taylor<00:03:09.850> yet<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.269> go<00:03:10.420> in<00:03:10.569> here<00:03:10.870> drop

know what Taylor yet you go in here drop

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.500 
know what Taylor yet you go in here drop
this<00:03:11.739> down<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.400> change<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.819> size<00:03:13.030> which

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
this down you can change the size which

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.050 
this down you can change the size which
is<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.019> amount<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.799> tags<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.340> can<00:03:15.489> add<00:03:15.819> in

click in one of these boxes and type in
node<00:03:19.299> two<00:03:19.950> just<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.760> then<00:03:22.720> you

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
node two just like that and then you

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.009 
node two just like that and then you
want<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.079> go<00:03:23.230> back<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:24.130> your<00:03:24.280> minion<00:03:24.730> and

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
want to go back on to your minion and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.379 
want to go back on to your minion and
drop<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.200> down<00:03:26.440> are<00:03:27.310> not<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.880> minion<00:03:28.209> but

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
drop this down are not the minion but

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.570 
drop this down are not the minion but
the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.930 
the
no<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.600> drop<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.800> down<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.070> select<00:03:32.700> no<00:03:32.910> to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
no to drop this down and select no to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.540 
no to drop this down and select no to
from<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.450> list<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:34.800> way<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.220> find<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
from the list that way you can find the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.850 
from the list that way you can find the
tag<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.970> it'll<00:03:36.180> know<00:03:36.390> where<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.080> go<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
tag and it'll know where to go in the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.120 
tag and it'll know where to go in the
scene<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.510> after<00:03:39.930> all<00:03:39.960> that's<00:03:40.200> done<00:03:40.410> you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
scene and so after all that's done you

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.270 
scene and so after all that's done you
want<00:03:41.490> to<00:03:41.580> go<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.940> create<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.300> prefab<00:03:42.950> so<00:03:43.950> just

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
want to go and create a prefab so just

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.310 
want to go and create a prefab so just
create<00:03:44.520> a<00:03:44.550> folder<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:46.160> create<00:03:47.160> new<00:03:48.320> prefab

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
create a folder and create new prefab

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.690 
create a folder and create new prefab
and<00:03:50.000> then<00:03:51.000> once<00:03:51.210> it's<00:03:51.810> created<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:53.430> want<00:03:53.610> to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
and then once it's created you want to

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.580 
and then once it's created you want to
take<00:03:53.850> your<00:03:54.030> minion<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.630> drag<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.200> drop<00:03:55.440> it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
take your minion and drag and drop it

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.800 
take your minion and drag and drop it
onto<00:03:55.710> the<00:03:56.040> prefab<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.760> all<00:03:57.270> your<00:03:57.450> code<00:03:57.660> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
onto the prefab and all your code and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.810 
onto the prefab and all your code and
stuff<00:03:58.020> should<00:03:58.200> be<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.350> here<00:03:58.710> and<00:03:58.860> we'll<00:03:59.700> be

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
stuff should be in here and we'll be

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.619 
stuff should be in here and we'll be
able<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.980> yeah<00:04:01.980> spawn<00:04:02.520> at<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.300> location

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.539 

and<00:04:06.780> then<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.409> last<00:04:07.590> thing<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.040> did<00:04:08.280> was

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
and then the last thing that I did was

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.750 
and then the last thing that I did was
uh<00:04:10.340> let's<00:04:11.340> see<00:04:11.670> here<00:04:11.780> at<00:04:12.780> node<00:04:13.230> 1<00:04:13.859> I<00:04:14.159> put<00:04:14.579> these

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
uh let's see here at node 1 I put these

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.599 
uh let's see here at node 1 I put these
spawn<00:04:15.209> minions<00:04:15.719> scripts<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:17.070> that's<00:04:17.370> the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
spawn minions scripts so that's the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.890 
spawn minions scripts so that's the
point<00:04:17.789> that<00:04:18.030> they're<00:04:18.180> gonna<00:04:18.269> be<00:04:18.479> spawning

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
point that they're gonna be spawning

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.640 
point that they're gonna be spawning
from<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.859> then<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.190> want<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> drag<00:04:21.380> node<00:04:22.380> 1

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
from and then you want to drag node 1

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.480 
from and then you want to drag node 1
onto<00:04:23.250> itself<00:04:23.639> in<00:04:23.849> that<00:04:24.449> spot<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.039> then<00:04:26.039> drag

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
onto itself in that spot and then drag

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.029 
onto itself in that spot and then drag
your<00:04:26.520> prefab<00:04:27.270> onto<00:04:27.750> there<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.680> that's<00:04:28.889> all

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
your prefab onto there and that's all

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.159 
your prefab onto there and that's all
you<00:04:29.190> need<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.520> do<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:29.970> they'll<00:04:30.570> spawn<00:04:30.840> and

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
you need to do and they'll spawn and

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.890 
you need to do and they'll spawn and
move<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:32.130> location<00:04:32.520> every<00:04:33.090> 5<00:04:33.300> seconds

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
move to that location every 5 seconds

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.300 
move to that location every 5 seconds
and<00:04:34.080> waves<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.970> we'll<00:04:36.539> go<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.080> check<00:04:37.139> this<00:04:38.099> out

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
and waves so we'll go and check this out

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.850 
and waves so we'll go and check this out
real<00:04:38.520> quick<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:40.080> can<00:04:40.229> see<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.650> they're

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
real quick you can see that they're

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.189 
real quick you can see that they're
changing<00:04:41.220> speeds<00:04:41.759> and<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.720> want<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.020> spread

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
changing speeds and I want to spread

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.189 
changing speeds and I want to spread
them<00:04:43.349> out<00:04:43.470> in<00:04:43.740> future<00:04:44.280> tutorials<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:45.199> we'll

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
them out in future tutorials and we'll

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.110 
them out in future tutorials and we'll
be<00:04:46.349> going<00:04:46.620> over<00:04:46.740> how<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.340> make<00:04:47.460> them<00:04:47.729> stop<00:04:48.090> and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
be going over how to make them stop and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.249 
be going over how to make them stop and
attack<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.800> player<00:04:50.099> if<00:04:50.539> they<00:04:51.539> interrupt<00:04:52.050> them

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
attack the player if they interrupt them

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.040 
attack the player if they interrupt them
or<00:04:52.550> have<00:04:53.550> them<00:04:53.580> fight<00:04:54.030> each<00:04:54.060> other<00:04:54.419> so<00:04:54.690> I'm<00:04:54.780> 2

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
or have them fight each other so I'm 2

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.110 
or have them fight each other so I'm 2
waves<00:04:55.289> that<00:04:55.620> will<00:04:55.889> randomly<00:04:56.400> target<00:04:56.910> each

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
waves that will randomly target each

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.980 
waves that will randomly target each
other<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.690> try<00:04:58.440> killing<00:04:58.650> each<00:04:58.889> other<00:04:59.099> and

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
other and try killing each other and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.040 
other and try killing each other and
then<00:05:01.220> yeah<00:05:02.220> we<00:05:02.490> can<00:05:02.639> make<00:05:02.820> them<00:05:03.120> once<00:05:03.690> they<00:05:03.870> get

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
then yeah we can make them once they get

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.400 
then yeah we can make them once they get
to<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.320> tower<00:05:04.530> started<00:05:04.919> attacking<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.639> and

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
to the tower started attacking it and

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.279 
to the tower started attacking it and
all<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.650> stuff<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.340> right<00:05:09.060> now<00:05:09.270> yeah<00:05:09.870> this<00:05:10.080> is

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
all that stuff so right now yeah this is

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.770 
all that stuff so right now yeah this is
messed<00:05:10.530> up<00:05:10.710> because<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.159> distance<00:05:11.780> we're

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
messed up because the distance we're

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.240 
messed up because the distance we're
gonna<00:05:12.900> have<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.320> adjust<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.770> script<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.159> little

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
gonna have to adjust the script a little

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.879 
gonna have to adjust the script a little
bit<00:05:14.490> but<00:05:14.729> once<00:05:15.270> we<00:05:15.419> start<00:05:15.659> programming<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.349> AI

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
bit but once we start programming the AI

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.370 
bit but once we start programming the AI
to<00:05:17.099> be<00:05:17.400> a<00:05:17.430> lot<00:05:17.639> smarter<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.240> can<00:05:18.930> do<00:05:19.080> all<00:05:19.229> that

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
to be a lot smarter and can do all that

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.890 
to be a lot smarter and can do all that
stuff<00:05:19.759> it'll<00:05:20.759> look<00:05:20.880> a<00:05:21.000> lot<00:05:21.030> nicer<00:05:21.360> than<00:05:21.570> this

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
stuff it'll look a lot nicer than this

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.100 
stuff it'll look a lot nicer than this
but<00:05:22.590> yeah<00:05:22.710> that's<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.099> basics<00:05:23.490> for<00:05:24.110> spawning

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
but yeah that's the basics for spawning

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.930 
but yeah that's the basics for spawning
your<00:05:25.409> minions<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.009> getting<00:05:26.250> them<00:05:26.430> to<00:05:26.460> move<00:05:26.789> to

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
your minions and getting them to move to

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.450 
your minions and getting them to move to
a<00:05:26.970> different<00:05:27.060> point<00:05:27.479> so<00:05:28.470> we'll<00:05:28.919> go<00:05:29.070> over<00:05:29.099> how

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
a different point so we'll go over how

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.360 
a different point so we'll go over how
to<00:05:29.490> also<00:05:30.240> move<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:31.289> more<00:05:31.440> nodes<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:31.949> after<00:05:32.250> they

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
to also move to more nodes so after they

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.850 
to also move to more nodes so after they
destroy<00:05:32.759> a<00:05:32.970> tower<00:05:33.180> make<00:05:34.050> them<00:05:34.229> move<00:05:34.440> to

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
destroy a tower make them move to

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.499 
destroy a tower make them move to
another<00:05:35.699> node<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.560> so<00:05:37.560> on<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:38.610> hope<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:39.360> guys

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
another node and so on so hope you guys

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.759 
another node and so on so hope you guys
keep<00:05:39.750> watching<00:05:39.900> stay<00:05:40.889> tuned<00:05:41.099> until<00:05:41.400> next<00:05:41.520> time
