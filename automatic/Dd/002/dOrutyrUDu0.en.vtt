hate catching catfish because of this

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.570 
hate catching catfish because of this
was<00:04:13.060> you'd<00:04:13.210> have<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.480> take<00:04:13.660> your<00:04:13.870> pliers<00:04:14.080> and

and it takes too much time and as you
saw<00:04:19.989> with<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.860> method<00:04:21.340> it's<00:04:21.820> really<00:04:22.570> quick

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
saw with this method it's really quick

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.410 
saw with this method it's really quick
it's<00:04:23.860> actually<00:04:24.190> quicker<00:04:24.400> than<00:04:24.760> scaling<00:04:25.210> or

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
it's actually quicker than scaling or

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.530 
it's actually quicker than scaling or
actually<00:04:25.690> cleaning<00:04:25.930> scaled<00:04:26.350> fish<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:28.270> that's

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
actually cleaning scaled fish so that's

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.330 
actually cleaning scaled fish so that's
pretty<00:04:28.810> much<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.110> rid<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.350> this<00:04:29.610> part<00:04:30.610> here

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
pretty much it rid of this part here

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.770 
pretty much it rid of this part here
then<00:04:33.340> you'd<00:04:33.460> wash<00:04:33.670> this<00:04:33.850> off<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.360> then
