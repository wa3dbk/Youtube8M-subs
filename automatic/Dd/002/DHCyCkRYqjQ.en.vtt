00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
know that I guess it must have come with

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.110 
know that I guess it must have come with
the<00:00:35.309> update<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:36.570> course<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.989> managed<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> lag

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
the update of course I managed to lag

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
the update of course I managed to lag
but<00:00:39.469> y'all<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.649> back<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> recording<00:00:41.219> when<00:00:41.309> I'm

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
but y'all get back to recording when I'm

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
but y'all get back to recording when I'm
inside<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.329> yeah<00:00:43.820> okay<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.840> usual

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
inside and yeah okay so just like usual

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.520 
inside and yeah okay so just like usual
you<00:00:47.070> want<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> teleport<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.200> grab<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> quick

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you want to teleport here grab a quick

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.010 
you want to teleport here grab a quick
amount<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.860> runes<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.850> normally<00:00:51.480> won't

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
amount of runes now normally won't

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.799 
amount of runes now normally won't
really<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.350> teleporting<00:00:52.980> much<00:00:53.160> um<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
really be teleporting much um but if you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.580 
really be teleporting much um but if you
plan<00:00:55.340> but<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.910> always<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.570> way<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
plan but there is always a way of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.439 
plan but there is always a way of
teleporting<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.640> probably<00:00:59.969> speed

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
teleporting and it will probably speed

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
teleporting and it will probably speed
you<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.780> bit<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:01.250> but<00:01:02.250> teleporting<00:01:02.789> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
you up a bit more but teleporting is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.570 
you up a bit more but teleporting is
really<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.480> done<00:01:03.719> only<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.580> people

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

really going to be done only for people
that<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:06.090> using<00:01:06.570> either<00:01:07.020> death<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.770> blood<00:01:08.040> but

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

emptier<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.159> time<00:01:56.520> after<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:58.380> update<00:01:58.560> gets

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
emptier in time after the update gets

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.539 
emptier in time after the update gets
dead<00:01:59.310> content<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.100> hop<00:02:02.310> around

in this spot I don't know why it's just
that<00:02:19.290> they<00:02:19.530> seem<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.890> occur<00:02:20.189> really<00:02:20.519> well<00:02:20.730> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that they seem to occur really well and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.360 
that they seem to occur really well and
for<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.659> level<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.110> you're<00:02:22.739> going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.099> at

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370

all you need to do is click siphon and

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.140 
all you need to do is click siphon and
this<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:12.440> why<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.500> want<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:14.159> have<00:04:14.519> many<00:04:14.849> ruins

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
this point is you just go to this spot

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.760 
this point is you just go to this spot

who<00:04:52.949> don't<00:04:53.070> know<00:04:53.190> what<00:04:53.370> nodes<00:04:53.669> are<00:04:53.940> nodes<00:04:54.300> are

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
who don't know what nodes are nodes are

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.060 
who don't know what nodes are nodes are
these<00:04:57.570> little<00:04:57.840> random<00:04:58.380> events<00:04:58.770> pretty<00:04:58.949> much

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
these little random events pretty much

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.219 
these little random events pretty much
that<00:04:59.550> happened<00:05:00.000> only<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.330> this<00:05:00.539> minigame<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
that happened only in this minigame and

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.890 
that happened only in this minigame and
they<00:05:01.860> give<00:05:02.039> extra<00:05:02.340> XP<00:05:02.789> you<00:05:03.479> know<00:05:03.599> you<00:05:03.690> don't

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
they give extra XP you know you don't

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.510 
they give extra XP you know you don't
get<00:05:04.080> rune<00:05:04.410> essence<00:05:04.740> when<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:04.949> kill<00:05:05.160> them<00:05:05.340> so

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
get rune essence when you kill them so

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.430 
get rune essence when you kill them so
you<00:05:05.580> know<00:05:05.789> don't<00:05:05.820> camp<00:05:06.479> them<00:05:06.720> unless<00:05:07.169> you<00:05:07.320> have

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
you know don't camp them unless you have

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.010 
you know don't camp them unless you have
a<00:05:07.500> large<00:05:07.889> supply<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:08.310> rune<00:05:08.580> essence<00:05:09.020> because

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
a large supply of rune essence because

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.420 
a large supply of rune essence because
that<00:05:10.110> will<00:05:10.199> not<00:05:10.380> be<00:05:10.500> good<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:11.099> get<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.220> body

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
that will not be good and you get a body

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.909 
that will not be good and you get a body
room<00:05:11.699> so<00:05:12.229> let's<00:05:13.229> find<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.560> body<00:05:13.740> there<00:05:14.190> we<00:05:14.340> go<00:05:16.370> so

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
room so let's find a body there we go so

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.860 
room so let's find a body there we go so
the<00:05:19.919> reason<00:05:20.849> why<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.120> want<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.389> find<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.630> spot

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
the reason why I want to find a spot

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.659 
the reason why I want to find a spot
with<00:05:22.020> good<00:05:22.259> nodes<00:05:22.530> is<00:05:22.830> because<00:05:23.130> nodes<00:05:23.400> give

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
with good nodes is because nodes give

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.300 
with good nodes is because nodes give
more<00:05:23.940> XP<00:05:24.449> and<00:05:24.750> are<00:05:24.870> easier<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.349> obtain<00:05:25.590> so<00:05:26.160> like

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
more XP and are easier to obtain so like

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.640 
more XP and are easier to obtain so like
even<00:05:26.460> if<00:05:26.639> the<00:05:27.090> node<00:05:27.300> gives<00:05:27.599> less<00:05:27.840> expedia

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
even if the node gives less expedia

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.909 
even if the node gives less expedia
little<00:05:29.039> creature<00:05:29.820> other<00:05:30.320> there<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.500> means<00:05:31.620> the

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
little creature other there it means the

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.550 
little creature other there it means the
lower<00:05:32.130> level<00:05:32.460> node<00:05:32.729> and<00:05:33.139> you'll<00:05:34.139> probably

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
lower level node and you'll probably

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.879 
lower level node and you'll probably
fail<00:05:35.099> it<00:05:35.340> less<00:05:35.580> likely<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.449> you'll<00:05:37.199> gain<00:05:37.620> the

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
fail it less likely and you'll gain the

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.300 
fail it less likely and you'll gain the
things<00:05:38.430> faster<00:05:38.880> now<00:05:39.360> if<00:05:40.229> you're<00:05:40.770> a<00:05:40.800> level<00:05:41.039> 90

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
things faster now if you're a level 90

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.820 
things faster now if you're a level 90
this<00:05:41.550> is<00:05:41.699> my<00:05:41.849> favorite<00:05:42.180> spot<00:05:42.449> as<00:05:43.199> you<00:05:43.380> can<00:05:43.470> see

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
this is my favorite spot as you can see

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.860 
this is my favorite spot as you can see
notes<00:05:44.159> spawned<00:05:44.490> everywhere<00:05:45.120> here<00:05:45.479> for<00:05:45.720> some

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
notes spawned everywhere here for some

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.800 
notes spawned everywhere here for some
reason<00:05:46.199> you<00:05:47.159> will<00:05:47.820> see<00:05:47.970> a<00:05:48.000> lot<00:05:48.210> of<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.479> undead

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
reason you will see a lot of the undead

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.800 
reason you will see a lot of the undead
souls<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.349> guess<00:05:49.560> but<00:05:50.430> it's<00:05:51.270> usually<00:05:51.419> not<00:05:51.659> that

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
souls I guess but it's usually not that

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.110 
souls I guess but it's usually not that
big<00:05:52.139> of<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.260> deal<00:05:52.409> as<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:53.550> can<00:05:53.699> see<00:05:53.849> they're<00:05:54.000> all

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
big of a deal as you can see they're all

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.230 
big of a deal as you can see they're all
on<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.570> undead<00:05:55.380> soul<00:05:55.789> they're<00:05:56.789> all<00:05:56.970> high

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
on the undead soul they're all high

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.969 
on the undead soul they're all high
level<00:05:57.479> room<00:05:57.659> crafters<00:05:58.110> but<00:05:58.620> there<00:05:58.770> are<00:05:58.889> many

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
level room crafters but there are many

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.249 
level room crafters but there are many
other<00:05:59.250> spots<00:05:59.610> that<00:05:59.909> spawn<00:06:00.240> here<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.509> lot<00:06:00.750> you

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
other spots that spawn here a lot you

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.839 
other spots that spawn here a lot you
can<00:06:01.380> also<00:06:01.470> go<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.919> spot<00:06:02.159> but<00:06:02.550> this<00:06:02.669> one's

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
can also go to that spot but this one's

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.589 
can also go to that spot but this one's
i<00:06:02.970> has<00:06:03.870> a<00:06:03.900> bit<00:06:04.139> less<00:06:04.349> events<00:06:04.740> usually<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.599> this

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
i has a bit less events usually and this

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.120 
i has a bit less events usually and this
one<00:06:06.750> obviously<00:06:06.990> is<00:06:07.380> more<00:06:07.590> crowded<00:06:07.860> because

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
one obviously is more crowded because

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.510 
one obviously is more crowded because
people<00:06:08.430> already<00:06:08.849> found<00:06:09.120> out<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.960> good<00:06:10.110> spots

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
people already found out the good spots

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.180 
people already found out the good spots
so<00:06:11.520> yeah<00:06:12.150> if<00:06:12.330> you're<00:06:12.539> a<00:06:12.870> little<00:06:13.800> 90

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
so yeah if you're a little 90

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.499 
so yeah if you're a little 90
runecrafting<00:06:14.490> you'll<00:06:14.880> be<00:06:14.970> trading<00:06:15.210> off<00:06:15.360> the

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
runecrafting you'll be trading off the

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.110 
runecrafting you'll be trading off the
soulless<00:06:16.020> Wraith<00:06:16.289> and<00:06:16.729> they're<00:06:17.729> also<00:06:17.849> other

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
soulless Wraith and they're also other

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.450 
soulless Wraith and they're also other
events<00:06:18.930> like<00:06:19.050> rooting<00:06:19.320> spheres<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.250> the

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
events like rooting spheres and the

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.300 
events like rooting spheres and the
wizard<00:06:20.880> but<00:06:21.120> I<00:06:21.270> personally<00:06:21.599> never<00:06:21.840> do<00:06:22.139> it<00:06:22.310> you

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
wizard but I personally never do it you

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.310 
wizard but I personally never do it you
have<00:06:23.340> to<00:06:23.430> have<00:06:23.580> a<00:06:23.610> really<00:06:24.030> massive<00:06:24.180> supply<00:06:25.110> of

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
have to have a really massive supply of

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.850 
have to have a really massive supply of
runes<00:06:25.590> and<00:06:25.949> I<00:06:26.729> always<00:06:27.539> get<00:06:27.780> unlucky<00:06:28.050> and<00:06:28.470> I

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
runes and I always get unlucky and I

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.520 
runes and I always get unlucky and I
never<00:06:29.070> managed<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:29.460> get<00:06:29.580> the<00:06:29.699> wizard<00:06:30.030> so<00:06:30.720> yeah

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
never managed to get the wizard so yeah

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.610 
never managed to get the wizard so yeah
I<00:06:31.560> usually<00:06:31.919> don't<00:06:32.009> bother<00:06:32.250> with<00:06:32.400> that<00:06:32.550> now

there's one over here and there's one
over<00:06:54.780> here<00:06:55.009> so<00:06:56.009> that's<00:06:56.189> why<00:06:56.310> sometimes<00:06:56.520> it'll

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 
over here so that's why sometimes it'll

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.459 
over here so that's why sometimes it'll
get<00:06:56.969> a<00:06:57.000> bit<00:06:57.150> less<00:06:57.419> XD<00:06:57.750> because<00:06:58.110> you<00:06:58.169> only<00:06:58.319> get

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:58.469 
get a bit less XD because you only get

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:59.719 
get a bit less XD because you only get
one<00:06:58.500> of<00:06:58.740> the<00:06:58.830> rooms<00:06:59.039> you'll<00:06:59.310> get<00:06:59.490> like<00:06:59.610> the

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
one of the rooms you'll get like the

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.459 
one of the rooms you'll get like the
weaker<00:07:00.000> version<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:00.599> sometimes<00:07:01.199> you'll<00:07:01.349> get

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:01.469 
weaker version and sometimes you'll get

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:07.610 
weaker version and sometimes you'll get
both<00:07:02.000> so<00:07:03.000> Todd<00:07:03.840> XP<00:07:04.620> is<00:07:04.680> determined<00:07:05.280> then<00:07:06.620> yeah

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
both so Todd XP is determined then yeah

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.559
