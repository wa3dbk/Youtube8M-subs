leave them alone so some other stuff
there's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> lot<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.710> improvements<00:02:02.430> in

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
there's a lot of improvements in

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.380 
there's a lot of improvements in
creative<00:02:03.119> mode<00:02:03.799> if<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.040> get<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> stack<00:02:06.360> of

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
creative mode if you get a stack of

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.249 
creative mode if you get a stack of
items<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.759> normal<00:02:09.390> thing

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
items now this is just a normal thing

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.160 
items now this is just a normal thing
but<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.129> throw<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> stack<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.300> items

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
but if you throw the stack of items

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.660 
but if you throw the stack of items
instead<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.620> having<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.950> all<00:02:14.130> count<00:02:14.459> as

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
instead of having it all count as

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.460 
instead of having it all count as
individual<00:02:15.240> items<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.690> now<00:02:15.900> keeps<00:02:16.319> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
individual items that now keeps it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.320 
individual items that now keeps it
together<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> stack<00:02:17.280> which<00:02:17.550> I'm<00:02:17.910> guessing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
together as a stack which I'm guessing

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.680 
together as a stack which I'm guessing
will<00:02:19.430> kind<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.520> help<00:02:20.670> servers<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.270> stuff<00:02:21.510> out

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
will kind of help servers and stuff out

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.210 
will kind of help servers and stuff out
with<00:02:21.930> having<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.260> ton<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.440> items<00:02:22.800> floating

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
of it they're basically trying to make

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.550 
of it they're basically trying to make
creative<00:03:11.700> mode<00:03:12.000> easier<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.110> stuff<00:03:13.380> with

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
creative mode easier to do stuff with

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.080 
creative mode easier to do stuff with
the<00:03:13.650> block<00:03:13.860> picking<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.310> everything<00:03:14.580> but<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the block picking and everything but a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.360 
the block picking and everything but a
side<00:03:15.299> effect<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:15.750> unless<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.440> go<00:03:16.590> down<00:03:16.799> here<00:03:17.190> and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
side effect is unless I go down here and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.729 
side effect is unless I go down here and
click<00:03:17.730> off<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.900> can't<00:03:19.140> really<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.500> rid<00:03:19.680> of

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
click off then I can't really get rid of

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.539 
click off then I can't really get rid of
this<00:03:19.950> stuff

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
this stuff

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.910 
this stuff
so<00:03:21.000> hopefully<00:03:21.299> they<00:03:21.450> fix<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:22.019> otherwise<00:03:22.769> I

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
so hopefully they fix that otherwise I

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.380 
so hopefully they fix that otherwise I
would<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.070> have<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.370> throw<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:23.790> out<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.269> I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
would just have to throw it out like I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.900 
would just have to throw it out like I
normally<00:03:24.510> would<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.170> know<00:03:25.549> some<00:03:26.549> other<00:03:26.579> new

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
normally would you know some other new

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.190 
normally would you know some other new
things<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.570> probably<00:03:27.810> one<00:03:28.079> of<00:03:28.109> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
things this is probably one of the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800 
things this is probably one of the
coolest<00:03:28.940> things<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.359> here<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.780> that

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
coolest things going on here is that

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.479 
coolest things going on here is that
dispensers<00:03:31.769> if<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:33.180> have<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.320> dispenser<00:03:35.100> full

that's<00:04:02.880> pretty<00:04:03.180> probably<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.900> most<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
that's pretty probably the most the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.360 
that's pretty probably the most the
biggest<00:04:05.940> feature<00:04:06.359> for<00:04:06.900> just<00:04:07.799> normal<00:04:07.950> players

biggest feature for just normal players
a<00:04:08.489> lot<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:08.970> is<00:04:09.120> creative<00:04:09.680> only<00:04:10.680> these

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
a lot of this is creative only these

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.620 
a lot of this is creative only these
kind<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.670> block<00:04:11.880> picking<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.389> all<00:04:12.450> that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
kind of the block picking and all that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.110 
kind of the block picking and all that
stuff<00:04:12.870> but<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.680> definitely<00:04:14.010> adds<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.730> to

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
stuff but it definitely adds to the to

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.759 
stuff but it definitely adds to the to
make<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.359> game<00:04:15.540> easier<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:16.200> us<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.680> these

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
baby animals are so cute but that is

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.930 
baby animals are so cute but that is
pretty<00:04:21.810> much<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.409> I<00:04:22.860> don't<00:04:23.490> think<00:04:23.700> there's

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
pretty much it I don't think there's

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.480 
pretty much it I don't think there's
much<00:04:24.210> else<00:04:24.450> other<00:04:24.780> than<00:04:25.140> if<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.860> shift-click

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
much else other than if you shift-click

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.170 
much else other than if you shift-click
I<00:04:26.700> can't<00:04:26.970> show

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
I can't show

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.879 
I can't show
this<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.570> creative<00:04:27.960> but<00:04:27.990> if<00:04:28.259> you<00:04:28.380> shift-click

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
this and creative but if you shift-click

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.800 
this and creative but if you shift-click
on<00:04:29.009> armor<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.580> will<00:04:29.669> now<00:04:29.789> go<00:04:29.850> into<00:04:30.210> your<00:04:30.360> armor

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810

slot<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:31.979> that's<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.310> pretty<00:04:32.520> simple<00:04:33.030> fix

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
slot so that's a pretty simple fix

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.050 
slot so that's a pretty simple fix
that's<00:04:33.479> been<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> long<00:04:33.810> time<00:04:34.020> coming<00:04:34.350> so<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:35.580> hope

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
that's been a long time coming so I hope

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.029 
that's been a long time coming so I hope
they<00:04:36.240> keep<00:04:36.479> some<00:04:36.840> way<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.050> make<00:04:37.289> baby<00:04:37.530> animals

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039
