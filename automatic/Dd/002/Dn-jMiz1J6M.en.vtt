00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.479
 In this video we will see how to find the 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.130
 true magnitude of all edges 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:10.790
 of a solid in this case we have a 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.700
 irregular tetrahedron or a pyramid 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.710
 of triangular base in which only 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.330
 we have in true magnitude the 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.699
 edges corresponding to the base 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.890
 those that form the triangle to bs 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.730
 its edges if we have them in true 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.900
 magnitude since they are 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.520
 and take out the base of this pyramid is 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.200
 contained in the horizontal plane of 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.850
 projection we already know that all 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.040
 lines that are contained in a plane 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.199
 of projection or in a plane parallel to 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.390
 one of the projection planes is 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.360
 show in real magneto so 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.360
 that the edges of the triangle apc that 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.010
 it serves as the basis for this pyramid if 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.600
 we observe it in true magnitude without 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.089
 However addicts to give and ask not 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.969
 we will contemplate in true magnitude 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.800
 since they are edges that are not in 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.449
 parallel to any of the plans of 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.340
 prediction can not be contained in 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.009
 a plane that is parallel to the planes 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.930
 of forecast to solve this kind of 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.360
 problems we know there is a series 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.930
 of systems or methods within the system 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.030
 of water that help us solve 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.980
 this problem in which in which 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.530
 we have a figure in such a way that it does not 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.200
 is in a favorable position to 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.570
 observe his true magnetto we saw 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.450
 methods how were the plane change that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.070
 in this case it would not be convenient because 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.960
 we will have to use a plane change 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.270
 for each of the edges with which 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.180
 we will have the third plane change and 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.420
 it would be a real nuisance and it would not be the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.030
 appropriate method we could resort to the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.729
 despondency but we will have to perform 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.890
 at least two abatements for that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.750
 way in the first depression find the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.970
 true magnitude of two edges and in 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.040
 the second dejection locate the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.899
 true magnitude of the third so 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.020
 which also does not seem to be the most 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.300
 suitable in this case the most 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.420
 adequate would be 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.229
 the spin method since we could 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.450
 to pass an axis of rotation that was a 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.000
 vertical line that passes through the point of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.210
 which is a common point to the three edges 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.990
 at sight ate cd &amp; v from that point 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.620
 we will move to a turning axis 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.630
 and thanks to that axis we can rotate all 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.720
 the edges until placing them in parallel 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.790
 to the vertical projection plane once 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.190
 that we had it like this we could 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.100
 contemplate the true magnitude of those 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.440
 edges 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.900
 if it appears let's go to it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.600
 as I was saying we are going to try an axis that 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.930
 is going to go through this point d 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.689
 task located going through point d 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.549
 and we will have our axis in the projection 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.549
 vertical I'm going to name it 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.930
 here would be a vertical precision and 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.330
 here we would see him sharing points with 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.560
 the point d in the horizontal projection 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.930
 that would be that axis seen in the pressure 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.700
 vertical 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.620
 and now simply from this axis 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.140
 we should take the measure 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.760
 corresponding to rotate each of 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.120
 the points but first of all I could 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.400
 draw a line parallel to the line 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.220
 earth passing through the axis 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.049
 will be the point at which they should be 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.900
 rotated all points to pp and pse and from 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.409
 this mode the edges are parallel 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.109
 to the vertical plane of prison vice that 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.879
 line parallel to the earth line is going to 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.650
 serve to rotate each one of the 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:51.099
 points up that line that way all 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.079
 the factories will be rotated in parallel 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.659
 to the vertical plane of forecast 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.370
 let's go with the first point we'll use the 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:02.239
 compass to fair 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.330
 we'll look first at this point go through 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.810
 closeness and 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.230
 there would be the point b rotated there 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.230
 we would have 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.690
 the turning point and to locate it in 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.960
 the vertical plane as we know it is a 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.640
 point located in the horizontal plane there 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.000
 would be the vertical projection of that 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.860
 point 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.659
 It would 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.840
 the turning point in your forecast 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:38.000
 vertical therefore here we will have the 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.870
 first of the edges I wanted it from this 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.400
 p up to d in true magnitude and what 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.759
 it should do with each 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.340
 the points we take the beat again 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.360
 we adjust to the point c 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.360
 we turn it 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.830
 there had the point turned on it should be 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.140
 also for the point 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.930
 we would write the point to place 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.110
 these two edges parallel to the plane 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.110
 vertical 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.960
 here we have 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.240
 the point c 1 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.880
 once rotated 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.460
 and the point of peace 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.770
 once rotated 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.590
 we draw reference lines for 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.810
 find the vertical precision of the 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.889
 points that equally of the same 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.830
 happened with point b 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.749
 is located in the horizontal plane of 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.509
 projection with which simply 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:40.439
 we move reference line and join 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:42.749
 there we will have the ideal edge of an idealist 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.259
 ade is true magnitude we are going to 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:45.259
 to name 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.749
 it would be the point 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.740
 a bonus 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.830
 and a point 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.470
 and a bonus as you see we already have the 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.490
 three edges that we were missing since 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.530
 those of the bases we already had 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.750
 true magnitude we already have all three 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.000
 edges in true magnitude and we have 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.940
 done by turns as you see quite 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.830
 simple and much more practical having 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.440
 made two dejection and of course 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.150
 much more practical than having used three 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.729
 plane changes is a problem quite 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.680
 frequent of the diedrick system or in 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.289
 cases in which they ask us for the development 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.050
 of a solid in this case 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.090
 the most comfortable way would be to find the 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.220
 true magnitude of edges that do not 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.560
 we observe in werder magnitude turning it 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.539
 once we have the true magnitude of 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.150
 all the edges would simply be 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.250
 solve triangle problems in 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.680
 elementary in the triangle problem in 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.449
 the one that give us the three sides is something 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.009
 that we are not going to do right now but if 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.470
 is something that we will see later when 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.930
 let's see the representation and development of 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.229
 solids in the water system 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.919
 well this is all for now we see each other in 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.919
 the next video
