00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.259
 There is one new video today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.179
 the television of blaupunkt again not 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.019
 park lately likes things out 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.150
 no longer belong 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:19.740
 that is from my girlfriend 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.300
 right now i'll be right the details in 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 write the video descriptions and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.269
 Now just go on after that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:39.840
 quite big than I thought 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:41.790
 I hope I hear it well I hope 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:57.750
 that light conditions ils bad 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:01:06.470
 open on tv are also the straw 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.470
 Vehicle used to be the bracket 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:54.710
 Here is the whole thing when you come 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.210
 what that focuses on a bit 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.200
 bad but I'll show you the first 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.200
 things that were there 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:16.040
 that comes already a lithe 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 wrapped up foil I always think that 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.830
 remove it from here at the back 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.200
 and the will to fix it I 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.860
 do not build it together now 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.860
 only a short time 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.620
 the beautiful things here will be where the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.860
 Being on foot feels like he does that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.819
 glass or metal or it around the whole 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.819
 fix the wall 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.939
 it is the stand it made of glass you 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.939
 can see here 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.590
 So far so far I know 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.060
 blaupunkt does not put good televisions 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.900
 definitely more reliable than to 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:08.159
 do not do like orion or telekom any 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:12.269
 the other side there was the bag again 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.269
 the remote control was in it 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.019
 The stop looks like pretty much everyone 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:30.209
 other remotes too and one 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:36.400
 piece of blue point on it short instruction 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.290
 how to build the whole and one 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.599
 Instructions for use the same again 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.440
 pretty much no human needs if you 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.440
 can be yourself 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.090
 Last but not least we have here 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.090
 can hear screwing here 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:02.080
 I think that the guarantee and that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.910
 Here is the efficiency class system 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:13.990
 consumes quite a bit 45 kilowatts per 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:14.770
 at 31 watt so is in an 80 cm led 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.770
 TV 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:28.110
 here are green with by daily max 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:28.110
 and the cable you need 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:27.710
 so is the whole then I hope 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:30.450
 Do not mirror such kind of thinking people 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.830
 that's what the whole thing looks like from behind me 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.450
 I hope that's good for you 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.870
 seen in front I will otherwise one 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:41.030
 photo rear cut or a purely 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:48.420
 Short video that you are the connections 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:53.010
 the whole part unfortunately has mine 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:59.610
 Camera does not focus so it looks like that 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:04.560
 whole out audio out twice hdmi scart 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.110
 connection vga connection the whole part 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.000
 hd is ready 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:14.010
 say it solved a maximum of 720p on here 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.580
 we still have some stuff usb is 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.310
 participate in card slot and that all 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:26.490
 you need here is not even think about the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:28.240
 is a 32 inch led tvs is and yes me 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.880
 I'll build it once 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.509
 So I'm just doing the tripod 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.949
 screw it on and it's that way first 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.449
 did not fit the whole i have 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.130
 asked me what was going on 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.110
 then I realized that the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.639
 screw we have to go wrong 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.009
 be screwed in because the whole thing there 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.479
 So it's a bit wrong in there 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.610
 is somehow somehow okay 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.490
 The TV now looks like this 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:54.789
 I think it looks really cool here 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:58.840
 on the side we have again the 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:07:02.550
 individual options must be set 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.550
 please focus 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:15.819
 everything just does not focus the same way 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:20.229
 apologizes to camera and here in front 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:22.330
 is the beautiful still pointless 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:23.999
 so I hope you had a lot of fun with 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.029
 the video 

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.029
 pure skin
