00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
but again it's used our GPS let's find

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.700 
but again it's used our GPS let's find
out<00:01:44.400> found<00:01:44.700> our<00:01:44.850> location<00:01:45.300> or<00:01:45.990> nearby<00:01:46.230> impact

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
out found our location or nearby impact

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.880 
out found our location or nearby impact
and<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.460> given<00:01:47.700> us<00:01:47.790> visual<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.890> temperature

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and it's given us visual and temperature

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.920 
and it's given us visual and temperature
and<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.610> forecast<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.120> tomorrow<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.750> that's

that it works in much the same way as

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.230 
that it works in much the same way as
Syria<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.470> 4s<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.460> do<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.910> sort<00:03:06.150> of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
Syria on the 4s you can do this sort of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.500 
Syria on the 4s you can do this sort of
thing<00:03:06.890> saying<00:03:07.890> alarms<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:09.180> come<00:03:09.390> in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
thing saying alarms that come in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.240 
thing saying alarms that come in
multiple<00:03:09.660> processes<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.530> can<00:03:10.740> do<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.070> one

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
multiple processes you can do it in one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.350 
multiple processes you can do it in one
go<00:03:11.280> but<00:03:12.120> we<00:03:12.300> found<00:03:12.600> for<00:03:13.140> ease<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.320> use<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.360> so

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
go but we found for ease of use and so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.970

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
together I think it's a misinterpreted

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.429 
together I think it's a misinterpreted
some<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.599> things<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.870> were<00:04:05.170> saying<00:04:05.439> that

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
some of the things that were saying that

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.979 
some of the things that were saying that
but<00:04:08.439> if<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:09.430> had<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:09.909> said<00:04:10.120> send<00:04:10.420> when<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:10.900> were

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
but if I had just said send when we were

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.089 
but if I had just said send when we were
back<00:04:11.170> here<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.650> would<00:04:11.709> have<00:04:11.920> gone<00:04:11.950> through

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
back here it would have gone through

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.619 
back here it would have gone through
unfortunately<00:04:12.939> it<00:04:13.000> was<00:04:13.090> listening<00:04:13.480> when<00:04:13.510> I

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
unfortunately it was listening when I

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.449 
unfortunately it was listening when I
was<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> explain<00:04:14.739> what<00:04:14.890> was<00:04:14.950> going<00:04:15.010> on<00:04:15.250> there

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
was a explain what was going on there

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.610 
was a explain what was going on there
but<00:04:15.670> that's<00:04:16.060> sending<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.510> text<00:04:16.750> message<00:04:16.780> it's

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
but that's sending a text message it's

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.949 
but that's sending a text message it's
very<00:04:17.889> straightforward<00:04:18.130> with<00:04:18.579> s<00:04:18.729> voice<00:04:18.959> and

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
very straightforward with s voice and

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.390 
very straightforward with s voice and
providing<00:04:20.380> it's<00:04:20.500> not<00:04:20.560> too<00:04:20.859> noisy<00:04:21.220> in<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
providing it's not too noisy in the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.670 
providing it's not too noisy in the
background<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:22.780> should<00:04:23.020> pick<00:04:23.350> up<00:04:23.470> what<00:04:23.620> you're

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
background it should pick up what you're

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.900 
background it should pick up what you're
saying<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.370> should<00:04:24.520> work<00:04:24.550> absolutely

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
saying and it should work absolutely

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.680
