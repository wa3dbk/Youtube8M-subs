00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:08.524
 Hello, in today's classes we will try to show two elements that can occur on 

00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:13.840
 state exam, it is detention in the indicated place and emergency stop. 

00:00:14.403 --> 00:00:22.125
 Stopping in the indicated place consists in a smooth stopping of the motorcycle in a place that we will define earlier. 

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:30.563
 In contrast, emergency stop is associated with an emergency situation on the road that we are not able to predict 

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.402
 and we have to stop the motorcycle at any given time. 

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:45.800
 This is important enough for emergency braking, so that the driving path is correct and do not lose control over the motorcycle. 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.840
 If it is possible we will stop at the right leg, there is no obligation to stabilize the left one 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.519
 and the lane of the motorcycle was always preserved. 

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:04.280
 And once again, I must emphasize the full control of the motorcycle during emergency braking. 

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:13.798
 You set yourself a post, you get up slowly and by this post ... it is so you know, for accuracy, for details. 

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:21.999
 A place where we want to stop, that is, we choose a bollard and the motorcycle is to stay at the height of this bollard 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.481
 arrested. 

00:01:25.883 --> 00:01:30.210
 We give the one and remember to make sure before driving well? 

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.601
 Oh, and stop at the bollard. 

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:37.600
 Still, just so that it would be a leg at the height of an obstacle. 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.120
 Still, you are riding in the middle of a motorcycle, or when you mark a point, then the left leg should be 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.880
 at the height of this obstacle. 

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:52.400
 Still, more or less. 

00:01:52.764 --> 00:01:58.680
 You do not need to be close to this obstacle, it's important to let me keep her equal. 

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:04.990
 And we stop nicely. 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.160
 Oh, that's it. 

00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:29.560
 The ride is smooth, calmly clutching beforehand, braking too early. 

00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:36.320
 So that you can calculate such a speed to stop as an obstacle. 

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:45.050
 Stop at the indicated position at the height of the pole, o. 

00:02:46.313 --> 00:02:48.390
 Almost right, that's exactly what this is about. 

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:52.120
 Stopping at the indicated place, Darek will be fine as it is. 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.990
 - I still have to do it a bit ... 

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.640
 -Oh, very good. 

00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:03.850
 That's it. 

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.390
 That's what it's all about. 

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:20.320
 -He has brakes you know. 

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:25.910
 - Yes, 80% of braking is a hand brake, that is, brake yourself here gently with your foot. 

00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:28.520
 Use your leg more than with your hand. 

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:34.180
 80%, because if you press your hand harder, it will keep you leaning forward.
