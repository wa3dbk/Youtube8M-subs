00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey everyone I just bought the new me 25

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey everyone I just bought the new me 25
millimeter<00:00:02.909> magic<00:00:03.780> wand<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.350> replace<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.920> have

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
millimeter magic wand to replace I have

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.340 
millimeter magic wand to replace I have
one<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.700> their<00:00:05.850> old<00:00:06.120> wands<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> 19

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
one of their old wands is a 19

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.370 
one of their old wands is a 19
millimeter<00:00:07.880> I<00:00:08.880> think<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.960> much<00:00:10.170> older

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
millimeter I think it's a much older

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.290 
millimeter I think it's a much older
style<00:00:10.740> because<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.070> has<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.400> end<00:00:11.550> cap<00:00:11.820> still

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
style because it has the end cap still

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.810 
style because it has the end cap still
and<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:13.200> was<00:00:13.290> just<00:00:13.469> time<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.889> replace<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.549> one

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
and it was just time to replace this one

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.029 
and it was just time to replace this one
the<00:00:15.030> end<00:00:15.179> cap<00:00:15.480> falls<00:00:15.809> off<00:00:16.080> all<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> time<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the end cap falls off all the time and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.240 
the end cap falls off all the time and
the<00:00:18.000> black<00:00:18.300> coating<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.410> wand<00:00:19.619> has<00:00:20.039> been

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the black coating on the wand has been

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.450 
the black coating on the wand has been
chipping<00:00:20.520> off<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.439> yeah<00:00:22.439> I've<00:00:22.619> had<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.100> at

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
chipping off so yeah I've had it for at

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.790 
chipping off so yeah I've had it for at
least<00:00:23.490> three<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.240> four<00:00:24.269> years<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.470> an

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
least three or four years now so an

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.700 
least three or four years now so an
upgrade<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.519> order<00:00:26.699> plus<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.510> wanted<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
upgrade was in order plus I wanted a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980 
upgrade was in order plus I wanted a
larger<00:00:29.400> barrel<00:00:29.609> size<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.599> hair<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
larger barrel size now that my hair is a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
larger barrel size now that my hair is a
bit<00:00:31.260> longer<00:00:31.759> 25<00:00:32.759> millimeter<00:00:33.180> sounds<00:00:33.540> good

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
bit longer 25 millimeter sounds good

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.299 
bit longer 25 millimeter sounds good
there's<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.170> more<00:00:34.350> size<00:00:34.559> above<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.100> one

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
there's one more size above this one

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
there's one more size above this one
though<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> titanium<00:00:37.020> curling

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
though so this is a titanium curling

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.760 
though so this is a titanium curling
line<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.579> temperature<00:00:39.329> control<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.379> old

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
line with a temperature control this old

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
line with a temperature control this old
one<00:00:41.040> did<00:00:41.280> not<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.700> temperature<00:00:42.180> control<00:00:42.570> so

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
one did not have temperature control so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.880 
one did not have temperature control so
I'm<00:00:43.050> glad<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I'm glad for that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.240 
I'm glad for that
it<00:00:44.670> goes<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.200> 450<00:00:46.200> degrees<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:46.890> low<00:00:47.100> as

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it goes up to 450 degrees or as low as

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.810 
it goes up to 450 degrees or as low as
140<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:49.110> comes<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> heat<00:00:50.219> resistant

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
140 and it comes with a heat resistant

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.260 
140 and it comes with a heat resistant
glove<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:52.199> probably<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.980> use<00:00:53.399> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
glove that I will probably not use so

all right so let's get her plugged in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.390 
all right so let's get her plugged in
now<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.390> she's<00:01:21.720> hooked<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.740> screen<00:01:23.280> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

flashing blue and it says off so you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.140 
flashing blue and it says off so you
still<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> turn<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.630> guess<00:01:29.000> yeah<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
still have to turn it on I guess yeah so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.399 
still have to turn it on I guess yeah so
you<00:01:30.210> hold<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> hold<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> power

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you hold you have to hold down the power

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
you hold you have to hold down the power
button<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:33.060> oh<00:01:34.759> that's<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.119> cool

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
button and then oh that's really cool

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
button and then oh that's really cool
the<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.229> monitor<00:01:37.790> shows<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the the monitor shows you the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
the the monitor shows you the
temperature<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.799> heating<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.579> it's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
temperature as it's heating up so it's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.340 
temperature as it's heating up so it's
like<00:01:42.590> dialing<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.799> 100<00:01:44.310> 115<00:01:45.030> 120<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.200> it's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
like dialing up like 100 115 120 so it's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.690 
like dialing up like 100 115 120 so it's
heating<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.710> pretty<00:01:46.979> fast

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
heating up pretty fast

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.859 
heating up pretty fast
the<00:01:48.409> wahoo<00:01:49.409> seems<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> bit<00:01:50.130> short<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the wahoo seems a bit short but it is

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.770 
the wahoo seems a bit short but it is
longer<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.070> old<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.509> metal

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
longer than the old one just the metal

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
longer than the old one just the metal
part<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> barrel<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> longer<00:01:56.549> so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
part of the barrel so it is longer so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.200 
part of the barrel so it is longer so
that's<00:01:57.390> nice<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.670> nice<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that's nice and it's nice that it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
that's nice and it's nice that it
doesn't<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.630> end<00:02:00.899> cap<00:02:01.170> either<00:02:01.500> because

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
doesn't have the end cap either because

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639 
doesn't have the end cap either because
that<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.790> always<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.240> obnoxious<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.380> I'm

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that was always really obnoxious so I'm

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.219 
that was always really obnoxious so I'm
gonna<00:02:04.860> try<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.280> temp<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:06.469> 400<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:08.580> start<00:02:09.229> or

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
gonna try the temp at 400 to start or

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.730 
gonna try the temp at 400 to start or
410<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.430> won't<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.760> 400<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.480> goes<00:02:12.599> from<00:02:12.870> 392

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
410 it won't go to 400 it goes from 392

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860 
410 it won't go to 400 it goes from 392
or<00:02:13.830> ten<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:14.430> strange<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.270> took<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.570> 30

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
or ten that's strange that took like 30

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.260 
or ten that's strange that took like 30
seconds<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.650> wasn't<00:02:17.010> prepared<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.760> let<00:02:18.180> me

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
seconds I wasn't prepared so let me

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.200 
seconds I wasn't prepared so let me
start<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.780> section<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:20.060> see<00:02:21.060> how

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
start with this section here see how

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
doing this so that's kind of obnoxious I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.690

air control I'm noticing the same thing
that<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.010> noticed<00:03:37.520> with<00:03:37.640> my<00:03:37.820> old<00:03:38.090> one<00:03:38.300> is<00:03:38.600> that

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
that I noticed with my old one is that

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.650 
that I noticed with my old one is that
it's<00:03:39.500> making<00:03:39.950> my<00:03:40.100> hair<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.700> curls<00:03:40.940> just<00:03:41.390> look

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
it's making my hair the curls just look

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.240 
it's making my hair the curls just look
so<00:03:41.960> smooth<00:03:42.320> it's<00:03:42.560> making<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:42.890> hair<00:03:43.010> looks

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
so smooth it's making the hair looks

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.699 
so smooth it's making the hair looks
smoother<00:03:43.790> even<00:03:44.510> though<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.990> is<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.350> heat

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
smoother even though it is a heat

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.460 
smoother even though it is a heat
product<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.490> like<00:03:46.820> that<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.660> gives<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:48.110> such

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
product so I like that it gives it such

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.720 
product so I like that it gives it such
a<00:03:48.500> smooth<00:03:48.950> appearance

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
a smooth appearance

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.449 
a smooth appearance
I'd<00:03:50.240> say<00:03:50.420> weight<00:03:50.720> wise<00:03:50.930> they're<00:03:51.709> very<00:03:52.040> similar

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
I'd say weight wise they're very similar

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.930 
I'd say weight wise they're very similar
in<00:03:52.670> weight<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:54.500> wand<00:03:55.010> at<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.430> end<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:55.820> it

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
in weight but this wand at the end of it

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.630 
in weight but this wand at the end of it
the<00:03:56.209> cord<00:03:56.510> comes<00:03:56.840> out<00:03:56.989> as<00:03:57.200> an<00:03:57.380> L<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.130> when<00:03:58.610> I

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
the cord comes out as an L and so when I

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.070 
the cord comes out as an L and so when I
set<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.060> down<00:03:59.090> on<00:04:00.010> my<00:04:01.150> desk

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
set it down on my desk

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.650 
set it down on my desk
it<00:04:03.320> always<00:04:03.739> has<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.100> tendency<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.880> fall<00:04:05.209> off<00:04:05.480> the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
it always has a tendency to fall off the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.800 
it always has a tendency to fall off the
desk<00:04:06.100> but<00:04:07.100> with<00:04:07.459> this<00:04:07.610> one<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.330> comes<00:04:08.570> out<00:04:08.780> a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
desk but with this one it comes out a
