00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.230
 in this nice meeting we are 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.410
 making memory notes we are going to 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.650
 ask eduardo dibós in 1994 was 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.570
 participating in the usa in the 94 brands of 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.510
 their story because they said who that is 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.380
 luxury you can walk without the water 94 you 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.760
 you have been wrong 24 but there was a good 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.570
 eduardo dibós that I ran back then 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.660
 about 194 it was already the third year that I started 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.550
 is that I was running in the USA 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.500
 so that memories of that car of that 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.179
 mazda who made history was a time 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.010
 because we saw just that he was 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.679
 a lot of people talking about how their 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 wankel engine of that era what came out 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.929
 On the 12th and 13th tell us something about that 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.140
 I will not grab more with 13 looks 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:55.429
 that the peripheral motor is a motor of 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.780
 this nominal had 1900 circuits 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.719
 cubic centimeters that with the factor 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.679
 what's in will bring about 3,400 as I 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.679
 ran in the category gt 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 in 3 liters 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.580
 The tubular cart with box box box already 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 I remember and I started with more than mx 6 and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 then the rx 7 built it apron for 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.830
 me and I inaugurate it in broken plant in 94 the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.260
 mustang I bought it to tong lloyd with blog 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.480
 and was a preparer of the ss is it 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.010
 because basically they had another 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.380
 feedback that fans but career 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.690
 very similar I bought it from rebel more 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.720
 weak and mandeville is left to the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.630
 fan tools 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.090
 but boss is basically the mass and says 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.500
 more than other people have 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.380
 shared 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.900
 lr always ran with my cousin raul and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.930
 with juan 24 hours and at 12 o'clock 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.320
 of sebring 24 hours at 24 detonate 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.140
 toning equipment and then the others 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.869
 races that were championship races 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.350
 said run only that year you came out as 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.869
 pilot highlighted in the competition and 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.190
 she remembered him a lot 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.020
 eduardo dibós said he could change 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.740
 in the water so strong a person who does not 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.310
 is also used in 94 if I left 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.600
 choose the best pilot eastern aínsa 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.090
 series of people because they always ran 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.760
 two cds people work from sport cup that 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.190
 they join championship also back and it 's 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.830
 who later became my brother-in-law 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.880
 curiously and if there is a debt is in 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.080
 new orleans 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.460
 in memories the race began the three 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.130
 first laps the fourth was sewn 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:43.410
 spin had grabbed on the side 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.790
 opposite the circuit of the rain in three 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.430
 It took me a long time to go with tires 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.140
 normal until the pits and others the pits 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.520
 change tires and I go out and when 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.690
 begins to leave begins to walk with 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.240
 the prey start to move to the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.830
 heteros i by inge tv the objective is 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.860
 download the big ones I put through the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.510
 nissan that ran 6,000 and ran no 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.250
 they will lose cars that is normally a 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.560
 simple also and two the tables then eight 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.150
 seconds per lap and I was behind 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.160
 them and since I pulled the car and the 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.250
 you pass and already what is happening here I 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.990
 from nothing to the middle wta and I 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.550
 I fixed a lot if you want to sign Madrid 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.520
 it's water like that because these can not be 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.370
 later and I started and in the end I and everything and 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.810
 on the radio it motivated me if I thought that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.410
 the race is winning 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.690
 finished face and give me as a winner what 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.550
 that in the end with the count that happens 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.250
 how well I delayed that first 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.710
 part to enter the pits there in that I lost 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.640
 as well 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:44.060
 the race was not close but in 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.580
 I race all the big cars and I 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.960
 I imagine that I related to the 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.000
 area that is in Peru and I was 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.990
 reality of driving a bit on land 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.090
 tea is to that end in that control and in 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.740
 us, because the gringos did not run several 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.810
 if they ran dry 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.740
 normally they hardly ran in 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.860
 rain 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.170
 that marked parts now because you too 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.760
 you left is the rookie in the category is 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.880
 a software opportunity in 93 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.160
 193 east 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.950
 if I'm not wrong I can tilton the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.650
 company that sponsored the one that leaves tve and 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.290
 what you consider your TV3 has been your 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.790
 best year when he participated in the usa 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.080
 all have been different because all 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.690
 have been at different levels 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.370
 first years with a pretty car 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.440
 limited but I also limited in 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.690
 As for the management, so I had a 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.720
 limitation I little by little was 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.270
 learning I was gaining experience I went 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.640
 taking management courses and at the beginning 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.470
 so go through the roof trying to get me 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.100
 I will blame the car but not in 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.080
 the race I 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.880
 to many pilots that we have run that 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.890
 we run we think we 're big 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.660
 pilots but you get to employ of with 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.810
 real professions that are all the 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.090
 day on a car and is on another level 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.430
 to reach that level a motorcycle on 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.160
 everything as I say I'm going to run and 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.410
 come back but work that takes time 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.410
 more in flight hours you also have 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.970
 know the circuits then not 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.310
 I knew the circuit after I changed 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.600
 because it was going up from mx srx 7 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.480
 from magazine the world we have so to the 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.430
 fashion this raid is every year has been 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.320
 had his stage and each car for me 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.700
 really so spectacular and I think that 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.880
 in all the years it 's a good 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.280
 a good work eduardo for me has been 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.210
 a satisfaction art could buy 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.800
 so many years in those times let's say and 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.870
 so many laps that we have given so many 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.190
 ideas and coming always with colors 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.510
 of Peru always with the colors of 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.790
 foces of that then that was all 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.070
 main officer carrying everything besides 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.960
 another very important thing all the 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.200
 mechanics were Peruvian or nobody 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.600
 I understood that 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.450
 in the immense they thought that he was 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.940
 operando has caught me because everything was 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.280
 bikes peru the uniforms of the 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.490
 pediatricians on the bike remember 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.000
 the peru bike cart of this peru 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.840
 your best option 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.230
 a lot of profane and thought that I 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.660
 run is the trial was operating 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.569
 that was part of the history of eduardo 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:24.210
 of the few years in motor racing 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:26.789
 already on 30 31 31 of shorts if there 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.650
 a lot of time but there he tells me that if 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.860
 no mischief, I'm fine 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.830
 well I'm going to endorse another week and there 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.280
 let's go so what do I like and the 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.840
 another day try to handle they can swallow 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.340
 can accelerate a bit but then I 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.590
 I scared because I do not have very well with the 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.360
 control of the stones still so 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.320
 I'm not going to encourage you to drive yet 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.509
 I believe that in 16 23 months we are another 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.370
 time out there I like to have 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:55.400
 problem again thanks greetings to 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.400
