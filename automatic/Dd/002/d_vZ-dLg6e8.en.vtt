00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
Prior that was a bit of a Eureka moment

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900 
Prior that was a bit of a Eureka moment

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
went from there but but you always

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.780 
went from there but but you always
tampering<00:02:49.890> with<00:02:49.920> things<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.310> always<00:02:50.459> trying

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
tampering with things and always trying

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.090 
tampering with things and always trying
to<00:02:50.850> improve<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.750> think<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.380> i<00:02:52.410> had<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.890> played

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
to improve I I think so i had to played

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.380 
to improve I I think so i had to played
a<00:02:53.130> little<00:02:53.489> bit<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.819> school<00:02:54.000> when<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.239> was<00:02:54.269> quite

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
a little bit of school when I was quite

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.600 
a little bit of school when I was quite
young<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.470> was<00:02:55.590> useless<00:02:55.980> at<00:02:56.220> batting<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
young and I was useless at batting and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.009 
young and I was useless at batting and
bowling<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.030> think<00:02:57.090> wicketkeeping<00:02:57.840> would

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
bowling so I think wicketkeeping would

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.960 
bowling so I think wicketkeeping would
be<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> area<00:02:58.470> for<00:02:58.650> me<00:02:58.830> but<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.670> would

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
be the area for me but I would

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
be the area for me but I would
definitely<00:03:00.120> start<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.140> stop<00:03:01.319> using<00:03:01.500> my

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
definitely start have to stop using my

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.559 
definitely start have to stop using my
legs<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.069> did<00:03:02.310> earlier<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.090> got<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> few

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
legs like I did earlier on I got a few
