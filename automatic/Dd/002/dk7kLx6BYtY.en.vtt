00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.290
 let's make the heads of the dummies 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:13.730
 with a round and thick balloon we are going to 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.350
 and with this white thread is a white thread 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.940
 to embroider 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.940
 we help the top 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.230
 and we have not hooked it is 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.130
 hooked 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.960
 2 knots we have to do everything 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.190
 turn around the globe to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.190
 make a structure 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 that we are going to harden but we are going to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 pass it a turn that then goes to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.810
 toughen 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.360
 with a glue we will apply 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.360
 to make the heads of the mannequins 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 let's hope the balloon explodes 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.670
 we started spinning 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.940
 how are we going to apply a glue 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.320
 to this thread 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 and then it will harden when it will be 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.710
 very much then we can exploit the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.780
 balloon to the days when it has dried and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.490
 it's not going to fit , it's going to be like 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.850
 outside a skeleton of thread 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.659
 with round shape this is also used 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:49.450
 to make decorations to hang 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.570
 in this case I'm going to use it to 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.440
 to make the heads of the mannequins 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.020
 to put to put the crowns 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.910
 and you will see that many of the photos where 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.680
 I have the causes of those of the chronicles 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.000
 because there is like a white writing of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.000
 official threads 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.890
 you have to have a lot of patience here 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.079
 because you have to go around a lot and 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:22.099
 that is totally covered if 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.099
 out of a ball of wool 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.599
 I have the thread here 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.549
 you will not have to stand up to the brother 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.549
 the easiest way to work 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.930
 you have to buy balloons of good quality 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 that exploit us is worth it because lately 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.080
 if you buy balloons in the store of the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.480
 chinese 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.450
 They are usually so fine that nothing 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.540
 you apply a little pressure on the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.920
 balloon explode 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.920
 well here I am 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.620
 and keep spinning around like it was 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.150
 a ball of wool 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.020
 so you have to do it with a lot 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.960
 patience 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.290
 and trying we can not escape the 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.290
 inah 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.580
 let's continue you have to fill it between 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.800
 rob him almost not be in spaces 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:32.140
 without filling then you have to rotate what 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.140
 so that it is even everywhere 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.700
 Be patient 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.700
 so let's go 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.209
 let's leave recording to heaven you see me 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.209
 the process 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.850
 you see up here that there are spaces 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.489
 open 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.270
 let 's turn to putting Irlo 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.270
 totally 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.409
 let's hope you do not notice the balloon 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.610
 get these black balloons that looks 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:36.439
 who have more 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.439
 more are thicker 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:43.139
 and they exploit us in the shack will be bought 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.589
 different types of balloons to see with 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.589
 this 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.660
 well there's a lot of free space so 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.660
 let's work so that by giving you more 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.660
 hitch 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:27.780
 is turning and completing on this side 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.000
 It has to be all covered because 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.880
 then the balloon will not be that you have to 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.280
 force the thread to maintain that 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.280
 you have everything is getting 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.430
 we're almost not going to have to see the black 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.430
 of the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.660
 of the globe 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.080
 we are not spinning 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.389
 to spin it in every way 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.550
 up here you see that there is a lot of space 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.550
 that gap does not have to be 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.689
 this is another decoration that can be 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:28.629
 make to decorate the candy table 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:31.229
 and those in many of these thread balloons 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.229
 Y 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.930
 You will see that it looks beautiful 2 I put 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.910
 photos of how they are 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.590
 it's a very nice effect if we're 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.590
 making a wedding 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.510
 limit 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:52.640
 kinda knows txiki and those things this 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.640
 type of decorations are very nice 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.820
 we make them, you can do it yourself 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:01.409
 that are unique things that all these 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:06.090
 decorations you have to make them continuous 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:08.400
 You have one year for the event 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.320
 little by little you can do everything 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.320
 with knowing everything you like 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.590
 it's here there are still black holes that 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.590
 we are going to cover 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.190
 I have a knot 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.190
 and then we take it off 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:40.620
 today we have here 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:52.140
 well let's shorten this video to 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.620
 continue not to have you there for much 

00:07:52.140 --> 00:08:00.050
 I'm going to continue twisting and then 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.050
 shows it to you in the end let's come then
