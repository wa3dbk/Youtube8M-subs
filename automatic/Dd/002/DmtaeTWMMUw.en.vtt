00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.089
 it is not known to the general public but 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.250
 Italy has a really important role 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.710
 within the great world of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.360
 general motors are born in Turin 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 all diesel engines and related 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500
 one type of switchboards that come 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.690
 used by the various brands of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.529
 galaxy opel chevrolet cadillac e 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 workshop 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.150
 the credit goes to the GM powertrain he has 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.279
 well done the task entrusted 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.990
 that of creating a more propeller 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 small more powerful more sober in the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.420
 consume the center of turin to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 global responsibility for development 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.899
 of diesel engines and systems 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.170
 full engine control 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.690
 corporation is one of the reasons why the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.670
 motorcycle day already decided to settle in 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 torino essentially linked 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.500
 to the existence of skills also 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.700
 to the insistence of an infrastructure 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.250
 industrial that certainly has 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.350
 allowed a very fast development of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.710
 of the same center as the global center 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.370
 means to be very flexible for 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.070
 to adapt to very different cultures 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 have the ability to be able to work 24 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.280
 hours a day 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.790
 because we exploit the official of the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.420
 nations in which 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.850
 we want and then had a say 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.740
 big mental fracture to be able to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.290
 being able to understand what comes to us 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.300
 requested by our customers 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.550
 in fact debuts on the opel zafira tourer 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.180
 but then it will also be mounted on others 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.430
 model the new 136 from 136 horses with 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.620
 320 newton meters of torque at 2,000 rpm 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.590
 very accurate in dispensing fluidity 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.210
 particularly quietly 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.470
 light and made entirely in 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.860
 aluminum and promises consumption 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.250
 combined content in 4.1 liters per 100 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.770
 km or 24.3 km liter that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.009
 correspond to emissions of 109 grams 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.900
 di co2 replaces the historic 1700 that 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.400
 after so many years it goes on to a well-deserved one 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.119
 board 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.280
 carries the abbreviation 1.6 cdti and presents between 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.650
 the technological innovations the system 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.240
 of blue catalytic reduction 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.709
 injection that uses a special one 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.090
 liquid to blue based on water and urea 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.850
 thanks injections calibrate this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.080
 liquid reduces nitrogen oxides 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.880
 eliminating at the base the hitches that 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.980
 they recently moved away from the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.060
 diesel users who used it 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.500
 especially on short city routes 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.600
 it was easily bile in DIY 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.630
 or during scheduled maintenance a 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.760
 an affordable cost around 10 European 5 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.750
 liters and 8 liters are consumed every 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.000
 15,000 km the opel zafira tourer returns 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.769
 thus in the euro 6 regulation 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.360
 but above all it is noteworthy 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.040
 smooth running that makes 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.670
 forget about being in a car 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.739
 diesel 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.600
 just one note to note the lack 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.519
 for now an automatic change that 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.980
 it would be perfect for a type of car 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.680
 like this the key launch price 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 in hand it starts from 28 thousand 990 euros
