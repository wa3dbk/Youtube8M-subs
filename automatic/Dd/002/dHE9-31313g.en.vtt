00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
the way I kind of figure things out a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.080 
the way I kind of figure things out a
lot<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.830> might<00:05:09.950> sound<00:05:10.160> kind<00:05:10.400> of<00:05:10.460> stupid

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
lot is and it might sound kind of stupid

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.300 
lot is and it might sound kind of stupid
as<00:05:11.210> far<00:05:11.570> as<00:05:11.600> but<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:11.960> just<00:05:12.230> kind<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.560> put<00:05:13.040> in<00:05:13.160> like

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
as far as but I just kind of put in like
