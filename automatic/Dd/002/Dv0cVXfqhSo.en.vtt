alright<00:00:00.359> here's<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.780> little<00:00:01.020> demo<00:00:01.310> what

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
alright here's a little demo what

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.970 
alright here's a little demo what
happens<00:00:02.730> when<00:00:02.970> yesyes<00:00:03.870> don't<00:00:04.200> cooperate<00:00:04.440> with

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
happens when yesyes don't cooperate with

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.540 
happens when yesyes don't cooperate with
these<00:00:05.130> many<00:00:05.400> motors<00:00:06.770> it's<00:00:07.770> always<00:00:08.130> when

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
these many motors it's always when

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.180 
these many motors it's always when
you're<00:00:08.670> picking<00:00:08.849> up<00:00:09.090> speed<00:00:09.300> from<00:00:09.840> low<00:00:10.440> rpm<00:00:10.980> if

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
you're picking up speed from low rpm if

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.360 
you're picking up speed from low rpm if
you<00:00:11.340> really<00:00:11.730> give<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.690> an<00:00:13.530> abrupt<00:00:14.009> full

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
you really give it a an abrupt full

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.460 
you really give it a an abrupt full
throttle<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:15.179> get<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:15.990> strange

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
throttle you can get it to do strange

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:28.600 
throttle you can get it to do strange
things<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:19.170> full<00:00:19.439> throttle

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:01:06.700 

I<00:00:28.700> knew<00:00:29.180> but<00:00:29.330> from<00:00:29.570> here<00:00:29.780> I'll<00:00:29.960> be<00:00:30.140> okay

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.900 

so<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.770> happens<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.399> down<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> little

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
so it happens when it's down a little

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.180 
so it happens when it's down a little
throttle<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.509> we're<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.800> an<00:01:10.920> ESC

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
throttle now we're going to do an ESC

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.420 
throttle now we're going to do an ESC
change<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.690> what<00:01:12.840> happens

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.640 

all<00:01:19.430> right<00:01:19.990> yeah<00:01:20.990> we're<00:01:21.230> going<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.380> change

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
all right yeah we're going to change

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.900 
all right yeah we're going to change
that<00:01:21.890> ESC<00:01:24.070> old-school<00:01:25.330> stick<00:01:26.330> commands<00:01:27.910> so

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
that ESC old-school stick commands so

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:37.709 
that ESC old-school stick commands so
start<00:01:29.810> off<00:01:29.960> around<00:01:30.140> halfway

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:50.920 

full<00:01:38.289> throttle

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.060 

zero<00:01:53.050> full<00:01:54.050> throttle<00:01:56.140> okay<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.350> last<00:01:57.560> triple

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
zero full throttle okay that last triple

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.800 
zero full throttle okay that last triple
sequence<00:01:58.280> tells<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:58.910> in<00:01:59.150> programming<00:01:59.780> mode

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
sequence tells you in programming mode

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.640 
sequence tells you in programming mode
do<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.770> do<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.950> do<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.880> do<00:02:02.350> now<00:02:03.350> I'm<00:02:03.500> in

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
do to do to do to do to do now I'm in

do to do to do to do to do now I'm in
1:1<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.810> want<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.900> advance<00:02:06.140> quickly<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.430> drop

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
1:1 I want to advance quickly so I drop

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.140 
1:1 I want to advance quickly so I drop
it<00:02:08.030> down<00:02:08.740> I'll<00:02:09.740> go<00:02:10.040> into<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.340> second

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:53.550 

third

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.809 

turn<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:54.950> fall

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:11.170 

should<00:02:59.510> be<00:02:59.659> in<00:02:59.750> 10:1

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.860 

that's<00:03:12.180> ten<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.740 

two<00:03:18.870> three<00:03:19.410> four<00:03:19.620> five<00:03:20.040> six<00:03:20.580> seven<00:03:20.970> eight<00:03:21.150> nine

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
two three four five six seven eight nine

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:35.900 
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten<00:03:24.650> now<00:03:25.650> we're<00:03:25.800> coming<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.100> ten<00:03:26.400> three

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.420 

and<00:03:36.910> ten-four<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.690> what<00:03:37.870> I'm<00:03:37.990> after

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.059 

next<00:03:42.430> one

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:58.610 

then<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.190> drop<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.730> zero

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.880 

it<00:03:59.620> resets<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:02.110> now<00:04:02.319> you'll<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.560> be<00:04:02.860> in

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
it resets and now you'll just be in

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.650 
it resets and now you'll just be in
regular<00:04:03.130> motormouth<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.000> we<00:04:04.090> can<00:04:04.239> put<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> prop

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
regular motormouth so we can put a prop

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:31.420 
regular motormouth so we can put a prop
on<00:04:04.840> test<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:17.019> stabilizing<00:04:17.680> foot

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.010 

I<00:04:34.510> didn't<00:04:35.510> check<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.900> maximum<00:04:37.690> amperage<00:04:38.690> on

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
I didn't check the maximum amperage on

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.510 
I didn't check the maximum amperage on
the<00:04:39.140> other<00:04:39.260> setting<00:04:39.710> but<00:04:39.890> I<00:04:39.920> guess<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.280> have<00:04:40.430> it

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
the other setting but I guess I have it

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.920 
the other setting but I guess I have it
on<00:04:40.610> video<00:04:40.910> now<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:41.180> we'll<00:04:41.480> know<00:04:41.600> whether<00:04:41.810> or

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
on video now so we'll know whether or

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.780 
on video now so we'll know whether or
not<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.170> time<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.590> changes<00:04:43.010> cost<00:04:43.310> us<00:04:43.520> any

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
not this time in changes cost us any

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.580 
not this time in changes cost us any
current<00:04:44.120> or<00:04:44.240> given<00:04:44.540> us<00:04:44.660> anything<00:04:44.960> same

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
current or given us anything same

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:58.540 
current or given us anything same
battery<00:04:46.480> no<00:04:47.480> use<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:47.990> between<00:04:57.250> giving<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.460> the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
battery no use in between giving it the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.980 
battery no use in between giving it the
same<00:04:58.760> kind<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.030> flicks<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.510> I<00:04:59.600> gave<00:04:59.810> it<00:04:59.960> the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
same kind of flicks that I gave it the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.370 
same kind of flicks that I gave it the
other<00:05:00.200> time<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.500> would<00:05:00.770> make<00:05:00.920> it<00:05:01.070> squeal

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
other time that would make it squeal

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:25.090 
other time that would make it squeal
it's<00:05:03.380> just<00:05:03.560> going<00:05:23.170> there's<00:05:24.170> no<00:05:24.230> hesitation<00:05:24.500> it

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
it's just going there's no hesitation it

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:38.800 
it's just going there's no hesitation it
never<00:05:25.310> locks<00:05:25.640> up<00:05:27.610> that's<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.820> one<00:05:29.000> oh<00:05:37.810> the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
never locks up that's the one oh the

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.330 
never locks up that's the one oh the
other<00:05:38.930> thing<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.320> guess<00:05:39.350> I<00:05:39.620> should<00:05:39.800> mention<00:05:40.010> is

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
other thing I guess I should mention is

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.250 
other thing I guess I should mention is
when<00:05:41.090> I've<00:05:41.240> been<00:05:41.390> playing<00:05:41.660> around<00:05:41.750> with<00:05:42.020> the

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
when I've been playing around with the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.040 
when I've been playing around with the
the<00:05:42.740> different<00:05:43.070> settings<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:43.610> timings<00:05:44.090> some

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
the different settings and timings some

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.200 
the different settings and timings some
of<00:05:45.170> them<00:05:45.290> actually<00:05:45.680> sound<00:05:46.160> really<00:05:46.550> bad<00:05:46.760> like<00:05:47.060> I

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
of them actually sound really bad like I

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.150 
of them actually sound really bad like I
thought<00:05:47.390> I'd<00:05:47.540> maybe<00:05:47.780> killed<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.590> bearings<00:05:48.980> on

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
thought I'd maybe killed the bearings on

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.800 
thought I'd maybe killed the bearings on
this<00:05:49.310> motor<00:05:49.550> from<00:05:49.790> all<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.090> testing<00:05:50.510> because

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
this motor from all the testing because

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.050 
this motor from all the testing because
it<00:05:50.930> was<00:05:51.050> making<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.530> kind<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.340> grinding<00:05:52.850> sound

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
it was making a kind of grinding sound

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.270 
it was making a kind of grinding sound
at<00:05:53.240> low<00:05:53.420> speed<00:05:53.810> when<00:05:54.050> it<00:05:54.170> was<00:05:54.320> set<00:05:54.530> to<00:05:54.560> I

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
at low speed when it was set to I

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.130 
at low speed when it was set to I
believe<00:05:56.150> high<00:05:56.420> timing<00:05:57.110> with<00:05:57.320> mag<00:05:57.740> on<00:05:58.300> but<00:05:59.300> the

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
believe high timing with mag on but the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.720 
believe high timing with mag on but the
other<00:06:00.170> nice<00:06:00.530> thing<00:06:00.560> about<00:06:00.830> finding<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.700> right

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
other nice thing about finding the right

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.060 
other nice thing about finding the right
setting<00:06:02.330> is<00:06:02.480> that<00:06:02.510> it<00:06:02.750> seems<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.170> run<00:06:03.500> smooth

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
setting is that it seems to run smooth

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.520 
setting is that it seems to run smooth
through<00:06:04.460> most<00:06:04.670> of<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:04.940> rpm<00:06:05.450> range<00:06:05.690> right<00:06:05.930> you

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
through most of the rpm range right you

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.990 
through most of the rpm range right you
probably<00:06:06.950> can't<00:06:07.220> hear<00:06:07.430> it<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.610> way<00:06:07.730> that<00:06:07.760> I

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
probably can't hear it the way that I

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.880 
probably can't hear it the way that I
can<00:06:08.240> right<00:06:08.510> now<00:06:08.690> but<00:06:09.620> that's<00:06:10.610> that's<00:06:11.090> the

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
can right now but that's that's the

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:28.469 
can right now but that's that's the
sound<00:06:12.890> that<00:06:13.190> this<00:06:13.340> motor

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.810 

sounds<00:06:29.479> good<00:06:29.629> to<00:06:29.689> me
