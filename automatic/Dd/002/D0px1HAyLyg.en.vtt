00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.200
 his bet with weapon team reserves in CFA 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.540
 to try to get away only suddenly 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 although reinstate hymn to the face and 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.110
 to extend his contract and move 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.519
 slide we are also learning started 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.650
 inside he had targeted two points 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.929
 possible fall to leave lyon 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.460
 marseille with which Lyon did not have 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 could agree to newcastle and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 gomis confessed to having refused his salary 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.179
 to sign in the magpies 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.910
 jean michel aulas good evening this 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:30.570
 interview you upset you very much go 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.840
 to be taken a little stone wenes who you 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.280
 have invited surprise and you had very 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 want to be given the floor tonight 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.810
 you have him you blame him what 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.850
 this interview jean michel aulas all 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.180
 first i would like to thank you hervé 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 thank cyril linette for allowing 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.500
 actually that I can evoke 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 this interview 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 so this interview actually poses two 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.590
 types of problems on the one hand a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.500
 form problem because it's a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.960
 surprise interview in which 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.620
 the usual did not have the opportunity to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.780
 reply 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.420
 and then secondly a problem more 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.430
 important again basically because I 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.310
 think that stone is not very well placed 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 to talk about the case of no 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.150
 objective way 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.670
 so that's why I preferred to come to 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.440
 in front of stone questions as he 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.810
 asked very professional questions 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.190
 and sometimes a little curious to a daf 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.729
 and I am at his disposal for them 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.170
 ask me the same questions 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.610
 timed 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.750
 out of curiosity the sequence of a fact 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.310
 committed during this attack where 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.080
 speak for 2 minutes 50 2 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.490
 stone 26 seconds with questions 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.680
 very simple I want that then 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.940
 not get your cup of tea but these 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.620
 questions that's a little bit the question 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.490
 that any journalist would have asked him 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:53.460
 so bankrupt and I do not think I 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.659
 think these questions on the one hand was 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.340
 had the merit of the franchise 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.340
 but it is the analysis of stone wenes that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.109
 she 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.689
 did not deserve the franchise since 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.630
 actually say at the end of this interview has 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.340
 not because it wants not greatly 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.830
 not the president version and I have 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 never heard not done say this thing 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.370
 this is the question we ask ourselves 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.510
 compared to the maps we have to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.220
 treat this is is that it is natural 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.049
 it is normal that international 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.660
 arrive at the end of the contract in 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.989
 Second big clubs do the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.250
 case management bafé gomis was wrong 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.440
 take good and in this case I come 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.849
 talk with stone he has a great 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.650
 responsibility of the people who was not 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.930
 very long it's true but when 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.910
 even a permanent contact with 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.579
 players agents and leaders 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.989
 so he has obligatorily all the 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.970
 elements that allow him to ask me 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.989
 the right questions and so so that's it 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.670
 so on these two points there I 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.769
 the impression that we can exchange 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.349
 completely normal and natural way 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.989
 well yes friend heat already thank you 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.060
 offer me an incredible scoop since 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.730
 this is the first time that we have criticized 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.019
 reporter to do an interview 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.480
 actually if he made me gomis took 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.970
 the tgv of lyon at seven o'clock in the morning 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.859
 to do an interview at 11 and the 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.590
 resume at 1 pm to be at 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.150
 Training at 16 Lyon to be able to 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.799
 play them the next day 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.450
 vesoul on synthetic is not 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:24.670
 necessarily between him and me there are 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.349
 trust reports now thank you 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.630
 also to have made me a man we are 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.609
 considers an actor in merano 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.090
 together yes but well excuse me 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.530
 to go I like and I do not know 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.970
 not by doing together we had each 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.310
 in Chad parked at him 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.470
 blame it's natural I do what 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.250
 I can to stay alive for 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.760
 to support all these attacks 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.180
 now yes and I say them I 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.310
 consider it was a badly managed I 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.450
 think no but this year I 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.889
 wanted to let talk is like the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.019
 politicians but it's paris I 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.450
 consider what was poorly managed 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.739
 especially strong human plane and that we can 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.079
 not ask a player to make a 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.599
 effort on his salary to leave then 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.600
 we sent him we humiliated him for a month 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.830
 in cfa and I note and 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.330
 it's never having to read that in my 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.250
 career that Bernard Lacombe does give 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:20.170
 nothing since I would have been very good on 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:22.870
 this stone folder on the subject what 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.200
 is contested and as of July 29 by a 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.910
 twitter you have been overturned by a 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.680
 charney who has the president secretary 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.270
 General of Newcastle 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.840
 there was no salary problem 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.190
 there was no problem of amount 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.640
 of transfer since the amount of 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.550
 transfer that you announce the 29 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.230
 July was confirmed there was and you 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.950
 know very well about other topics that 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.650
 did that tafer could not have failed 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.910
 to leave then society it is necessary not if one 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.310
 we know it is the Committee to 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.110
 their story when but what is it 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.930
 it's the bakery agents commission 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.490
 this is the 5% of the training of 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.920
 the ace saint-etienne is 400000 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.810
 euros on 108 million is the fact 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.030
 I had to make an effort 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.340
 the transaction make me I'm ready to 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.940
 speak early with your best putting me 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.940
 the numbers on the table 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.740
 yes all the all the elements you 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.610
 have just been finally indicate have been 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.070
 rules 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.380
 it was not settled the relationship with 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.970
 the agents and you know it very well 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.090
 so all the other problems 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.250
 commission on the five percent of 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.620
 solidarity wages and amount of 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.750
 transfer had been settled with licciardi 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.920
 you can call him he so you me 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.570
 so confirm that it's already a taste 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:44.050
 less than gossy you only have to 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:46.270
 to do because of doing before he did not 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.770
 been to newcastle because actually 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:54.930
 at one point there was a discussion 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.430
 final with agents and this 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.140
 situation did not allow to pass from 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.820
 leave now there have been several 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.980
 phases in this litigation 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.590
 there was one must understand and I 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.030
 think you the calves created from 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.700
 way quite born there was a 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.380
 pre-departure phase of lisandro is a 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.420
 phase after leaving lisandro 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.340
 initially the subject came 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.200
 of competition between not doing and 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.630
 lisandro which is evoked elsewhere in 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.630
 the interview and when lisandro decided 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.480
 to leave because obviously not done 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.640
 had not found a club and well the 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.200
 situation has completely changed us 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.500
 found in a management 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.630
 normal contract with a player 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.260
 international who wants to go after 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.490
 his contract 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.130
 so the question that must be asked 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:43.360
 now after seeing the management of the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.800
 case is whether he actually 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.260
 I had built since I have seen them 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.760
 that we had changed our mind of course 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.650
 that it had to be reinstated all 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.880
 club presidents and if you had it 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.590
 was in my place you would have done the 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.150
 same thing and you've seen besides 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.430
 that we facilitated their is allowed in 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.780
 severely recovery because we 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.490
 had I not put my center forward 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.650
 at 32 over the last two seasons 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.410
 championship in CFA I was doing an internship 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.210
 during and I would have tried as said 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.500
 of funes in the madness of grandeur 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.880
 I would have tried to polish my pieces 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.410
 to be able to separate myself from it 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.610
 to put in my mouth the master review 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.860
 River do on jeans background 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.230
 michel aulas you admit to yourself 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.880
 say you have you would have more 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.690
 better manage this place to tafer gomis or 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.980
 no or do you have no regrets 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.240
 no I do not think so I think that if he had 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.460
 not had the interference of a certain 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.230
 number of people in this folder who in 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.720
 done with a priori who have them 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.400
 always I see this folder would have been 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.590
 managed like the others I remember that 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.590
 we had a hit and so badly
