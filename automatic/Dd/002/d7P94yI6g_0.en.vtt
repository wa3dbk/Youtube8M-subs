00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:09.080
 cristian a difficult day for you difficult 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.080
 to bathe and sad 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.879
 for me it really was easier to vote 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.890
 now because Spain 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.510
 landover is forward 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.980
 sad because I 'm sure that already what 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.560
 it hurts the most is that the applicant is not 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.419
 Alejandra, what if I say that they are the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.369
 best friends who have very few 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.930
 friends of truth tell her I considered her 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.720
 one of them now how are you going to feel 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.360
 because you continue in combat you do not go 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.970
 the bathroom is going to be a bit difficult if 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.089
 they are with seeing each other again it was 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.150
 custom to see her here and laugh in the 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.460
 dressing room and parana laughing of all now 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.350
 his fights to not clear is how complicated 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.360
 It is also the complicated thing of working 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.520
 all the time with your partner is not 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.980
 complicated but it was all eh it feels 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.820
 better up with even discussions here 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.739
 because you're seeing it not then this 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.989
 is to get used to maybe I 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.869
 it causes sadness the first days and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.850
 later I will understand that that is part of 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.530
 how do I tell you maybe no one tomorrow warned 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.630

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.200

 the city 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.200

 christian dominguez 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.990
 of the red team I imagine 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.440
 let's remember 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.310
 something that wants a lot 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.310
 the great friends 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.980

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.640

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.430

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.229
 support 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.750
 beautiful moments that we spent here all 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.229
 together I felt a lot more pain 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.700
 stay with Alejandra but they are 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.380
 things that happen because I'm not going to be 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.209
 happy I write the tour that has also 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.459
 been the green team see this this 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.560
 season coming green I yes or yes 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.849
 I'm going to come the day of the final to support the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.849
 that I always consider my team 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.850
 can not be more 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.050
 efe 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.370
 it's hard to keep talking 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.370
 we are the same and I am 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.620
 with the rules 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.430
 of the tests that arranges competition to 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.430
 the rules of combat 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.420
 same if you have to place behind 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 someone 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.060
 and it is placed 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.150
 behind Alejandra 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.150
 that means that unfortunately 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.020
 thank you fanny help thanks for 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.730
 participate in combat 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.730
 all his classmates obviously 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.310
 sad because I 'm leaving but happy because 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.859
 because I know that it stays for me the best 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.810
 fighter competitor the sky proved 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.879
 or won the combat cup and all that and 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.769
 for me it is the best and it is in my team 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.480
 the green team so you have to follow 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.489
 pulling the claw from anywhere because I know 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.709
 that we are very tired and compete 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.750
 until the day of the final because I think that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.090
 the action is more difficult than you two 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.489
 in two great great friends whom 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.750
 combat to be standing in front as 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.239
 it is sense because we have nerves to 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.480
 Alejandra I felt really bad 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.079
 I did not expect this, things did not 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.349
 They came out as we wanted as we thought 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.819
 how do we plan that all things 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.620
 they go through something but in reality that was 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.030
 very strong because like a piece 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.349
 like they tore off a piece of me and 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.030
 I had to kneel because in 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.470
 I really felt terrible I did not feel like I did not 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.389
 it was coming down and I wanted to 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.739
 very much I liked to get to the 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.980
 final with her I would have liked to fight 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.419
 for winning this this season that 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.549
 finally it's the green, not the 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.530
 last season giving in red so 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.450
 Green are fighting despite 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.180
 all the things you obstacles we 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.250
 with the boss I think it 's difficult 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.600
 because they had already been an excellent 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.530
 competitor there I stay with lisette 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.530
 who is going to put you coal 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.790
 quiet 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.650
 and it gets like a pit bull it would be crazy 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.300
 they judge us when we talk but 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.160
 we talk because we have a 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.930
 special character and we reassure ourselves 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.330
 between the two things that suddenly the 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.130
 people take it differently I hope so 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.870
 how he gave me the opportunity in september 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.700
 last year to enter 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.530
 I do not know then I'll see if they give me another one 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.600
 the opportunity I do not know to participate or 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.430
 something then not suddenly to return not 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.140
 I want to injure as well considered 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.030
 of two fingers look where she is although 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.740
 it is not here but this same program 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.420
 and it's all if suddenly I'm going to do 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.270
 a pretty reporter 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:20.060
 I take a hug a big hug 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.380
 little friends or me too 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.380
 but really the truth
