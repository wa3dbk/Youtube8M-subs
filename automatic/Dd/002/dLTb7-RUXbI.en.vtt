share shield ability on this thing

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.750 
share shield ability on this thing
so<00:02:03.760> if<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.970> only<00:02:04.150> take<00:02:04.240> one<00:02:04.780> hit<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:06.340> ship

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
so if you only take one hit on this ship

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.609 
so if you only take one hit on this ship
onto<00:02:07.120> whatever<00:02:07.540> its<00:02:07.960> hull<00:02:08.200> because<00:02:08.530> it

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
onto whatever its hull because it

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.160 
onto whatever its hull because it
doesn't<00:02:08.890> have<00:02:08.920> shields<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:11.110> know

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
doesn't have shields this you know

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.620 
doesn't have shields this you know
taking<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:12.130> shield<00:02:12.730> off<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.210> cracks<00:02:13.450> in

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
taking a shield off of the cracks in

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.080 
taking a shield off of the cracks in
instead<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.050> taking<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.650> token<00:02:15.610> off<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
instead of taking a token off of the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.000 
instead of taking a token off of the
cart<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:16.750> totally<00:02:17.200> reasonable<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.860> take

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
cart it's totally reasonable you take

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.980 
cart it's totally reasonable you take
three<00:02:18.190> or<00:02:18.280> four<00:02:18.490> or<00:02:18.580> five<00:02:18.610> hits<00:02:19.060> from<00:02:19.780> one

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
three or four or five hits from one

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.560 
three or four or five hits from one
round<00:02:20.200> yeah<00:02:20.890> taking<00:02:21.460> up<00:02:21.550> one<00:02:21.760> token<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.330> not

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
round yeah taking up one token is not

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.890 
round yeah taking up one token is not
that<00:02:22.870> bad<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:24.070> really<00:02:24.460> interesting<00:02:25.150> also

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
that bad so it's really interesting also

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.870 
that bad so it's really interesting also
if<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.530> look<00:02:26.710> at<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:26.980> tokens<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.460> can<00:02:27.640> see

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
if you look at the tokens you can see

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.270 
if you look at the tokens you can see
that<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.420> shoot<00:02:28.720> six<00:02:29.050> or<00:02:29.320> five<00:02:29.530> or<00:02:29.800> four<00:02:30.100> or

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
that you shoot six or five or four or

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.660 
that you shoot six or five or four or
three<00:02:30.670> attacks<00:02:31.600> out<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.050> which<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.590> pretty

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
three attacks out of it which is pretty

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.460 
three attacks out of it which is pretty
significant<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.970> card<00:02:34.270> itself<00:02:34.450> gives<00:02:35.230> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
significant the card itself gives you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.010 
significant the card itself gives you
the<00:02:36.100> ability<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.580> shoot<00:02:37.030> out<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.660> rear

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
the ability to shoot out of the rear

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.430 
the ability to shoot out of the rear
firing<00:02:38.590> arc<00:02:38.800> twice<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.390> if<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.080> want<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.350> shoot

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
firing arc twice so if you want to shoot

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.560 
firing arc twice so if you want to shoot
that<00:02:41.650> way<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:42.160> also<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.850> which<00:02:43.390> is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
that way you can also do that which is

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.210 
that way you can also do that which is
really<00:02:43.990> interesting<00:02:44.230> given<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.860> fact<00:02:45.100> that

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
really interesting given the fact that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.060 
really interesting given the fact that
again<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.090> very<00:02:46.209> Dominion<00:02:46.930> II<00:02:47.050> they<00:02:47.860> have<00:02:48.040> a

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
again it's very Dominion II they have a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.770 
again it's very Dominion II they have a
lot<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.490> fire<00:02:48.940> or<00:02:48.970> nurse<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.330> lot<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.540> their<00:02:49.630> main

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
lot of fire or nurse a lot of their main

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.130 
lot of fire or nurse a lot of their main
ships<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.730> 180-degree<00:02:51.730> firing<00:02:52.120> arc<00:02:52.330> this

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
ships have a 180-degree firing arc this

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.530 
ships have a 180-degree firing arc this
one<00:02:53.370> only<00:02:54.370> has<00:02:54.459> many<00:02:54.730> before<00:02:55.000> but<00:02:55.240> it<00:02:55.300> also<00:02:55.390> has

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
one only has many before but it also has

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.750 
one only has many before but it also has
the<00:02:55.660> money<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:56.560> back<00:02:56.770> which<00:02:57.220> always<00:02:57.459> shoots

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the money to be back which always shoots

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.730 
the money to be back which always shoots
to<00:02:57.940> again<00:02:58.330> range<00:02:58.780> bad<00:02:58.930> one<00:02:59.080> you're<00:02:59.260> presumably

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
to again range bad one you're presumably

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.680 
to again range bad one you're presumably
also<00:02:59.980> let's<00:03:00.520> just<00:03:00.730> count<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.150> normal<00:03:01.390> hits<00:03:01.540> to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
also let's just count as normal hits to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.870 
also let's just count as normal hits to
the<00:03:01.780> hole<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.350> ignore<00:03:03.130> any<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.640> effect

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
the hole so you ignore any of the effect

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.120 
the hole so you ignore any of the effect
the<00:03:04.000> creek<00:03:04.240> would<00:03:04.390> have<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.810> ship<00:03:05.260> really

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
the creek would have on the ship really

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.130 
the creek would have on the ship really
amazed<00:03:06.880> also<00:03:07.450> I'm<00:03:07.600> going<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.780> stick<00:03:07.930> up<00:03:08.050> the

amazed also I'm going to stick up the

which<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.550> amazing<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.570> could<00:03:34.720> also<00:03:34.930> do<00:03:35.140> a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
which is amazing you could also do a

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.810 
which is amazing you could also do a
flip<00:03:35.410> turn<00:03:35.560> on<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.769> three<00:03:35.950> which<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.160> red<00:03:36.580> and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
flip turn on the three which is red and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.470 
flip turn on the three which is red and
a<00:03:37.600> forward<00:03:38.560> for<00:03:38.860> which<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.459> white<00:03:39.670> everything

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
a forward for which is white everything
