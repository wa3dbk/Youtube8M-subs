 Meat Stuffed Potatoes 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.959
 in this recipe we used 6 potatoes 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.820
 medium 250 grams of minced meat 2 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.920
 garlic cloves 50 grams of sobrasada 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.920
 parsley salt and pepper 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.860
 well the first thing we have done is wash 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 well the potato so that it is what it is without 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.090
 We do not put any kind of land in a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.390
 we throw a good jet of oil 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.390
 olive 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.250
 a good handful of salt 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.670
 with this we're going to get how we're doing 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.690
 to make the oven to stay a skin 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.570
 crunchy and do not fall apart as you see 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.120
 now let's smear it with the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.120
 oil is created all the impregnated skin 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 take a knife and the games by 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.300
 half 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.549
 well then now 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.560
 let's catch aluminum foil and let's go 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.469
 to wrap the back of the pieces of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.170
 potato let's put them all the pieces 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.810
 on a baking sheet and we'll give it 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.399
 we're going to give you oven for about 50 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.399
 minutes approximately 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.040
 well because we have nothing potatoes him 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.410
 let's get the heart out of the potato 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.560
 let's make a space for later go 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.560
 filling 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.570
 we do not do the same with potatoes 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.850
 now in a bowl we put the filling of the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.510
 potato let's put the guard is the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.510
 qualified 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.250
 We are going to add 2 tablespoons of sobrasada 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.250
 2 or 3 more humans 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.270
 we put the garlic cloves, chopped 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.890
 we add a handful of chopped parsley 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.510
 and now it's time to remove everything 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.710
 well when we have everything half removed 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.260
 we are going to take a lot of salt 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.650
 and we will also put pepper 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.760
 we remove everything right again until 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.760
 that stays well loose 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.190
 and now with that filling we're going to fill 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.070
 the potatoes one by one and then we go 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.190
 to take to the oven for about 20 to 25 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.670
 minutes and with this we already have the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.190
