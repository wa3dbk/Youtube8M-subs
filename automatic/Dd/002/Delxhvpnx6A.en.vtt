00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
to shift there in a year quite unique
and<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.840> both

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and that you can see that it's in both

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.040 
and that you can see that it's in both
sides<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.860> if<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.940> using<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.510> left<00:01:00.750> or

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
sides so if you're using your left or

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.189 
sides so if you're using your left or
right<00:01:01.379> hand<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.520> adapt<00:01:03.120> whichever<00:01:03.930> way

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

you<00:01:04.709> want<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> work<00:01:05.459> or<00:01:05.789> we'll<00:01:06.119> try<00:01:06.299> it

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
you want it to work or we'll try it

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.510 
you want it to work or we'll try it
first<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.289> fill<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.679> automatic<00:01:08.279> mode

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
first of all and fill the automatic mode

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.730 
first of all and fill the automatic mode
and<00:01:08.819> then<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.600> demonstrate<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and then we can demonstrate also the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:20.469 
and then we can demonstrate also the
sequential<00:01:11.159> shift<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:11.969> the<00:01:12.569> paddle<00:01:13.079> shift

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
and it works in the conventional style

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.690 
and it works in the conventional style
it's<00:01:28.250> not<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.490> CVT<00:01:30.760> model<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:33.010> as<00:01:34.010> efficient<00:01:34.550> I

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
it's not a CVT model and as efficient I
