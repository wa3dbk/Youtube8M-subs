particular<00:00:44.199> kind<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.860> picking<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:45.460> often

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
particular kind of picking it's often

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.719 
particular kind of picking it's often
called<00:00:46.210> Travis<00:00:46.750> picking<00:00:47.129> people<00:00:48.129> often<00:00:48.519> play

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
called Travis picking people often play

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.240 
called Travis picking people often play
this<00:00:48.909> with<00:00:49.089> a<00:00:49.120> thumb<00:00:49.420> pick<00:00:49.629> as<00:00:49.809> well<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.070> what

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
this with a thumb pick as well so what

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.770 
this with a thumb pick as well so what
is<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.460> difference<00:00:51.640> between<00:00:52.150> using<00:00:52.360> bare

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
is the difference between using bare

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.499 
is the difference between using bare
fingers<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.439> finger<00:00:53.799> picks<00:00:54.089> when<00:00:55.089> do<00:00:55.239> we<00:00:55.360> use

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:55.509 
fingers and finger picks when do we use

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:58.890 
fingers and finger picks when do we use
one<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.019> not<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.379> other<00:00:56.409> I<00:00:57.720> think<00:00:58.720> it's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
one and not the other I think it's

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.749 
one and not the other I think it's
mostly<00:00:59.259> a<00:00:59.320> case<00:00:59.559> of<00:00:59.769> preference<00:01:00.309> but<00:01:00.580> there

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:00.759 
mostly a case of preference but there

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.670 
mostly a case of preference but there
are<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.879> definite<00:01:01.509> difference<00:01:01.720> between<00:01:02.530> the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
are a definite difference between the

are a definite difference between the
two<00:01:02.860> sounds<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.549> different<00:01:03.759> ways<00:01:04.180> that

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
two sounds and different ways that

two sounds and different ways that
they're<00:01:04.600> used<00:01:05.520> in<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.820> last<00:01:07.090> piece<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.689> was

making a thumping sound instead of

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
if we separate out the alternating bass

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.850 
if we separate out the alternating bass
we<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.060> hear<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.420> characteristic<00:02:21.200> chunk

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
it's the same kind of Travis picking

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.750 
it's the same kind of Travis picking
style<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.930> sometimes<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.980> bass<00:02:46.190> notes<00:02:46.550> are

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
style that sometimes the bass notes are

style that sometimes the bass notes are
not<00:02:46.880> damped<00:02:47.420> they're<00:02:47.810> damped<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.770> again

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
not damped they're damped now and again

00:02:49.010 --> 00:03:08.370 
not damped they're damped now and again
to<00:02:49.220> cause<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> right<00:02:50.060> effect

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380

now<00:03:09.380> thumb<00:03:09.680> big<00:03:10.210> is<00:03:11.210> a<00:03:11.270> natural<00:03:11.900> amplifier

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
now thumb big is a natural amplifier

now thumb big is a natural amplifier
when<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.730> hit<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.120> strings<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.660> thumb<00:03:14.870> pick

so you can see even with a quite a

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.909 
so you can see even with a quite a
simple<00:06:13.370> blue<00:06:13.819> Sun<00:06:14.180> like<00:06:14.419> a<00:06:14.689> lone<00:06:14.960> Blues<00:06:15.259> there

are quite a few things happening for

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.350

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:22.999 
basses with my thumb pick so instead of

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:27.070 
basses with my thumb pick so instead of
just<00:06:23.180> hitting<00:06:24.580> I'm<00:06:25.580> stumbling<00:06:26.479> from<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:26.870> base

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
just hitting I'm stumbling from the base

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.040 
just hitting I'm stumbling from the base
E<00:06:31.150> which<00:06:32.150> makes<00:06:32.419> it<00:06:32.569> a<00:06:32.599> little<00:06:32.689> bit<00:06:32.900> more

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
E which makes it a little bit more

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.230 
E which makes it a little bit more
complicated<00:06:33.439> and<00:06:33.830> syncopated<00:06:34.610> and<00:06:34.759> more

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
complicated and syncopated and more

complicated and syncopated and more
interesting<00:06:35.960> which<00:06:36.169> is<00:06:36.289> really<00:06:36.589> important<00:06:37.189> we

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
interesting which is really important we

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.579 
interesting which is really important we

it fills out the sound it makes it

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:09.540 
it fills out the sound it makes it
broader<00:07:03.969> and<00:07:04.360> again<00:07:04.749> more<00:07:05.020> interesting<00:07:08.550> there

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
broader and again more interesting there
