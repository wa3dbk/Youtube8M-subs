00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
go into that but yes the processor had

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
go into that but yes the processor had
that<00:00:52.800> capability<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:53.969> thing<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> had<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that capability the one thing we had to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
that capability the one thing we had to
do<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:54.870> step<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> RAM<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:56.670> and

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
incredible now in addition because we're

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.899 
incredible now in addition because we're
emphasizing<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> video<00:01:50.070> side<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.790> bit

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
emphasizing the video side a little bit

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.370 
emphasizing the video side a little bit
more<00:01:51.119> we've<00:01:51.299> enhanced<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.930> couple<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
more we've enhanced a couple of the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.859 
more we've enhanced a couple of the
other<00:01:52.530> applications<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.600> slow

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
other applications can you do like slow

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.410 
other applications can you do like slow
motions<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.590> yes<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.850> there's<00:01:57.299> an

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
motions and yes you can so there's an

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.359 
motions and yes you can so there's an
application<00:01:58.200> called<00:01:58.350> timeshift<00:01:58.890> burst<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
application called timeshift burst that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069 
application called timeshift burst that
you<00:01:59.460> might<00:01:59.700> remember<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> still<00:02:00.659> photos

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
you might remember with the still photos

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.630 
you might remember with the still photos
yeah<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.799> gives<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> flipbook

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
yeah that gives you like a flipbook

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.209 
yeah that gives you like a flipbook
effect<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.869> nice<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.799> have

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
effect it's really nice here now we have

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.059 
effect it's really nice here now we have
it<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.430> video<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.240> well<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.990> add<00:02:07.140> slow<00:02:07.619> motion

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
it for video as well to add slow motion

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160 
it for video as well to add slow motion
while<00:02:08.220> you're<00:02:08.399> shooting<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.239> 4k<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> mean<00:02:10.050> then

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
while you're shooting so 4k I mean then

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.730 
while you're shooting so 4k I mean then
those<00:02:10.440> are

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
those are

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.410 
those are
huge<00:02:10.860> file<00:02:11.130> sizes<00:02:11.460> can<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.180> capture

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
huge file sizes can you just capture

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.840 
huge file sizes can you just capture
forever<00:02:13.320> until<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> run<00:02:14.070> out<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.250> memory<00:02:14.460> the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
forever until you run out of memory the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.910 
forever until you run out of memory the
cool<00:02:15.060> thing<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.840> course<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.770> with

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
cool thing that of course is that with

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.710 
cool thing that of course is that with
our<00:02:17.070> devices<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.730> give<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.030> expandable

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
our devices we give you expandable

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.140 
our devices we give you expandable
memory<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.620> start<00:02:19.950> out<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.400> 16<00:02:20.850> gig

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
memory so you start out with the 16 gig

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.300 
memory so you start out with the 16 gig
which<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.630> pretty<00:02:21.900> generous<00:02:22.440> internal<00:02:22.980> memory

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
which is pretty generous internal memory

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.220 
which is pretty generous internal memory
but<00:02:23.490> then<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.300> want<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> expand<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.110> with

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
but then if you want to expand it with

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.230 
but then if you want to expand it with
micro<00:02:25.560> sd<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.070> can<00:02:26.250> go<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> an<00:02:26.640> additional<00:02:27.090> up

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
micro sd you can go to an additional up

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.840 
micro sd you can go to an additional up
to<00:02:27.420> an<00:02:27.570> additional<00:02:28.110> 64<00:02:28.860> gig<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.550> one<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
to an additional 64 gig so one of the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.250 
to an additional 64 gig so one of the
most<00:02:29.970> important<00:02:30.330> parts<00:02:30.510> about<00:02:30.690> video<00:02:30.930> isn't

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
most important parts about video isn't

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.930 
most important parts about video isn't
just<00:02:31.380> making<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.770> beautiful<00:02:32.220> obviously<00:02:32.820> it's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
just making it beautiful obviously it's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.480 
just making it beautiful obviously it's
capturing<00:02:33.360> good<00:02:33.510> audio<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.130> capture

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
capturing good audio so is the capture

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.180 
capturing good audio so is the capture
quality<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> phone<00:02:37.010> fantastic

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
quality of the phone fantastic

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.310 
quality of the phone fantastic
it<00:02:38.520> has<00:02:38.730> by<00:02:39.180> itself<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:39.720> great<00:02:40.050> audio

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
it has by itself really great audio

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.830 
it has by itself really great audio
capturing<00:02:40.830> capability<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:41.910> there's<00:02:42.150> also<00:02:42.360> an

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
capturing capability but there's also an

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.870 
capturing capability but there's also an
accessory<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.560> we're<00:02:43.860> introducing<00:02:44.130> yeah

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
in a club or something like that you can

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.910 
in a club or something like that you can
adjust<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.870> audio<00:03:21.990> quality<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.740> there's

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
adjust the audio quality so there's

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.040 
adjust the audio quality so there's
different<00:03:23.040> sampling<00:03:23.670> rates<00:03:24.030> but<00:03:24.600> also<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
different sampling rates but also you

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.440 
different sampling rates but also you
can<00:03:25.350> select<00:03:25.530> stereo<00:03:26.160> or<00:03:26.460> mono<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.090> if<00:03:27.270> you're

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
can select stereo or mono so if you're

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.930 
can select stereo or mono so if you're
just<00:03:27.480> recording<00:03:28.320> notes<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.980> other<00:03:29.220> mic

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
just recording notes that other mic

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.340 
just recording notes that other mic
isn't<00:03:30.300> capturing<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> other<00:03:30.930> direction

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
isn't capturing the other direction

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.770 
isn't capturing the other direction
you're<00:03:31.890> able<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.610> have<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.940> focus<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.690> it

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
you're able to have that focus and it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.960 
you're able to have that focus and it
fits<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:34.350> nicely<00:03:34.500> does<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.160> work<00:03:35.460> with<00:03:35.700> other

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
fits so nicely does this work with other

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.760 
fits so nicely does this work with other
phones<00:03:36.300> or<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.810> with<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.200> experience

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
phones or is it just with the experience

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.470 
phones or is it just with the experience
I<00:03:37.860> think<00:03:37.920> right<00:03:38.340> now<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.550> focus<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.300> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
I think right now you focus on the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.780 
I think right now you focus on the
Xperia<00:03:39.960> z2<00:03:40.260> with<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:40.830> product<00:03:41.100> because<00:03:41.610> it's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
Xperia z2 with this product because it's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.880 
Xperia z2 with this product because it's
a<00:03:41.970> five<00:03:42.390> pole<00:03:42.690> connector<00:03:43.260> there<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.770> it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
a five pole connector there so it

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.550 
a five pole connector there so it
requires<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> special

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
requires a you know a special

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.440 
requires a you know a special
configuration<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.710> plug<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.700> then<00:03:48.090> once

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
configuration on the plug so then once

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.990 
configuration on the plug so then once
I've<00:03:48.630> got<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.900> all<00:03:49.020> captured<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.710> just<00:03:50.400> plug<00:03:50.880> in

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
I've got it all captured I just plug in

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.580 
I've got it all captured I just plug in
my<00:03:51.120> headphones<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.660> go<00:03:51.840> yeah<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.470> have

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
my headphones and go yeah and we have

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.200 
my headphones and go yeah and we have
some<00:03:52.740> special<00:03:52.830> headphones<00:03:53.460> to<00:03:53.580> talk<00:03:53.760> about<00:03:54.000> -

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
some special headphones to talk about -

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.420 
some special headphones to talk about -
oh<00:03:54.390> great<00:03:54.690> these<00:03:55.350> are<00:03:55.680> digital<00:03:56.070> noise

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
oh great these are digital noise

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.450 
oh great these are digital noise
cancelling<00:03:57.030> headphones<00:03:57.060> okay<00:03:57.960> now<00:03:58.740> the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
cancelling headphones okay now the

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.670 
cancelling headphones okay now the
reason<00:03:59.490> that<00:03:59.910> these<00:04:00.180> are<00:04:00.240> so<00:04:00.600> tiny<00:04:00.960> and<00:04:01.350> can<00:04:01.590> be

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
reason that these are so tiny and can be

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.400 
reason that these are so tiny and can be
digital<00:04:02.100> noise<00:04:02.220> cancelling<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.060> because<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
digital noise cancelling is because the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.860 
digital noise cancelling is because the
phone<00:04:04.710> has<00:04:05.100> digital<00:04:05.610> noise<00:04:05.760> canceling<00:04:06.420> but

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
phone has digital noise canceling but

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.500 
phone has digital noise canceling but
let's<00:04:07.110> call<00:04:07.230> DNC<00:04:07.890> for<00:04:08.100> short<00:04:08.430> as<00:04:08.730> DNC

digital noise canceling okay great so

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.840 
digital noise canceling okay great so
and<00:04:22.290> also<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.070> power<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.550> in<00:04:23.730> the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
you didn't have in the z1 right that's

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.970 
you didn't have in the z1 right that's
correct<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:09.810> we<00:05:09.930> stepped<00:05:10.230> up<00:05:10.440> on<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.770> with

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
correct so we stepped up on this with

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.440 
correct so we stepped up on this with
this<00:05:11.160> device<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.730> give<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.030> IPS

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
this device to give you the IPS

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.170 
this device to give you the IPS
technology<00:05:12.920> but<00:05:13.920> also<00:05:13.950> this<00:05:14.670> has<00:05:14.910> what<00:05:15.090> we

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
technology but also this has what we

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.290 
technology but also this has what we
call<00:05:15.390> live<00:05:15.690> color<00:05:16.320> LEDs<00:05:17.310> okay<00:05:17.760> so<00:05:17.820> what's<00:05:18.120> that

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
call live color LEDs okay so what's that

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.050 
call live color LEDs okay so what's that
well<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:19.500> introduces<00:05:20.040> without<00:05:20.340> getting<00:05:20.850> too

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
well it introduces without getting too

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.490 
well it introduces without getting too
technical<00:05:21.090> because<00:05:21.660> then<00:05:21.930> I'll<00:05:22.080> get<00:05:22.260> bogged

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
technical because then I'll get bogged

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.810 
technical because then I'll get bogged
down<00:05:22.650> in<00:05:23.360> but<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.480> adds<00:05:25.130> customized<00:05:26.130> color

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
down in but it adds customized color

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.430 
down in but it adds customized color
filter<00:05:27.270> layers<00:05:27.510> okay

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
filter layers okay

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.430 
filter layers okay
and<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.740> also<00:05:28.920> adds<00:05:29.340> into<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.090> blue<00:05:30.360> LEDs<00:05:31.170> it

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
and it also adds into the blue LEDs it

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.730 
and it also adds into the blue LEDs it
adds<00:05:31.650> red<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.640> green<00:05:32.850> phosphor<00:05:33.450> elements<00:05:34.110> now

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
adds red and green phosphor elements now

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.500 
adds red and green phosphor elements now
the<00:05:35.070> benefit<00:05:35.580> all<00:05:35.730> that<00:05:36.000> is<00:05:36.150> he's<00:05:36.300> going<00:05:36.450> to

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
the benefit all that is he's going to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.510 
the benefit all that is he's going to
get<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.690> more<00:05:36.960> consistent<00:05:37.410> brightness<00:05:38.130> on<00:05:38.370> the

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
get a more consistent brightness on the

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.430 
get a more consistent brightness on the
screen<00:05:38.850> overall<00:05:39.390> yeah<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.020> that's<00:05:40.140> gonna

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
screen overall yeah and that's gonna

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.290 
screen overall yeah and that's gonna
produce<00:05:40.710> better<00:05:41.340> colors<00:05:41.820> getting<00:05:42.150> more

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
produce better colors getting more

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.090 
produce better colors getting more
realistic<00:05:42.690> color<00:05:43.110> don't<00:05:43.350> like<00:05:43.560> saturate

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
realistic color don't like saturate

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.740 
realistic color don't like saturate
that's<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:44.520> that's<00:05:44.820> an<00:05:44.970> excellent<00:05:45.390> point

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
that's it that's an excellent point

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.480 
that's it that's an excellent point
because<00:05:45.930> it's<00:05:46.260> easy<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:46.740> pump<00:05:47.130> up<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.460> volume

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
because it's easy to pump up the volume

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.730 
because it's easy to pump up the volume
right<00:05:48.090> now<00:05:48.270> everything<00:05:48.870> but<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.140> up<00:05:49.230> at<00:05:49.350> 11

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
right now everything but it up at 11
