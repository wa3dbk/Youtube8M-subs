00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the boy the ball rejected for torrado 

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.200
 and pablo javi navarro click on where is 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
 pressing the real madrid let's see 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.410
 that there is a Real Madrid player who 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.500
 he has been lying on the ground 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.269
 of game is michelle is not mechel 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 salgado and what we are talking about what 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.940
 what were you saying I had the pressure 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.340
 see what stays in Madrid to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.939
 press all the points all very 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 ordered look by right side in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.500
 the center forward position 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.309
 pressing then for the signal and the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.120
 mark that you notice now steps 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.010
 complicated that does not come to clear account 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.360
 we will have to assume that it is 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.160
 involuntary what happens that as the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.300
 clear soccer curriculum that on the other 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.269
 part of the grounds games 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.890
 great anyway, but the truth is 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.260
 that what Pablo has done is very ugly 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.589
 alfaro 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.140
 and we will apply the benefit of the doubt 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.410
 Pablo Alfaro about everything that happens 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.340
 It is I think 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.170
 in another site we're going to see you know support 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.159
 and he knows what he has and yes 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.829
 I tell them 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.590
 something ugly that we have always 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.240
 recriminated and perhaps also my being 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.189
 Salgado arrives late but Mike Salgado 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.159
 always goes to the field of play and hopefully 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.039
 that is simply pain but it gives me the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.229
 impression that the epa gives me that not what 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.179
 we do not know is if it has been with the first 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.759
 contact in the play that was going to 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.270
 like the ball or has it been possible 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.270
 stomp 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.920
 this afternoon because the royal favors 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.840
 madrid are tremendously annoying 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.630
 now Pablo Alfaro would come to put peace 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.299
 it's curious 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.950
 the arsonist is 13 firemen those things 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.439
 javi navarro that is also blood 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.320
 hot in the end if the referee has gone to 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.509
 consult with the assistant and told him 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.539
 javi navarro and said 65 bis navarros 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.720
 it's javi navarro goes away red card 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.500
 direct javi navarro minute 4 of this 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.500
 second part 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.240
 that he should have paid too 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.270
 his partner Pablo Alfaro that there is 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.270
 all 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.190
 javi navarro and pablo alfaro javi navarro 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.650
 they have seen him and he is in the shower and talking 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.780
 but he has not seen it 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.490
 this also because he does not want to lose the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 trip and this is bad news from 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.310
 true and apart because ronaldo man 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.440
 it falls out of balance it falls over 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.270
 javi navarro 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 but there's Mike left for the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.400
 very strong inertia but that does not come
