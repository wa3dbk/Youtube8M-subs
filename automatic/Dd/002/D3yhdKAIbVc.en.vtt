from Samsung for example but not in
smartphone<00:01:05.030> before<00:01:05.180> it's<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.080> really<00:01:06.260> nice

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
smartphone before it's a really nice

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.550 
smartphone before it's a really nice
value<00:01:06.770> added<00:01:07.310> as<00:01:07.430> part<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.730> sense<00:01:08.000> 5<00:01:08.560> another

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
value added as part of sense 5 another

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.990 
value added as part of sense 5 another
thing<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:09.800> Boone<00:01:10.160> sound<00:01:10.550> those<00:01:10.760> are<00:01:10.910> the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000

a really loud show for example and I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.050 
a really loud show for example and I
just<00:01:21.500> have<00:01:21.650> this<00:01:21.770> experience<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.910> want
