and that's pretty much it for this bag
and<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.900> reason<00:03:39.170> this<00:03:39.260> bag<00:03:39.470> is<00:03:39.680> packed<00:03:39.890> so

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.580 
and the reason this bag is packed so
lately<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:41.000> because<00:03:41.060> underneath<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.989> in<00:03:42.410> the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
lately is because underneath it in the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.759 
lately is because underneath it in the
holster<00:03:42.769> I've<00:03:43.670> got<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:43.880> 2<00:03:44.300> liter<00:03:44.739> MSR<00:03:45.739> a

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
holster I've got a 2 liter MSR a

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.540 
holster I've got a 2 liter MSR a
dromedary<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:47.480> for<00:03:47.989> this<00:03:48.080> trip<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.620> would<00:03:49.370> have

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
dromedary so for this trip I would have

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.030 
dromedary so for this trip I would have
my<00:03:49.910> Camelback<00:03:50.480> full<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.560> that's<00:03:51.830> going<00:03:51.980> to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
my Camelback full so that's going to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.790 
my Camelback full so that's going to
give<00:03:52.190> me<00:03:52.220> about<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.239> 3<00:03:53.540> liter<00:03:53.840> capacity<00:03:54.170> there

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
give me about a 3 liter capacity there

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.050 
give me about a 3 liter capacity there
and<00:03:55.069> then<00:03:55.220> I've<00:03:55.310> got<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.459> 2<00:03:55.640> liter<00:03:55.850> capacity

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.270 
and then I've got a 2 liter capacity
here<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:57.140> that's<00:03:57.319> about<00:03:57.440> enough<00:03:57.830> for<00:03:58.010> me<00:03:58.160> to

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
buying a bag or a trip to think about

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.179 
buying a bag or a trip to think about
the<00:05:59.689> kind<00:05:59.870> of<00:05:59.899> camping<00:06:00.259> you<00:06:00.289> want<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.560> do<00:06:00.710> this

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
some sort of basic luxury items there I

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.409 
some sort of basic luxury items there I
wouldn't<00:06:10.039> take<00:06:10.129> on<00:06:10.310> a<00:06:10.370> trip<00:06:10.550> like<00:06:10.699> this<00:06:10.729> I'd<00:06:11.330> be

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
wouldn't take on a trip like this I'd be

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.010 
wouldn't take on a trip like this I'd be
riding<00:06:11.719> most<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.110> single<00:06:12.259> track<00:06:12.620> and

riding most a single track and
so<00:06:14.170> this<00:06:14.290> would<00:06:14.380> be<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.590> equivalent<00:06:14.770> of<00:06:15.100> a

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
the packing and equipment goes along

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.680 
the packing and equipment goes along
with<00:06:20.260> that<00:06:20.320> if<00:06:20.980> you're<00:06:21.280> looking<00:06:21.910> for<00:06:22.570> more

with that if you're looking for more

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.540 
with that if you're looking for more
space<00:06:22.990> or<00:06:23.290> comfort<00:06:23.740> things<00:06:23.980> like<00:06:24.220> the<00:06:24.340> camp

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
chair a larger tent definitely want to

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.710 
chair a larger tent definitely want to
think<00:06:27.520> about<00:06:27.610> either<00:06:28.000> when<00:06:28.330> two<00:06:28.420> liters<00:06:28.630> of

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
think about either when two liters of

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.930 
think about either when two liters of
storage<00:06:28.990> capacity<00:06:29.530> of<00:06:29.560> these<00:06:29.770> fresh<00:06:30.670> food

storage capacity of these fresh food

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.550 
storage capacity of these fresh food
will<00:06:31.210> also<00:06:31.330> change<00:06:31.750> the<00:06:31.960> calculation

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
will also change the calculation

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.010 
will also change the calculation
freeze-dried<00:06:33.310> food<00:06:33.550> is<00:06:33.760> pretty<00:06:34.000> efficient<00:06:34.450> in
