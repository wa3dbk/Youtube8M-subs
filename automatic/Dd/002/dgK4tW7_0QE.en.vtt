00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
able to stretch in different directions

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.420 
able to stretch in different directions
and<00:02:15.300> lie<00:02:15.480> down<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.960> not<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:16.650> than<00:02:16.710> is<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.280> in

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
and lie down but not more than is up in

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
this you can open this up the top opens

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.070 
this you can open this up the top opens
so<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.250> your<00:02:20.400> hand<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.970> fit<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.360> here<00:02:21.660> yet

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.140 
so that your hand can fit in here yet
like<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> main<00:02:23.340> thing<00:02:23.760> about<00:02:23.790> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
like that but the main thing about this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.760 
like that but the main thing about this
the<00:02:24.330> main<00:02:24.510> benefit<00:02:24.960> is<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.470> stop

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the main benefit is that if you stop

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.430 
the main benefit is that if you stop
suddenly<00:02:26.070> there's<00:02:26.820> only<00:02:27.090> two<00:02:27.450> inches<00:02:27.660> around

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
suddenly there's only two inches around

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.500 
suddenly there's only two inches around
him<00:02:28.680> on<00:02:28.830> any<00:02:29.040> side<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> stop<00:02:30.060> suddenly

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
him on any side so I stop suddenly

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.570 
him on any side so I stop suddenly
he'll<00:02:31.080> travel<00:02:31.500> two<00:02:31.800> inches<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.250> hit<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> side

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
he'll travel two inches and hit the side

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.010 
he'll travel two inches and hit the side
he's<00:02:32.760> not<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.060> hurt<00:02:33.180> himself<00:02:33.330> okay<00:02:33.810> if

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
he's not going to hurt himself okay if

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.140 
he's not going to hurt himself okay if
you<00:02:34.230> use<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> big<00:02:34.950> carrier<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.700> some<00:02:35.910> people

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you use a big carrier and some people

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.400 
you use a big carrier and some people
want<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.330> give<00:02:36.450> their<00:02:36.600> rabbit<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:36.960> much<00:02:37.170> room

want to give their rabbit as much room

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.800 
want to give their rabbit as much room
as<00:02:37.500> possible<00:02:37.770> bad<00:02:38.700> idea<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.300> if<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.660> have

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
as possible bad idea because if you have

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.570 
as possible bad idea because if you have
a<00:02:39.840> big<00:02:40.080> carrier<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.740> stop<00:02:41.010> suddenly<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
a big carrier and you stop suddenly the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.490 
a big carrier and you stop suddenly the
rabbit's<00:02:41.910> body<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.660> slam<00:02:43.080> into<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
rabbit's body is going to slam into the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.690 
rabbit's body is going to slam into the
inside<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.980> carrier<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.460> he<00:02:44.550> could

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
inside of that carrier and he could

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.430 
inside of that carrier and he could
really<00:02:44.820> hurt<00:02:45.030> himself<00:02:45.210> okay<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.200> want<00:02:46.380> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
really hurt himself okay so you want to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.960 
really hurt himself okay so you want to
choose<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.710> smallest<00:02:47.190> carrier<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.850> would

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
choose the smallest carrier that would

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.670 
choose the smallest carrier that would
still<00:02:48.240> allow<00:02:48.360> your<00:02:48.720> rabbit<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.170> turn<00:02:49.350> around

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
still allow your rabbit to turn around

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.920 
still allow your rabbit to turn around
and<00:02:49.920> lie<00:02:50.070> down<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:51.180> that's<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> safest<00:02:51.780> way

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and lie down and that's the safest way

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.600 
and lie down and that's the safest way
to<00:02:51.960> travel<00:02:52.260> with<00:02:52.500> rabbits<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.040> used<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.490> do<00:02:53.580> a

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
to travel with rabbits I used to do a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.030 
to travel with rabbits I used to do a
fair<00:02:53.880> amount<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.150> air<00:02:54.360> travel<00:02:54.840> with<00:02:55.380> my<00:02:55.590> rabbit

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
fair amount of air travel with my rabbit

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.740 
fair amount of air travel with my rabbit
and<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.610> would<00:02:56.790> use<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.090> kind<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.390> carrier

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
and I would use this kind of carrier

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.390 
and I would use this kind of carrier
because<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.200> fits<00:02:58.410> under<00:02:58.650> an<00:02:58.740> airline<00:02:59.100> seat

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
because this fits under an airline seat
