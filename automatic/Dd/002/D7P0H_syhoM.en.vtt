shut down and what we have to do is put

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.290 
shut down and what we have to do is put
it<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.899> recovery<00:00:36.899> mode<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.030> we

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it in recovery mode but so to do this we

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.990 
it in recovery mode but so to do this we
have<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> hold<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> power<00:00:40.620> down<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.250> mean<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
have to hold the power down I mean the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.240 
have to hold the power down I mean the
volume<00:00:42.329> down<00:00:42.510> button<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.829> power<00:00:43.860> button

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
volume down button and the power button

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.779 
volume down button and the power button
at<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> same<00:00:44.640> time<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.460> will<00:00:47.640> basically

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
at the same time so this will basically

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.330 
at the same time so this will basically
put<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.440> into<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.010> hot<00:00:50.449> fastboot<00:00:51.449> mode<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
put you into a hot fastboot mode and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.540 
put you into a hot fastboot mode and
let's<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.399> wait<00:00:53.730> until<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.210> finishes<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
let's just wait until this finishes I

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
let's just wait until this finishes I
didn't<00:00:56.550> work<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.449> second<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
didn't work just one second and now it's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 
didn't work just one second and now it's
in<00:00:59.430> fastboot<00:01:00.059> mode<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.930> hop<00:01:01.230> vol<00:01:01.559> up

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
in fastboot mode so just hop vol up

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.690 
in fastboot mode so just hop vol up
twice<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.059> power<00:01:03.660> button<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:05.339> in

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
twice and power button now you are in

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.090 
twice and power button now you are in
recovery<00:01:06.210> mode<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.530> clockworkmod

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
recovery mode so it's clockworkmod

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.609 
recovery mode so it's clockworkmod
