00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
people so that would give you net growth

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.809 
people so that would give you net growth
of<00:02:52.549> 2<00:02:52.790> billion<00:02:53.239> people<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.810> he<00:02:54.590> also<00:02:54.739> added<00:02:55.129> in

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
of 2 billion people and he also added in

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.319 
of 2 billion people and he also added in
other<00:02:56.000> statistics<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:57.079> that<00:02:57.400> half<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.730> those<00:02:58.940> 2

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
other statistics is that half of those 2

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.080 
other statistics is that half of those 2
billion<00:02:59.810> people<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:01.220> their<00:03:01.459> own<00:03:01.700> late-night

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
billion people have their own late-night

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.680 
billion people have their own late-night
talk<00:03:02.599> shows<00:03:02.870> now<00:03:03.639> which<00:03:04.639> was<00:03:04.849> a<00:03:04.879> funny<00:03:05.239> one<00:03:05.420> too

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
talk shows now which was a funny one too

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.110 
talk shows now which was a funny one too
so<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.560> guess<00:03:06.920> because<00:03:07.129> most<00:03:07.639> of<00:03:07.760> your<00:03:07.879> viewers

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
so I guess because most of your viewers

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.809 
so I guess because most of your viewers
who<00:03:08.569> watch<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:09.079> doing<00:03:09.920> your<00:03:10.280> own<00:03:10.400> version<00:03:10.639> of
