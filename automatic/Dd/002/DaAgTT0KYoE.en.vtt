you<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:46.460> one<00:00:46.640> I've<00:00:47.359> always<00:00:47.569> thought<00:00:47.839> it<00:00:47.989> best

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
you for one I've always thought it best

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.099 
you for one I've always thought it best
to<00:00:48.350> start<00:00:48.620> with<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.979> engine<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:50.329> know<00:00:50.449> I<00:00:50.719> see

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
to start with the engine you know I see

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.569 
to start with the engine you know I see
a<00:00:51.140> lot<00:00:51.409> of<00:00:51.559> them<00:00:51.679> every<00:00:51.859> day<00:00:52.010> here<00:00:52.249> but<00:00:52.280> there

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
a lot of them every day here but there

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.340 
a lot of them every day here but there
is<00:00:52.699> one<00:00:52.969> brand<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.420> don't<00:00:53.569> get<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.809> work<00:00:54.019> on<00:00:54.199> this

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
is one brand I don't get to work on this

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.759 
is one brand I don't get to work on this
often<00:00:54.710> which<00:00:55.219> one<00:00:55.429> to<00:00:55.909> come<00:00:56.089> so<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.929> come<00:00:57.199> set<00:00:57.499> I

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
often which one to come so to come set I

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.349 
often which one to come so to come set I
thought<00:00:58.280> they<00:00:58.399> only<00:00:58.429> made<00:00:58.789> snow<00:00:59.030> thrower

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
thought they only made snow thrower

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.539 
thought they only made snow thrower
engines<00:00:59.839> well<00:01:00.229> actually<00:01:00.469> they<00:01:00.859> power<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.280> lot

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
engines well actually they power a lot

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.160 
engines well actually they power a lot
more<00:01:01.819> equipment<00:01:02.120> than<00:01:02.420> you'd<00:01:02.659> think

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
more equipment than you'd think

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.350 
more equipment than you'd think

step over here let me tell you a couple
of<00:01:05.420> things<00:01:05.540> about<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.990> come<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.120> you<00:01:08.120> see<00:01:08.330> for

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
of things about to come so you see for

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.660 
of things about to come so you see for
one<00:01:08.720> thing<00:01:09.020> they're<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.590> only<00:01:09.950> one<00:01:10.370> with<00:01:10.640> a

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
one thing they're the only one with a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.940 
one thing they're the only one with a
pro<00:01:11.090> tech<00:01:11.450> oil<00:01:11.750> system<00:01:12.290> in<00:01:12.380> every<00:01:12.590> engine

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
pro tech oil system in every engine

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.250 
pro tech oil system in every engine
what's<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:13.910> special<00:01:14.150> about<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.570> one<00:01:15.080> buddy

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
what's so special about that one buddy

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.230 
what's so special about that one buddy
else<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.620> anything<00:01:15.920> like<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:17.030> a

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
else is anything like it it's a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.750 
else is anything like it it's a
pressurized<00:01:17.750> oil<00:01:18.290> distribution<00:01:19.160> system<00:01:19.610> that

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
pressurized oil distribution system that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.000 
pressurized oil distribution system that
pumps<00:01:19.970> oil<00:01:20.270> directly<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.230> all<00:01:21.410> your<00:01:21.800> critical

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
pumps oil directly to all your critical

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.030 
pumps oil directly to all your critical
engine<00:01:22.400> parts<00:01:23.110> there's<00:01:24.110> oil<00:01:24.260> in<00:01:24.440> my<00:01:24.620> engine

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
engine parts there's oil in my engine

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.910 
engine parts there's oil in my engine
that's<00:01:25.220> good<00:01:25.430> enough<00:01:25.550> right<00:01:26.000> well<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.620> can't

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
that's good enough right well you can't

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.680 
that's good enough right well you can't
be<00:01:28.100> sure<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.580> all<00:01:28.610> your<00:01:28.790> parts<00:01:29.360> are<00:01:29.510> getting

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
be sure that all your parts are getting

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.500 
be sure that all your parts are getting
a<00:01:29.780> constant<00:01:30.170> supply<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.800> oil<00:01:30.980> you<00:01:31.760> see<00:01:32.000> other

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
a constant supply of oil you see other

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.360 
a constant supply of oil you see other
engines<00:01:33.050> just<00:01:33.290> kind<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.590> splash<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.190> oil

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
engines just kind of splash the oil

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.550 
engines just kind of splash the oil
around<00:01:34.700> down<00:01:34.910> here<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.050> system<00:01:36.290> is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
around down here but this system is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.130 
around down here but this system is
pressurized<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.390> can<00:01:38.570> be<00:01:38.690> sure<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.110> oil

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
pressurized so you can be sure the oil

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.930 
pressurized so you can be sure the oil
is<00:01:39.440> getting<00:01:39.590> up<00:01:39.920> where<00:01:40.220> it's<00:01:40.370> needed<00:01:40.790> so

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
is getting up where it's needed so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.970 
is getting up where it's needed so
there's<00:01:41.480> less<00:01:41.600> friction<00:01:41.900> less<00:01:42.290> wear<00:01:42.650> which

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
there's less friction less wear which

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.040 
there's less friction less wear which
means<00:01:43.220> your<00:01:43.400> engine<00:01:43.670> lasts<00:01:43.880> longer<00:01:44.330> well<00:01:44.900> that

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
means your engine lasts longer well that

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.640 
means your engine lasts longer well that
makes<00:01:45.230> sense

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
makes sense

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.280 
makes sense
here's<00:01:46.310> something<00:01:46.670> else<00:01:46.930> if<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.110> were<00:01:48.200> to

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
here's something else if you were to

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.650 
here's something else if you were to
look<00:01:48.410> into<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.770> gas<00:01:49.070> tank<00:01:49.430> you'd<00:01:50.060> see<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.300> gray

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
look into that gas tank you'd see a gray

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.250 
look into that gas tank you'd see a gray
mesh<00:01:51.020> screen<00:01:51.500> like<00:01:51.800> this<00:01:52.840> now<00:01:53.840> this<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.230> a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
mesh screen like this now this is a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.110 
mesh screen like this now this is a
material<00:01:54.650> it's<00:01:54.980> woven<00:01:55.460> in<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.730> way<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.090> only

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
material it's woven in a way that only

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.690 
material it's woven in a way that only
allows<00:01:56.540> gasoline<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.530> pass<00:01:57.770> through<00:01:58.130> it's

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
allows gasoline to pass through it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.690 
allows gasoline to pass through it's
called<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.210> clean<00:01:59.510> fuel<00:01:59.960> filter<00:02:00.500> system<00:02:00.980> it

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
called the clean fuel filter system it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700 
called the clean fuel filter system it
keeps<00:02:01.940> water<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.659> debris<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:03.080> can<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.620> in

need to worry about water in my engine I

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.770 
need to worry about water in my engine I
don't<00:02:08.869> leave<00:02:09.200> my<00:02:09.229> mower<00:02:09.679> out<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.220> rain<00:02:10.780> I'm

inside your gas tank but you can't

inside your gas tank but you can't
prevent<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.370> but<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.330> don't<00:02:23.540> need<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> let

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
prevent that but you don't need to let

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.320 
prevent that but you don't need to let
it<00:02:24.080> give<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.440> hard<00:02:24.650> time<00:02:24.710> either<00:02:25.330> well

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
it give you a hard time either well

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.430 
it give you a hard time either well
that's<00:02:26.570> something<00:02:26.780> I've<00:02:26.990> never<00:02:27.140> thought

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that's something I've never thought

that's something I've never thought
about<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.250> maybe<00:02:28.490> that's<00:02:28.730> why<00:02:28.940> my<00:02:29.300> mower

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
about and maybe that's why my mower

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.140 
about and maybe that's why my mower
doesn't<00:02:29.720> start<00:02:30.170> very<00:02:30.350> easily<00:02:30.620> sometimes<00:02:31.160> it

could<00:02:32.420> be<00:02:32.630> but<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.350> know<00:02:33.380> clean<00:02:33.740> fuel<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.190> just

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
could be but you know clean fuel is just

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
to show you something the starter pulley

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.870 
to show you something the starter pulley
that<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.170> see<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.470> here<00:03:09.710> is<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.310> lot<00:03:10.610> larger

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
that you see in here is a lot larger

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.520 
that you see in here is a lot larger
than<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.330> one<00:03:11.450> you're<00:03:11.630> used<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.050> so<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.350> takes

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
than the one you're used to so it takes

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.100 
than the one you're used to so it takes
a<00:03:12.620> lot<00:03:12.800> less<00:03:13.010> effort<00:03:13.280> plus<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.330> compression

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
a lot less effort plus the compression

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.380 
a lot less effort plus the compression
in<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.290> engine<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:15.980> automatically<00:03:16.850> reduced

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
in the engine is automatically reduced

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.050 
in the engine is automatically reduced
when<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.750> pull<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.860> takes<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:19.340> little<00:03:19.580> effort

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
when you pull it takes so little effort

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.240 
when you pull it takes so little effort
that<00:03:20.240> comes<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.570> calls<00:03:20.780> its<00:03:20.960> soft<00:03:21.230> pull<00:03:21.560> mmm

lawn now here's open anyway now the last
thing<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.850> want<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.060> tell<00:03:29.240> you<00:03:29.360> about<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
thing I want to tell you about is the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.160 
thing I want to tell you about is the
hot<00:03:30.740> spark<00:03:31.190> electronic<00:03:31.820> ignition<00:03:32.170> this

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
hot spark electronic ignition this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.350 
hot spark electronic ignition this
produces<00:03:33.740> a<00:03:33.800> hotter<00:03:34.190> spark<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.880> fire<00:03:35.120> the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
produces a hotter spark to fire the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.360 
produces a hotter spark to fire the
engine<00:03:35.750> but<00:03:36.110> it<00:03:36.260> doesn't<00:03:36.620> have<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.920> wait<00:03:37.130> for

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
engine but it doesn't have to wait for

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.950 
engine but it doesn't have to wait for
the<00:03:37.460> engine<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.820> reach<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.210> high<00:03:38.360> speed<00:03:38.750> before

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
the engine to reach a high speed before

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.620 
the engine to reach a high speed before
it<00:03:39.260> can<00:03:39.410> fire<00:03:39.680> it's<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.490> lot<00:03:40.670> easier<00:03:41.120> it's<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.450> lot

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
it can fire it's a lot easier it's a lot

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.030 
it can fire it's a lot easier it's a lot
more<00:03:41.810> efficient<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.440> you're<00:03:42.710> up<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:42.950> running

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
more efficient and you're up and running

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.970 
more efficient and you're up and running
a<00:03:43.340> whole<00:03:43.520> lot<00:03:43.730> faster<00:03:44.240> well<00:03:45.050> that<00:03:45.410> settles<00:03:45.770> it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
a whole lot faster well that settles it

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.110 
a whole lot faster well that settles it
for<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.280> engine<00:03:46.840> now<00:03:48.040> which<00:03:49.040> mower<00:03:49.550> is<00:03:49.790> best
