certain concept within the blender check
out<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> video<00:00:27.810> descriptions<00:00:28.560> because<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.609> try

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
out the video descriptions because I try

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.900 
out the video descriptions because I try
to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.090> specific<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.050> people<00:00:31.769> who<00:00:32.219> are

entire five or ten minute video every
time<00:00:40.700> okay<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.180> video<00:00:42.360> we're<00:00:42.690> going

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
time okay so in this video we're going

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
time okay so in this video we're going
to<00:00:42.840> talk<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.260> soft<00:00:43.649> body<00:00:43.950> collision<00:00:44.340> we're

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to talk about soft body collision we're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.330 
to talk about soft body collision we're
going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> create<00:00:44.969> an<00:00:45.149> animation<00:00:46.010> by<00:00:47.010> enabling

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
going to create an animation by enabling

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
going to create an animation by enabling
physics<00:00:48.059> properties<00:00:48.539> within<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> blender

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
physics properties within the blender

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.900 
physics properties within the blender
it's<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> create<00:00:50.340> some<00:00:50.610> artificial

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it's going to create some artificial

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
it's going to create some artificial
gravity<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> we're<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.350> make

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
gravity and we're going to actually make

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.150 
gravity and we're going to actually make
this<00:00:53.640> cube<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.629> drop<00:00:55.020> according<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
this cube right here drop according to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.209 
this cube right here drop according to
how<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.340> define<00:00:57.079> gravity<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.559> whatnot<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
how we define gravity and whatnot so the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
how we define gravity and whatnot so the
first<00:00:59.399> thing<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.149> I'm<00:01:00.930> going

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.360 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:01.109> click<00:01:01.260> 7<00:01:01.530> i'm<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.129> top

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to click 7 i'm going to put it in top

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.529 
to click 7 i'm going to put it in top
down<00:01:02.609> view<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.940> i'm<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> delete<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
down view and i'm going to delete the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.910 
down view and i'm going to delete the
default<00:01:03.690> cube<00:01:05.720> i'm<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> add<00:01:07.350> i'm

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
default cube i'm going to go to add i'm

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.039 
default cube i'm going to go to add i'm
going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> choose<00:01:08.369> mesh<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.780> i'm<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
going to choose mesh and i'm going to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
going to choose mesh and i'm going to
add<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> plane<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.070> important<00:01:11.460> you're<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
add a plane now it's important you're in

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
add a plane now it's important you're in
top<00:01:11.909> view<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.200> plane<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
top view here this plane is a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.570 
top view here this plane is a
two-dimensional<00:01:15.950> mesh<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.520> just

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
two-dimensional mesh here it's just

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
two-dimensional mesh here it's just
basically<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.180> single<00:01:18.659> face<00:01:18.900> I'm<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> hit

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
basically a single face I'm going to hit

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
basically a single face I'm going to hit
s<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> size<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.570> up

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
s and I'm going to size it up

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.530 
s and I'm going to size it up
significantly<00:01:22.320> okay<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.909> next<00:01:24.150> step<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
significantly okay the next step is to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
significantly okay the next step is to
hit<00:01:24.810> three<00:01:25.290> we're<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.070> kick<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
hit three we're going to kick it over to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
hit three we're going to kick it over to
side<00:01:26.850> view<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.229> choose

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
side view and then I'm going to choose

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.460 
side view and then I'm going to choose
our<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> rotate<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.210> about<00:01:31.049> 45

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
our and I'm going to rotate it about 45

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.819 
our and I'm going to rotate it about 45
degrees<00:01:31.890> maybe<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.180> less<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.619> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
degrees maybe a little less and as you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.109 
degrees maybe a little less and as you
can<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.040> I'll<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.640> ahead<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.850> I'll<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
can see I'll go ahead and I'll just

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.490 
can see I'll go ahead and I'll just
rotate<00:01:39.450> around<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.840> we've<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.170> plane

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
rotate around now we've got our plane

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
rotate around now we've got our plane
just<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.850> okay<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> move

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
just like that okay I'm going to move

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.889 
just like that okay I'm going to move
the<00:01:43.140> cursor<00:01:43.320> above<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.189> plane<00:01:44.689> I'm<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the cursor above the plane I'm going to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.560 
the cursor above the plane I'm going to
choose<00:01:46.079> add<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.939> I'm<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> choose<00:01:48.240> mesh

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
choose add and I'm going to choose mesh

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.280 
choose add and I'm going to choose mesh
the<00:01:49.290> more<00:01:49.470> complicated<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.340> mesh<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:52.020> slower

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the more complicated the mesh the slower

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.219 
the more complicated the mesh the slower
your<00:01:52.500> animation<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.220> render<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.229> I'm

here<00:02:02.509> what<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> did<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.759> plane<00:02:06.630> was

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
here what it did was it's the plane was

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.600 
here what it did was it's the plane was
selected<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.500> added<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.890> new<00:02:08.009> mash<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> added

the<00:02:23.069> answer<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.630> i<00:02:24.660> could

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the answer to that so that i could

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.150 
the answer to that so that i could
right-click<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.530> cube<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.069> then

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
right-click on the cube and then

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.800 
right-click on the cube and then
right-click<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> plane<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> select<00:02:27.690> them

right-click on the plane and select them

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.930 
right-click on the plane and select them
independently<00:02:28.410> based<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.610> fact<00:02:29.849> that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
independently based on the fact that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.330 
independently based on the fact that
right<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.360> blender<00:02:31.290> seems<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.709> consider

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
right now the blender seems to consider

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.150 
right now the blender seems to consider
them<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.580> single<00:02:32.880> object<00:02:33.650> please<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:35.069> know

post a comment to youtube and say here's
how<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.140> split<00:02:37.920> those<00:02:38.160> two<00:02:38.370> objects<00:02:38.790> up<00:02:38.970> i'm

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
how you split those two objects up i'm

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.610 
how you split those two objects up i'm
going<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.750> delete<00:02:39.870> them<00:02:40.110> right<00:02:40.260> now<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.440> i'm

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
going to delete them right now and i'm

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.600 
going to delete them right now and i'm
just<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.890> go<00:02:41.040> through<00:02:41.190> those<00:02:41.370> steps

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
just going to go through those steps

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.500 
just going to go through those steps
again<00:02:41.940> very<00:02:42.239> quickly<00:02:42.420> add<00:02:43.130> mesh<00:02:44.130> plane<00:02:44.760> i'm

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
again very quickly add mesh plane i'm

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.350 
again very quickly add mesh plane i'm
going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> scale<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.110> up<00:02:46.970> I'm<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.239> kick

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
going to scale it up I'm going to kick

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390 
going to scale it up I'm going to kick
it<00:02:48.480> into<00:02:48.600> object<00:02:49.110> mode<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.250> go<00:02:50.340> to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
it into object mode I'm going to go to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.830 
it into object mode I'm going to go to
three<00:02:50.790> side<00:02:51.180> view<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:52.350> right<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.830> going<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
three side view all right I'm going to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
three side view all right I'm going to
rotate<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> little<00:02:55.470> less<00:02:55.680> than<00:02:55.860> 45<00:02:56.310> degrees

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
rotate it a little less than 45 degrees

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.270 
rotate it a little less than 45 degrees
so<00:02:57.780> we've<00:02:57.959> got<00:02:58.140> our<00:02:58.170> plane<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.769> there<00:02:59.040> now

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
so we've got our plane right there now

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.789 
so we've got our plane right there now
I'm<00:02:59.400> going<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.580> deselect<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.500> I'm<00:03:01.500> going<00:03:01.739> to

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
I'm going to deselect it I'm going to

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.610 
I'm going to deselect it I'm going to
choose<00:03:01.980> add<00:03:02.660> I'm<00:03:03.660> going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.900> go<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.049> mesh<00:03:04.350> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
choose add I'm going to go to mesh and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.309 
choose add I'm going to go to mesh and
i'm<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.830> choose<00:03:05.010> cube<00:03:05.840> ok<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:06.900> now<00:03:07.170> I've

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
i'm going to choose cube ok so now I've

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.440 
i'm going to choose cube ok so now I've
got<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.739> independently<00:03:08.400> selectable<00:03:08.910> objects

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
got to independently selectable objects

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.990 
got to independently selectable objects
I<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:10.319> select<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.739> plane<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.459> can<00:03:11.640> select

I can select the plane and I can select

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.650 
I can select the plane and I can select
the<00:03:12.120> cube<00:03:13.970> all<00:03:14.970> right<00:03:15.120> I'm<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.420> take<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the cube all right I'm going to take the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.550 
the cube all right I'm going to take the
cube<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.019> I'm<00:03:16.080> going<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.260> move<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:16.530> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
cube but I'm going to move it up to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.979 
cube but I'm going to move it up to
about<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.069> top<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.489> plane<00:03:17.730> actually<00:03:18.510> let

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
ahead and size it down make it a little

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210 
ahead and size it down make it a little
smaller<00:03:36.380> we're<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.590> hover<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.010> fair

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
smaller we're going to hover it a fair

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.180 
smaller we're going to hover it a fair
distance<00:03:38.519> above<00:03:38.700> our<00:03:38.940> plane<00:03:39.320> ok<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.160> first

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
distance above our plane ok so the first

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.110 
distance above our plane ok so the first
thing<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.549> want<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.700> do<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.880> we're<00:03:41.970> going<00:03:42.060> to

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
thing we want to do is we're going to

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.729 
thing we want to do is we're going to
select<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.480> plane<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.019> we're<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.620> go

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
select the plane and we're going to go

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.180 
select the plane and we're going to go
over<00:03:43.769> here<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> our<00:03:44.570> object<00:03:45.570> panel<00:03:48.380> says<00:03:49.380> f7

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
over here to our object panel says f7

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.590 
over here to our object panel says f7
that's<00:03:50.400> our<00:03:50.549> shortcut<00:03:51.030> down<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
that's our shortcut down there in the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.259 
that's our shortcut down there in the
panel<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.489> over<00:03:53.489> on<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.700> right<00:03:53.910> you've<00:03:54.090> got

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
going to uncheck use goal now here's the

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.720 
going to uncheck use goal now here's the
cool<00:04:26.849> thing<00:04:26.909> about<00:04:27.120> blender

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
cool thing about blender

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.710 
cool thing about blender
really<00:04:27.880> does<00:04:28.030> give<00:04:28.180> some<00:04:28.360> good<00:04:28.450> information

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
really does give some good information

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.410 
really does give some good information
if<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.770> hover<00:04:30.010> over<00:04:30.130> use<00:04:30.520> goal<00:04:30.730> it<00:04:30.850> says<00:04:31.030> define

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
if I hover over use goal it says define

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.530 
if I hover over use goal it says define

forces four vertices to stick to

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.960 
forces four vertices to stick to
animated<00:04:35.080> positions<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:35.740> by<00:04:36.130> keeping<00:04:36.700> that

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
animated positions so by keeping that

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.840 
animated positions so by keeping that
checked<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:38.320> forces<00:04:38.830> of<00:04:38.860> gravity<00:04:39.250> are<00:04:39.610> going

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
checked the forces of gravity are going

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.300 
checked the forces of gravity are going
to<00:04:40.030> kind<00:04:40.720> of<00:04:40.780> stick<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.350> cube<00:04:41.800> where<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.190> is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
to kind of stick that cube where it is

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.680 
to kind of stick that cube where it is
but<00:04:42.520> we<00:04:42.640> don't<00:04:42.790> want<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.180> happen<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:43.540> I'm

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
but we don't want that to happen so I'm

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.100 
but we don't want that to happen so I'm
going<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.870> uncheck<00:04:44.080> use<00:04:44.680> goal<00:04:45.840> I'm<00:04:46.840> going<00:04:47.050> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
going to uncheck use goal I'm going to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.060 
going to uncheck use goal I'm going to
come<00:04:47.260> down<00:04:47.410> here<00:04:47.440> I'm<00:04:47.710> going<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:47.920> check

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
come down here I'm going to check

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.040 
come down here I'm going to check
stiffness<00:04:51.000> go<00:04:52.000> ahead<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.210> bump<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.480> up<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.630> 0

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
stiffness go ahead and bump it up to 0

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.530 
stiffness go ahead and bump it up to 0
point<00:04:53.590> six<00:04:53.860> now<00:04:54.730> all<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:54.940> have<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.180> do<00:04:55.390> is<00:04:55.510> hit

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
point six now all I have to do is hit

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.260 
point six now all I have to do is hit
alt<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:58.980> as<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.190> can<00:05:00.340> see<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.730> cube<00:05:01.000> goes

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
alt a and as you can see the cube goes

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.910 
alt a and as you can see the cube goes
rolling<00:05:01.600> down<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.080> plane<00:05:02.320> that's<00:05:02.560> pretty

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
rolling down the plane that's pretty

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.240 
rolling down the plane that's pretty
cool<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:04.300> that<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.960> all<00:05:05.290> there<00:05:05.440> is<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.890> soft

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
cool and that is all there is to soft

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.310 
cool and that is all there is to soft
body<00:05:06.580> deflection<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.300> create<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.840> plane<00:05:08.080> you

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
body deflection you create the plane you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.490 
body deflection you create the plane you
create<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.770> cube<00:05:09.070> you<00:05:09.280> enable<00:05:09.640> soft<00:05:09.910> body<00:05:10.500> on

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
create the cube you enable soft body on

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.590 
create the cube you enable soft body on
the<00:05:11.890> plane<00:05:12.430> itself<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:13.120> need<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.420> enable

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
the plane itself you need to enable

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.040 
the plane itself you need to enable
deflection<00:05:14.290> and<00:05:15.300> that's<00:05:16.300> all<00:05:16.510> there<00:05:16.660> is<00:05:16.720> to<00:05:16.870> it

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
deflection and that's all there is to it

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.110 
deflection and that's all there is to it
ok<00:05:17.680> lesson<00:05:17.950> aids<00:05:18.220> pretty<00:05:18.520> simple<00:05:18.880> we're<00:05:19.000> going

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
ok lesson aids pretty simple we're going

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.340 
ok lesson aids pretty simple we're going
to<00:05:19.180> create<00:05:19.390> a<00:05:19.450> cube<00:05:19.750> we're<00:05:19.900> going<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.080> create<00:05:20.260> a

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
to create a cube we're going to create a

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.240 
to create a cube we're going to create a
plane<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.890> when<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:21.580> hit<00:05:21.760> all<00:05:21.790> a<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.720> cube

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
plane and when you hit all a the cube

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.100 
plane and when you hit all a the cube
should<00:05:24.250> go<00:05:24.400> rolling<00:05:24.670> down<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:25.120> plane<00:05:25.330> alright

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
should go rolling down the plane alright

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.220 
should go rolling down the plane alright
that's<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.920> for<00:05:26.980> lesson<00:05:27.340> eight<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:28.110> keep<00:05:29.110> an

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
that's it for lesson eight and keep an

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.660
