00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
lucky my run was definitely a

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.310 
lucky my run was definitely a
disappointment<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.570> me<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.930> wasn't<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
disappointment for me it wasn't what I

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.419 
disappointment for me it wasn't what I
was<00:00:25.439> hoping<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.330> I<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.990> felt<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.920> had

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
was hoping for and I I felt like I had

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.460 
was hoping for and I I felt like I had
blown<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.179> halfway<00:00:30.420> down<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> mountain<00:00:30.929> so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
blown it halfway down the mountain so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.420 
blown it halfway down the mountain so
it's<00:00:31.619> definitely<00:00:31.890> hard<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> keep<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
it's definitely hard to keep that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.910 
it's definitely hard to keep that
motivation<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.870> keep<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.079> hard<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
motivation to keep going hard all the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.459 
motivation to keep going hard all the
way<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> bottom<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.050> feel<00:00:37.230> really

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
way to the bottom so I just feel really

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.119 
way to the bottom so I just feel really
really<00:00:37.649> lucky<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:39.680> even<00:00:40.680> even

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
obviously you knew your bash but the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
obviously you knew your bash but the
course<00:00:48.930> changed<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> lot<00:00:49.829> since<00:00:50.129> yesterday

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
course changed a lot since yesterday

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
course changed a lot since yesterday
because<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.899> been<00:00:52.079> drying<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.680> day<00:00:52.860> how

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
because it's been drying up all day how

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.819 
because it's been drying up all day how
different<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.350> honestly<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.440> didn't

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
different was it honestly I didn't

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.459 
different was it honestly I didn't
really<00:00:55.920> notice<00:00:56.190> anything<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.870> dirt<00:00:58.079> was

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
really notice anything that the dirt was

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
really notice anything that the dirt was
it<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.890> stickier<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> bit<00:00:59.699> slippery<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.270> but

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it was stickier in a bit slippery or but

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.150 
it was stickier in a bit slippery or but
other<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
other than that I don't think that it's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.939 
other than that I don't think that it's
slower<00:01:02.520> faster<00:01:03.210> than<00:01:03.390> yesterday<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.170> think

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
slower faster than yesterday I think

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.940 
slower faster than yesterday I think
that<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.760> had<00:01:06.000> had<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> good<00:01:06.479> run<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.160 
it's an out-of-body experience when you
start<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.679> race<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.219> like<00:01:50.609> this<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.299> big<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
just think that I put a little too much

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.450 
just think that I put a little too much
pressure<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.780> myself<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.710> didn't<00:01:56.280> ride

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
pressure on myself and just didn't ride

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.630 
pressure on myself and just didn't ride
