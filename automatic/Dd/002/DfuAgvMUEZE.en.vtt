00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
longer people but they're a group there

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719

whatever you use the term and they're no
longer<00:02:02.969> human<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:04.890> more

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
longer human and you can then more

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.389 
longer human and you can then more
easily<00:02:06.149> kill<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.960> feel<00:02:07.259> less<00:02:07.560> guilt<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.069> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
easily kill and feel less guilt about it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.010 
easily kill and feel less guilt about it
so<00:02:09.060> those<00:02:09.539> two<00:02:09.840> things<00:02:10.110> added<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.709> to

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
so those two things added up to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.580 
so those two things added up to
me<00:02:11.140> thinking<00:02:11.680> what<00:02:12.460> can<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.300> do<00:02:13.360> with<00:02:14.080> my<00:02:14.110> time

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
me thinking what can I do with my time

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.160 
me thinking what can I do with my time
on<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.950> planet<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.610> try<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> stop<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.990> to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
on this planet to try to stop that to
