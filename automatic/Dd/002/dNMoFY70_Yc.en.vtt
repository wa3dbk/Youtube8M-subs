restoration is kind of useless because

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270

not really all that important if you

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.899 
not really all that important if you
couldn't<00:02:31.469> reload<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.250> would<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.579> much<00:02:32.879> more

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909
