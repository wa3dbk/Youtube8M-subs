00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.220 
kind of bunch it up and just twist it
I'm<00:01:15.880> not<00:01:16.090> really<00:01:16.240> concerned<00:01:16.510> about<00:01:16.810> how<00:01:17.080> it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
I'm not really concerned about how it

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.350 
I'm not really concerned about how it
looks<00:01:17.500> right<00:01:17.650> now<00:01:17.980> because<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:18.940> can<00:01:19.090> always

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
looks right now because I can always

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.220 
looks right now because I can always
modify<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.840> with<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:19.990> little<00:01:20.200> bit<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.410> hairspray

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
modify it with a little bit of hairspray

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.010 
modify it with a little bit of hairspray
so<00:01:23.230> I'm<00:01:23.350> just<00:01:23.500> kind<00:01:23.620> of<00:01:23.740> getting<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.100> up<00:01:24.340> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.750 
so I'm just kind of getting it up and
kind<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.110> piling<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.280> always<00:01:27.430> want<00:01:27.700> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.000 
kind of piling it you always want to
make<00:01:27.880> sure<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.630> it<00:01:28.750> cascades<00:01:29.320> down<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.950> you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
make sure that it cascades down and you

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.200 
make sure that it cascades down and you
have<00:01:30.160> a<00:01:30.190> little<00:01:30.460> bit<00:01:30.580> more<00:01:30.760> height<00:01:30.970> through

have a little bit more height through
here<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:32.140> don't<00:01:32.320> really<00:01:32.440> want<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.740> place<00:01:33.010> a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
here you don't really want to place a

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.650 
here you don't really want to place a
bunch<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.460> height<00:01:33.670> here<00:01:33.700> unless<00:01:34.180> you're<00:01:34.480> going

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
bunch of height here unless you're going
