over<00:00:57.149> training<00:00:57.390> program<00:00:57.870> while<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
over training program while I'm on this

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.500 
over training program while I'm on this
program<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.760> train<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> muscle<00:01:00.420> with

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
program can I not train a muscle with

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
program can I not train a muscle with
normal<00:01:00.780> hypertrophy<00:01:01.350> reps<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.770> sets<00:01:02.039> should

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
normal hypertrophy reps and sets should

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
normal hypertrophy reps and sets should
I<00:01:02.820> stop<00:01:03.180> doing<00:01:03.480> her<00:01:03.570> purse<00:01:03.809> resets<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.500> raps

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
I stop doing her purse resets and raps

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.870 
I stop doing her purse resets and raps
on<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.100> muscle<00:01:05.400> throughout<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> whole

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
on that muscle throughout the whole

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.600 
on that muscle throughout the whole
month<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.350> should<00:01:07.560> stop<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
month and if I should stop how can I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.980 
month and if I should stop how can I
avoid<00:01:08.729> hitting<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.240> muscle<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.630> other<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
avoid hitting that muscle to other I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
avoid hitting that muscle to other I
should<00:01:10.049> pretty<00:01:10.439> much<00:01:10.530> yes<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.490> too<00:01:11.580> many

of<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> can't<00:01:29.549> take<00:01:29.790> calculus<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
of like you can't take calculus but I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.420 
of like you can't take calculus but I
take<00:01:30.750> an<00:01:30.840> algebra<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:32.070> muscles

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
take an algebra right your muscles

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.620 
take an algebra right your muscles
cannot<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:32.880> grow<00:01:33.090> unless<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
cannot really grow unless they have a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
lot of number one a lot of nuclei right

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.789 
lot of number one a lot of nuclei right
muscle<00:01:36.540> cells<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.990> able<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:37.650> than

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
muscle cells are able to have more than

one nucleus plural is nuclear and I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.480 
one nucleus plural is nuclear and I
suppose<00:01:40.530> he's<00:01:40.619> put<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.130> starts

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
suppose he's put this and it starts

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.310 
suppose he's put this and it starts
right<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.450> there's<00:01:42.600> nuclei<00:01:42.840> come<00:01:43.110> from

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
right but there's nuclei come from

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
right but there's nuclei come from
satellite<00:01:43.799> cells<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.729> around<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
satellite cells that are around the

satellite cells that are around the
muscles<00:01:45.479> come<00:01:46.140> fuse<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> muscle<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
muscles come fuse with the muscle and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
muscles come fuse with the muscle and
donate<00:01:47.700> their<00:01:47.820> nucleus<00:01:48.119> away<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.689> also

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
donate their nucleus away we can also

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
donate their nucleus away we can also
show<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:49.890> nucleus<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
show so the more nucleus you have the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.210 
show so the more nucleus you have the
more<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:52.229> workers<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> more

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
more the more workers you have the more

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.710 
more the more workers you have the more
brain<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> muscle<00:01:53.970> has<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> more

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
brain and muscle has right the more

endless reps you pick a heavyweight I've

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.649 
endless reps you pick a heavyweight I've
see<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:58.980> first<00:02:59.219> set<00:02:59.430> my<00:03:00.030> reach<00:03:00.209> failure<00:03:00.419> at

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
see the first set my reach failure at

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.629 
see the first set my reach failure at
ten<00:03:00.840> or<00:03:00.959> twelve<00:03:01.169> cuz<00:03:01.319> it's<00:03:01.439> heavy<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:02.250> after

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
ten or twelve cuz it's heavy but after

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.250 
ten or twelve cuz it's heavy but after
that<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.939> don't<00:03:03.030> rest<00:03:03.329> for<00:03:03.569> thirty<00:03:03.840> second

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
that you don't rest for thirty second

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.390 
that you don't rest for thirty second
you<00:03:04.319> just<00:03:04.439> keep<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.799> right<00:03:05.189> I'm<00:03:05.310> sorry

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
you just keep going right I'm sorry

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.949 
you just keep going right I'm sorry
that's<00:03:05.579> what<00:03:05.669> endurance<00:03:06.090> comes<00:03:06.239> in<00:03:06.389> strength

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that's what endurance comes in strength

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.330 
that's what endurance comes in strength
endurance<00:03:07.169> so<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.739> start<00:03:07.919> off<00:03:07.980> with<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.159> heavy

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
endurance so you start off with a heavy

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.369 
endurance so you start off with a heavy
exercise<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:08.849> heavy<00:03:09.120> set<00:03:09.450> but<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.109> just

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
exercise a heavy set but you just

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.920 
exercise a heavy set but you just
continue<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.060> extend<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.150> set<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.750> keep

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
continue to extend that set to keep

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.770 
continue to extend that set to keep
going<00:03:13.349> drops<00:03:13.799> add<00:03:14.129> supersize<00:03:14.879> don't<00:03:15.480> give

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
going drops add supersize don't give

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.170 
going drops add supersize don't give
that<00:03:16.019> muscle<00:03:16.379> a<00:03:16.409> break<00:03:16.769> but<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.669> way<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:17.909> still

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
that muscle a break but the way to still

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.879 
that muscle a break but the way to still
has<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.900> keep<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.229> don't<00:03:19.319> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.650> keep

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
has to keep you don't want to just keep

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.339 
has to keep you don't want to just keep
doing<00:03:20.099> this<00:03:20.549> an<00:03:20.699> air<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.209> okay<00:03:21.659> big<00:03:21.870> triceps

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
doing this an air and okay big triceps

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.789 
doing this an air and okay big triceps
so<00:03:23.069> resistance<00:03:23.729> and<00:03:24.000> endurance<00:03:24.989> keep<00:03:25.199> going

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
so resistance and endurance keep going

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.289 
so resistance and endurance keep going
going<00:03:26.040> going<00:03:26.280> once<00:03:26.519> again<00:03:26.699> I<00:03:26.790> discovered<00:03:27.239> this

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
going going once again I discovered this

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.119 
going going once again I discovered this
by<00:03:27.449> accident<00:03:27.690> science<00:03:28.409> came<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.799> proved<00:03:28.979> this

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
by accident science came and proved this

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.909 
by accident science came and proved this
like<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.340> year<00:03:29.370> later<00:03:29.699> right<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:31.199> it<00:03:31.319> works<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
like a year later right but it works and

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:32.960 
like a year later right but it works and
what's<00:03:32.040> gonna<00:03:32.129> happen<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.489> you're<00:03:32.519> not<00:03:32.699> you're

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
what's gonna happen is you're not you're

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.789 
what's gonna happen is you're not you're
not<00:03:33.030> gonna<00:03:33.150> build<00:03:33.569> muscle<00:03:34.139> doing<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:34.500> month

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
not gonna build muscle doing that month

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.379 
not gonna build muscle doing that month
right<00:03:35.069> but<00:03:35.549> once<00:03:35.760> again<00:03:35.819> you're<00:03:36.000> gonna<00:03:36.060> build

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
right but once again you're gonna build

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.479 
right but once again you're gonna build
the<00:03:36.629> prerequisite<00:03:37.319> much<00:03:37.620> almost<00:03:37.859> a<00:03:38.040> monocle

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
the prerequisite much almost a monocle

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.640 
the prerequisite much almost a monocle
is<00:03:38.549> more<00:03:38.699> mitochondria<00:03:38.849> blah<00:03:39.479> blah<00:03:39.629> blah<00:03:39.780> then

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
is more mitochondria blah blah blah then

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.219 
is more mitochondria blah blah blah then
after<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.220> month<00:03:41.430> overtraining<00:03:42.019> if<00:03:43.019> the

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229
