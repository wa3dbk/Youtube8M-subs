00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.620 
plate bowl things you can see they're
really<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.840> shallow<00:01:37.729> i<00:01:38.729> thought<00:01:39.479> they'd

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
really really shallow i thought they'd

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.510 
really really shallow i thought they'd
be<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.930> perfect<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.619> when<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.930> like

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
be like perfect for when we have like

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.950 
be like perfect for when we have like
stews<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.549> stuff<00:01:44.970> instead<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.450> putting<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
stews and stuff instead of putting on a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.870 
stews and stuff instead of putting on a
plate<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.290> our<00:01:46.979> bowls<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.729> really

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
plate and our bowls are really really

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.460 
plate and our bowls are really really
deep<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.450> i<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.869> would<00:01:49.049> actually<00:01:49.170> work

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
deep so i think this would actually work

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.730 
deep so i think this would actually work
better<00:01:50.149> generally<00:01:51.149> i<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.290> how
