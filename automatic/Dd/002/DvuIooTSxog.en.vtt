00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello everyone as promised today vi 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.430
 I make a short video 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.050
 of how to use the application there 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.270
 allows to apply the slow effect 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.500
 motion on our recorded videos 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.840
 the application as you can see yes 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.490
 called video breakdown is once 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.760
 installed 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.160
 and open we will be able to record our own 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.810
 video to then apply the slow effect 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.349
 motion in this case I will show you 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.529
 the test on the recorded video 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.360
 and uploaded to youtube for precisely 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.680
 capture a video we could click 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.470
 on the top right icon and note 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.840
 clicking on this button we will be able to 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.490
 start recording i now you 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.220
 I do the test right away that I already have 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.060
 registered that once opened we will have to 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.580
 go to click analyze e button 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.559
 here we will have our application there 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.220
 allows to apply the slow effect 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.960
 motion 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.000
 as he showed in b as I have you 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.580
 shown in the previous video 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.119
 we could with this right wheel 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:10.220
 send the video back and forth like 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.770
 you can see or send it forward e 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.820
 use this button to apply 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.240
 the slow motion effect 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.460
 when when we want or so how 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.350
 you can see I'm applying and removing 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.710
 the slow motion fact in order to make you 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.630
 see for a moment the effect is more 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.950
 also in the video we could also ad 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.450
 apply the lines exactly to the flec 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.150
 so as to make the effect more 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.610
 evident if we also want a 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.860
 circle now I'll show you 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.920
 quickly right what you can do with 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.500
 this application is obviously for 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 record our video now me 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.250
 I did it without recording that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.170
 that I was doing but let's go back a 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.810
 moment back without saving it 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.050
 let's do a little analyze if we do 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.450
 click on this button on the left 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.569
 say that this button to the left that 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.900
 will start to record the actions you 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.090
 we are going to do to get the effect 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.550
 slow motion we will get a second video 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.710
 that indeed 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.900
 where the effect will be applied 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.060
 slow motion should be seen quickly 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.319
 I apply the recording I play 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.090
 Meanwhile, maybe I want to apply one 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.520
 row an arrow and at this time in 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.910
 which trigger the cat you want to apply 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:49.700
 the slow motion effect 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:03:10.340
 ok now I stop before I save it 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:12.500
 and now we will have our video now 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.570
 I delete this anyway I hope to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.510
 to have been clear on how to use 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.640
 the application in the description of the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.450
 video find the link to download 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.790
 the app is a short review 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.209
 on the application I hope there has been 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.140
 that's useful for the moment 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.140
 to the next
