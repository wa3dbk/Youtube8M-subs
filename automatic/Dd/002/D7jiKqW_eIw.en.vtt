for<00:00:52.289> Rilakkuma<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.960> outline

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
for Rilakkuma and you see that outline

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.920 
for Rilakkuma and you see that outline
like<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> bear<00:00:56.039> head<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.460> made<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> myself<00:00:57.300> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
like the bear head I made it myself I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
like the bear head I made it myself I
didn't<00:00:58.410> use<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> cookie<00:00:58.949> cutter<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.250> mold<00:00:59.699> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
didn't use a cookie cutter or mold so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630 
didn't use a cookie cutter or mold so
that's<00:01:00.090> why<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.690> uneven<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that's why it's kind of uneven and it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.910 
that's why it's kind of uneven and it
doesn't<00:01:03.000> look<00:01:03.149> its<00:01:03.449> best<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.619> okay<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
doesn't look its best but it's okay I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.450 
doesn't look its best but it's okay I
guess<00:01:05.299> um<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> made<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.590> other<00:01:07.890> baking
