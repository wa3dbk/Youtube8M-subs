haven't<00:00:20.279> made<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> video<00:00:20.869> because<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.230> just

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
haven't made a video because I just

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.460

it's<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> joke<00:01:18.689> because

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it's just kind of like a joke because

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.740 
it's just kind of like a joke because
it's<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.229> small<00:01:19.640> now<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> might<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.420> able<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it's so small now you might be able to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's so small now you might be able to
see<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.159> front<00:01:23.640> turret<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
see that the front turret I'm not the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
see that the front turret I'm not the
star<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.320> observation<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.220> navigation<00:01:26.909> bomb

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
star the observation and navigation bomb

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.100

sorry<00:01:28.110> bomb<00:01:28.409> droppers<00:01:30.740> clear<00:01:31.740> piece<00:01:32.070> is

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
sorry bomb droppers clear piece is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.679 
sorry bomb droppers clear piece is
actually<00:01:34.110> kind<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.710> messy<00:01:35.430> another<00:01:36.180> reason

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
actually kind of messy another reason

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.289 
actually kind of messy another reason
that<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:38.030> because<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:41.189> solution<00:01:41.939> i<00:01:42.060> use

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that is because the the solution i use

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.010 
that is because the the solution i use
to<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> decals<00:01:43.320> off<00:01:44.659> because<00:01:45.659> these

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to get the decals off because these

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.429 
to get the decals off because these
pieces<00:01:46.380> came<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> mom<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.899> what's<00:01:49.259> it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
pieces came from a mom the what's it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.010 
pieces came from a mom the what's it
called<00:01:49.649> set<00:01:50.869> gunship<00:01:51.869> set<00:01:52.200> i<00:01:54.020> accidentally

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
called set gunship set i accidentally

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.219 
called set gunship set i accidentally
left<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.600> instead<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> forgetting<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
left it on and instead of forgetting to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.410 
left it on and instead of forgetting to
wipe<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.590> off<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.430> became<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.180> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
wipe it off so it became like that so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
wipe it off so it became like that so
that's<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.110> problem<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.770> not

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that's just a little problem it's not

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.060 
that's just a little problem it's not
too<00:02:02.130> bad<00:02:02.310> though<00:02:02.960> moving<00:02:03.960> down<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.890> like

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
too bad though moving down I really like

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.620 
too bad though moving down I really like
how<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.340> windshield<00:02:05.820> came<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.540> we

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
how the windshield came out and then we

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.749 
how the windshield came out and then we
have<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> windows<00:02:07.200> side<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.700> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
have the windows side I think that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.040 
have the windows side I think that
really<00:02:09.050> imitates<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> b70

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
really imitates the b70

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.000 
really imitates the b70
look<00:02:11.550> um<00:02:14.100> now<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.640> know<00:02:16.210> this<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.260> kind<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
look um now I know this is kind of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.720 
look um now I know this is kind of
strange<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.960> regular<00:02:20.680> b-17<00:02:21.460> there's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
looks really good it's just kind of hard

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.979 
looks really good it's just kind of hard
to<00:03:42.040> capture<00:03:42.280> at<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.670> camera<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.209> just<00:03:43.660> get<00:03:43.840> that

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
to capture at the camera I just get that

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.380 
to capture at the camera I just get that
on<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.260> ground<00:03:44.470> again<00:03:47.970> right<00:03:48.970> now<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.360> kind

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
on the ground again right now it's kind

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.900 
on the ground again right now it's kind
of<00:03:49.600> slopped<00:03:50.130> sloping<00:03:51.130> because<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.580> haven't

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
of slopped sloping because I haven't

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.560 
of slopped sloping because I haven't
perfected<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.630> wing<00:03:52.810> design<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.920> they<00:03:54.070> really

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
perfected the wing design so they really

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.100 
perfected the wing design so they really
don't<00:03:55.570> really<00:03:55.840> support<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.320> aircraft<00:03:58.110> that's

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
don't really support the aircraft that's

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.930 
don't really support the aircraft that's
where<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.500> landing<00:04:00.010> gear<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.459> landing<00:04:00.820> gear

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
where the landing gear the landing gear

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.300 
where the landing gear the landing gear
just<00:04:01.150> not<00:04:01.420> finished<00:04:01.900> at<00:04:02.080> all<00:04:02.290> because<00:04:02.950> right

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
just not finished at all because right

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.130 
just not finished at all because right
now<00:04:03.340> they're<00:04:03.700> pushing<00:04:04.150> backwards<00:04:04.420> they

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
now they're pushing backwards they

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.130 
now they're pushing backwards they
should<00:04:05.350> be<00:04:05.500> pushing<00:04:05.739> forwards<00:04:06.989> so<00:04:07.989> that's

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
should be pushing forwards so that's

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.979 
should be pushing forwards so that's
kind<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.530> problem<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:09.190> then<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.540> engines

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
kind of a problem and then the engines

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.449 
kind of a problem and then the engines
just<00:04:11.230> don't<00:04:11.470> have<00:04:11.620> their<00:04:11.769> engines<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.250> yet

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
just don't have their engines in yet

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.430 
just don't have their engines in yet
because<00:04:14.100> yeah<00:04:15.100> they<00:04:15.340> just<00:04:15.459> don't<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:17.140> sorry
