00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
so I don't know really why you would do

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.110 
so I don't know really why you would do
that<00:02:10.979> unless<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.520> rolling<00:02:11.910> your

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that unless you really rolling your

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.960 
that unless you really rolling your
buddy<00:02:12.590> because<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:14.220> gives<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> more<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
buddy because it gives you more of a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.640 
buddy because it gives you more of a
disadvantage<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.350> chain<00:02:16.620> and
