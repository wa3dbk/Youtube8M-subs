00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.220
 hi everyone is welcome on the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.019
 Orange Blossom 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.790
 so today it's a recipe that 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.559
 likes a lot of hadiths or chocolate 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 it's the famous word and the fluent 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.070
 chocolate 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.529
 video recipe you'll see it 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 is fast and easy for a result 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.880
 very greedy one must start with 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.119
 turn on the oven to preheat it to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.640
 240 Â° and melt 150 g of chocolate 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.649
 with the butter cut in parcels with 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 bain marie or in the microwave 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 after we start whipping the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.680
 whole eggs with sugar until 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.680
 that the mixture whitens 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.380
 the waters have white and with the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.340
 sugar I'm adding flour of which more 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.700
 tablespoons 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.890
 I mix and after I incorporate the 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.600
 melted chocolate with butter 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.400
 continuing to mix forever to 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.400
 have a very homogeneous preparation 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.050
 I have already prepared this little mussel 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.450
 individual that I swore to avoid 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.430
 that the words and the collar I'm going to them 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.650
 fill a three-quarter with my 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.050
 chocolate preparation and at this stage one 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.240
 can leave them in the fridge and at the moment 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.940
 to serve them m 2 squares of chocolate to 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.470
 center of each ramekin and bake 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.120
 to cook for 10 minutes in 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.330
 the place of dark chocolate we can also 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.820
 put chocolate praline or 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.820
 white chocolate why not there then our 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.830
 small hamlets and are already ready on 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.390

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.880
