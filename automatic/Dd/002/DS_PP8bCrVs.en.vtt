 the car even with the heat wave that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.420
 summer promises only air conditioning

 pull the air out or inside the car 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.979
 on the highways leave disabled so that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.500
 the interior air is renewed 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.540
 already in the city or on the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.840
 earth that connects the system so that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.960
 dust or pollution between ducts and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.180

 if the car is exposed to the sun open 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.210
 the windows before 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.700
 the mass of hot air is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 environment and the car gets cooler with

 more speed and attention 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.200
 chemical cleaning of air conditioning 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.170
 annually for this reason. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.420
 important is every 15 days in the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.910
 recirculated to sign the hot air in the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.489
 maximum with maximum ventilation 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.380

 conditioned three minutes before 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.730
 reach the destination 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.430
 keeping it connected to air ventilation 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.560
 natural strong but like not all 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.930
 world has air conditioning in the car if 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.000
 to get on the road the best tip is 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.670
 open the windows because the fan 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.320
 then it will not make much difference 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.310
 the air coming out of it is at the temperature 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.890
 environment and more car care in the heat 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.230
 is as important as everything that was 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.700
 spoken so far it is important to 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.740
 your mechanic and ask him to check 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 if everything is legal with the system of 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.210
 cooling it is important that they be 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.340
 views hoses water pump radiator 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.590
 all components that are part of the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.180
 motor cooling has shown that it is not only 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.180
 people who need to freshen up
