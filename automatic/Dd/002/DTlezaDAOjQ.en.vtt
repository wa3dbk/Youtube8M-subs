00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
was losing clearly during the first ten

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.630 

I<00:02:34.810> went<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.230> dock<00:02:36.440> Santa<00:02:36.830> Cruz<00:02:37.160> out<00:02:37.370> there

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
I went on the dock Santa Cruz out there

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.300 
I went on the dock Santa Cruz out there
in<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> guide<00:02:38.180> him<00:02:38.930> will<00:02:39.110> be<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:40.040> wait

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
in the guide him will be up and wait

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.920 
in the guide him will be up and wait
this<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.850> not<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.420> add<00:02:41.540> five<00:02:41.750> pounds

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
this is not going to add five pounds

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.510 
this is not going to add five pounds
it's<00:02:42.200> not<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.530> much<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.950> difference

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
it's not that much of a difference

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.420 
it's not that much of a difference
weight<00:02:44.300> does<00:02:44.600> not<00:02:44.630> win<00:02:45.020> things<00:02:45.320> maybe<00:02:45.800> size

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
weight does not win things maybe size

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.850 
weight does not win things maybe size
difference<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.360> more<00:02:47.540> often<00:02:47.720> weight<00:02:48.140> losses

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
difference and more often weight losses

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.260 
difference and more often weight losses
fights<00:02:49.190> when<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.760> fighter

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
fights when a fighter

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.470 
fights when a fighter
trains<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.410> make<00:02:51.740> way<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.640> gets<00:02:52.820> weak<00:02:53.060> think

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
trains to make way it gets weak think

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.760 
trains to make way it gets weak think
the<00:02:53.630> power<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:53.990> going<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.170> come<00:02:54.230> up<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:54.620> us

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
the power is going to come up with us

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.010 
the power is going to come up with us
and<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.130> think<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.460> will<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.910> stay<00:02:56.300> out<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.960> the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
and I think it will not stay out in the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.410 
and I think it will not stay out in the
lay<00:02:57.200> around<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.510> think<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.900> have<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:01.040> lot<00:03:01.370> of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
lay around but I think I have a lot of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.870 
lay around but I think I have a lot of
advantage<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.930> him<00:03:03.080> like<00:03:03.620> speed<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.370> power

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
advantage to him like speed and power

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.510 
advantage to him like speed and power
experience<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.170> personally<00:03:07.070> did<00:03:07.280> everything

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
experience I personally did everything

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.940

that<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.790> possibly<00:03:08.240> could<00:03:09.050> do<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.440> prepare

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
that I possibly could do to prepare

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.920 
that I possibly could do to prepare
