00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.260
 they say that this island will change you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.390
 that behind the beauty lurks a darkness 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.610
 a describable 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.020
 you have lost in those you loved 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.470
 you think you have what you have to have 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.790
 to kill and you will doubt your consumption the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:32.510
 pain will stop when Jason Bourne and die 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.850
 I want to go home the fact is that I do not 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.610
 I 've brought you here has focused here by 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.030
 your fucking will and now here you are 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.160
 trapped like a rat mound 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.539
 hello friends must 40 my name is pablo 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.399
 AdriÃ¡n emerges from the product of Far Cry 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.079
 welcome to the hard days 2012 is 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.879
 saying this is simple are three friends are 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.070
 a desert island and they are going to spend it 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.860
 well they are going to drink they are going to enjoy 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.780
 beaches go girls were guys that 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.729
 It really is a little fun but 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.769
 they realize that there is something on the island 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.300
 what they expected us to say are abducted 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.159
 three send one of them and they stay 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.200
 Two a girl and a boy Jason Wright 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.490
 are you the protagonist and nicky who is 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.110
 the girl that stays with you goes with him with 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.090
 the pirate team what is the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.950
 development of the game is to get 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.780
 rescue the one that you have managed to escape and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.700
 the whole game takes place in trying 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.149
 rescue nicky from the pirate camp and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.770
 especially 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.929
 you also have another differentiating theme 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.130
 of the game is dementia that is to say apart 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.460
 of realizing the protagonists have 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.200
 an island where there are people of mind the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.550
 people are a little thrown on everything 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.320
 the protagonist more 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.260
 you have to try to survive the island 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 say many times you're playing chunks 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.220
 who does not know if it really is a dream what 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960
 what you are playing is real is not real in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.060
 what exact degree there are many times that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.190
 you have to play dirty and survive and if 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.780
 you were alone on an island like what 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.880
 that you would do to survive in the background that 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.730
 is the question that you would make clean I do not 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.470
 all the world 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.780
 out of campaign say all that is already 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.870
 cooperative multiplayer mode is very 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.340
 powerful brings about 30 hours 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.510
 of extra play to individual mode is 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.730
 which is very powerful apart from 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.050
 cooperative there is a story the mode 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.630
 cooperative are roughly 10 hours 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.040
 of the game if it's a totally story 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.110
 out of the individual mode and it is created 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.330
 a story with different characters and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.310
 it would be a story totally alien to what 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.780
 what is the course to plot line 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.280
 of the reality game like so that three 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.420
 in part of the game we have returned to the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.430
 origins we have returned to the tropical island 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.220
 but since there's one that really 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.960
 it's something that the fans loved and 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.340
 the users let there in the 2 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.380
 We try to innovate by going to Africa and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.600
 create a different taste story but 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.220
 really the origins and what impacted 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.210
 and what he liked was the beauty of the island 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.460
 of 4 and 1 and we have returned to that is in 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.960
 around that setting a part of a 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.020
 a little careless about the switches 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.780
 both visos and competition is the 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.310
 variety of gameplay style at the end is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.170
 move forward and shoot but there is no 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.490
 clear variety so that 3 if we have 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.980
 I tried to open a little more this 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.810
 fan and as you well say then catch 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.700
 cars for catching paragliding water bikes 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.510
 after 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 in boats of 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.709
 outboard since really the way of 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.599
 move in a shooter especially in 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.519
 an open world as farcry is 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.099
 difficult and we have to prevent it from being 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.420
 monotonous in the displacements and what 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.560
 it has been achieved with part three what 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.969
 we have tried is that those 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.349
 displacements and that this variety does not 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.209
 Always move from one place to another 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.640
 how was it for them in a car 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.400
 but you can choose three four five 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.629
 six different ways to move from 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.980
 point to point the objective of the 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.049
 videos with faults is that it is the vessel 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.349
 Route badge as each brand has 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.329
 his shooter and about missing and it 's fried it 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.560
 falls in sales has been the most shooter 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.720
 sold was that there are two can shooter 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.769
 most sold by ubisoft when it came out and 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.139
 what he lacked vision is to have a 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.060
 shooter although we support ourselves be 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.050
 recognizable and be at the same level of 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.620
 competition 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.870
 to this day never since he has 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.120
 there was a release per year without more 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.630
 good have passed 34 years of us or 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.980
 be that looking 34 years ahead do not you 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.140
 I can give visibility in that sense 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.180
 because the feet in another but the reality 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.010
 is that we do not know but good really 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.040
 a new generation consoles 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.180
 any shooter in the end what is going to 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.760
 bring the new generation of consoles 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.890
 especially to be a graphic quality 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.590
 amazing always attracts up to the top 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.940
 of the graphic quality I suppose that with 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.340
 a new generation of consoles we can 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.739
 we are hallucinated are friends to see in 40 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.800
 there is little left of November 21 on 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.060
 launch of packages we hope not 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.870
 go to stores you buy it on 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.530
 everything that you enjoy a lot 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.400
 You know I'm not crazy but you do 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:42.840
 jumped son of a bitch pulls the trigger 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.840
 shoot me you are me and I am you
