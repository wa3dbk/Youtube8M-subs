00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
calling about fitting these bits that I

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.740 
calling about fitting these bits that I
thought<00:00:11.460> I'd<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> video<00:00:12.000> because<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.509> much

just<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.770> work<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.310> around<00:01:33.320> slowly

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
just have to work your way around slowly

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.300 
just have to work your way around slowly
prising<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> over<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> top<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.100> it's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
prising it over the top see now it's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
prising it over the top see now it's
actually<00:01:39.000> sitting<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:39.420> better<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.140> let

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
actually sitting a bit better I can let

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.490 
actually sitting a bit better I can let
go<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.650> first<00:01:40.920> end<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:43.079> work<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
go that first end and then just work it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.670 
go that first end and then just work it
all<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:43.860> around<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.259> go

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
all the way around and there we go

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.710 
all the way around and there we go
snapped<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.939> give<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> light<00:01:48.420> push

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
snapped on just give it a light push

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.359 
snapped on just give it a light push
just<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.079> check<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> way<00:01:50.130> home

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
just to check there is all the way home

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.780 
just to check there is all the way home
now<00:01:51.240> since<00:01:51.990> I've<00:01:52.110> got<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> stripped<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.700> we've

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
now since I've got it stripped and we've

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.039 
now since I've got it stripped and we've
got<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> lot<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> people<00:01:54.329> asking<00:01:54.540> about<00:01:54.600> taking

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
got a lot of people asking about taking

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.740 
got a lot of people asking about taking
it<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:55.670> I'll<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:57.030> whip<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> back<00:01:57.450> off<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it off I'll just whip it back off and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.830 
it off I'll just whip it back off and
then<00:01:57.840> pop<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.259> again<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:58.649> well<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> best

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
then pop it on again as well the best

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.050

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.620 
and yellow dots on there on a little
cable<00:03:48.650> mechanism<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.540> look<00:03:50.690> on<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.990> hob

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
cable mechanism if you look on the hob

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.340 
cable mechanism if you look on the hob
just<00:03:53.630> here<00:03:53.840> you've<00:03:54.020> got<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.730> little<00:03:55.940> red<00:03:56.060> dots

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
just here you've got the little red dots

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.520 
just here you've got the little red dots
all<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.650> red<00:03:57.770> dots<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.840> plastic<00:03:59.840> cable

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
all the red dots on the plastic cable

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.270 
all the red dots on the plastic cable
mechanism<00:04:01.160> need<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.700> line<00:04:01.850> up<00:04:02.030> with<00:04:02.180> those<00:04:03.280> so

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
mechanism need to line up with those so

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.250 
mechanism need to line up with those so
it'll<00:04:04.459> just<00:04:04.490> slip<00:04:04.910> down<00:04:05.090> on<00:04:05.390> when<00:04:05.959> they're<00:04:06.140> all

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
it'll just slip down on when they're all

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.030 
it'll just slip down on when they're all
lined<00:04:06.560> up<00:04:08.110> it'll<00:04:09.110> actually<00:04:09.200> slot<00:04:09.590> down<00:04:09.740> far

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
lined up it'll actually slot down far

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.460 
lined up it'll actually slot down far
enough<00:04:10.480> can't<00:04:11.480> do<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.720> open<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.020> up<00:04:12.050> like<00:04:12.260> that

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
enough can't do it open it up like that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.640 
enough can't do it open it up like that
there<00:04:12.739> we<00:04:12.860> go<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.510> now<00:04:14.660> all<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.320> dots<00:04:15.500> are

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
there we go so now all the dots are

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.460 
there we go so now all the dots are
lined<00:04:15.800> up<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.310> slipped<00:04:16.609> down<00:04:17.320> then<00:04:18.320> you

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
lined up and it slipped down then you

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.400 
lined up and it slipped down then you
take<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:19.459> locking<00:04:19.790> piece<00:04:20.200> line<00:04:21.200> up<00:04:21.380> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
take the locking piece line up the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.750 
take the locking piece line up the
yellow<00:04:21.799> dot<00:04:22.390> with<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.419> other<00:04:23.720> yellow<00:04:23.900> dot<00:04:24.200> and

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
yellow dot with the other yellow dot and

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.570 
yellow dot with the other yellow dot and
then<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:26.020> twist<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.320> lock<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.830> then

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
then just twist it to lock and then

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.700 
then just twist it to lock and then
that's<00:04:28.790> fitted<00:04:29.210> you're<00:04:29.870> all<00:04:29.990> done<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:30.500> just

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
that's fitted you're all done you just

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.290 
that's fitted you're all done you just
need<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.950> work<00:04:31.100> out<00:04:31.310> which<00:04:31.490> non<00:04:31.700> turn<00:04:31.910> wash<00:04:32.150> is

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
need to work out which non turn wash is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.130 
need to work out which non turn wash is
using<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.930> mount<00:04:33.530> in<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.890> frame
