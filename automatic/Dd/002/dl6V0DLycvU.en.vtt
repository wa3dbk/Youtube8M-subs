pretty<00:01:10.070> good<00:01:10.250> option<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.850> those<00:01:11.240> conditions

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
pretty good option in those conditions

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.710 
pretty good option in those conditions
as<00:01:11.840> well<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.410> of<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.560> design<00:01:13.009> with<00:01:13.250> the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
as well because of the design with the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.690 
as well because of the design with the
amount<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.929> tread<00:01:15.590> grooves<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:16.039> are<00:01:16.100> in<00:01:16.369> both

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
amount of tread grooves that are in both

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.790 
amount of tread grooves that are in both
the<00:01:16.880> front<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.420> rear<00:01:17.509> of<00:01:17.690> these<00:01:18.140> tires<00:01:18.470> I
