00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
the ground and hang them on the tree we

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.330 
the ground and hang them on the tree we
won't<00:01:17.160> even<00:01:17.310> need<00:01:17.580> any<00:01:18.390> twine<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.900> anything

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
won't even need any twine or anything
this<00:01:20.340> time<00:01:20.550> of<00:01:20.670> year<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.540> dead<00:01:21.750> stuff<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
this time of year all this dead stuff is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
this time of year all this dead stuff is
fragile<00:01:22.980> enough<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.760> break<00:01:23.910> it<00:01:24.060> off

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
fragile enough we can just break it off

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.350 
fragile enough we can just break it off
by<00:01:24.330> hand<00:01:24.480> and<00:01:24.720> that's<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:25.020> easy<00:01:25.140> building

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
by hand and that's pretty easy building

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
by hand and that's pretty easy building
so<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.480> we've<00:01:27.690> got<00:01:27.900> our<00:01:28.110> main<00:01:28.950> structure<00:01:29.580> we

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
so now we've got our main structure we

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.250 
so now we've got our main structure we
stuck<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> sticks<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:30.780> ground<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
stuck the sticks in the ground and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.050 
stuck the sticks in the ground and
they're<00:01:31.350> holding<00:01:31.620> up<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.830> base<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.910> we're

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
they're holding up the base what we're

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.310 
they're holding up the base what we're
gonna<00:01:33.180> do<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.720> we're<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.050> get<00:01:34.140> some
