00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.720
 new advertising in the press does not freeze 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.249
 the fact that they came up with how they think a joke 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.619
 original words as a place of words they 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.579
 emit therefore decided to remember 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.989

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.460
 is only one desire for something 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.240
 to change 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.190
 but sometimes I feel that her percy ad 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.390
 words should look like this in 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.390
 performance 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.180
 I'm sure 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.880
 money in caps 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.270

 so that this thing Teplinskaya even dior 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499
 joked about what they lack 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.499
 the letter m is not the word 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.300
 casual communication is much closer to 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.160

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.329

 say what the experts thought 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.909
 but the main thing is musical advertising
