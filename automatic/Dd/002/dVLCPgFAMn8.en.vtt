00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.950

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.720

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.720

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.920
 I have the ingredients ready here 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 already chopped all in cubes in small 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.640
 cubes I have the nopales the onion in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
 sliced ​​the garlic well minced the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.790
 tomato in cubes and chilies 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.699
 serranos 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.160
 Now let's fry in a pan the 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.340
 onion and garlic you can use 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.809
 the oil that you prefer is at 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.059
 taste let's perfectly fry the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.520
 onion so that we have a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.829
 transparent color that is not very 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.210
 When cooked, do not burn them. 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.010
 to stay like this more or less 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.070
 It is not very cooked but it is not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.100
 raw very well now we are going to add 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 the tomato 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.259
 and the chile 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.799
 let's perfectly mix these 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.619
 ingredients you have to be moving 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.979
 so that we are not going to paste the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.979
 tomato 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.510
 as soon as the tomato is cooked 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.210
 we are going to add the nopales I put 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.960
 boil the nopales with enough water 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.900
 a teaspoon of baking soda and salt 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.119
 the bicarbonate is going to help you 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.159
 the nopal wand is less and it's going to 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.290
 To give a lot of color the cactus will come out very 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.229
 green is going to look very nice them 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.320
 I recommend that you put that teaspoon 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.270
 of baking mix we have to move 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.130
 perfectly all this so that it 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.130
 can integrate all the ingredients 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.190
 and now let's season our nopales 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.900

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.450
 add table salt I'm using 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.670
 grain salt but it is optional is to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 taste and if you prefer you can 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.920

 cook for about 10 minutes and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.080
