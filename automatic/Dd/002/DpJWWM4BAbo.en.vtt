00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
hey guys the subject of today's tutorial

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.360 
hey guys the subject of today's tutorial
is<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.669> be<00:00:02.820> full<00:00:03.090> with<00:00:03.270> content<00:00:03.780> columns

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
is going to be full with content columns

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.519 
is going to be full with content columns
switching<00:00:05.370> on<00:00:05.490> over<00:00:05.730> into<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.029> test<00:00:06.240> site

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
switching on over into the test site

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.509 
switching on over into the test site
I've<00:00:07.529> already<00:00:07.740> created<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.069> page<00:00:08.280> that

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
I've already created a page that

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.430 
I've already created a page that
contains<00:00:08.670> three<00:00:09.210> columns<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.870> some<00:00:10.260> dummy

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
contains three columns and some dummy

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.799 
contains three columns and some dummy
data<00:00:10.530> now<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:11.639> for<00:00:11.759> some<00:00:11.880> brief<00:00:12.059> history<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
data now just for some brief history the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.990 
data now just for some brief history the
actual<00:00:13.290> row<00:00:13.679> type<00:00:13.950> full<00:00:14.250> width<00:00:14.400> content<00:00:14.880> has

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
actual row type full width content has

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.120 
actual row type full width content has
been<00:00:15.179> around<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.719> since<00:00:15.960> version<00:00:16.170> 3.0<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
been around and since version 3.0 the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.580 
been around and since version 3.0 the
only<00:00:18.060> real<00:00:18.210> use<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.810> until<00:00:19.080> now<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.439> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
only real use of it up until now is to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
only real use of it up until now is to
essentially<00:00:19.980> allow<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.670> element<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> expand

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
essentially allow one element to expand

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.290 
essentially allow one element to expand
the<00:00:21.869> full<00:00:22.080> width<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> browser<00:00:22.920> window

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
the full width of the browser window

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.849 
the full width of the browser window
this<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.539> useful<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:25.050> things<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.320> placing

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
this was useful for things like placing

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.740 
this was useful for things like placing
full<00:00:26.070> width<00:00:26.220> map<00:00:26.490> elements<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.539> far<00:00:27.720> as

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
full width map elements but as far as

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.480 
full width map elements but as far as
the<00:00:27.930> columns<00:00:28.260> were<00:00:28.380> concerned<00:00:28.769> there<00:00:29.340> was

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the columns were concerned there was

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070 
the columns were concerned there was
just<00:00:29.699> not<00:00:29.820> enough<00:00:30.119> functionality<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.840> place

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
just not enough functionality in place

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
just not enough functionality in place
to<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
to really make use of it now with the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020 
to really make use of it now with the
addition<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> column<00:00:34.829> padding<00:00:35.309> options<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
addition of column padding options and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
addition of column padding options and
background<00:00:36.480> color<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.930> image<00:00:37.230> options<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
background color and image options you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.040 
background color and image options you
can<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.730> make<00:00:38.879> some<00:00:38.910> unique<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> exciting

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
can really make some unique and exciting

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.350 
can really make some unique and exciting
layouts<00:00:40.590> using<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> full<00:00:41.550> width<00:00:41.700> content<00:00:42.210> row

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
layouts using the full width content row

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
layouts using the full width content row
type<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:44.670> not

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
type so right now I have actually not

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.700 
type so right now I have actually not
turned<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> road<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.809> full<00:00:45.960> width<00:00:46.110> content<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
turned the road to full width content it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
turned the road to full width content it
is<00:00:46.770> still<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> basic<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.910> container<00:00:48.660> row

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is still on the basic in container row

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.979 
is still on the basic in container row
type<00:00:49.230> which<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> standard<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:51.809> can

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
type which is the standard and we can

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.779 
type which is the standard and we can
now<00:00:52.199> take<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> look<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.219> what<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> would<00:00:53.760> look

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
now take a look at what this would look

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
now take a look at what this would look
like<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.780> front<00:00:57.050> as<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like on the front as you can see it's a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.930 
like on the front as you can see it's a
pretty<00:00:58.770> standard<00:00:59.190> layout<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.730> three

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
pretty standard layout we have three

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.580 
pretty standard layout we have three
columns<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.510> some<00:01:00.660> dummy<00:01:00.870> text<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
columns with some dummy text in and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
columns with some dummy text in and
we're<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.699> change<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.120> into

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
we're going to change this into

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.109 
we're going to change this into
something<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:03.899> exciting<00:01:04.409> quickly<00:01:05.119> going

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
something pretty exciting quickly going

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.170 
something pretty exciting quickly going
back<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> admin<00:01:07.049> panel<00:01:08.150> we<00:01:09.150> can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
back over to the admin panel we can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
back over to the admin panel we can
start<00:01:09.600> by<00:01:09.869> editing<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.409> row<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.830> these

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
start by editing the row that these

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
start by editing the row that these
columns<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.490> contained<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.360> switching

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
columns are contained in and switching

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.920 
columns are contained in and switching
the<00:01:13.049> type<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.470> full<00:01:13.710> width<00:01:13.830> content<00:01:14.930> upon

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the type to full width content upon

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.240 
the type to full width content upon
selecting<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.500> option<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.070> see

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
selecting that option you can see

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.490 
selecting that option you can see
another<00:01:17.549> option<00:01:18.000> has<00:01:18.180> appeared<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.350> is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
another option has appeared and that is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
another option has appeared and that is
to<00:01:19.710> vertically<00:01:20.340> Center<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> column<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to vertically Center the column I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
to vertically Center the column I
already<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> selected<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.560> most

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
already have this selected and in most

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410 
already have this selected and in most
cases<00:01:22.920> when<00:01:23.220> you're<00:01:23.369> placing<00:01:23.610> columns<00:01:24.119> inside

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
cases when you're placing columns inside

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
cases when you're placing columns inside
of<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> full<00:01:24.810> width<00:01:24.930> content<00:01:25.409> row<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.799> going

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
of a full width content row you're going

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950 
of a full width content row you're going
to<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.400> check<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.479> will<00:01:27.630> simply

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to want to check this this will simply

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
to want to check this this will simply
make<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.680> there's<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.100> text<00:01:29.460> or

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
make it so that if there's more text or

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.640 
make it so that if there's more text or
more<00:01:30.150> content<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.659> any<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:31.049> column<00:01:31.439> than<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
more content in any one column than the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.649 
more content in any one column than the
rest<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> columns<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:33.000> less<00:01:33.210> content

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
rest that the columns with less content

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.330 
rest that the columns with less content
will<00:01:33.780> still<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:34.079> vertically<00:01:34.530> centered<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
will still be vertically centered and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
will still be vertically centered and
appear<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> flow<00:01:35.850> better<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.600> scheme<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
appear to flow better in the scheme of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.410 
appear to flow better in the scheme of
things<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.650> now<00:01:37.799> we've<00:01:38.790> changed<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> full

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
things so now we've changed it to full

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.140 
things so now we've changed it to full
width<00:01:39.540> content<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:41.729> check<00:01:41.970> out

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
width content and if we just check out

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
width content and if we just check out
the<00:01:42.299> front<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.290> going<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the front it's actually not going to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.950 
the front it's actually not going to
look<00:01:43.619> very<00:01:43.799> good<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.700> no

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
look very good because there is no

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.030 
look very good because there is no
separation<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.290> between<00:01:46.530> these<00:01:46.680> columns

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
separation really between these columns

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.639 
separation really between these columns
so<00:01:47.220> they're<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.640> touching<00:01:47.880> directly

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
so they're going to be touching directly

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.749 
so they're going to be touching directly
which<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.680> definitely<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.549> we'd<00:01:50.729> want

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
which is definitely not what we'd want

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.569 
which is definitely not what we'd want
in<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.540> case<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.740> let's<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.189> back<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
in a case like this so let's go back in

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.749 
in a case like this so let's go back in
and<00:01:53.610> change<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.740> all<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.579> now

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and change this all we have to do is now

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
and change this all we have to do is now
edit<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.240> columns<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.920> start<00:01:59.159> with

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
edit the columns I'm going to start with

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.270 
edit the columns I'm going to start with
the<00:01:59.369> first<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> start<00:02:01.950> by<00:02:02.070> adding

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the first one and we can start by adding

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.800 
the first one and we can start by adding
some<00:02:02.430> padding<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.119> which<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
some padding to it which is going to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
some padding to it which is going to
allow<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.350> separation<00:02:04.860> between<00:02:05.250> each

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
allow for some separation between each

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.169 
allow for some separation between each
of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> columns<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.910> after<00:02:08.910> we've<00:02:09.149> done

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of the columns and now after we've done

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.930 
of the columns and now after we've done
that<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:10.560> give<00:02:10.800> an<00:02:10.890> example<00:02:10.950> such<00:02:11.580> as<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that just give an example such as the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.130 
that just give an example such as the
demo<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.420> three<00:02:12.750> different<00:02:12.989> color

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
demo with the three different color

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.910 
demo with the three different color
boxes<00:02:13.620> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
boxes on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040 
boxes on
homepage<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.330> add<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.630> background

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
homepage I'm going to add a background

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.170 
homepage I'm going to add a background
color<00:02:16.640> let's<00:02:17.640> make<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:19.290> blue<00:02:19.830> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
color let's make this one a blue and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.970 
color let's make this one a blue and
that's<00:02:21.180> about<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.050> we<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.290> save<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.739> and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
that's about it so we can save that and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.229 
that's about it so we can save that and
I'm<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.310> gonna<00:02:23.459> do<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> same<00:02:23.880> thing<00:02:24.090> for

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
I'm just gonna do the same thing for

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.059 
I'm just gonna do the same thing for
each<00:02:24.390> column<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:24.900> quickly<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.830> use<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
each column really quickly so use the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.580 
each column really quickly so use the
same<00:02:26.280> padding<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:26.819> consistency<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.810> I'll

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
same padding for consistency and I'll

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.229 
same padding for consistency and I'll
pick<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.980> different<00:02:29.370> background<00:02:29.550> color<00:02:29.790> each

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
pick a different background color each

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:38.990 
pick a different background color each
time<00:02:30.540> around<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:34.350> last<00:02:34.620> one<00:02:37.670> mmm<00:02:38.730> that

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
time around and the last one mmm that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.120 
time around and the last one mmm that
background<00:02:39.270> color<00:02:39.360> already<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.810> pretty<00:02:39.959> good

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
background color already was pretty good

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.530 
background color already was pretty good
so<00:02:41.130> now<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.519> last<00:02:41.730> step<00:02:42.000> here<00:02:42.209> would<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
so now the last step here would be to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.780 
so now the last step here would be to
simply<00:02:43.080> change<00:02:43.410> go<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.099> into<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> row<00:02:44.550> type

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
simply change go back into the row type

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.160 
simply change go back into the row type
again<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.330> let's<00:02:45.480> make<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.720> text<00:02:45.870> color

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
again and let's make the text color

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.140 
again and let's make the text color
light<00:02:46.470> once<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.100> colors<00:02:47.370> we've<00:02:47.489> chosen<00:02:47.760> light

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
light once the colors we've chosen light

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.870 
light once the colors we've chosen light
text<00:02:48.420> would<00:02:48.540> look<00:02:48.959> better<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:50.670> have<00:02:50.760> now

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
text would look better we have now

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.270 
text would look better we have now
successfully<00:02:51.390> recreated<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.799> look<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
successfully recreated the look of the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.490 
successfully recreated the look of the
demo<00:02:53.580> as<00:02:53.760> far<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.120> color<00:02:54.299> boxes<00:02:54.780> -<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
demo as far as the color boxes - the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.020 
demo as far as the color boxes - the
column<00:02:55.799> animations<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.370> you're<00:02:56.730> free<00:02:56.940> to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
column animations that you're free to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.090 
column animations that you're free to
play<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.510> course<00:02:57.750> let's<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.560> ahead<00:02:58.739> and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
play with of course let's go ahead and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.400 
play with of course let's go ahead and
create<00:02:59.459> one<00:02:59.940> more<00:03:00.180> full<00:03:00.600> with<00:03:00.720> content<00:03:01.170> row

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
create one more full with content row

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.140 
create one more full with content row
underneath<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.430> let's<00:03:02.790> experiment

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
underneath this and let's experiment

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.850 
underneath this and let's experiment
with<00:03:03.510> some<00:03:03.720> more<00:03:03.900> effects<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.500> can<00:03:04.620> create

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
with some more effects so we can create

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.509 
with some more effects so we can create
this<00:03:05.250> go<00:03:06.180> back<00:03:06.360> into<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> admin<00:03:06.930> panel<00:03:07.110> and

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
this go back into the admin panel and

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.220 
this go back into the admin panel and
I'm<00:03:08.519> going<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:09.030> add<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.330> new<00:03:09.630> row<00:03:09.870> underneath

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
I'm going to add a new row underneath

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.520 
I'm going to add a new row underneath
and<00:03:10.650> let's<00:03:11.400> change<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.850> into<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.980> 1/3<00:03:15.530> 2/3

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and let's change this into a 1/3 2/3

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.789 
and let's change this into a 1/3 2/3
layout<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.269> have<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:18.510> nice

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
layout so we can have this nice

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.750 
layout so we can have this nice
geometrical<00:03:19.799> alignment<00:03:20.370> between<00:03:20.489> our

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
geometrical alignment between our

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.150 
geometrical alignment between our
columns<00:03:21.120> let's<00:03:21.989> change<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.470> also<00:03:22.799> into<00:03:23.130> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
columns let's change this also into a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.550 
columns let's change this also into a
full<00:03:23.549> width<00:03:23.700> content<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.930> time<00:03:25.230> let's

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
full width content but this time let's

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.030 
full width content but this time let's
add<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:26.220> background<00:03:26.700> image<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.890> selected<00:03:28.890> one<00:03:29.010> of

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
add a background image I selected one of

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.130 
add a background image I selected one of
the<00:03:29.160> images<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.579> is<00:03:29.850> used<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.570> salient

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the images that is used on the salient

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.380 
the images that is used on the salient
demo<00:03:31.680> might<00:03:32.040> be<00:03:32.190> familiar<00:03:32.519> with<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.850> I'm

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
demo might be familiar with and I'm

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.000 
demo might be familiar with and I'm
going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.720> enable<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.170> parallax<00:03:34.769> background

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
going to enable the parallax background

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.550 
going to enable the parallax background
and<00:03:35.579> let's<00:03:36.390> just<00:03:36.540> change<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.900> text<00:03:36.930> color<00:03:37.350> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
and let's just change the text color to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.280 
and let's just change the text color to
light<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.040> now<00:03:38.820> let's<00:03:39.090> create<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.540> nice<00:03:39.900> cool

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
light and now let's create a nice cool

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.380 
light and now let's create a nice cool
effect<00:03:40.769> using<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.160> columns<00:03:41.519> let's<00:03:41.970> put<00:03:42.209> a

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
effect using the columns let's put a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.140 
effect using the columns let's put a
background<00:03:42.959> color<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.530> black<00:03:44.130> over<00:03:44.700> both<00:03:44.970> of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
background color of black over both of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.069 
background color of black over both of
them<00:03:45.440> but<00:03:46.440> vary<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.950> opacity<00:03:47.609> so<00:03:48.570> let's<00:03:48.870> go

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
them but vary the opacity so let's go

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.949 
them but vary the opacity so let's go
with<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.820> 0.6<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.420> larger<00:03:52.290> column<00:03:52.650> and

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
with about 0.6 in the larger column and

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.599 
with about 0.6 in the larger column and
let's<00:03:54.959> go<00:03:55.230> with<00:03:55.440> point<00:03:57.530> 8<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.280> left-hand

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
let's go with point 8 in the left-hand

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.000 
let's go with point 8 in the left-hand
column<00:04:00.049> so<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.829> sake<00:04:01.980> of

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
column so just for the sake of

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.699 
column so just for the sake of
experimenting<00:04:02.640> let's<00:04:02.790> only<00:04:02.940> put<00:04:03.420> text<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.410> one

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
experimenting let's only put text on one

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.170 
experimenting let's only put text on one
of<00:04:04.769> them<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> other<00:04:05.340> one<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.910> be

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
of them and the other one can just be

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.360 
of them and the other one can just be
held<00:04:06.690> open<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.530> show<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.739> image<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.220> is

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
held open to show the image that is

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.580 
held open to show the image that is
parallaxing<00:04:08.940> in<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> background<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.560> let's

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
parallaxing in the background so let's

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.430 
parallaxing in the background so let's
put<00:04:10.920> text<00:04:11.370> in<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.850> left<00:04:12.150> column<00:04:12.420> let's<00:04:12.989> go<00:04:13.170> and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
put text in the left column let's go and

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.900 
put text in the left column let's go and
let's<00:04:13.590> add<00:04:13.739> some<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.280> padding<00:04:14.609> that

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
let's add some of that padding that

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.699 
let's add some of that padding that
we've<00:04:15.030> been<00:04:15.120> using<00:04:15.180> across<00:04:15.840> all<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.289> them<00:04:16.470> and

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
we've been using across all of them and

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.399 
we've been using across all of them and
we<00:04:17.549> can<00:04:18.079> also<00:04:19.079> Center<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:20.250> text<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:20.729> this<00:04:20.850> one

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
we can also Center the text for this one

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.659 
we can also Center the text for this one
now<00:04:22.409> let's<00:04:22.590> add<00:04:22.710> an<00:04:22.830> element<00:04:23.070> instead<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
now let's add an element instead of the

now let's add an element instead of the
text<00:04:23.970> block<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.419> we've<00:04:24.510> been<00:04:24.630> using<00:04:24.979> let's

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
text block that we've been using let's

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.650 
text block that we've been using let's
put<00:04:26.099> a<00:04:26.130> testimonial<00:04:26.760> slider<00:04:26.970> and

on the demo and the ones I've been
creating<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.680> various<00:05:02.310> examples<00:05:02.640> throughout

here<00:05:03.720> are<00:05:03.870> just<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.560> tip<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.920> iceberg<00:05:05.310> I

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
here are just the tip of the iceberg I

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.460 
here are just the tip of the iceberg I
mean<00:05:05.700> this<00:05:05.790> is<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:05.970> very<00:05:06.210> flexible<00:05:06.510> feature<00:05:07.080> and

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
mean this is a very flexible feature and

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.320 
mean this is a very flexible feature and
basically<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.280> sky<00:05:08.490> is<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.730> limit<00:05:09.030> I've

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
basically the sky is a limit I've

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.550 
basically the sky is a limit I've
