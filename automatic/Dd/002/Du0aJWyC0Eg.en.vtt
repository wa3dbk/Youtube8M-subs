00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:02.442
(guitar stings)

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:04.731
- How hot does this thing get?

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:06.630
- Burn off your fucking nutsacks.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.764
It's fucking hot.

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:10.711
(guitar music)

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.746
- Let's try not to fuck up.

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:15.913
We're gonna put some coin down
on a nice, beautiful steak.

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.131
I want to be able to go home and cook this

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:22.276
and not feel like I just
totally blew my money.

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:25.309
Or it's like, "Oh shit, that's medium-well

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.514
"and now I'm pissed off."

00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:27.958
So, how do we do that?

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.600
- We're gonna try not to get your pop-shot

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.075
on too early here.
(laughs)

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.578
We're gonna start off with
a nice piece of steak,

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:36.087
which I like my porterhouse.

00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:38.228
You're gonna start with
some good Maldon salts.

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:39.320
- Maldon's?
- [Tin] You wanna do this?

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.153
- What?

00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:40.986
- You should do this, here.

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:41.826
- I should do this?

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.838
All right, what is Maldon salt?

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:45.848
- It's just a type of salt that is flakes.

00:00:45.848 --> 00:00:49.238
It's larger in pieces, so
you actually taste more salt

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:51.466
without being it too salty.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.906
If you think it's too much salt,
that's about where it's at.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:55.310
Then you take some olive oil.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.769
I'm gonna take it in the pan.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:57.602
- OK.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.208
- We're gonna oven-sear it, cook it first,

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:02.018
to about 100 degrees, which is rare,

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:04.008
and then we're gonna let it rest,

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.553
and then we're gonna
sear it to medium-rare.

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:09.509
This is about an inch and a half,

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.275
so this will probably
cook at 375 to 400 degrees

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.025
for about 15 minutes.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.325
- [Jeremy] You guys opened this restaurant

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:22.098
about two months ago that you guys opened?

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:23.267
- Yeah, just about two months, yeah.

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:25.371
- When I first came in,
it was really different

00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:27.632
than a lot of steakhouses I've been to.

00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:29.500
It's 'cause you're known
for Little Sister, Abigaile.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.711
What made you want to open a steakhouse?

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:33.030
- Right now, I just want to go back,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.999
all the other restaurants
are very flamboyant,

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.347
very rich in flavors.

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:39.173
So I wanted to do something
for the city, and for myself,

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:42.657
just a really nice, rustic steakhouse

00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:46.414
that's classic, Americana, you
know what you're gonna get,

00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:50.081
quality, bomb-ass fucking
steak, good sides,

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.523
with a twist to it,
meaning new techniques,

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:55.891
but yeah, just good, solid Americana food.

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.916
The idea of cooking itself,
when you over-complicate things,

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:03.115
it really ruins the joy of
cooking and why you do it.

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:05.703
Cooking at home is, it's
just fucking rad, you know?

00:02:05.703 --> 00:02:06.536
- Yeah.

00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:07.494
- It's why you have friends over.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:11.229
You drink, you party, you cook some shit,

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.049
it's just fun, exciting,

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.687
and I don't want to
over-complicate things.

00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:17.198
(sizzling)

00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:18.192
Here we go.

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:19.366
See how soft and springy it is?

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:20.580
- What would this be?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.169
This is like, rare?
- [Tin] This is rare.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.551
It's perfect.

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.733
Make sure you don't have
too much fat on there,

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:27.268
on a dry pan.

00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:29.255
It has enough fat on this to sear.

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:30.691
(sizzling)

00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.600
- [Jeremy] Get it right in there.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.003
- Nice sizzle sound.

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:35.453
- And you don't want to move it, right?

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:39.620
- No, just leave it there for
about 45 seconds to a minute.

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.559
Add some butter.

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.926
- The chef's secret.

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:46.676
A shit-ton of butter.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.687
- And then I'm gonna have some garlic.

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:55.581
Some fresh thyme.

00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:59.182
You want that hot butter right
over the herbs and the garlic

00:02:59.182 --> 00:03:02.573
so you want to release some
of that nice thyme flavor.

00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:03.823
Check that out.

00:03:05.183 --> 00:03:08.133
- So, actually, you give the
rest before you do the sear?

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.010
- Yes.
- [Jeremy] OK.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.029
- So you want to rest it out of the oven

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.862
for a good 20 minutes.

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:16.717
- Which we did, through
the magic of television.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:17.698
- Absolutely.

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:18.960
Some of this grey sea salt.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.222
- Wait a minute, do I get to do this one?

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:21.769
- [Tin] You may.
- Oh, shit.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:22.897
I'm useful again.

00:03:22.897 --> 00:03:25.814
- Add a little bit of cubed pepper.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.266
That is absolutely
fucking delicious-looking.

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:31.417
Gonna use a little fresh wasabi,

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:34.404
which is a lot more milder,
just a perfect amount of heat.

00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:35.481
- I'm gonna shank you now

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.481
and eat the whole damn thing myself.

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:42.710
You gotta grab a fork,
man, you gotta dig in.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.543
- I already know it's good.

00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:45.338
You don't gotta tell me. (laughs)

00:03:45.338 --> 00:03:47.800
See how it's just not gray on one side?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.094
It's just flushed throughout?

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:49.927
- Yeah.

00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:50.760
- That's what you really want.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.162
- I mean, this is absolutely awesome shit.

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:56.745
Now I'm gonna go home
and not fuck this up.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.102
That should be the
other name of this show.

00:04:00.102 --> 00:04:01.229
- Don't fuck it up?

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.470
- Don't fuck this up.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.401
- That's good.

00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.818
(rock music)
