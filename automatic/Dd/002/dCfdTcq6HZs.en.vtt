00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello dear friends and welcome to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.670
 Although a new fashion conceptions of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.379
 the mod tools with your like the name 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.389
 actually already says tools 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.929
 of any kind on the back 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.929
 can 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.740
 how does this work? 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.259
 Now that's pretty simple 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.000
 you're just wearing it here on the back 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.980
 move the weapon resp 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.439
 the tool so the tool what you 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.690
 last equipped in the case was 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.280
 that you sword diamond and which one to 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.290
 would change diamond 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.420
 So she complained that Eisenstadt in 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.190
 Hand and switch to the diamond will then 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.300
 would they be exchanged speak 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.430
 Now the team is in the hand 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.989
 instead of the iron sword or iron 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.410
 is sword instead of diamond sword 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.000
 on my back so that you but me 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.620
 also believe that not only on swords 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.019
 I will limit you again 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.929
 show that shovel and men going 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.629
 with the ax with a pc's and with a 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.219
 high, but it does not matter 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.160
 which material they are, that's all 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:09.340
 combinable with each other and she does 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.320
 actually pretty nice and find that 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.530
 what's on the back is actually always 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.039
 to last last tool 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.690
 so if i am now the iron ax 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:25.599
 I do not care if it's the team 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.319
 or too fast pickaxe 

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.920
 would change 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:32.759
 I would always be the last silent ax 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.020
 I'll keep my back 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.550
 and yes , that's actually perfect 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.459
 no matter if now go to the left or 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.929
 turn right into the slot and then colorful 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.729
 is there to say that there is no 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.410
 animation for that you see that 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.539
 just such a rapid change easy 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.319
 but he exchanged the pictures part 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.700
 there is no animation that somehow 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.250
 I still say the tool from behind 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.599
 take it out or something and worry too 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.890
 a bit bugged here you can see the 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.629
 head stuck in it 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.670
 or if i run that sometimes there 

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:06.220
 the hand with the stapler or with the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.509
 handle overlaps but that makes too little 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.610
 nothing at all I think that sees 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.940
 actually wonderful and also one 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.129
 nice little update and you have to 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.569
 The scorers say in agreement 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.870
 if I attack a zombie from behind 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.599
 would 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.739
 or just pug of any kind that me 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.390
 do not bring anything because it protects me 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.280
 No one is even in the sword 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 that in defense a little bit 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.660
 is that does not protect me at all and 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.240
 to be it that way with a bow 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.180
 So is also possible the bow out 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.040
 but not with another 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.530
 again a pair of scissors with the scissors 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 a bit too big , I think if 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.310
 you look at the yes can I watch the scissors is 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.080
 as high as the cow bit 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.660
 Unrealistic, the cow complains too 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.950
 and i welcome to the installation the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.140
 Installation is really simple 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.970
 he just needs the modder or and 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.770
 As usual, life takes one 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.340
 description and then you just pull 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.470
 all the files in the minecraft you are in 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.360
 model or folder and in the mod itself 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.960
 as found in the folder and then have 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.250
 you already know her 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.110
 you do not have to do more 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.850
 I will be there ever at that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.290
