00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.480
 hey people what we are at the start 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 and welcome to a new one 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 video we show you how you are 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 Create an easy camp trek online 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.560
 you and yes people you can go to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.769
 just on a sheet and this one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.679
 Glitches on a building so in the building 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.630
 in there and you can also walk around freely 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.610
 The best thing the opponents see is there too 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.430
 not at all and you can join the opponents 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.399
 completeness and thus creates 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.020
 you can get it with the can track like that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.620
 Now that is indeed something a bit 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.059
 to the left you jump straight ahead and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.250
 then she jumps between the two 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.079
 bar and impressive circle and then 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.600
 Be in here if I'm in here 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 You can see the whole place 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.750
 right if you still have snapper then 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.850
 can you the opponents from the distance 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.420
 pubs or they have good hour would 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.640
 zap 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 and best of all, you can walk around 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.680
 and you can even make room for yourself 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.810
 so if the opponents are among you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 can you tell the people the opponents 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 cut off that sees the recordings 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.770
 same and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.299
 yes, I'll show you worse now 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.090
 I've got no quarrel times 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.700
 and you can still come from here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.640
 out on the balcony there that looks too 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.990
 still the same and yes people as I said 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.610
 you can make this glacier online 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.840
 Of course it has, like all other true 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.470
 also his difficulties 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.000
 He had to get up fast before the opponents 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 also see and climb up 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.189
 yes, but if he but once around 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.189
 then you can have no problems 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.140
 makes fighting and already has two 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.000
 unfortunately he has no hd pvr 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.950
 and cinema mode , they do not exist either 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.179
 That's why we needed that time again 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.890
 repeat and record again 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.179

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.520
