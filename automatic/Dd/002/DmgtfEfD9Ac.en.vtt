00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
doesn't it all right I think the guys

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.760 
doesn't it all right I think the guys
are<00:00:57.490> gonna<00:00:57.760> like<00:00:58.030> this<00:00:58.240> better<00:00:58.590> than<00:00:59.590> the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
are gonna like this better than the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.540 
are gonna like this better than the
original<00:00:59.800> one<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.780> because<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:03.280> more

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
original one just because it's more

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.210 
original one just because it's more
stable<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.870> lot<00:01:05.229> more<00:01:05.590> room<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.010> work<00:01:06.040> with

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
stable and a lot more room to work with

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.270 
stable and a lot more room to work with
to<00:01:06.610> modify<00:01:07.210> later<00:01:07.420> it's<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.840> dish<00:01:08.050> look<00:01:08.560> at<00:01:08.680> that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
to modify later it's a dish look at that

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.300 
to modify later it's a dish look at that
was<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> spoiler<00:01:10.030> on<00:01:10.560> flip<00:01:11.560> which<00:01:11.830> way<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.040> wind
