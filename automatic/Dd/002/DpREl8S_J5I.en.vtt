00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
at file explorer now previously it was

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.290 
at file explorer now previously it was
known<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:10.320> Windows<00:00:10.769> Explorer<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.790> now<00:00:12.030> as<00:00:12.210> you

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
known as Windows Explorer but now as you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.450 
known as Windows Explorer but now as you
can<00:00:12.420> see<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.410> now<00:00:13.799> called<00:00:14.130> file

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
can see here it is now called file

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.430 
can see here it is now called file
explorer<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:15.540> these<00:00:15.719> are<00:00:15.900> practically<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
explorer now these are practically the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.950 
explorer now these are practically the
same<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.400> windows<00:00:17.760> explorer<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
same thing as windows explorer but the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
same thing as windows explorer but the
only<00:00:19.199> difference<00:00:19.439> says<00:00:19.830> windows<00:00:20.070> does<00:00:20.460> not

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
only difference says windows does not

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
only difference says windows does not
rely<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.270> anymore<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:21.990> don't<00:00:22.260> really

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
rely on this anymore so you don't really

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.950 
rely on this anymore so you don't really
browse<00:00:22.949> windows<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.029> per<00:00:24.750> say

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
browse windows with this and per say

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.779 
browse windows with this and per say
this<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.410> called<00:00:25.740> windows<00:00:26.039> explorer<00:00:26.369> anymore

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
powershell we can use command prompt and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
powershell we can use command prompt and
we<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.299> open<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.049> new<00:01:31.170> window<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
we can open this in a new window so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380
