amplified this and xbox took drm away
which<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.180> basically<00:00:55.010> disk<00:00:56.010> right

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
which was basically disk right

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.389 
which was basically disk right
management<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:57.120> allowed<00:00:57.930> games<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
management which allowed games to be you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.029 
management which allowed games to be you
know<00:00:59.550> downloaded<00:01:00.300> digitally<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> stored<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
know downloaded digitally and stored and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.640 
know downloaded digitally and stored and
shared<00:01:02.399> without<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.539> being<00:01:03.719> pirated

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
shared without them being pirated

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.520 
shared without them being pirated
through<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.430> method<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.229> taken

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
through this method and it was taken

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
through this method and it was taken
away<00:01:07.650> which<00:01:07.979> obviously<00:01:08.369> could<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.850> seen<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
away which obviously could be seen as a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.090 
away which obviously could be seen as a
good<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.770> people<00:01:10.860> were

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
good thing because a lot of people were

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
good thing because a lot of people were
against<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> idea<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> 24-hour

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
against the idea of it with the 24-hour

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
against the idea of it with the 24-hour
logins<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> stuff<00:01:14.360> but<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
logins and that kind of stuff but it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.149 
logins and that kind of stuff but it
could<00:01:15.659> again<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.470> course<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.920> meant<00:01:17.100> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
could again and of course it meant that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
could again and of course it meant that
xbox<00:01:17.580> were<00:01:17.729> listening<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.390> their<00:01:18.570> consumers

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
xbox were listening to their consumers

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.609 
xbox were listening to their consumers
and<00:01:20.119> doing<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.049> many<00:01:22.320> ways

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and doing that but actually in many ways

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.230 
and doing that but actually in many ways
it<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.890> kind<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.159> backward<00:01:23.610> step<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it was kind of a backward step because I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
it was kind of a backward step because I
was<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> lot<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.770> been<00:01:25.860> able

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
was a lot that they would have been able

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
was a lot that they would have been able
to<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> build<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.869> we're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to do and build on that you know we're

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840 
to do and build on that you know we're

gaming you know all mostly being
cloud-based<00:01:52.470> downloadable<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.450> discs

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
cloud-based downloadable you know discs

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.780 
cloud-based downloadable you know discs
were<00:01:55.350> becoming<00:01:55.799> less<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.100> less<00:01:56.280> used<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
were becoming less and less used and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.060 
were becoming less and less used and
they<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:57.030> become<00:01:57.299> even<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
they would become even more so with this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
they would become even more so with this
change<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.670> now<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> almost<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.930> bit

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
change but now it's kind of almost a bit

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.980 
change but now it's kind of almost a bit
of<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> step<00:02:01.439> backwards<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:03.090> terms<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.689> sharing

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
of a step backwards in terms of sharing

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.920 
of a step backwards in terms of sharing
and<00:02:04.409> all<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.189> kind<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.579> stuff<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.689> yeah<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
and all that kind of stuff so yeah I

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
and all that kind of stuff so yeah I
don't<00:02:07.079> claim<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.530> an<00:02:07.680> expert<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.369> any<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
don't claim to be an expert on any of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.460 
don't claim to be an expert on any of
this<00:02:09.209> stuff<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:09.959> kind<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.259> my

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
this stuff but that was kind of my

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.130 
this stuff but that was kind of my
takeaway<00:02:11.330> obviously<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.390> can't

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
takeaway obviously I can't

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.570 
takeaway obviously I can't
could<00:02:13.260> see<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> negatives<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.340> well<00:02:14.550> I

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
could see the negatives of it as well I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.700 
could see the negatives of it as well I
can<00:02:14.850> imagine<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.240> being<00:02:15.360> really<00:02:16.110> frustrating

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
can imagine it being really frustrating

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.070 
can imagine it being really frustrating
if<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:17.819> your<00:02:18.030> internet<00:02:18.240> went<00:02:18.540> out<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
if you know your internet went out for a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.140 
if you know your internet went out for a
day<00:02:19.260> or<00:02:19.410> two<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.040> weren't<00:02:20.310> able<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.850> play

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
day or two and you weren't able to play

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.790 
day or two and you weren't able to play
your<00:02:21.690> games<00:02:22.020> maybe<00:02:22.319> they<00:02:22.440> could<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.680> been<00:02:22.770> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
your games maybe they could have been a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440 
your games maybe they could have been a
little<00:02:22.950> more<00:02:23.130> lakhs<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
little more lakhs on that but as a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.120 
little more lakhs on that but as a
general<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.990> think<00:02:25.020> they<00:02:25.290> were<00:02:25.350> moving<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
general I think they were moving in the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.410 
general I think they were moving in the
right<00:02:26.310> direction<00:02:26.370> they<00:02:27.000> got<00:02:27.180> kind<00:02:27.360> of

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
right direction they got kind of

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.840 
right direction they got kind of
redirected<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.920> wrong<00:02:29.100> direction<00:02:29.280> but

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
redirected in the wrong direction but

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.370 
redirected in the wrong direction but
