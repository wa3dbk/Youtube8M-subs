volume<00:06:24.409> control<00:06:24.769> on<00:06:25.039> the<00:06:25.929> puck<00:06:26.929> I<00:06:27.229> like<00:06:27.979> to

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
volume control on the puck I like to

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:34.239 
volume control on the puck I like to
call<00:06:30.579> and<00:06:31.779> then<00:06:32.779> didn't<00:06:33.709> go<00:06:33.799> over<00:06:34.009> this<00:06:34.099> before
