00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.320
 I would like to tell you how I cooked 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.070
 a mixture to fill this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.689
 here is a two-story house of sawdust, I poured 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.010
 his one zalyu I did three months here 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.130
 I filled the whole house in three months literally 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.600
 over the summer one flooded 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.809
 I only used sand only sawdust 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 and cement 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.289
 here two years ago I filled it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.559
 here is such here it now stands without 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.270
 trim without everything basically good 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.870
 feeling here with sawdust, I have nothing 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.850
 didn't do 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.090
 I didn't prepare them beforehand 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.670
 added no liquid glass 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.939
 no ki stars added anything to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:12.000
 quality wall principle 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:18.350
 pretty good quality to me 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.350
 principle very much like it here 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 proportions which are four and a half 05 then 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.280
 there are four buckets of sawdust and a half buckets 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.630
 sand and cement bucket floor I'm all 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.500
 missile wonderful cement mixers 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 here and gently poured here it is 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 cement mixer now I'll be in the summer by the way 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.860
 flood 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 literally in a month will be flooded 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.799
 close veranda no veranda how come 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560
 entrance hall 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.490
 warm nude decided to make one here too 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.290
 I come to the floor and the second floor will be like 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.420
 balcony or veranda 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 I know that is, I will fill and then 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.810
 I already have the details of him as I am the Gulf 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.290
 as I did there already there are several 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.600
 nuances 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.940
 a few secrets because just like that 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.239
 laid out and sawdust by the way I'm not even 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.519
 pressed that is what they are not their 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.019
 ram not pressed 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.719
 I did this for two reasons: firstly, I 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.730
 there was one I was uncomfortable that is 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.010
 pour and press because 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.579
 load is very large material is very 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.129
 much here in the second reason for which i 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.109
 drew no rambova 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.299
 this so that there is as much air as possible 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.109
 here is an example of foam foam 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.139
 warm why because it consists on 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.989
 98 percent of the air and and that was 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.939
 as much as possible the voids inside i don't 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.290
 have tried 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.939
 I have a wall width of 36 centimeters 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.680
 It turned out in principle, I think that this 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:58.950
 quite enough is the foundation on which 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.629
 the depth I poured the foundation I had 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:09.389
 such a principle that I poured it dug 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:11.760
 pit to depth peep digging peep 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.599
 it approximately turned out from meter-twenty 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.959
 from the ground to 80 centimeters decard like 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:24.209
 only it went drive I stopped 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.129
 it is poured into such a principle here 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.769
 quality two years say this house is worth 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:33.959
 they are sheathed this year for more ships to chew 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.239
 his siding still further his 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.889
 to warm 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.690
 will spend a small amount of money to his 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.540
 fully sheathed in the kit that was 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.650
 very warm home 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.579
 energy efficient well all to all who 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.919
 like put likes subscribe 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.930
 on the channel and up if any more questions 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:57.569
 will ask and feel free to anything 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.000
 answer tell you tell how that matter yes 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.430
 by the way, I 'm going to do the door instead 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.109
 on the second floor to the veranda there will be a door from 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.819
 the apartments are like on the second floor of the veranda and 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.079
 in one and the following videos I will show you 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.199
 I'll break here right here 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.870
 will cut out under the door as if a little 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.620
 before I had a window 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.199
 the holes for the window were meant 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.320
 now i'm going to make a door here and 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:25.000
 here I will choose see how it is 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.820
 how and how strong is it like me 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.610
 I will do break this wall and zapilov 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.670
 besides i will still be here 102 on 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.490
 I will cut out a small window in the bathroom 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.370
 do here is what issued the glass was always 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.530
 and everywhere you stand on the stairs like this 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.390
 stained glass to small do too i 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.790
 I will cut out to myself I wonder how 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.760
 I will not break this wall than I will 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.550
 cut out with available detailed tools 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.550
 means capabilities so that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.550
 look
