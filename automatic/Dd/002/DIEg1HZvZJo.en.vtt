this is the same list of recipes that we

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.599 
this is the same list of recipes that we
had<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.320> did<00:00:25.500> our<00:00:25.529> corporate<00:00:25.980> proposal

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
had when we did our corporate proposal

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
had when we did our corporate proposal
and<00:00:26.880> still<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> find<00:00:27.960> wise<00:00:28.109> whether<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> eat

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and still got to find wise whether I eat

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
and still got to find wise whether I eat
it<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> Kate<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.460> hopefully<00:00:29.849> it'll<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.090> all

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
it a Kate but hopefully it'll be all

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
it a Kate but hopefully it'll be all
good<00:00:30.480> yeah<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.099> suppose<00:00:32.309> what

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
good yeah and then I suppose what

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
good yeah and then I suppose what
happens<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> once<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.420> come<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> recipe

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
happens is once we come up with a recipe

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.459 
happens is once we come up with a recipe
and<00:00:35.130> develop<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:36.180> usually<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:37.230> write

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
and develop it we usually go on to write

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
and develop it we usually go on to write
it<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.160> here's<00:00:38.430> an<00:00:38.550> example<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this super crispy and I think it's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
this super crispy and I think it's
working<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.090> tiny<00:01:15.299> torch<00:01:15.720> doesn't

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
working look at your tiny torch doesn't

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740 
working look at your tiny torch doesn't
you<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.530> been<00:01:16.650> walking<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:16.950> her<00:01:17.250> ability<00:01:17.909> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you have been walking by her ability I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.490 
you have been walking by her ability I
are<00:01:19.439> no<00:01:19.650> yeah<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.700> no<00:01:20.820> light<00:01:21.290> not<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
are no yeah so no light not at this
