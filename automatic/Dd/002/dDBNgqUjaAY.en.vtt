00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.330
 the ward and wound are welcome to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.119
 One more video and this time I'll be 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.609
 answering and reading my comments 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.800
 because it is not a tradition of many channels 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.210
 And I have to do with mine too. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.399
 subscribed so let's go 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 and this video is just an excuse to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.160
 post videos on the channel but also right 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.590
 okay 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.809
 the dead channel team you already know the reason 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.809
 but let's continue here 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.329
 I only have one doubt if he has created himself 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.850
 to prevent him from starting this 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.120
 war he would have no reason to create 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.370
 the genius then they would technically be 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.649
 ending their existence does not 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.570
 necessarily they returned to the 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.330
 past but does not mean that they will 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.310
 disappear but also means that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.830
 they do not exist in the future 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.530
 Kind if nothing happens Victor does not 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.740
 have reasons to create and then they 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 they would not come back to prevent war 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.830
 kkkkkk adopt the thunderstorm is brain bug 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.390
 lines time prevents war has a 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.380
 new timeline he never 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.440
 It happened 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.330
 such watching very much alive for the future 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.399
 I do not know what you mean by that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.369
 but the journey to the technical past 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.250
 theoretically possible if you are going to have 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.259
 intentions to pontificate something example if 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.899
 you go back into the past to prevent 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.759
 a war you can stop it 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:54.580
 You did not want to go back to the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:59.080
 passed to prevent her but but I 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.300
 the sea ​​of ​​the past I did not want 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.239
 wanted to go back in time to ask her and 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.440
 so there will be no paradox where 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.440
 You would do this internally. 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.660
 Our wheel from where you took it does 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.870
 a lot of legal sense traveled legal from where 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.660
 You took away so much history, I did not 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.370
 I like crazy, I think I think on the street a lot. 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.170
 good theory blond pr was king and does not stay 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.730
 tremendous screen leaves the image not quiet 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.530
 shakes her headache not pain 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.200
 see why theoretical part does not 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.120
 Face please, I love it but the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.070
 inscribed but the cousins ​​a very 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.680

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.820
 I remember when I had 50 people and I 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.560
 was one of them a great channel channel one 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.650

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.060
 technical problems of my pc 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.340

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.890

 story characters but fuck 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.860

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.040

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.340

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.020

 At night it's still necessary but I live 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:25.669
 much worse than this bullshit of success 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:39.050
