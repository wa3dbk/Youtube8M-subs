00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.250 
gun you're better off with the m1911 for
distance<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.350> you're<00:03:46.350> better<00:03:46.530> off<00:03:46.620> for<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
distance and you're better off for the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.030 
distance and you're better off for the
whatever<00:03:49.260> I'm<00:03:49.380> look<00:03:49.500> at<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.830> was<00:03:49.950> all

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
whatever I'm look at this I was all

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.380 
whatever I'm look at this I was all
right<00:03:50.190> there's<00:03:50.370> no<00:03:50.489> way<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> guy<00:03:50.880> knows<00:03:51.090> i<00:03:51.299> was

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
right there's no way the guy knows i was

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.820 
right there's no way the guy knows i was
there<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.630> lot<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.959> fuck<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.530> i'm<00:03:52.620> guessing

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
there a lot the fuck so i'm guessing

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.650 
there a lot the fuck so i'm guessing
that<00:03:52.980> was<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> little<00:03:53.400> guy<00:03:53.640> over<00:03:53.850> there<00:03:54.030> camping

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
that was a little guy over there camping

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.120 
that was a little guy over there camping
in<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.810> corner<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.260> was<00:03:55.680> like<00:03:55.799> there's<00:03:55.890> no<00:03:56.010> way

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
in the corner I was like there's no way

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.670 
in the corner I was like there's no way
he<00:03:56.430> knows<00:03:56.640> if<00:03:56.910> I'm<00:03:57.030> gonna<00:03:57.180> run<00:03:57.390> over<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.690> run

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
he knows if I'm gonna run over the run

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.380 
he knows if I'm gonna run over the run
over<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.950> c-4<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.610> figured<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.000> won't<00:04:00.209> even

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
over the c-4 so I figured I won't even

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.890 
over the c-4 so I figured I won't even
stun<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.690> but<00:04:01.680> he<00:04:01.769> knew<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:03.330> know<00:04:03.420> good<00:04:03.720> for

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
stun it but he knew so you know good for

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.140 
stun it but he knew so you know good for
him<00:04:03.989> kudos<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.680> him<00:04:04.830> I'm<00:04:05.220> an<00:04:05.519> idiot<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.000> should

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
him kudos to him I'm an idiot and should

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.789 
him kudos to him I'm an idiot and should
have<00:04:06.269> realized<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.870> here<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.440> got<00:04:07.590> screwed

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
have realized and here I got screwed

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.940 
have realized and here I got screwed
over<00:04:07.980> again<00:04:08.400> also<00:04:09.269> now<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.290> might<00:04:10.620> be<00:04:10.650> me

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
over again also now it just might be me

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.520 
over again also now it just might be me
but<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.310> Makarov<00:04:11.730> seems<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.330> swaim<00:04:12.720> like<00:04:13.320> it's

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
but the Makarov seems to swaim like it's

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.530 
but the Makarov seems to swaim like it's
harder<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.820> it<00:04:14.940> says<00:04:15.090> has<00:04:15.360> better

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
harder to like it says has better

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.000 
harder to like it says has better
distance<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> further<00:04:16.410> they<00:04:16.680> are<00:04:16.799> it's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
distance but the further they are it's

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.150 
distance but the further they are it's
hard<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.280> stay<00:04:17.489> on<00:04:17.640> target<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.510> guess<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.380> m1911

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
hard to stay on target I guess the m1911

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.029 
hard to stay on target I guess the m1911
I<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.850> do<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.150> easily<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:21.989> maybe<00:04:22.770> that's

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
I can do that easily and maybe that's

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.500 
I can do that easily and maybe that's
because<00:04:23.190> it's<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.669> one<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:23.940> use<00:04:24.180> them<00:04:24.330> zombies

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
because it's the one I use them zombies

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.260 
because it's the one I use them zombies
so<00:04:24.840> I'm<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.110> used<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.470> but<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.640> Makarov

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
so I'm just used to it but the Makarov

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.939 
so I'm just used to it but the Makarov
I<00:04:27.330> seem<00:04:27.599> to<00:04:27.629> like<00:04:27.870> sway<00:04:28.139> more<00:04:28.470> away<00:04:28.620> from<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
I seem to like sway more away from the

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.619 
I seem to like sway more away from the
enemy<00:04:29.069> and<00:04:29.460> I'm<00:04:29.699> just<00:04:29.940> not<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.090> fan<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.419> this

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629
