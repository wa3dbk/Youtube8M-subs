positioning mistakes that players make

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.410 
positioning mistakes that players make
unlike<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> burst<00:01:25.950> mage<00:01:26.250> who<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> takes

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
unlike the burst mage who all it takes

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.260 
unlike the burst mage who all it takes
is<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> tiny<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.650> minor<00:01:29.130> misstep<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
is a tiny really minor misstep and you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
is a tiny really minor misstep and you
can<00:01:30.420> flash<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> pick<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.560> free<00:01:31.890> kill

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
can flash in and pick up a free kill

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
can flash in and pick up a free kill
pretty<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.640> every<00:01:33.030> time<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.420> cooldowns

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
pretty much every time your cooldowns

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
pretty much every time your cooldowns
are<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.950> works<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.280> well<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.150> it's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
are up and it works so well because it's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
are up and it works so well because it's
so<00:01:36.869> punishing<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> mistake<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.729> often

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so punishing of a mistake that is often

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
so punishing of a mistake that is often
really<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:40.049> small<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.740> would<00:01:40.950> go

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
really really small and would go

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.340 
really really small and would go
completely<00:01:41.310> unpunished<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:42.570> any<00:01:42.780> other<00:01:43.049> type

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
completely unpunished by any other type

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
completely unpunished by any other type
of<00:01:43.470> champion<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.000> mistake<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
of champion and so it's a mistake that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
of champion and so it's a mistake that
most<00:01:45.659> players<00:01:45.990> tend<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.890> hard

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
most players tend to have a really hard

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.170 
most players tend to have a really hard
time<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.579> stop<00:01:47.880> making<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.479> their<00:01:48.630> games<00:01:50.180> and

time to stop making in their games and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
time to stop making in their games and
so<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:51.840> burst<00:01:52.259> mages<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.829> really

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
so right now burst mages are really

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
so right now burst mages are really
powerful<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.970> our<00:01:54.060> sporting<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:55.079> high<00:01:55.290> win

a<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:10.050> tiny<00:03:10.290> mistake<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> play<00:03:11.580> style

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
a really tiny mistake so the play style

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.360 
a really tiny mistake so the play style
is<00:03:12.060> incredibly<00:03:12.900> effective<00:03:13.350> for<00:03:13.740> soloqueue

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
is incredibly effective for soloqueue

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
and whenever you have flash up you can

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.890 
and whenever you have flash up you can
easily<00:03:16.950> use<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.550> make<00:03:17.700> plays<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.330> when<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.000

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
mentioning that burst mages tend to be a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.479 
mentioning that burst mages tend to be a
little<00:04:09.959> bit<00:04:10.140> weak<00:04:10.380> against<00:04:10.890> traditional

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
little bit weak against traditional

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.460 
little bit weak against traditional
assassins<00:04:12.239> because<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.810> mobility<00:04:13.320> that

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
assassins because the mobility that

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.320 
assassins because the mobility that
assassins<00:04:14.100> have<00:04:14.310> allows<00:04:14.760> them<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.150> really

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
assassins have allows them to really

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.360 
assassins have allows them to really
outplay<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.989> burst<00:04:16.229> mages<00:04:16.530> somewhat<00:04:17.100> easily

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
outplay the burst mages somewhat easily

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.820 
outplay the burst mages somewhat easily
most<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.970> time<00:04:18.209> or<00:04:18.720> at<00:04:18.989> least<00:04:19.169> ensure<00:04:19.620> that

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
most of the time or at least ensure that

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.770 
most of the time or at least ensure that
their<00:04:19.979> flash<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.519> cooldown<00:04:20.760> which<00:04:21.630> is

their flash is on cooldown which is

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.600 
their flash is on cooldown which is
another<00:04:22.049> reason<00:04:22.470> why<00:04:22.500> burst<00:04:22.919> mages<00:04:23.190> weren't

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
another reason why burst mages weren't

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.540 
another reason why burst mages weren't
as<00:04:23.760> popular<00:04:24.300> before<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:25.470> now<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.979> most<00:04:26.280> if

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
as popular before but now that most if

not all of the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.240 
not all of the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
channel assassins have been completely

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.130 
channel assassins have been completely
nerfed<00:04:29.640> into<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:29.970> ground<00:04:30.210> burst<00:04:30.870> mages

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
nerfed into the ground burst mages

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.830 
nerfed into the ground burst mages
really<00:04:31.680> shine<00:04:31.920> through<00:04:32.390> burst<00:04:33.390> mages<00:04:33.630> are

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
really shine through burst mages are

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.450 
really shine through burst mages are
also<00:04:33.990> pretty<00:04:34.350> good<00:04:34.440> at<00:04:34.560> killing<00:04:34.800> tanks<00:04:35.280> too

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
also pretty good at killing tanks too
