to<00:02:01.100> get<00:02:01.280> involved<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:01.939> this<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.680> partially

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
to get involved in this and partially

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.490 
to get involved in this and partially
because<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.979> can't<00:02:04.189> do<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.369> but<00:02:05.240> yeah<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.170> your

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
because I can't do it but yeah so your

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.139 
because I can't do it but yeah so your
need<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.740> do<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.100> stall<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.549> signal<00:02:07.909> you<00:02:07.970> could

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
need to do is stall the signal you could

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.539 
need to do is stall the signal you could
use<00:02:08.269> an<00:02:08.360> RS<00:02:08.629> nor<00:02:08.810> latch<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.439> then<00:02:09.500> when<00:02:10.429> you

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
use an RS nor latch and then when you

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.399 
use an RS nor latch and then when you
press<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.879> button<00:02:10.909> any<00:02:11.420> button<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.110> it

can come up with a really nice build

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.470 
can come up with a really nice build
then<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.459> would<00:03:31.549> be<00:03:31.609> really<00:03:31.819> good<00:03:32.030> community

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
if you wanted to make it so it didn't

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.420 
if you wanted to make it so it didn't
use<00:03:37.690> fire<00:03:38.690> charges<00:03:39.349> that's<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:39.980> changing

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
use fire charges that's just changing

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.460 
use fire charges that's just changing
this<00:03:40.519> green<00:03:40.790> circuit<00:03:41.269> here<00:03:41.569> it's<00:03:42.049> not<00:03:42.230> too

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
this green circuit here it's not too

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.890 
this green circuit here it's not too
difficult<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.730> yeah<00:03:44.239> i<00:03:44.389> might<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.720> tutorial

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
difficult so yeah i might do a tutorial

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.990 
difficult so yeah i might do a tutorial
on<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.470> one<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.769> doesn't<00:03:46.129> use<00:03:46.250> fire<00:03:46.519> charges

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
on and one that doesn't use fire charges

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.909 
on and one that doesn't use fire charges
but<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.239> reason<00:03:47.419> i<00:03:47.629> chose<00:03:47.660> fire<00:03:48.139> charges<00:03:48.769> is

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
but the reason i chose fire charges is

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.849 
but the reason i chose fire charges is
because<00:03:49.639> it's<00:03:49.819> unique<00:03:50.150> item<00:03:50.900> when<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.620> fire

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
because it's unique item when you fire

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.430 
because it's unique item when you fire
out<00:03:52.099> of<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.280> dispenser<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.389> fires<00:03:53.840> an<00:03:53.959> entity

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
out of a dispenser it fires an entity

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.500 
out of a dispenser it fires an entity
that<00:03:54.739> will<00:03:54.949> cause<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.310> fire<00:03:55.699> when<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> hits<00:03:56.359> a

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
that will cause a fire when it hits a

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.780 
that will cause a fire when it hits a
block<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.079> that<00:03:57.859> is<00:03:58.040> when<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.310> activates<00:03:58.699> this

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
block and that is when it activates this

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.909 
block and that is when it activates this
block<00:03:59.060> update<00:03:59.419> and<00:03:59.660> then<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.590> will<00:04:00.680> send<00:04:00.859> a

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
block update and then it will send a

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.710 
block update and then it will send a
signal<00:04:01.129> and<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:01.639> on<00:04:01.760> so<00:04:01.940> forth<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.389> will<00:04:02.480> count

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
signal and so on so forth it will count

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.259 
signal and so on so forth it will count
it<00:04:02.989> ain't<00:04:03.560> actually<00:04:03.949> really<00:04:04.280> fast<00:04:04.549> if<00:04:04.819> I<00:04:05.030> just

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
it ain't actually really fast if I just

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.990 
it ain't actually really fast if I just
get<00:04:05.419> some<00:04:05.720> more<00:04:05.959> like<00:04:06.949> this<00:04:07.579> let's<00:04:07.819> put<00:04:07.970> a

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
get some more like this let's put a

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.839 
get some more like this let's put a
stack<00:04:08.299> in<00:04:08.540> certain<00:04:09.290> long<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.560> takes<00:04:09.859> to<00:04:10.160> fire<00:04:10.459> a

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
stack in certain long it takes to fire a

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.680 
stack in certain long it takes to fire a
stack<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:12.199> that

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
stack like that

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.350 
stack like that
it's<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:14.800> fast<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:16.090> thing<00:04:16.239> is

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
it's so fast and this thing is

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.330 
it's so fast and this thing is
completely<00:04:16.750> expandable<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.680> will<00:04:17.860> count<00:04:18.040> up

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
completely expandable it will count up

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.930 
completely expandable it will count up
to<00:04:19.470> God<00:04:20.470> knows<00:04:20.650> our<00:04:20.830> money<00:04:21.100> but<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.489> as<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:21.850> is

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
to God knows our money but this as it is

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.390 
to God knows our money but this as it is
now<00:04:22.500> will<00:04:23.500> count<00:04:23.740> up<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.570> about<00:04:25.830> 50<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.010> believe

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
now will count up to about 50 I believe

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.070 
now will count up to about 50 I believe
I'm<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:27.700> too<00:04:27.910> sure<00:04:28.150> on<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.480> but<00:04:28.840> you<00:04:28.960> add

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
I'm not too sure on that one but you add

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.170 
I'm not too sure on that one but you add
another<00:04:29.290> one<00:04:29.500> it'll<00:04:30.250> count<00:04:30.400> up<00:04:30.640> to<00:04:30.730> about<00:04:30.910> a

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
another one it'll count up to about a

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.980 
another one it'll count up to about a
hundred<00:04:31.270> which<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.110> absolutely<00:04:32.500> crazy<00:04:32.790> so

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
hundred which is absolutely crazy so

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.090 
hundred which is absolutely crazy so
yeah<00:04:34.990> as<00:04:35.170> you<00:04:35.320> can<00:04:35.410> see<00:04:35.620> we're<00:04:35.770> probably<00:04:35.950> about

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
yeah as you can see we're probably about

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.150 
yeah as you can see we're probably about
30<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.970> now<00:04:37.180> oh<00:04:37.450> yeah<00:04:38.380> we've<00:04:38.500> only<00:04:38.620> got<00:04:38.770> 18

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
30 and now oh yeah we've only got 18

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.640 
30 and now oh yeah we've only got 18
left<00:04:39.400> it's<00:04:39.640> so<00:04:39.880> fast<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.630> can't<00:04:41.200> imagine<00:04:41.290> this

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
left it's so fast I can't imagine this

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.550 
left it's so fast I can't imagine this
causing<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:43.450> would<00:04:43.660> cause<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> lot<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.110> life<00:04:44.380> for

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
causing it would cause a lot of life for

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.380 
causing it would cause a lot of life for
multiplayer<00:04:45.070> but<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:45.430> quick<00:04:45.700> so<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.180> will<00:04:46.270> be

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
multiplayer but it's quick so it will be

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.800 
multiplayer but it's quick so it will be
over<00:04:46.510> in<00:04:47.140> an<00:04:47.350> instant<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:48.190> there<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.460> have<00:04:48.490> it

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
over in an instant and there you have it

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.780 
over in an instant and there you have it
64<00:04:49.810> items<00:04:50.020> have<00:04:50.560> been<00:04:50.680> dispensed<00:04:51.310> through<00:04:51.460> the

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
64 items have been dispensed through the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.850 
64 items have been dispensed through the
entire<00:04:52.120> machine<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.900> by<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.410> looks<00:04:53.650> of<00:04:53.770> it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
entire machine and by the looks of it

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.450 
entire machine and by the looks of it
this<00:04:54.160> thing<00:04:54.400> can<00:04:54.580> count<00:04:54.820> up<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.090> 64<00:04:55.860> while<00:04:56.860> 63

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
this thing can count up to 64 while 63

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.760 
this thing can count up to 64 while 63
so<00:04:57.760> yeah<00:04:58.030> it's<00:04:58.210> pretty<00:04:58.330> interesting<00:04:58.630> so<00:04:59.500> yeah

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
so yeah it's pretty interesting so yeah
