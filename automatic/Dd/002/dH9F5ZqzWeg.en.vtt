hours I mean it's definitely gonna be
not<00:00:53.309> long<00:00:53.550> after<00:00:53.969> Hoover<00:00:54.239> unveils<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.840> for

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
not long after Hoover unveils this for

not long after Hoover unveils this for
real<00:00:55.320> now<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.190> suppose<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.910> we'll

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
real now I do suppose that we'll

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
real now I do suppose that we'll
probably<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> lot<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:58.020> expensive<00:00:58.500> less

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
probably see a lot more expensive less

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.490 
probably see a lot more expensive less
disposable<00:00:59.820> iterations<00:01:00.570> pop<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
disposable iterations pop up because I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
disposable iterations pop up because I
mean<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> sort<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> point<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.940> Google

the actual use of this you basically

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.899 
the actual use of this you basically
just<00:01:28.619> hold<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> box<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.640> face<00:01:29.880> and

of applications to scroll back and forth

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
of applications to scroll back and forth
you<00:01:34.259> turn<00:01:34.500> your<00:01:34.680> head<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.640> basically

you turn your head and then basically

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
you turn your head and then basically
you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.390> click<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.659> things<00:01:36.960> using<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> little

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you can click on things using a little

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
you can click on things using a little
washer<00:01:38.369> that's<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.880> side<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.630> slide<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
washer that's to your side you slide it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
washer that's to your side you slide it
down<00:01:40.439> instead<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.829> cardboard<00:01:41.340> slot<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
down instead of cardboard slot and it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.819 
down instead of cardboard slot and it
pops<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> basically<00:01:43.259> feels<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.740> an
