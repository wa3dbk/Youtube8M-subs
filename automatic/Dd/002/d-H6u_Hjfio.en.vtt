a little do-it-yourself

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.989 
a little do-it-yourself
DIY<00:00:23.619> projects<00:00:24.619> like<00:00:24.949> with<00:00:25.099> any<00:00:25.220> other<00:00:25.460> project

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:25.999 
DIY projects like with any other project

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.819 
DIY projects like with any other project
I'm<00:00:26.150> starting<00:00:26.509> by<00:00:26.630> ironing<00:00:27.019> my<00:00:27.199> fabric<00:00:27.650> and

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
I'm starting by ironing my fabric and

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.319 
I'm starting by ironing my fabric and
this<00:00:28.159> is<00:00:28.279> just<00:00:28.429> some<00:00:28.579> favorite<00:00:28.909> that<00:00:28.999> I<00:00:29.029> happen

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
this is just some favorite that I happen

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.779 
this is just some favorite that I happen
to<00:00:29.359> have<00:00:29.539> on<00:00:29.749> hand<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:30.949> I<00:00:30.980> decided<00:00:31.399> to<00:00:31.550> make

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
to have on hand so I decided to make

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.360 
to have on hand so I decided to make
about<00:00:32.029> 19<00:00:32.480> inch<00:00:32.689> square<00:00:33.110> feet<00:00:33.680> pads<00:00:33.950> if<00:00:34.250> you

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
about 19 inch square feet pads if you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.689 
about 19 inch square feet pads if you
will<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.510> I'm<00:00:35.750> cutting<00:00:36.320> 20<00:00:37.039> inches<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:37.670> I

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
will and so I'm cutting 20 inches so I

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.220 
will and so I'm cutting 20 inches so I
have<00:00:37.879> about<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.149> half<00:00:38.239> inch<00:00:38.539> allowance<00:00:38.809> on<00:00:39.109> your

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
have about a half inch allowance on your

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.470 
have about a half inch allowance on your
side<00:00:39.469> to<00:00:39.710> finish<00:00:39.890> those<00:00:40.250> edges<00:00:40.760> off<00:00:40.910> with<00:00:41.239> and

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
side to finish those edges off with and

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.590 
side to finish those edges off with and
if<00:00:41.989> your<00:00:42.199> fabric<00:00:42.800> doesn't<00:00:43.519> rip<00:00:43.730> well<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.449> can

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
if your fabric doesn't rip well you can

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.020 
if your fabric doesn't rip well you can
use<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.140> rotary<00:00:45.739> cutter<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.670> straightedge

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
use a rotary cutter and a straightedge

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.360 
use a rotary cutter and a straightedge
like<00:00:47.480> I'm<00:00:47.629> using<00:00:47.929> here<00:00:48.079> on<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.620> self-healing

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
like I'm using here on a self-healing

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.360 
like I'm using here on a self-healing
mat<00:00:49.760> or<00:00:50.089> if<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.480> look<00:00:50.690> out<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.199> your<00:00:52.070> fabric

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
mat or if you look out and your fabric

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.660 
mat or if you look out and your fabric
rips<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.480> can<00:00:53.660> just<00:00:53.929> rip<00:00:54.199> her<00:00:54.350> instead<00:00:54.829> you

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
rips you can just rip her instead you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.840 
rips you can just rip her instead you
just<00:00:55.730> put<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.570> little<00:00:57.100> notch<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.579> where<00:00:58.730> you

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
just put a little notch in to where you

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.239 
just put a little notch in to where you
want<00:00:59.089> that<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.019> it<00:01:00.109> will<00:01:00.320> rip<00:01:00.679> right<00:01:01.010> along

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
want that and it will rip right along

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.149 
want that and it will rip right along
that<00:01:01.429> grain<00:01:02.260> obviously<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:03.409> a<00:01:03.440> lot<00:01:03.559> faster

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
that grain obviously it's a lot faster

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.640 
that grain obviously it's a lot faster
and<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.790> much<00:01:05.239> more<00:01:05.449> accurate<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.050> then<00:01:06.620> I

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
and it is much more accurate and then I

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.260 
and it is much more accurate and then I
decided<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.340> put<00:01:07.430> some<00:01:07.700> batting<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:08.240> between

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
decided to put some batting in between

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.260 
decided to put some batting in between
these<00:01:09.050> two<00:01:09.350> layers<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.310> I'm<00:01:10.430> kind<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.880> batting

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
these two layers so I'm kind of batting

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.780 
these two layers so I'm kind of batting
the<00:01:11.390> size<00:01:11.600> all<00:01:12.590> of<00:01:12.650> this<00:01:13.010> stuff<00:01:13.280> I've<00:01:13.460> cut<00:01:13.670> to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
the size all of this stuff I've cut to

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.150 
the size all of this stuff I've cut to
20<00:01:14.150> inch<00:01:14.330> squares<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.110> then<00:01:15.620> I<00:01:15.650> thought<00:01:15.890> they

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
20 inch squares and then I thought they

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.650 
20 inch squares and then I thought they
would<00:01:16.340> be<00:01:16.370> good<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:16.730> these<00:01:16.910> Carolla<00:01:17.330> for

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
would be good if these Carolla for

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.140 
would be good if these Carolla for
easier<00:01:18.050> storage<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.220> I'm<00:01:19.430> putting<00:01:19.760> down<00:01:19.820> some

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
easier storage so I'm putting down some

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.320 
easier storage so I'm putting down some
velcro<00:01:20.480> you<00:01:20.960> also<00:01:21.620> could<00:01:21.800> use<00:01:22.100> little<00:01:22.400> time<00:01:22.670> so

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
velcro you also could use little time so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.540 
velcro you also could use little time so
I'm<00:01:23.450> cutting<00:01:23.720> these<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.740> am<00:01:24.950> just<00:01:25.280> sort<00:01:25.460> of

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
I'm cutting these and I am just sort of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.010 
I'm cutting these and I am just sort of
rough<00:01:25.760> placing<00:01:26.330> them<00:01:26.480> to<00:01:26.600> see<00:01:26.780> where<00:01:26.930> they

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
rough placing them to see where they

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.200 
rough placing them to see where they
need<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.260> go<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:27.950> I'm<00:01:28.070> actually<00:01:28.280> placing

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
need to go and I'm actually placing

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.520 
need to go and I'm actually placing
these<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.330> little<00:01:29.570> bit<00:01:29.720> loose<00:01:29.960> since<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.470> don't

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
these a little bit loose since I don't

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.620 
these a little bit loose since I don't
have<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> batting<00:01:31.430> in<00:01:31.610> between<00:01:31.730> these<00:01:32.420> layers

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
have the batting in between these layers

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.280 
have the batting in between these layers
yet

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
yet

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.950 
yet
and<00:01:33.400> then<00:01:34.400> I'm<00:01:34.520> pinning<00:01:34.820> them<00:01:35.060> on<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.390> fabric

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
and then I'm pinning them on the fabric

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.810 
and then I'm pinning them on the fabric
where<00:01:36.290> they<00:01:36.410> need<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.650> go<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.190> I'm<00:01:37.460> sewing

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
where they need to go and I'm sewing

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.670 
where they need to go and I'm sewing
these<00:01:38.210> onto<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.840> fabric<00:01:39.140> before<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.500> do

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
these onto the fabric before I do

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.350 
these onto the fabric before I do
anything<00:01:40.040> else<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.760> way<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.970> stitches<00:01:41.240> are

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
anything else that way the stitches are

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.940 
anything else that way the stitches are
hidden<00:01:41.660> if<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:42.020> had<00:01:42.230> put<00:01:42.380> this<00:01:42.470> together<00:01:42.650> and

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
hidden if I had put this together and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.530 
hidden if I had put this together and
had<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.250> two<00:01:43.400> layers<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.790> fabric<00:01:44.360> together

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
had the two layers of fabric together

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.450 
had the two layers of fabric together
then<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.230> would<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.470> seen<00:01:45.830> those<00:01:46.190> stitches

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
then you would have seen those stitches

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.420 
then you would have seen those stitches
on<00:01:46.820> each<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.420> other<00:01:47.600> side<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.590> each<00:01:49.160> of<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
on each on the other side of each of the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.860 
on each on the other side of each of the
fabric<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.060> hope<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.360> makes<00:01:50.510> sense

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
fabric so I hope that makes sense

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.720 
fabric so I hope that makes sense
and<00:01:51.020> once<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.500> have<00:01:51.740> all<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.130> all<00:01:52.280> frou<00:01:52.520> in

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
and once I have all that all frou in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.610 
and once I have all that all frou in
place<00:01:53.090> where<00:01:53.330> they<00:01:53.390> need<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.570> go<00:01:53.750> I'm<00:01:54.260> just

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
place where they need to go I'm just

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.770 
place where they need to go I'm just
dipping<00:01:54.890> off<00:01:55.160> that<00:01:55.400> corner<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.090> know<00:01:56.300> which

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
dipping off that corner so I know which

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.000 
dipping off that corner so I know which
orientation<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.830> match<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.220> back<00:01:58.400> up<00:01:58.580> with

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
orientation to match the back up with

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.250 
orientation to match the back up with
and<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:01:59.190> on<00:01:59.400> my<00:01:59.430> cell<00:01:59.730> machine<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.930> just

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
down with the right side facing down so

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.750 
down with the right side facing down so
the<00:02:15.690> right<00:02:15.870> side<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.290> touching<00:02:16.890> my<00:02:17.250> mat<00:02:17.550> right

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
the right side is touching my mat right

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.240 
the right side is touching my mat right
now<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.080> wrong<00:02:19.260> side<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.710> facing<00:02:19.950> up

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
down so they don't get in the way of

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.900 
down so they don't get in the way of
your<00:03:20.459> first<00:03:20.880> eylem

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910

of the seat cover first I'm sewing that
all<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.570> way<00:03:58.660> around<00:03:59.020> and<00:03:59.260> when<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.590> get<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.800> a

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
all the way around and when you get to a

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.390 
all the way around and when you get to a
corner<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.370> unwrap<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.910> whole<00:04:01.090> thing<00:04:01.420> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
corner you unwrap the whole thing and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.160 
corner you unwrap the whole thing and
fold<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.550> over<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.210> right<00:04:04.390> as<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:04.990> see

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
fold it over to the right as you can see

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.650 
fold it over to the right as you can see
I'm<00:04:05.320> doing<00:04:05.590> here<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.160> then<00:04:06.730> fold<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.180> back<00:04:07.420> on

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
I'm doing here and then fold it back on

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.050 
I'm doing here and then fold it back on
itself<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.650> left<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.430> will<00:04:09.670> create<00:04:09.880> a

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
itself the left and that will create a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.940 
itself the left and that will create a
little<00:04:10.270> triangle<00:04:10.810> right<00:04:10.930> there<00:04:11.080> fold<00:04:11.770> the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
little triangle right there fold the

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.980 
little triangle right there fold the
triangles<00:04:12.460> down<00:04:12.790> while<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.600> finish<00:04:13.960> that

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
triangles down while you finish that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.020 
triangles down while you finish that
edge<00:04:14.410> right<00:04:14.710> there<00:04:14.770> and<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.610> careful<00:04:15.910> not<00:04:15.970> to

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
edge right there and be careful not to

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:30.629 
edge right there and be careful not to
catch<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.480> triangle<00:04:17.080> in<00:04:17.260> those<00:04:17.470> stitches

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.070 

once<00:04:31.639> you've<00:04:31.879> back<00:04:32.059> stitch<00:04:32.599> and<00:04:32.840> you're<00:04:32.930> ready

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
once you've back stitch and you're ready

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.019 
once you've back stitch and you're ready
to<00:04:33.169> do<00:04:33.409> the<00:04:33.559> next<00:04:33.770> leg<00:04:34.069> then<00:04:34.669> you're<00:04:34.849> going<00:04:34.939> to

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:35.029 
to do the next leg then you're going to

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.420 
to do the next leg then you're going to
fold<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.599> triangle<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.349> other<00:04:36.529> side<00:04:36.949> so

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
fold the triangle to the other side so

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.159 
fold the triangle to the other side so
it's<00:04:37.610> out<00:04:37.759> of<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:38.059> way<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.749> did<00:04:38.900> this<00:04:38.990> all

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
it's out of the way and I did this all

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.390 
it's out of the way and I did this all
the<00:04:39.259> way<00:04:39.319> around<00:04:39.439> to<00:04:39.860> make<00:04:39.979> those<00:04:40.159> minor

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
the way around to make those minor

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.129 
the way around to make those minor
corners<00:04:40.939> and<00:04:41.389> when<00:04:41.569> you<00:04:41.659> get<00:04:41.779> to<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> edge

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
corners and when you get to the edge

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.339 
corners and when you get to the edge
just<00:04:42.610> continue<00:04:43.610> stitching<00:04:43.909> right<00:04:44.240> on<00:04:44.479> to

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
just continue stitching right on to

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.230 
just continue stitching right on to
where<00:04:45.529> you<00:04:45.710> start<00:04:46.039> it<00:04:46.189> you'll<00:04:46.370> see<00:04:46.580> where<00:04:47.210> I

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
where you start it you'll see where I

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.119 
where you start it you'll see where I
started<00:04:47.839> I<00:04:47.990> actually<00:04:48.199> followed<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:48.949> raw

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
started I actually followed that raw

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.519 
started I actually followed that raw
edge<00:04:49.159> at<00:04:49.639> so<00:04:50.419> there's<00:04:50.599> a<00:04:50.659> full<00:04:50.960> line<00:04:51.289> right

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:51.529 
edge at so there's a full line right

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.260 
edge at so there's a full line right
there<00:04:51.770> which<00:04:52.309> will<00:04:52.430> be<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.520> finished<00:04:52.849> edge<00:04:53.059> on

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
there which will be a finished edge on

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.029 
there which will be a finished edge on
the<00:04:53.360> right<00:04:53.479> side<00:04:53.779> and<00:04:54.199> going<00:04:54.439> back<00:04:54.589> I<00:04:54.770> like<00:04:54.889> the

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
the right side and going back I like the

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.499 
the right side and going back I like the
stitch<00:04:55.249> on<00:04:55.339> the<00:04:55.490> right<00:04:55.639> side<00:04:55.939> so<00:04:56.089> you<00:04:56.180> can<00:04:56.300> see

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
stitch on the right side so you can see

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.269 
stitch on the right side so you can see
where<00:04:56.719> those<00:04:56.809> stitches<00:04:57.050> are<00:04:57.169> going<00:04:57.289> on<00:04:57.860> top<00:04:58.129> of

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 
where those stitches are going on top of

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.890 
where those stitches are going on top of
that<00:04:58.400> binding<00:04:58.819> and<00:04:59.300> when<00:04:59.479> you<00:04:59.539> get<00:04:59.689> to<00:04:59.779> that

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
that binding and when you get to that
