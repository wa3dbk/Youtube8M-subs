00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.430
 taking advantage of this slack and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.599
 request from colleagues who asked for music 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.099
 boy girl from the village music from 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:16.020
 florence lourival and was re-recorded 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.510
 Recently Reviewed by lime 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.980
 So I'll make this video for you guys. 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.970
 taking advantage of this little play I had 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.619
 today and the music is here at the keep 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 a means that the only original recording 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.359
 a little faster than the old one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.660
 the first years with greater defour here 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.190
 with the first I want to pass the lows 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 because you already have several ways and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.550
 that you can not leave without playing bass 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:50.309
 how many people do then two options 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.079
 to do it here as it is a rhythm in 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.960
 here in Gustavo's version of the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.449
 Gustavo file is more a clash touches the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.580
 to gain more stock 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:15.130
 neighbors I pick up an alternate name 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:22.000
 and come back to prove this bass here one 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:27.670
 Other you can do this here you have 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.350
 these two options to make that bass 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 A lot of people talk a lot today. 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.670
 It's strange because the music is 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.040
 so this bass you can put on 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.890
 music on the right hand 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.090
 I'll pass on the most original aggravation 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.080
 she's like this, everything matters everything 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.350

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.540
 The document already dropped here is a bit 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:31.410
 complicated but you can not fall already 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:44.400

 Simon Cowell LladÃ³ B flat ground to go there 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.720
 preparation in the corner back in the sun if given 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.720
 bad 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:05.720
 the sun there is sunshine and it can be 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.720
 used the fingers 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.020
 gustavo lima is a little different from 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.100
 see certainty at first simple notes 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:23.230
 would be the note the single dollar sun battery 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.890
 from there I went through 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.890
 eats 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.980
 the skin 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.350
 so here's everyone you go 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.130
 make first time and decorate the 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:46.900
 typing is now ready to be 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.530
 you use this shake that you play 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.530
 quieter 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.980
 both with lay playing as bass along 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.980
 because more grandchild 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.750
 the relationship 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:33.289
 that bass and listen together here he 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:46.220
 Follow sibemol la sol and do bemol only there 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:49.330
 use when closed at the end here and here 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.330
 in the end an advice here 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.720
 and a base for those who have nothing to go 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:05.169
 to follow the corner but it 's fast you 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:07.060
 will do it here, a base that you 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.580
 can use to accompany her who 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.199
 It has nothing what are actually sentence 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.770
 is not if you have a little guitar will not 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.770
 do it here 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.479
 the cat of a flutter right 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.820
 this phrase may be using at the time 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.710
 at the time of the singer and not one 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:47.930
 there is nothing yet just a double 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:50.540
 base here at this time people get a 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.580
 It took little confused snake line only 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.730
 well and on and on and on I can 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.130
 a video showing everything 100% from the corner 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.750
 her from what you can or can not do 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.010
 this time to accompany the singing 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.200
 a lot of people each have their own 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.180
 based on the style of playing 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.760
 it is logical that it has a more correct style 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.400
 but many people already have a base there that 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.230
 if it is common, it's more for the party of 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.970
 family that things more 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.860
 to join colleagues and play in a 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.600
 party, but then you can play the 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.540
 same very beautiful song and the music that 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.850
 It marked the season and it's really beautiful. 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:27.280
 I hope to please him who asked for this video. 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.280
 with great affection and we go forward
