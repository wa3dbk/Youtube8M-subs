00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.170 
were pretty good i bought improved comms
for<00:04:21.150> him<00:04:21.270> so<00:04:21.479> that<00:04:21.660> was<00:04:21.870> not<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:23.400> useful

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
for him so that was not that useful

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.400 
for him so that was not that useful
in<00:04:25.419> this<00:04:25.600> game<00:04:25.720> because<00:04:26.020> there<00:04:26.199> are<00:04:26.320> no

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
in this game because there are no

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.379 
in this game because there are no
reserves<00:04:26.830> I'm<00:04:27.400> definitely<00:04:27.639> happy<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:28.270> the

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
reserves I'm definitely happy with the

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.110 
reserves I'm definitely happy with the
stormtroopers<00:04:29.199> they<00:04:30.009> have<00:04:30.699> good<00:04:30.940> leadership

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
stormtroopers they have good leadership

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.330 
stormtroopers they have good leadership
good<00:04:31.750> ballistics<00:04:32.259> kill<00:04:32.560> lots<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:33.070> special

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
good ballistics kill lots of special

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.360 
good ballistics kill lots of special
weapons<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.090> definitely<00:04:34.419> improve<00:04:35.370> prefer

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
weapons so I definitely improve prefer

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.749 
weapons so I definitely improve prefer
