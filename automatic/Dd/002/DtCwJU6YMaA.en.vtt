hi everyone in this video we'll transmit

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.990 
hi everyone in this video we'll transmit
the<00:00:15.879> music<00:00:16.270> using<00:00:16.510> a<00:00:16.690> laser<00:00:16.840> over<00:00:17.609> 442<00:00:18.609> meters

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
the music using a laser over 442 meters

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.999 
the music using a laser over 442 meters
we<00:00:19.509> invite<00:00:19.839> you<00:00:20.080> to<00:00:20.320> watch<00:00:20.439> the<00:00:20.619> whole<00:00:20.800> video

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
we invite you to watch the whole video

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.919 
we invite you to watch the whole video
because<00:00:21.640> we<00:00:21.789> are<00:00:21.880> first<00:00:22.150> going<00:00:22.359> to<00:00:22.599> present

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
because we are first going to present

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.659 
because we are first going to present
our<00:00:23.050> aggression<00:00:23.679> and<00:00:23.830> try<00:00:24.160> on<00:00:24.339> a<00:00:24.369> short

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
our aggression and try on a short

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.140 
our aggression and try on a short
distance<00:00:24.820> then<00:00:25.810> we'll<00:00:25.960> try<00:00:26.169> very<00:00:26.439> far<00:00:26.740> at<00:00:27.699> the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
distance then we'll try very far at the

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.659 
distance then we'll try very far at the
end<00:00:28.300> we<00:00:28.839> will<00:00:28.990> explain<00:00:29.289> how<00:00:29.349> is<00:00:29.650> work<00:00:29.859> and<00:00:30.070> test

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
end we will explain how is work and test

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.990 
end we will explain how is work and test

the lasers power to transmit the music

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.720 
the lasers power to transmit the music
we<00:00:34.270> need<00:00:34.390> an<00:00:34.570> ammeter<00:00:34.809> a<00:00:35.520> receiver<00:00:36.520> and

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
we need an ammeter a receiver and

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.959 
we need an ammeter a receiver and
between<00:00:37.270> both<00:00:37.449> as<00:00:37.719> you<00:00:38.230> guessed<00:00:38.440> a<00:00:38.770> laser<00:00:39.640> beam

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
between both as you guessed a laser beam

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.700 
between both as you guessed a laser beam
using<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.350> pretty<00:00:41.680> simple<00:00:41.920> we<00:00:43.590> plug<00:00:44.590> the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
using it is pretty simple we plug the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.959 
using it is pretty simple we plug the
