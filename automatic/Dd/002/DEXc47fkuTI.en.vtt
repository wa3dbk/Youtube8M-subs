00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.910
 Welcome to this new 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.710
 tips and tricks video with assassin's 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 creed pressure and with the force grain and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.060
 I'll show you today like you all 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.849
 viking swords finds resp 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.670
 so where you find them as he finds 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.080
 and then what you have of it, too 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 Viking weakness are relatively easy too 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.190
 Find this pain calm this 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.329
 ache pohl everywhere on the map 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.120
 actually should be found 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.250
 a total of 15 times the Beijing locks 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.910
 there are funds and thus on 15 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 viking swords fragments and once 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.700
 you are there he marks you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 the best on the minimap 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 synchronize every place once so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.770
 the viewpoint to Reach to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 climb and with it all symbols 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.359
 uncovered on the map thus also 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 including these viking swords 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.710
 then you mark yourself that just goes 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.250
 to this point and grab just like that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.780
 then briefly set the pop up and there 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 then do you get your wikinger swords 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.939
 if you have all then that's 15 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 of 15 do not swear even that 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.119
 well hidden are I say now 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 So just once relatively easy these 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.830
 to find really and without much 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.920
 all in all would need effort 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 Explore possible places and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.020
 but that should not sync 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 be the big problem 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.759
 you go directly to the conclusion it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.250
 back to the ship because on the ship 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.110
 then practically waiting for your reward in 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 shape of the viking treasure he had just 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.229
 bottom right which is blocked on 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.649
 and that is a wikinger montur 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.770
 or a wikinger armor and wikinger 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.729
 swords like that and the armor does not look 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.490
 just cool off the benefits, I know exactly 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.460
 not now but the swords are 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.860
 really good because this has some new ones 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.180
 professional and they are also pretty strong 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.950
 So, if you already have the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.929
 James gunn swords makes that relatively 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.280
 little sense because they are not there 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.010
 a lot of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.720
 but the viking swords are up 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.790
 every case cool what the moves 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.220
 as far as the new group is concerned and 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.870
 so and they are pretty strong 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.350
 you get the opponents relatively fast 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.110
 last 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.530
 unlike the normal ones 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.750
 but you have that remains for you 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.060
 let that be free 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.459
 I'll just say if 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.260
 you use the viking montur or james 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.040
 Gunn montur or just another 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.290
 gear 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.410
 because a few engines i will put you in 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.840
 still show the upcoming videos 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.250
 and we are definitely looking forward to it 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.550
 be so you see james gunn sword 344 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.989
 viking swords have 434 you have 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.819
 even know how you do it 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.769
 I now have the viking swords 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.430
 Just taken the fallen 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.819
 I'm fine 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.080
 and yes that was it for the first time from me 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.630
 I hope I switch the next 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.100
 video again and thank you 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.739
 In any case, for me very warmly 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.860
 watching and skin makes it pure people 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.860
 Well
