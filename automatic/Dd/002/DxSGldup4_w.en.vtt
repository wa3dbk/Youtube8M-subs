spot treatments the moisturizer so which

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.780 
spot treatments the moisturizer so which
comes<00:02:37.790> first<00:02:38.060> well<00:02:38.709> easy-breezy<00:02:39.709> serums<00:02:40.670> are

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
comes first well easy-breezy serums are

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.850 
comes first well easy-breezy serums are
always<00:02:41.180> going<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.540> come<00:02:41.840> first<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
always going to come first and the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.520 
always going to come first and the
reason<00:02:42.980> being<00:02:43.459> is<00:02:43.790> that's<00:02:44.120> how<00:02:44.510> serums<00:02:45.110> aren't

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
reason being is that's how serums aren't

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.600 
reason being is that's how serums aren't
developed<00:02:46.040> that's<00:02:46.190> why<00:02:46.340> they're<00:02:46.489> called

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
developed that's why they're called

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.030 
developed that's why they're called
serums<00:02:47.030> they<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> very<00:02:47.959> small<00:02:48.260> molecular

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
serums they have a very small molecular

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.130 
serums they have a very small molecular
weight<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:49.550> they're<00:02:49.970> developed<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.630> go<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.989> and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
weight so they're developed to go in and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.559 
weight so they're developed to go in and
penetrate<00:02:51.560> deeper<00:02:52.100> into<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.519> skin<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.330> if

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
penetrate deeper into the skin so if

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.270 
penetrate deeper into the skin so if
you're<00:02:53.750> putting<00:02:54.049> them<00:02:54.170> over<00:02:54.799> something<00:02:55.190> else

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
you're putting them over something else

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.670 
you're putting them over something else
they're<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.819> always<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.680> penetrate

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
they're not always going to penetrate

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.729 
they're not always going to penetrate
through<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.730> serums<00:02:59.720> first<00:03:00.019> all<00:03:00.260> over

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
through that so serums first all over

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.340 
through that so serums first all over
the<00:03:00.830> face<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.340> then<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:02.269> can<00:03:02.420> pop<00:03:02.840> on<00:03:02.870> with

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
the face and then you can pop on with

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.970 
the face and then you can pop on with
your<00:03:03.590> choice<00:03:04.130> pot<00:03:04.850> treatment<00:03:05.269> okay<00:03:05.980> again

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
your choice pot treatment okay again

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.350 
your choice pot treatment okay again
because<00:03:07.430> your<00:03:07.610> serum<00:03:07.880> may<00:03:08.000> not<00:03:08.150> penetrate

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
because your serum may not penetrate

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.150 
because your serum may not penetrate
through<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.350> chances<00:03:09.680> are<00:03:09.799> your<00:03:09.890> serums

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
through this and chances are your serums

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.890 
through this and chances are your serums
