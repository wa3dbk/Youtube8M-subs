 I do not know how many times they deleted me from the list and let me die. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.800
 So this is not new. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.000
 Bounty hunters. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 I've been chasing him for 10 years. 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.800
 He's the most dangerous guy we've ever spotted. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 The fee has doubled. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.500
 I came to get your head in a box right here. 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.000
 The same over again.. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 There will be blood. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.800
 He is a man who sees in the darkness. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.200
 Beware of surprise attacks. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 What is; 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.800
 - Rhindi. - There's one. 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 Three. You can see where this is leading. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.700
 Keep the property. 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.100
 What happens; 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.300
 End of time. 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.500
 Yes. Let's free him. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:10.000

 You are not afraid of the darkness, right?
