00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.900
 joystick 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.320
 two keys with the program called 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.740
 ex father I leave you download link no 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.770
 escape 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.070
 so they can get it 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.520
 so it's already once once downloaded 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.120
 we go to downloads opens opens the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.120
 former father 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.210
 they execute it 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.790
 it puts you to be and to be again 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.250
 they already put their 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.030
 [Music] 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.149
 your preferred language 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.300
 very well I already have it then of this 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.760
 way I'm going to open all this that 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.750
 it comes out to me here are my configurations 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.440
 because you worry about them going out 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.570
 how did you see right now 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.680
 previously if I open a former father 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.500
 with a new document and here where it says 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.380
 you are going to put on opening in the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.200
 folder that you saw here well go 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 to put your control of preference 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:23.020
 I have this one from xbox and play 3 360 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.260
 Well, many eggs come with 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.960
 the 360 ​​by the microsoft delegation 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.830
 that's how we open that, we're going to give it 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.820
 in sticks 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.710
 we will activate it right here says 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.190
 move it to the left towards the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.100
 right and the other two will come out 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.840
 default 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.920
 we activate the right equally 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.030
 left right and the others also 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.030
 here as you can see from the side 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.980
 simulating for that stimulator this the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.740
 movements of the keys that go to 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.030
 to assign 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.090
 this 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.969
 then 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.610
 now we go with the crosshead going up 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.550
 down left of letter and we arrange it 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.250
 was to accommodate is extremely personal 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.540
 also what of the image that already depends 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.170
 of each one on the buttons sometimes 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.420
 we put 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.840
 in our control we press the buttons 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.709
 we want to start with the and the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.040
 lx since we move it respectively 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.489
 where they correspond 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.489
 everyone 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.720
 and they can see how it works now itself 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.720
 that the left trigger 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.870
 straight 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.329
 the r1 r2 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.540
 the select button 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.540
 to be 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.730
 the buttons are from those of the can be 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.430
 of three on three analog models 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.750
 giving the applicants tighten the two 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.750
 they place them 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.990
 after this they put me to accept and 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.990
 prayer here 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:29.640
 at home most of the eggs 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.970
 as can know the direction it 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.850
 of game so the doll that they go to 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.430
 directing is that employee with the keys 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.319
 wast if we are going to put we are going to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.290
 click on it will appear 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.340
 this keyboard 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:52.200
 and we will assign the w key what do you want 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.710
 say forward ws back 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.380
 key 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.920
 and then the others respectively how 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.950
 is the game here so I know these 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.210
 move the look we put the mouse 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.210
 because with those you direct 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.260
 an arrow to where it corresponds 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.540
 and then to see for example let's say that 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:24.389
 to shoot the market or any 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.389
 thing most of the time the space 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.509
 or space but want to call then 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.509
 also because the r why not 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.580
 w this is a saying nothing more 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.620
 then if you what you want is 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.830
 assign two letters now a button 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.070
 because it happens to happen in some cases 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.190
 with some games that are like 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.750
 they have like more 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.980
 like more actions 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.980
 click here 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.810
 then they are going to advanced 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:10.270
 here they stay with the other functions 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:14.560
 then they give him here 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.540
 and they will press the key on their keyboard 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.690
 that you want or the one that corresponds 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.870
 to be able to play his game well as he 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.790
 see him for example let's put the j 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.130
 then already and we give to accept 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.169
 we close this and here as you can see 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:35.110
 appears 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.110
 the space the spacebar and the j 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.870
 you can put several more 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:46.460
 they put on lacquer and they accept and that's how they go 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.630
 putting this east successively 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.250
 program is very good for some for 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.980
 some games where they do not have the 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.720
 gamepad configuration and put 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.260
 obviously 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.760
 we do not have control of xbox 360 which is 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.550
 what we need for the eggs of 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:11.140
 microsoft then that's all I hope 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.140
 what has worked for them and this 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.880
 and puss comment about likes ask questions 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.800
 or that I will answer that as you can see 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.800
 everything works perfectly well
