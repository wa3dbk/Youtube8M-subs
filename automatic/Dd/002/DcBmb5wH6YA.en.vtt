00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.870 
yeah and I think people don't understand
not<00:01:48.780> basically<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.890> happens<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.610> with

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
not basically that what happens is with

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.100 
not basically that what happens is with
cancer<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.899> major<00:01:52.259> cancerous

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
cancer is the major cancerous

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.110 
cancer is the major cancerous
are<00:01:53.380> using<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.650> same<00:01:53.830> protocol<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:54.970> it's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
are using the same protocol because it's

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.520 
are using the same protocol because it's
the<00:01:55.210> same<00:01:55.420> specialist<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.200> are<00:01:56.290> doing<00:01:56.380> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the same specialist that are doing the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.500 
the same specialist that are doing the
same<00:01:56.560> their<00:01:57.130> limit<00:01:57.400> entering<00:01:57.790> these<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:58.180> males

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
same their limit entering these is males

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.090 
same their limit entering these is males
and<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.870> course<00:01:59.110> there's<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.500> place<00:01:59.740> for<00:01:59.770> those

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
and of course there's a place for those

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.800 
and of course there's a place for those
protocols<00:02:00.430> they<00:02:00.700> have<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> place<00:02:01.180> in<00:02:01.210> cancer

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
protocols they have a place in cancer

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.150 
protocols they have a place in cancer
treatment<00:02:02.200> but<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.350> lot<00:02:02.620> of<00:02:02.740> times<00:02:02.980> with

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
treatment but a lot of times with

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.040 
treatment but a lot of times with
advanced<00:02:03.640> cancers<00:02:04.030> more<00:02:04.180> difficult<00:02:04.630> cancers

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
advanced cancers more difficult cancers

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.780 
advanced cancers more difficult cancers
but<00:02:05.590> they're<00:02:05.710> not<00:02:05.830> as<00:02:05.980> effective<00:02:06.400> as<00:02:06.490> people

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
but they're not as effective as people

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.910 
but they're not as effective as people
believe<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.480> so<00:02:08.350> what<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.590> want<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.860> to

other cancer centers and in vino Medical

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.760 
other cancer centers and in vino Medical
Center<00:02:48.010> was<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:49.090> were<00:02:49.209> educated<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:50.020> why<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.380> got

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
Center was we were educated on why I got

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.310 
Center was we were educated on why I got
cancer<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.400> how<00:02:51.580> important<00:02:52.360> nutrition<00:02:53.110> plays

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
cancer and how important nutrition plays

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.680 
cancer and how important nutrition plays
into<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> factor<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.370> then<00:02:54.850> rebuilding<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
into a factor and then rebuilding the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.229 
into a factor and then rebuilding the
immune<00:02:56.050> system<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.770> how<00:02:57.250> immunotherapy<00:02:58.209> is

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
immune system and how immunotherapy is

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.390 
immune system and how immunotherapy is
so<00:02:58.660> important<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.380> fighting<00:02:59.860> any<00:03:00.070> chronic

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
so important in fighting any chronic

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.509 
so important in fighting any chronic
disease<00:03:00.790> not<00:03:01.090> just<00:03:01.150> cancer<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.920> that

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
disease not just cancer and and that

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.090 
disease not just cancer and and that
became<00:03:04.299> an<00:03:04.450> education<00:03:05.260> for<00:03:05.530> us<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:05.799> became

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
became an education for us this became

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.430 
became an education for us this became
an<00:03:06.220> education<00:03:06.880> source<00:03:07.209> for<00:03:07.540> us<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:08.230> it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
an education source for us that it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.530 
an education source for us that it
fueled<00:03:08.799> us<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.310> find<00:03:09.610> out<00:03:09.790> more<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.239> why

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
fueled us to find out more and why

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.110 
fueled us to find out more and why
didn't<00:03:11.440> other<00:03:11.680> people<00:03:12.100> know<00:03:12.310> about<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:12.850> why

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
didn't other people know about this why

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.640 
didn't other people know about this why
weren't<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.780> traditional<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.500> conventional

weren't the traditional and conventional

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.300 
weren't the traditional and conventional

teaching or the same principles and it

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.420 
teaching or the same principles and it
was<00:03:22.540> common<00:03:23.140> sense<00:03:23.560> for<00:03:23.650> us<00:03:23.769> but<00:03:23.980> when<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.220> came

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
was common sense for us but when it came

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.630 
was common sense for us but when it came
to<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.360> family<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.440> common<00:03:26.860> sense<00:03:27.160> wasn't

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
to the family the common sense wasn't

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.330 
to the family the common sense wasn't
there<00:03:27.820> because<00:03:28.180> they<00:03:28.450> didn't<00:03:28.989> know<00:03:29.250> from<00:03:30.250> an

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
there because they didn't know from an
