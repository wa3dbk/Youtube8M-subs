it's very it's more tube all the way

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.450 
it's very it's more tube all the way
through<00:03:33.210> with<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> grip<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.920> perfect

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460

the<00:03:35.580> handle<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.030> little<00:03:36.270> bit<00:03:36.390> bigger<00:03:36.630> than

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
the handle is a little bit bigger than

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.860 
the handle is a little bit bigger than
the<00:03:36.930> wood<00:03:37.140> lower<00:03:37.350> which<00:03:37.620> quite<00:03:38.100> honestly<00:03:38.160> is

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
the wood lower which quite honestly is

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.120 
the wood lower which quite honestly is
probably<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.110> little<00:03:40.350> bit<00:03:40.440> small<00:03:40.770> for<00:03:40.800> my

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
probably just a little bit small for my

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.400 
probably just a little bit small for my
hands<00:03:41.550> but<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.240> works<00:03:42.480> nice<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:42.990> this<00:03:43.140> one<00:03:43.290> is

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
hands but it works nice but this one is

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.990 
hands but it works nice but this one is
a<00:03:43.440> little<00:03:43.530> bit<00:03:43.800> larger<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.250> Fitz<00:03:44.580> Fitz

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
a little bit larger and Fitz Fitz

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.630 
a little bit larger and Fitz Fitz
excellent<00:03:45.780> yeah<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.710> great<00:03:46.890> handle<00:03:47.430> and

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
excellent yeah it's a great handle and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.580 
excellent yeah it's a great handle and
it's<00:03:48.270> also<00:03:48.450> with<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.870> little<00:03:49.020> sweep<00:03:49.350> there

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
it's also with that little sweep there

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.840 
it's also with that little sweep there
too<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:49.950> because<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.250> got<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.490> weight<00:03:50.700> of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
too and because you got the weight of

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.880 
too and because you got the weight of
the<00:03:50.940> tip<00:03:51.150> now<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:52.110> isn't<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.470> chopper

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
the tip now this isn't a chopper

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.320 
the tip now this isn't a chopper
obviously<00:03:53.460> I<00:03:53.520> wouldn't<00:03:53.670> use<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.880> small<00:03:54.150> knife

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
obviously I wouldn't use a small knife

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.850 
obviously I wouldn't use a small knife
for<00:03:54.510> chopping<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.050> if<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.260> wanted<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.590> trim

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
for chopping but if I wanted to trim

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.800 
for chopping but if I wanted to trim
some<00:03:55.890> some<00:03:56.520> limbs<00:03:56.760> off<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> small<00:03:57.330> branch<00:03:57.540> or

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
some some limbs off a small branch or

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.870 
some some limbs off a small branch or
something<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.920> got<00:03:59.070> plenty<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.400> room<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.670> get

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
something you got plenty of room to get

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.000 
something you got plenty of room to get
three<00:04:00.120> fingers<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.540> here<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.590> whip<00:04:01.830> them

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
three fingers in here and just whip them

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.640 
three fingers in here and just whip them
off<00:04:02.160> real<00:04:02.430> quick<00:04:03.050> which<00:04:04.050> is<00:04:04.200> what<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.440> can<00:04:04.560> do

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
off real quick which is what you can do

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.010 
off real quick which is what you can do
with<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.860> nesma<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.490> what<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> thought<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:06.960> is

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
with the nesma to what I thought this is

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.650 
with the nesma to what I thought this is
a<00:04:07.170> definitely<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.920> nice<00:04:08.100> blade<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.760> honestly<00:04:09.570> I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
a definitely a nice blade and honestly I

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.120 
a definitely a nice blade and honestly I
haven't<00:04:09.840> had<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.050> lot<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.260> chance<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.680> use<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.830> at

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
haven't had a lot of chance to use it at

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.680 
haven't had a lot of chance to use it at
that<00:04:11.430> was<00:04:11.610> what's<00:04:11.820> going<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.060> be<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.270> weekend
