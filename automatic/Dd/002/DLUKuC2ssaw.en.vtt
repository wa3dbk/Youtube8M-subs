Steve<00:00:10.530> there<00:00:11.530> are<00:00:11.679> two<00:00:11.860> really<00:00:12.039> interesting

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
Steve there are two really interesting

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.060 
Steve there are two really interesting
papers<00:00:12.789> about<00:00:13.000> inclusion<00:00:13.389> body<00:00:14.019> myositis<00:00:14.349> and

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
papers about inclusion body myositis and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.880 
papers about inclusion body myositis and
it's<00:00:15.429> a<00:00:15.490> disease<00:00:15.789> that<00:00:15.849> we<00:00:16.090> often<00:00:16.480> don't<00:00:16.890> talk

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
it's a disease that we often don't talk

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.230 
it's a disease that we often don't talk
about<00:00:18.039> that<00:00:18.279> much<00:00:18.490> because<00:00:18.820> we<00:00:18.939> don't<00:00:19.090> have<00:00:19.180> a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
about that much because we don't have a

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.909 
about that much because we don't have a
diagnosis<00:00:19.990> or<00:00:20.259> we<00:00:20.349> don't<00:00:20.410> have<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.590> diagnostic

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
diagnosis or we don't have a diagnostic

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.040 
diagnosis or we don't have a diagnostic
test<00:00:21.400> or<00:00:21.610> a<00:00:21.669> real<00:00:21.820> good<00:00:22.210> treatment<00:00:22.689> for<00:00:22.869> but<00:00:23.020> I

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
test or a real good treatment for but I

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.300 
test or a real good treatment for but I
was<00:00:23.500> wondering<00:00:23.710> there<00:00:24.039> are<00:00:24.130> really

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
was wondering there are really

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.950 
was wondering there are really
interesting<00:00:24.669> papers<00:00:24.970> about<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.270> diagnosis

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
interesting papers about the diagnosis

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.839 
interesting papers about the diagnosis
and<00:00:26.259> the<00:00:26.710> actual<00:00:26.980> potential<00:00:27.340> treatment<00:00:27.730> for

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
and the actual potential treatment for

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.909 
and the actual potential treatment for
IBM<00:00:28.360> and<00:00:28.989> I<00:00:29.079> wonder<00:00:29.410> if<00:00:29.529> you<00:00:29.649> could<00:00:29.739> actually

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
IBM and I wonder if you could actually

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.100 
IBM and I wonder if you could actually
maybe<00:00:30.160> start<00:00:30.579> by<00:00:30.730> just<00:00:30.910> describing<00:00:31.419> briefly

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
maybe start by just describing briefly

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.600 
maybe start by just describing briefly
about<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:33.600> diagnosis<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:35.200> how<00:00:35.500> one<00:00:36.010> goes

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
about the diagnosis and how one goes

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.729 
about the diagnosis and how one goes
about<00:00:36.670> establishing<00:00:37.450> that<00:00:37.870> well<00:00:38.559> it's

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
about establishing that well it's

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.069 
about establishing that well it's
interesting<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.460> years<00:00:40.210> ago<00:00:40.510> because<00:00:40.899> there

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
interesting a years ago because there

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.380 
interesting a years ago because there
was<00:00:41.200> inflammation<00:00:41.860> on<00:00:41.950> a<00:00:42.040> muscle<00:00:42.220> biopsy<00:00:42.520> it

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
was inflammation on a muscle biopsy it

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.090 
was inflammation on a muscle biopsy it
was<00:00:43.540> thought<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:43.780> be<00:00:43.990> a<00:00:44.140> chronic<00:00:44.590> form<00:00:45.010> of

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
was thought to be a chronic form of

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.950 
was thought to be a chronic form of
polymyositis<00:00:45.550> that<00:00:46.210> didn't<00:00:46.450> respond<00:00:46.840> to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
polymyositis that didn't respond to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.990 
polymyositis that didn't respond to
treatment<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.860> then<00:00:48.130> somebody<00:00:48.520> figured<00:00:48.850> out

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
treatment and then somebody figured out

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.200 
treatment and then somebody figured out
that<00:00:49.239> there<00:00:49.480> were<00:00:49.600> these<00:00:49.840> funny<00:00:50.260> inclusions

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that there were these funny inclusions

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780 
that there were these funny inclusions
inside<00:00:52.210> muscle<00:00:52.540> cells<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.860> got<00:00:54.040> named

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
inside muscle cells and it got named

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.330 
inside muscle cells and it got named
inclusion<00:00:55.360> body<00:00:55.540> myositis<00:00:55.950> there's<00:00:56.950> actually

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
inclusion body myositis there's actually

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.970 
inclusion body myositis there's actually
a<00:00:57.399> clinical<00:00:57.989> pattern<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.200> weakness<00:00:59.620> it's<00:00:59.860> an

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
a clinical pattern of weakness it's an

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.370 
a clinical pattern of weakness it's an
older<00:01:00.280> people<00:01:00.610> more<00:01:00.880> men<00:01:01.120> than<00:01:01.329> women<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.809> the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
older people more men than women and the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.410 
older people more men than women and the
weakness<00:01:02.770> is<00:01:02.980> asymmetrical<00:01:03.880> it<00:01:04.000> particularly

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
weakness is asymmetrical it particularly

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.749 
weakness is asymmetrical it particularly
gets<00:01:04.750> quadriceps<00:01:05.409> muscles<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.070> finger

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
gets quadriceps muscles and finger

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.870 
gets quadriceps muscles and finger
flexors<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:07.840> we<00:01:08.020> in<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.500> majority<00:01:09.250> of<00:01:09.280> cases<00:01:09.490> you

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
flexors so we in a majority of cases you

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.690 
flexors so we in a majority of cases you
actually<00:01:09.909> think<00:01:10.689> about<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.170> diagnosis<00:01:11.950> when

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
actually think about that diagnosis when

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.330 
actually think about that diagnosis when
you<00:01:12.820> do<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.090> biopsy<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:13.780> may<00:01:14.229> not<00:01:14.560> find<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
you do the biopsy you may not find the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.210 
you do the biopsy you may not find the
inclusions<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.360> do<00:01:16.600> if<00:01:16.870> you<00:01:17.110> see<00:01:17.409> them<00:01:17.650> it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
inclusions you do if you see them it

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.890 
inclusions you do if you see them it
certainly<00:01:18.490> helps<00:01:18.940> you<00:01:19.030> with<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.240> diagnosis

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
certainly helps you with the diagnosis

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.600 
certainly helps you with the diagnosis
but<00:01:20.080> there's<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.350> certain<00:01:20.890> percentage<00:01:21.460> of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
but there's a certain percentage of

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.969 
but there's a certain percentage of
patients<00:01:21.820> where<00:01:22.330> we're<00:01:22.990> not<00:01:23.110> sure<00:01:23.440> we<00:01:23.770> see

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
patients where we're not sure we see

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.240 
patients where we're not sure we see
inflammation<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.299> we<00:01:26.049> don't<00:01:26.229> know<00:01:26.320> is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
inflammation and and we don't know is

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.550 
inflammation and and we don't know is
this<00:01:27.640> polymyositis<00:01:28.210> or<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.110> inclusion

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
this polymyositis or is it inclusion

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.850 
this polymyositis or is it inclusion
body<00:01:29.740> myositis<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.810> sounds<00:01:32.200> like<00:01:32.260> over

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
body myositis it's so sounds like over

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.230 
body myositis it's so sounds like over
the<00:01:32.950> years<00:01:32.979> we've<00:01:33.369> all<00:01:33.549> kind<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.880> made<00:01:34.060> this

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
the years we've all kind of made this

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.630 
the years we've all kind of made this
diagnosis<00:01:34.930> by<00:01:35.080> phenotype<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.100> actually<00:01:36.549> if

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
diagnosis by phenotype and actually if

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.310 
diagnosis by phenotype and actually if
necessary<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.180> muscle<00:01:37.450> biopsy<00:01:37.930> but<00:01:38.080> I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
necessary the muscle biopsy but I

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.020 
necessary the muscle biopsy but I
noticed<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.070> real<00:01:39.220> interesting<00:01:39.640> study<00:01:39.880> that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
noticed a real interesting study that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.840 
noticed a real interesting study that
actually<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.570> possibility<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:41.409> even<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.979> blood

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
actually the possibility of even a blood

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.380 
actually the possibility of even a blood
sample<00:01:43.150> or<00:01:43.420> serum<00:01:43.689> sample<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.260> actually<00:01:44.560> help

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
sample or serum sample to actually help

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.820 
sample or serum sample to actually help
establish<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.600> diagnosis<00:01:47.260> can<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.560> kind<00:01:47.770> of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
establish the diagnosis can you kind of

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.710 
establish the diagnosis can you kind of
review<00:01:48.070> that<00:01:48.100> study<00:01:48.460> with<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.790> yeah<00:01:48.939> so<00:01:49.479> this

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
review that study with it yeah so this

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.590 
review that study with it yeah so this
was<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.900> study<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.439> 200<00:01:51.010> patients<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:51.909> they

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
was a study of 200 patients and they

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.359 
was a study of 200 patients and they
were<00:01:52.659> looking<00:01:52.869> at<00:01:53.200> an<00:01:53.350> antibody<00:01:53.890> called<00:01:54.280> a

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
were looking at an antibody called a

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.920 
were looking at an antibody called a
nucleotide<00:01:54.790> ease<00:01:55.210> which<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.750> the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
nucleotide ease which is in the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.620 
nucleotide ease which is in the
cytoplasm<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.100> muscle<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.330> binds

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
cytoplasm of the muscle and it binds

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.580 
cytoplasm of the muscle and it binds
around<00:01:59.229> those<00:02:00.509> inclusion<00:02:01.509> bodies<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.140> around

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
around those inclusion bodies and around

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.030 
around those inclusion bodies and around
the<00:02:02.830> new<00:02:03.040> perinuclear<00:02:04.030> area<00:02:04.420> as<00:02:04.540> well<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.200> it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
the new perinuclear area as well and it

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.100 
the new perinuclear area as well and it
was<00:02:06.159> very<00:02:06.400> interesting<00:02:06.700> because<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:08.079> was

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
was very interesting because it was

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.050 
was very interesting because it was
really<00:02:08.500> specific<00:02:08.739> for<00:02:09.129> inclusion<00:02:09.909> body

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
really specific for inclusion body

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.050 
really specific for inclusion body
myositis<00:02:10.329> I<00:02:10.929> think<00:02:11.110> 92%<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.010> patients<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
myositis I think 92% of patients the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.050 
myositis I think 92% of patients the
problem<00:02:13.659> was<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.110> wasn't<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.400> sensitivity

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
problem was it wasn't the sensitivity

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.050 
problem was it wasn't the sensitivity
was<00:02:16.209> only<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> 70<00:02:17.290> 72<00:02:18.040> percent<00:02:18.550> somewhere<00:02:18.940> in

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
was only a 70 72 percent somewhere in

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.510 
was only a 70 72 percent somewhere in
that<00:02:19.090> range<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.560> they're<00:02:20.980> still<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
that range and so they're still going to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.070 
that range and so they're still going to
be<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.700> third<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.150> patients<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.720> you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
be a third of patients that you

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.900 
be a third of patients that you
be<00:02:23.230> able<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.470> use<00:02:23.740> this<00:02:23.980> test<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.520> that's

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
be able to use this test and that's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.940 
be able to use this test and that's
about<00:02:25.240> what<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.810> now<00:02:26.050> because<00:02:26.590> for<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
about what we have now because for the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.460 
about what we have now because for the
vast<00:02:27.160> majority<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.760> patients<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:28.960> find<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
vast majority of patients we find the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.260 
vast majority of patients we find the
inclusions<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.280> call<00:02:30.550> an<00:02:30.700> inclusion<00:02:31.120> body

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
inclusions and we call an inclusion body

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.710 
inclusions and we call an inclusion body
myositis<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.650> very<00:02:33.150> 30%<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.540> would

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
myositis so the very 30% that you would

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.080 
myositis so the very 30% that you would
like<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.560> an<00:02:35.770> added<00:02:36.130> test<00:02:36.460> this<00:02:36.730> isn't

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
like to have an added test this isn't

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.740 
like to have an added test this isn't
quite<00:02:37.270> there<00:02:37.480> yet

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
quite there yet

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.260 
quite there yet
so<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.620> interesting<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:39.100> actually<00:02:39.550> measures

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
so it's interesting it actually measures

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.940 
so it's interesting it actually measures
an<00:02:40.570> antibody<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.320> blood

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
an antibody in the blood

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.450 
an antibody in the blood
that<00:02:42.400> actually<00:02:42.790> binds<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.230> cytosol<00:02:45.220> ik

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
that actually binds to this cytosol ik

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.630 
that actually binds to this cytosol ik
kind<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.470> protein<00:02:47.470> that's<00:02:47.770> found<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.310> patients

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
kind of protein that's found in patients

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.850 
kind of protein that's found in patients
with<00:02:48.730> inclusion<00:02:49.150> body<00:02:49.300> myositis<00:02:49.710> yeah<00:02:50.710> it's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
with inclusion body myositis yeah it's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.740 
with inclusion body myositis yeah it's
actually<00:02:51.220> interesting<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.330> would<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.600> not

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
actually interesting I would have not

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.540 
actually interesting I would have not
have<00:02:53.140> thought<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.650> actually<00:02:54.400> as<00:02:54.520> a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
have thought of that actually as a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.910 
have thought of that actually as a
potential<00:02:55.000> role<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.480> diagnosing<00:02:56.020> IBM<00:02:56.650> and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
potential role for diagnosing IBM and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.710 
potential role for diagnosing IBM and
this<00:02:57.220> gets<00:02:57.430> into<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> whole<00:02:58.030> mechanism<00:02:58.240> of

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
this gets into the whole mechanism of

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.420 
this gets into the whole mechanism of
what's<00:02:58.840> going<00:02:59.110> on<00:02:59.260> this<00:02:59.500> disease<00:02:59.920> because

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
what's going on this disease because

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.550 
what's going on this disease because
there<00:03:00.670> are<00:03:00.730> two<00:03:00.850> camps<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:02.230> they're<00:03:02.350> probably

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
there are two camps and they're probably

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.390 
there are two camps and they're probably
both<00:03:02.800> right<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.760> one<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.450> inflammatory

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
both right the one is the inflammatory

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.010 
both right the one is the inflammatory
but<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.820> doesn't<00:03:07.270> respond<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.840> know

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
but it doesn't respond to you know

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.110 
but it doesn't respond to you know
suppressive<00:03:08.560> agents<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.700> other<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.090> a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
suppressive agents and the other is a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.960 
suppressive agents and the other is a
degenerative<00:03:10.810> process<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.459> this

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
degenerative process and so this

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.440 
degenerative process and so this
antibody<00:03:13.600> appears<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.440> bind<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.830> two

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
antibody appears to bind to the two

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.430 
antibody appears to bind to the two
receptors<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.630> are<00:03:19.780> related<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.410> a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
receptors that are related to a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.620 
receptors that are related to a
degenerative<00:03:21.190> process<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.300> kind<00:03:22.540> of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
degenerative process and so it kind of

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.510 
degenerative process and so it kind of
implies<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.110> that's<00:03:23.680> what's<00:03:23.890> going<00:03:24.190> on<00:03:24.340> in

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
implies that that's what's going on in

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.670 
implies that that's what's going on in
the<00:03:24.640> illness<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.510> sounds<00:03:25.750> like<00:03:25.810> Oh<00:03:26.110> before

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the illness so it sounds like Oh before

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.470 
the illness so it sounds like Oh before
this<00:03:27.040> gets<00:03:27.250> ready<00:03:27.489> for<00:03:27.550> primetime<00:03:27.880> we'll<00:03:28.330> have

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
this gets ready for primetime we'll have

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.220 
this gets ready for primetime we'll have
to<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:30.430> further<00:03:30.670> studies<00:03:31.150> larger<00:03:31.690> samples

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
to have further studies larger samples

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.420 
to have further studies larger samples
better<00:03:32.860> spectrum<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.940> patients<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:35.430> any

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
better spectrum of patients and any

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.160 
better spectrum of patients and any
ideas<00:03:36.910> or<00:03:37.060> where<00:03:37.239> two<00:03:37.360> neurologists<00:03:37.870> go<00:03:37.989> from

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
ideas or where two neurologists go from

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.780 
ideas or where two neurologists go from
here<00:03:38.410> in<00:03:38.470> terms<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.920> diagnosis<00:03:39.489> are<00:03:39.670> we

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
here in terms of the diagnosis are we

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.310 
here in terms of the diagnosis are we
ready<00:03:39.970> for<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.269> test<00:03:40.570> yet<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.900> think<00:03:41.110> I

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
ready for this test yet you think I

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.650 
ready for this test yet you think I
think<00:03:41.650> you're<00:03:41.800> right<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.280> has<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.670> have

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
think you're right that it has to have

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.140 
think you're right that it has to have
more<00:03:44.320> study<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.920> find<00:03:45.190> out<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.670> validity<00:03:45.880> of

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
more study to find out the validity of

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.330 
more study to find out the validity of
it<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:46.660> in<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.170> long<00:03:47.380> run<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.680> think<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.190> has

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
it in in the long run I think it has

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.490 
it in in the long run I think it has
tremendous<00:03:48.880> potential<00:03:49.330> but<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.110> don't<00:03:50.350> think

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
tremendous potential but I don't think

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.750 
tremendous potential but I don't think
we're<00:03:50.709> ready<00:03:50.830> yet<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:51.370> we're<00:03:51.610> going<00:03:51.700> to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
we're ready yet I think we're going to

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.490 
we're ready yet I think we're going to
need<00:03:51.940> confirmation<00:03:52.450> we<00:03:52.930> have<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.200> make<00:03:53.350> sure

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
need confirmation we have to make sure

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.850 
need confirmation we have to make sure
that<00:03:53.680> we<00:03:53.800> don't<00:03:53.920> have<00:03:55.019> false<00:03:56.019> positives<00:03:56.650> as

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
that we don't have false positives as

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.009 
that we don't have false positives as
well<00:03:57.100> as<00:03:57.280> have<00:03:57.459> increased<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.239> sensitivity

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
well as have increased that sensitivity

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.720 
well as have increased that sensitivity
where<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.530> really<00:03:59.769> will<00:04:00.070> help<00:04:00.340> us<00:04:00.459> with<00:04:00.640> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
where it really will help us with the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.090 
where it really will help us with the
diagnosis<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.080> moving<00:04:02.620> after<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
diagnosis and so moving after the

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.820 
diagnosis and so moving after the
treatment<00:04:03.550> there<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:03.670> another<00:04:04.650> abstract<00:04:05.650> and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
treatment there is another abstract and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.170 
treatment there is another abstract and
study<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.190> was<00:04:06.340> published<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:06.820> terms<00:04:07.030> of

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
study that was published in terms of

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.699 
study that was published in terms of
actually<00:04:07.480> now<00:04:07.630> moving<00:04:07.870> into<00:04:08.140> potential

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
actually now moving into potential

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.259 
actually now moving into potential
treatments<00:04:09.190> for<00:04:09.280> IBM<00:04:09.580> can<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:09.790> review<00:04:10.120> with

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
treatments for IBM can you review with

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.910 
treatments for IBM can you review with
us<00:04:10.360> kind<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.570> what<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.810> standards<00:04:11.500> are<00:04:11.650> now

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
us kind of what the standards are now

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.590 
us kind of what the standards are now
for<00:04:12.190> potential<00:04:12.640> treatments<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.209> where<00:04:13.420> this

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
for potential treatments and where this

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.500 
for potential treatments and where this
new<00:04:14.170> study<00:04:14.440> fits<00:04:14.800> in<00:04:15.010> well<00:04:15.640> this<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:16.060> very

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
new study fits in well this is very

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.360 
new study fits in well this is very
exciting<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.320> I'm<00:04:17.440> hoping<00:04:17.830> that<00:04:18.010> this<00:04:18.160> is

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
exciting and I'm hoping that this is

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.159 
exciting and I'm hoping that this is
going<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.609> be<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.790> breakthrough<00:04:19.180> as<00:04:19.690> I

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
going to be a breakthrough as I

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.500 
going to be a breakthrough as I
mentioned<00:04:20.709> for<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.549> most<00:04:21.640> part<00:04:22.060> patients

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
mentioned for the most part patients

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.150 
mentioned for the most part patients
don't<00:04:22.660> respond<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.290> immunosuppressive

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
don't respond to immunosuppressive

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.969 
don't respond to immunosuppressive
agents<00:04:24.310> they<00:04:25.200> sometimes<00:04:26.200> if<00:04:26.650> there's<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.919> lot

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
agents they sometimes if there's a lot

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.710 
agents they sometimes if there's a lot
of<00:04:27.220> inflammation<00:04:27.520> present<00:04:28.360> you'll<00:04:28.479> see<00:04:28.690> a

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
of inflammation present you'll see a

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.540 
of inflammation present you'll see a
little<00:04:29.110> bit<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.620> response<00:04:30.130> but<00:04:30.400> it's

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
little bit of a response but it's

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.980 
little bit of a response but it's
temporary<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.150> they<00:04:31.419> continue<00:04:31.960> to

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
temporary and they continue to

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.010 
temporary and they continue to
deteriorate<00:04:32.500> over<00:04:32.830> time<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.479> this<00:04:34.720> group

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
deteriorate over time and so this group

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.910 
deteriorate over time and so this group
and<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.440> was

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
and it was

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.710 
and it was
I<00:04:36.010> have<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.520> emphasize<00:04:36.640> as<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.090> very<00:04:37.390> small

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
I have to emphasize as a very small

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.410 
I have to emphasize as a very small
study<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.290> was<00:04:38.440> only<00:04:38.650> 14<00:04:39.130> patients<00:04:39.370> but<00:04:40.210> they

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
study it was only 14 patients but they

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.300 
study it was only 14 patients but they
looked<00:04:41.200> at<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:42.720> block<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.140> antibody<00:04:44.650> that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
looked at a block and the antibody that

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.510 
looked at a block and the antibody that
blocks<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:46.110> active<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.230> receptor<00:04:47.800> which<00:04:48.310> is

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
blocks the active in receptor which is

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.670 
blocks the active in receptor which is
part<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:49.060> growth<00:04:49.780> factor<00:04:49.990> it's<00:04:50.410> called<00:04:50.590> a

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
part of a growth factor it's called a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.800 
part of a growth factor it's called a
transforming<00:04:51.310> growth<00:04:51.490> factor<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:52.330> so<00:04:52.660> they

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
transforming growth factor and so they

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.630 
transforming growth factor and so they
designed<00:04:53.230> this<00:04:53.410> study<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.890> said<00:04:54.070> well<00:04:54.340> gee<00:04:54.490> if

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
designed this study and said well gee if

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.480 
designed this study and said well gee if
this<00:04:54.760> degeneration<00:04:55.570> is<00:04:55.720> going<00:04:56.050> on<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.620> can

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
this degeneration is going on and it can

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.640 
this degeneration is going on and it can
we<00:04:57.700> block<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.330> from<00:04:58.570> happening<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:59.230> active

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
we block that from happening this active

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.910 
we block that from happening this active
process<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:01.210> they<00:05:01.420> they<00:05:01.840> measured<00:05:02.320> the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
process and so they they measured the

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.470 
process and so they they measured the
primary<00:05:03.340> measure<00:05:03.520> was<00:05:03.790> they<00:05:03.910> looked<00:05:04.120> at<00:05:04.240> thigh

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
primary measure was they looked at thigh

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.750 
primary measure was they looked at thigh
size<00:05:04.780> remember<00:05:05.170> I<00:05:05.230> said<00:05:05.500> that<00:05:05.530> this<00:05:05.830> affects

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
size remember I said that this affects

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.120 
size remember I said that this affects
the<00:05:06.970> thigh<00:05:07.210> muscles<00:05:07.660> particularly<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.680> the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
the thigh muscles particularly and the

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.070 
the thigh muscles particularly and the
secondary<00:05:09.550> measure<00:05:09.880> was<00:05:10.150> ability<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.870> walk

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
secondary measure was ability to walk

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.380 
secondary measure was ability to walk
and<00:05:11.410> there<00:05:11.710> really<00:05:11.920> was<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.310> suggestion<00:05:12.970> I

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
and there really was a suggestion I

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.230 
and there really was a suggestion I
think<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.260> something<00:05:14.650> like<00:05:14.680> 7%<00:05:15.220> increase<00:05:15.730> in

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
think that something like 7% increase in

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.480 
think that something like 7% increase in
the<00:05:16.330> size<00:05:16.570> of<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.930> thigh<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.440> in<00:05:17.890> just<00:05:18.220> one

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
the size of the thigh and in just one

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.240 
the size of the thigh and in just one
measurement<00:05:18.940> a<00:05:19.630> matter<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.530> weeks<00:05:20.860> later

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
measurement a matter of weeks later

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.400 
measurement a matter of weeks later
eight<00:05:21.670> weeks<00:05:21.940> later<00:05:22.210> they<00:05:22.780> were<00:05:22.900> already<00:05:23.140> able

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
eight weeks later they were already able

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.310 
eight weeks later they were already able
to<00:05:23.650> demonstrate<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.250> so<00:05:24.790> I<00:05:24.820> think<00:05:24.940> this<00:05:25.210> is

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
to demonstrate that so I think this is

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.630 
to demonstrate that so I think this is
maybe<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.470> breakthrough<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.190> people<00:05:27.490> will

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
maybe a breakthrough that people will

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.520 
maybe a breakthrough that people will
really<00:05:27.850> look<00:05:28.180> at<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.300> bigger<00:05:28.540> study<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.320> is<00:05:29.500> a

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
really look at a bigger study this is a

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.280 
really look at a bigger study this is a
monoclonal<00:05:30.100> antibody<00:05:30.760> against<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.450> active

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
monoclonal antibody against this active

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.260 
monoclonal antibody against this active
in<00:05:32.470> 2b<00:05:33.040> receptor<00:05:33.760> that's<00:05:33.910> not<00:05:34.120> actually

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
in 2b receptor that's not actually

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.030 
in 2b receptor that's not actually
supposed<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.810> be<00:05:34.930> kind<00:05:35.080> of<00:05:35.110> over<00:05:35.470> stimulated

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
supposed to be kind of over stimulated

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.710 
supposed to be kind of over stimulated
in<00:05:36.100> IBM<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.640> this<00:05:36.730> actually<00:05:37.030> blocks<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.540> and

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
in IBM and this actually blocks it and

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.930 
in IBM and this actually blocks it and
and<00:05:38.290> and<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:38.920> you<00:05:38.980> could<00:05:39.220> argue<00:05:39.400> well<00:05:39.640> is<00:05:39.790> this

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
and and so you could argue well is this

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.420 
and and so you could argue well is this
are<00:05:40.840> we<00:05:41.020> stopping<00:05:41.290> a<00:05:41.470> degenerative<00:05:42.010> response

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
are we stopping a degenerative response

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.310 
are we stopping a degenerative response
or<00:05:42.640> we<00:05:42.760> stopping<00:05:43.300> an<00:05:43.390> inflammatory<00:05:43.930> response

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
or we stopping an inflammatory response

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.590 
or we stopping an inflammatory response
we<00:05:44.890> still<00:05:45.160> don't<00:05:45.370> know<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:46.090> it<00:05:46.180> sounds<00:05:46.450> like

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
we still don't know so it sounds like

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.930 
we still don't know so it sounds like
here<00:05:46.870> -<00:05:47.160> real<00:05:48.160> real<00:05:48.460> exciting<00:05:49.330> kind<00:05:49.600> of

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
here - real real exciting kind of

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.430 
here - real real exciting kind of
insights<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.300> progress<00:05:52.600> moving<00:05:52.840> forward<00:05:52.960> but

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
insights and progress moving forward but

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.800 
insights and progress moving forward but
probably<00:05:53.830> until<00:05:54.450> larger<00:05:55.450> studies

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
probably until larger studies

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.080 
probably until larger studies
confirmatory<00:05:56.560> trials<00:05:57.130> but<00:05:57.670> certainly<00:05:57.970> it

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
confirmatory trials but certainly it

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.090 
confirmatory trials but certainly it
looks<00:05:58.210> like<00:05:58.360> one's<00:05:58.570> going<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.810> be<00:05:59.040> kind<00:06:00.040> of

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
looks like one's going to be kind of

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.250 
looks like one's going to be kind of
probably<00:06:00.790> scheduled<00:06:01.570> and<00:06:01.780> planned<00:06:02.020> in<00:06:02.170> the

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
probably scheduled and planned in the

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.720 
probably scheduled and planned in the
future<00:06:02.290> I<00:06:02.740> think<00:06:03.130> there's<00:06:03.310> no<00:06:03.490> doubt<00:06:03.700> that

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
future I think there's no doubt that

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:13.270 
future I think there's no doubt that
that'll<00:06:04.180> happen

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.340
