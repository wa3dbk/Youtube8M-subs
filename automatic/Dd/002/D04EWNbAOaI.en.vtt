00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the edges because otherwise it's just

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
the edges because otherwise it's just
got<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.759> doesn't<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.180> much<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
got it it doesn't do much so what I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.330 
got it it doesn't do much so what I
thought<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.830> guess<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.130> apple

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
