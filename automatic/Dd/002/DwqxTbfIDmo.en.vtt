00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
but you have to draw a path from the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.560 
but you have to draw a path from the
plan<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> airport<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.850> ice<00:01:44.970> helicopters

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
and get kind of bored so it would be a

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.499 
and get kind of bored so it would be a
lot<00:02:01.649> higher<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:04.380> hard<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.679> show<00:02:05.280> cuz<00:02:06.179> I<00:02:06.240> uses

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
lot higher it's hard to show cuz I uses

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:15.280 
lot higher it's hard to show cuz I uses
exhale<00:02:06.840> around<00:02:07.140> me

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.809 

I'll<00:02:16.290> probably<00:02:16.650> get<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> point<00:02:17.900> use<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
I'll probably get the point use the

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.160 
I'll probably get the point use the
accelerometer<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.120> move<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> monkey<00:02:21.750> around

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
accelerometer and move the monkey around

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:33.420 
accelerometer and move the monkey around
to<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.190> goal<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:25.520> next<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.819> line<00:02:27.270> rider
