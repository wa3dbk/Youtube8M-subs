00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.280
 good morning good afternoon good night 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:08.170
 well this is how the 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.530
 grill after yesterday 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.719
 we take the covers off and burn it 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.059
 now that I have done with scrap because 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:20.830
 I always work to hire a recycled 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.320
 and I found a tube 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.740
 I have cut the tube into two parts 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.740
 measure 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.759
 I have taken the measure 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.809
 center 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.020
 from the grill until the end of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020
 wheel 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.839
 that measure approximately I give you 28 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.480
 50 because the center of the bar 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.480
 where the meat will be 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.930
 once this is done 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.230
 I have taken from the line that we talked 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.570
 yesterday that is the center I made this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.030
 discount here that's about 130 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 about millimeters that I have taken 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.990
 this measure actually measure 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.600
 you can not do what you want 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.600
 and I've heard a part I've heard 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.820
 this other part if so listened to with a 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.010
 hammer and a club that to one of them 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.450
 I made a hole for him 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.159
 put the wheels 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.619
 then with another piece of scrap 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.570
 also heard to have greater 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.480
 welding I always shook them for 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.610
 I can weld it the best I do not know if it looks 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.130
 always remember to tap first 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.960
 later we will give you because if we 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.620
 we wrong then take out the solder is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.470
 harder always dotted if 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.090
 together we put the squadron always 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.700
 putting the squares so that the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.700
 pipes are always neat 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.100
 here the same with the two asparagus 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.350
 and here we are going to put two pastas 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.530
 on the other side we're just going to put 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.750
 a leg to save iron we are going to 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.459
 put a leg nothing else there we go to 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.630
 put this piece of iron so that 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.180
 have base on the floor 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.580
 I'm going to weld it there and then here 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.390
 let's put some 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.830
 grill or some mesh or something 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.650
 that gives stability to the three legs 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.710
 it is understood good so it is at the moment how 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.180
 our grill is now in 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.180
 As for the tip and I'm going to turn it
