away you know I can't get a runaway so I
want<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.300> real<00:02:34.450> careful<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.410> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
want to be real careful that so you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.320 
want to be real careful that so you
notice<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:35.950> climate<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.760> ODE<00:02:37.090> is

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
notice for climate but the ODE is

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.070 
notice for climate but the ODE is
staying<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> same

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
staying the same

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.500 
staying the same
what's<00:02:38.380> up<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.739> well<00:02:39.489> everybody<00:02:40.060> knows

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
what's up with that well everybody knows

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.020 
what's up with that well everybody knows
I<00:02:40.780> think<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.230> lapse<00:02:41.530> rates<00:02:41.860> don't<00:02:42.610> hold<00:02:42.850> up

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
I think that lapse rates don't hold up

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.810 
I think that lapse rates don't hold up
very<00:02:43.060> well<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:45.720> activities<00:02:46.720> are<00:02:47.820> enabled

DME<00:03:19.220> fix<00:03:19.490> I'll<00:03:19.790> use<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.120> OBS<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.450> set<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:20.990> up

DME fix I'll use the OBS to set that up
and<00:03:21.830> now<00:03:22.100> then<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.220> that's<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.550> desired<00:03:25.850> track

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
