density lipoproteins in this lecture I'm
just<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> talk<00:00:44.399> about<00:00:44.520> HDL<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.480> high

density<00:00:45.840> lipoprotein<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.460> name

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
density lipoprotein as the name

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.100 
density lipoprotein as the name
lipoprotein<00:00:48.270> suggests<00:00:48.660> they<00:00:48.780> contain<00:00:49.079> both

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
lipoprotein suggests they contain both

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.860 
lipoprotein suggests they contain both
lipids<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.219> fat<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.670> proteins<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
lipids which are fat and proteins this

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
lipids which are fat and proteins this
gives<00:00:52.140> them<00:00:52.230> both<00:00:52.440> structure<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:52.920> function

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
gives them both structure and function

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
gives them both structure and function
lipids<00:00:53.969> normally<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.719> water<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
lipids normally do not like water and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
lipids normally do not like water and
that<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.100> say<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.489> hydrophobic

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that is to say that they are hydrophobic

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
that is to say that they are hydrophobic
but<00:00:57.660> attach<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> proteins<00:00:58.710> makes<00:00:59.250> them

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
but attach them to proteins makes them

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
but attach them to proteins makes them
less<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.629> allows<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> move<00:01:01.379> better

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
less so this allows them to move better

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
less so this allows them to move better
around<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> body<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:03.059> effectively<00:01:03.539> for

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
around the body more effectively for

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.289 
around the body more effectively for
various<00:01:04.170> purposes<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.309> made<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.729> 60%

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
various purposes we are made up of 60%

water and so the purpose of lipoprotein

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.789 
water and so the purpose of lipoprotein
is<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.909> transport<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.170> things<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> contain
