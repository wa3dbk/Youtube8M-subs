00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.570
 the whole model has always been for me not 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.160
 I understand what kind of car it is 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.080
 for whom it is good 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.480
 weekly format razdrava allows 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.640
 find the answer not only to these questions but 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.680
 and many others and let the review begin 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.600
 noticed that often in the comments you 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.580
 say that my reviews are not enough 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.440
 critics but get it right i don't take 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.789
 on the test bad car I want 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.300
 you to rate only the most 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 worthy of a chaise like this whole 250 form 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.100
 the tag will start with the exterior in which 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.269
 An example of this model is perfectly visible vector 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.739
 corporate design development 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.409
 latest mercedes 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.569
 I would call this design fish for very 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.030
 so new gelding and it looks like good fish 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:46.100
 right or maybe it will be more correct 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.879
 express that it is some kind of organic 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.579
 style look at these lights and grille 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.829
 radiator and the topic of organics continues in 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.989
 cabin interior need to get a little. 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.489
 by the way definitely does not understand those who do not 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.920
 approves the rear lights 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.899
 After all, such beautiful turned out to think 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.930
 what's a non-standard form for mercedes 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.340
 but then the model itself is not the usual 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.350
 what else can you see interesting 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.869
 outside here in no small size 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.520
 panoramic roof which if desired 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.020
 turns into a hatch anti spoiler as well 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.700
 wonderful doors without frames 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.490
 which is so cool add some 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.649
 youth sti car sense of freedom 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.460
 I think the owners of other cars with 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.890
 same doors 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.049
 now I understand perfectly 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.750
 through these doors we sit down 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.670
 sanction spoon it is made in beige 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.579
 black colors and perceived such 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.799
 rooms moment al note on 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.200
 this gray inset with beautiful reliefs 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.080
 I think this is a continuation of the topic of organic 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.110
 already inside 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.200
 true and which cool air of water 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.760
 turned out see what a king when I 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.420
 started the team your iphone with a local 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.120
 system then 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.190
 effectively try to click on the screen 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.590
 finger but unfortunately the tap is not here 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.420
 I think this is a minor drawback. 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.130
 I hope the following we will see the touch 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 screen because all the same I want right 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.050
 fingers all the mood as they say 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.280
 our whole life is made up of little things 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.560
 mercedes with this okay would like to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.600
 draw your attention to one of these 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 nights this is a power window unit 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.870
 here every glass and front 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.220
 driver's rear right passenger 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.790
 possesses auto lift function 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.340
 and descent 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.780
 that you are really comfortable but unfortunately in 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.420
 Many cars only have a driver 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.040
 glass is such an opportunity so 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.660
 I suggest that manufacturers take 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.900
 example they think it is strong 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.610
 increases the cost of plain machines 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.470
 let's get down to driving here 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.660
 beautiful seats with a variety of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.180
 the regulations are just why you forgot 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.970
 do their ventilation for a couple of months in 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.920
 year it will be a minus behind cramped 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.890
 due to the design bevel roof here 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.000
 even with my 175 centimeters felt 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.010
 contact with the ceiling 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.989
 the steering wheel has excellent anatomy and plows 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.849
 quality materials and when you 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.220
 violating the number while driving 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:12.090
 there is a noticeable impulsive / 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:14.280
 convenient box here is robotic 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.870
 seven steps works great only 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.480
 here immediately proceed to military action 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.190
 not even in sports mode when 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.940
 pressing the gas pedal off 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.280
 some 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.620
 noticeable time to turn on low 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720
 gear suspension deserves the most 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.670
 The best praise is such 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.860
 impression that we have asphalt capital 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.780
 some kind of soft it became at 18x then 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.599
 disks but no it is a merit of engineers 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.730
 mercedes also pleased in the marginal 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.829
 modes on bends full drive form 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.530
 tag machine is rooted to the spot 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:48.120
 weather work here liter 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.940
 gas turbine engine 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.920
 day 201 force 350 newton meters 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.379
 twisting and by tradition and armed 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.980
 positive and 98 gasoline went to 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.980
 booth morendi 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.600
 it's time to talk about fuel 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.300
 the efficiency of this machine during the test 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.060
 I drove 339 kilometers and now 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.730
 bore 52 liters of 98 gasoline and so 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.380
 way we get a flow rate of 15.5 liters per 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.480
 a hundred kilometers I think it is 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.640
 really really very economical 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.500
 heaps hp turbocharged engine with good 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.120
 power 201 forces active in style 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.100
 driving we get quite adequate 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.280
 consumption that is if you will go 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.800
 calmly don't hurry then one hundred percent i 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.060
 I think the flow will be around 11 12 liters 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.060
 and 200 strength. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.490
 According to the manufacturerâ€™s passport 6 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.830
 as many as seven tenths of a second to one hundred 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.690
 kilometers per hour using the flight log 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.690
 we took measurements and that's what happened 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.330
 mercedes 250 form tag leaves 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.800
 great impression this is a car 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.900
 so good that it is not even 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.480
 you always want to go fast though she is 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.070
 can prices for the version with 211 strong 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.100
 engine and all-wheel drive starts 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.630
 with a million 670 thousand rubles and in my 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.230
 this is a good option for successful 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:15.570
 youth 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:15.570
 what do you think car project
