00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.460
 much harder to land 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.650
 when you do not get conditioned into a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.410

 When you're moisturizing, I do not know. 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.810
 why but it seems that hydration is 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.690
 deeper in your hair than you 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.310
 pass a cream so I always massage 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.760
