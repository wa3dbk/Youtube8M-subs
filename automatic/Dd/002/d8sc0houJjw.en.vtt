00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
out and after a lot of hard work and a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.470 
out and after a lot of hard work and a
lot<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.160> scratching<00:02:41.160> our<00:02:41.280> hits<00:02:41.519> we<00:02:42.090> figured

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
lot of scratching our hits we figured

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.010 
lot of scratching our hits we figured
out<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.750> could<00:02:42.959> take<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.320> floor

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
out we could take the floor

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.080 
out we could take the floor
so<00:02:44.350> two<00:02:44.560> years<00:02:44.770> later<00:02:45.070> we're<00:02:45.370> here<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.790> make<00:02:45.940> it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
so two years later we're here to make it

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.040 
so two years later we're here to make it
even<00:02:46.360> better

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
even better

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.980

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
worked on that alone while to the first

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.230 
worked on that alone while to the first
we<00:02:57.100> are<00:02:57.130> going<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.460> try<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:57.910> cut<00:02:58.120> the

floor off the front of it we found out

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.070 
floor off the front of it we found out
that<00:03:00.610> really<00:03:00.880> wasn't<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.390> right<00:03:01.540> thing<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.840> do

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
that really wasn't the right thing to do

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.800 
that really wasn't the right thing to do
so<00:03:02.320> we<00:03:02.350> built<00:03:02.740> new<00:03:02.800> chassis<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:04.210> pieces<00:03:04.660> in

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
so we built new chassis the pieces in

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.840 
so we built new chassis the pieces in
the<00:03:04.840> middle<00:03:05.050> are<00:03:05.290> brand<00:03:05.560> new<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.400> he<00:03:06.490> took<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
the middle are brand new so he took the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.490 
the middle are brand new so he took the
bogies<00:03:07.240> off<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.600> old<00:03:07.750> ones<00:03:07.960> put<00:03:08.170> them<00:03:08.260> on<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
bogies off the old ones put them on the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.110 
bogies off the old ones put them on the
new<00:03:08.650> ones<00:03:08.800> took<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.190> seats<00:03:09.460> off<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.850> old<00:03:09.940> ones

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
new ones took the seats off the old ones

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.240 
new ones took the seats off the old ones
put<00:03:10.330> them<00:03:10.420> on<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.690> new<00:03:10.840> ones<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.920> chassis

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
put them on the new ones so the chassis

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.830 
put them on the new ones so the chassis
they're<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> little<00:03:12.790> bit<00:03:13.030> different<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.600> weight

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
they're a little bit different in weight

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.900 
they're a little bit different in weight
they're<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> little<00:03:14.290> heavier<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.820> it

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
they're a little heavier so that it

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.160 
they're a little heavier so that it
makes<00:03:16.090> up<00:03:16.270> for<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.510> weight<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.900> floor

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
makes up for the weight of the floor

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.760 
makes up for the weight of the floor
that<00:03:17.380> we<00:03:17.500> lost<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.150> they're<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> little<00:03:19.770> so

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
that we lost and they're a little so

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.110 
that we lost and they're a little so
here<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.490> they're<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.670> little<00:03:21.850> bit<00:03:22.090> different

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
here so they're a little bit different

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.700 
here so they're a little bit different
and<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.690> course<00:03:22.870> there's<00:03:23.020> nothing<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.560> front

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
and of course there's nothing in front

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.450 
and of course there's nothing in front
of<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.570> was<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.750> new<00:03:26.140> floor<00:03:26.410> lifts<00:03:26.740> in

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
of it that was the new floor lifts in

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.550 
of it that was the new floor lifts in
the<00:03:27.820> station<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.420> mechanism<00:03:29.200> working

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
the station the mechanism working

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.070 
the station the mechanism working
mechanisms<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:31.120> was<00:03:31.360> probably<00:03:31.630> our<00:03:31.930> biggest

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
mechanisms that was probably our biggest

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.800 
mechanisms that was probably our biggest
challenge<00:03:32.400> because<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:33.850> had<00:03:34.060> an<00:03:34.300> existing

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
challenge because we had an existing

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.420 
challenge because we had an existing
station<00:03:35.350> we<00:03:35.470> did<00:03:35.650> weren't<00:03:35.890> starting<00:03:36.130> from

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
station we did weren't starting from

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.000 
station we did weren't starting from
scratch<00:03:36.700> now<00:03:37.540> if<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.020> could<00:03:38.230> go<00:03:38.350> back<00:03:38.530> two<00:03:38.770> years

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
scratch now if I could go back two years

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.070 
scratch now if I could go back two years
ago<00:03:39.310> or<00:03:39.460> three<00:03:39.700> years<00:03:39.820> ago<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.600> know<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.960> we

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
ago or three years ago and know that we

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.360 
ago or three years ago and know that we
were<00:03:41.200> going<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.410> do<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:41.740> I'd<00:03:41.980> have<00:03:42.100> made<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
were going to do this I'd have made the

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.760 
were going to do this I'd have made the
station<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.850> little<00:03:43.030> bit

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
station a little bit

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.460 
station a little bit
but<00:03:45.220> we<00:03:45.370> have<00:03:45.580> actually<00:03:46.270> two<00:03:46.720> stations<00:03:47.230> that

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
but we have actually two stations that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.250 
but we have actually two stations that
we<00:03:47.590> can<00:03:47.770> load<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.340> unload<00:03:48.520> people<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:49.990> had

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
we can load and unload people so we had

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.830 
we can load and unload people so we had
to<00:03:50.620> build<00:03:50.800> twelve<00:03:51.430> different<00:03:52.150> mechanisms

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
to build twelve different mechanisms

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.960 
to build twelve different mechanisms
that<00:03:52.960> come<00:03:53.230> up<00:03:53.380> from<00:03:53.590> below<00:03:53.770> they<00:03:54.580> kind<00:03:54.880> of

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
that come up from below they kind of

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.330 
that come up from below they kind of
have<00:03:55.120> an<00:03:55.240> s-shaped<00:03:55.960> motion<00:03:56.470> too<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.190> then

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
have an s-shaped motion too and then

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.710 
have an s-shaped motion too and then
when<00:03:57.460> they<00:03:57.550> get<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.940> final<00:03:58.270> position<00:03:58.390> they

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
when they get to the final position they

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.620 
when they get to the final position they
go<00:03:58.870> straight<00:03:59.260> up<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.860> fill<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.400> gap<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.120> then

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
go straight up to fill that gap and then

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.810 
go straight up to fill that gap and then
big<00:04:01.990> swing<00:04:02.410> arms<00:04:02.770> come<00:04:03.010> out<00:04:03.130> in<00:04:03.280> front<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
big swing arms come out in front of the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.180 
big swing arms come out in front of the
front<00:04:04.120> row<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.020> front<00:04:05.260> row<00:04:05.470> people<00:04:05.710> can't

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
front row so the front row people can't

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:45.100 
front row so the front row people can't
step<00:04:06.790> off

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.480

they<00:04:50.060> open<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.389> gates<00:04:50.419> go<00:04:50.870> ahead<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.169> fill<00:04:51.380> in

to do this ride there we go we're
leaving<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.750> station<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.810> as<00:05:18.770> you<00:05:18.919> know<00:05:19.630> the

leaving the station and as you know the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.510 
leaving the station and as you know the
new<00:05:20.750> addition<00:05:21.139> this<00:05:21.289> time<00:05:21.590> is<00:05:21.740> it's<00:05:21.919> floorless

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520
