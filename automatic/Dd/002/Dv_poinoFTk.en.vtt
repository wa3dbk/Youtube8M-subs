00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
release now this trigger is at the top

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.740 
release now this trigger is at the top
of<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.489> connector<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.089> when<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.300> push<00:01:01.600> it

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
of the connector and when you push it

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.740 
of the connector and when you push it
down<00:01:01.930> with<00:01:02.229> your<00:01:02.260> thumb<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:03.010> lifts<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.699> tab<00:01:04.420> so

down with your thumb it lifts the tab so

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.899 
down with your thumb it lifts the tab so
it<00:01:04.870> releases<00:01:05.199> from<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.250> connector<00:01:06.729> on<00:01:06.880> the

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
it releases from the connector on the

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.350 
it releases from the connector on the
face<00:01:08.400> next<00:01:09.400> we're<00:01:09.580> going<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.729> remove<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.120> two

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
face next we're going to remove the two

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.880 
face next we're going to remove the two
screws<00:01:10.690> next<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.790> AC<00:01:12.790> controls<00:01:13.540> here<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
screws next to the AC controls here the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.030 
screws next to the AC controls here the
reason<00:01:15.190> for<00:01:15.340> removing<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.990> AC<00:01:16.990> control<00:01:17.710> here

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
reason for removing the AC control here

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.660 
reason for removing the AC control here
is<00:01:18.159> because<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.960> car<00:01:20.200> stereo<00:01:20.680> has<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:20.920> lip<00:01:21.310> on

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
is because the car stereo has a lip on

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.460 
is because the car stereo has a lip on
the<00:01:21.880> bottom<00:01:22.060> of<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.510> along<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.020> edge<00:01:23.140> here

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
the bottom of it along the edge here

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.459 
the bottom of it along the edge here
that<00:01:24.070> goes<00:01:24.310> behind<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.969> AC<00:01:25.180> controls<00:01:25.930> and

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
that goes behind the AC controls and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.929 
that goes behind the AC controls and
will<00:01:26.619> not<00:01:26.770> come<00:01:26.950> out<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.250> dash<00:01:27.430> unless<00:01:27.789> the

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
will not come out of the dash unless the

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.609 
will not come out of the dash unless the
AC<00:01:28.090> controls<00:01:28.750> are<00:01:28.960> pulled<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.289> little<00:01:29.530> bit

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
AC controls are pulled a little bit

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.850 
AC controls are pulled a little bit
forward<00:01:29.950> because<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.939> lip<00:01:31.149> is<00:01:31.360> here<00:01:31.860> next

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
forward because the lip is here next

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.010 
forward because the lip is here next
we're<00:01:33.100> going<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.280> remove<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.780> bottom<00:01:34.780> left
