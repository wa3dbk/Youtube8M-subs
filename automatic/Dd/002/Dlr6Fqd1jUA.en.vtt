with a visual and acoustic warning then

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
with a visual and acoustic warning then
it<00:01:25.590> prepares<00:01:26.040> brake<00:01:26.369> assist<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.119> most

it prepares brake assist for the most

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.960 
it prepares brake assist for the most
precise<00:01:27.960> possible<00:01:28.650> braking<00:01:29.040> response<00:01:29.490> as

but the system doesn't only help me to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.430 
but the system doesn't only help me to
break<00:01:37.980> as<00:01:38.220> much<00:01:38.730> as<00:01:39.090> possible<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.900> avoid<00:01:40.080> an

near Stuttgart it's in the afternoon the
traffic<00:02:07.920> gets<00:02:08.310> dense<00:02:08.790> so<00:02:09.540> what<00:02:09.810> does<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
traffic gets dense so what does the
