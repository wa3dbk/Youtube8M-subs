00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.610
 into all kinds of data 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.830
 fortified as the number one labs 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.199
 So no big change here 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.539
 Just return to the inventory 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 see the creative in the game mode 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 just once short trains that here at 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320
 The crafting table is where it comes from 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.239
 simply open it a try 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 book after that is the order 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 it does not really matter 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.420
 all feathers and here then just the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.520
 ink says put there and then 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 we get the booking so called 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.649
 the whole book 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
 we can just do that here 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.200
 do it right click open what happens 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.120
 no, that's just a whole new book 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.739
 Here we come back and forth in 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 climb back to the beautiful book 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 and I can describe the pages 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.660
 Just click a bit there 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.230
 let's just go so far 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.600
 click 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 So there are a few possibilities I have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.119
 believe it 's up to 50 to the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.310
 page 50 levels seeing eye or 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.650
 page 50 is here we can go to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.360
 Example by enrolling great that you 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.110
 have forked out 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.550
 and so on and so on then you can 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.820
 that's us then we can do here 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.640
 enter the book title 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.260
 if we have secured that now and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.940
 have closed come nothing more 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.650
 edit edit 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.480
 so write one now 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:45.530
 story that okay i have now 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.870
 just the story so it works 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 not so long now, but the article 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.760
 history has its kloten now we have 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.650
 that shines now that I like blue 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.230
 as we enchanted 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.000
 objects here too is that we 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.500
 can now right click then to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 see page 50 and then we would 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.200
 see our text but I want that 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.210
 Do not do it now because of it 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.149
 now way too time consuming and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.010
 I 'm boring the book 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.570
 now from me or you do that in one 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.830
 box or other already hidden 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.610
 that you can do it in multiplayer as well 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.830
 pass on 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.290
 So some plugins are back then 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.960
 unnecessarily but I find it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.160
 every case very interesting 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.870
 there is the next update 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.700
 besiktas if you pick your pickaxe 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.140
 Enchanted you can now also as a block 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.750
 can break down his own ice 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 palace now build this a beautiful too 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.090
 possibility to just his own 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.030
 ice palace its a snowball or 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.170
 to build another without this now 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.930
 title to the title 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.820
 yes then there is only one change in the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.340
 options we now go into the option 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.360
 then in the chat settings can now 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.310
 hiding the chat from or just the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.580
 activate comments 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.230
 weblinks to the colors on or off 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.700
 and we can see if it's the city 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.350
 set to a certain percentage 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.190
 that is when we say something for example 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.260
 do not write now 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.269
 blah blah blah and then in the options 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.590
 You 're just gonna look down here 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.780
 left on the corner yes I'm going in now 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.100
 the chat settings and then i can do that 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.170
 cover power back and forth stand the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.930
 transparency the power back and forth 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.570
 push as it just your eyes on 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.790
 So you like that your choice is 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.489
 quite pleasant but somehow you need 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.350
 In that case, that's not it 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.960
 the big updates also weeks update 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.580
 I thank you for watching 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.580
