00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.710
 tuenti five 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 hello everyone I'm bringing you a trick in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 butterfield 4 on the sunrise map and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.130
 good is a walk break that good more 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.010
 well they are two is very simple simply 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.510
 well he was playing around 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.789
 doing a little bit the campero and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 I found that little mistake there 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.040
 on this map and good and subsequently 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 another valet here as you see I have put the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.879
 fast camera worth his thing would be 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.699
 come to this building here is worth 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
 we went up to what is the lift worth 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.720
 to climb up the whole and if not then 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.540
 we can come with a helicopter or 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.190
 some kind of plane or something like that is worth 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.480
 As you can see, I got up here I was in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.640
 a part fell alone on a server I 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.079
 just what I do is jump with the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.540
 parachute just to that area over there 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.629
 ok and when we're already there in 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.550
 this piece of building or something like it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.410
 the piece of this where are the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.800
 fans those we have to come 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.630
 here we go up and go back up it's worth 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.170
 once we are here up here or if you 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.369
 you look at this column here 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.990
 we just have to get inside 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.179
 we put in there is already there is the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.219
 goalverage that vale 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.700
 we can simply cover ourselves 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.189
 say it like that since I was playing and 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.229
 I found this also after having it 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.750
 found I noticed that there are people 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 that gets in here they try then 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 not give them the bullets because the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.530
 bullets if you get in here we get out 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.149
 but they do not enter and they leave 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.219
 the bullets take a little out of the gun 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.840
 for outside and then your body is already 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.939
 it stays inside the column but the weapon 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 is out then you can kill vale 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.500
 so be careful if you see there 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.659
 right around here in this area 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 usually cover within this one of this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.729
 column and as you can see they know well some 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.610
 mistakes and such I do not know why it's not solid 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.820
 ok we can go through it 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.670
 and good in the other part of the building is 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.840
 more of the same here you will see 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.640
 then to those who see below the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 parts that look down there some 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.190
 bullets do happen but you should stay 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.560
 in some 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.700
 elsewhere it no longer reach 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.830
 give the enemies you have to take out 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.450
 what is the weapon a little bit and good if 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.670
 you come around here we surround a little bit what 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.280
 is the building you will see that in the other 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.980
 side there is also the same column and it happens 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.440
 exactly the same is true what I 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.940
 I use is to put the radio beacon there 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.310
 ok if we put the radio lighthouse in there 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.200
 it costs more to be seen and such and 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.640
 So, well, it's more likely 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.440
 that do not break us and then later when 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.489
 we appear appears better parachutes are 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.290
 we can fall on top of any 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.390
 building so nothing is simply 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.420
 this is a couple of wahlberg on the map of 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.799
 dawn on battery 4 this I say that 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.900
 that team how much it's worth I guess 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.580
 present in the other sites will be what 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.780
 it's worth it so I do not expect anything 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.040
 I liked it if you liked to vote for me 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.329
 like favorites and see you in the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.329
 next video greetings to all 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.790
 one
