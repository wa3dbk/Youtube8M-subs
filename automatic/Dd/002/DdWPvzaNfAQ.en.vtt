00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
because you know it was really hard for

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.599 
because you know it was really hard for
us<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.049> really<00:02:59.949> you<00:03:00.099> know<00:03:00.159> sell<00:03:00.400> them<00:03:00.519> with

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.909 
us to really you know sell them with
that<00:03:00.790> but<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:02.049> like<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.319> said<00:03:02.379> it's<00:03:02.650> just<00:03:02.680> good

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
that but and like I said it's just good

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.289 
that but and like I said it's just good
that<00:03:02.949> we<00:03:03.099> all<00:03:03.219> stuck<00:03:03.459> together<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.909> just<00:03:03.969> move

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
that we all stuck together and just move

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.009 
that we all stuck together and just move
forward<00:03:04.449> from<00:03:04.629> there<00:03:04.840> why<00:03:05.379> aren't<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.829> good

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019
