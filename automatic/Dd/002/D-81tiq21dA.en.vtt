best way to put it it's like eating an

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.720 
best way to put it it's like eating an
electrical<00:04:27.730> cable<00:04:27.940> filled<00:04:28.420> with<00:04:28.570> grape<00:04:29.140> jelly

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
electrical cable filled with grape jelly

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.020 
electrical cable filled with grape jelly
it's<00:04:30.730> really<00:04:31.330> odd<00:04:33.060> scores<00:04:34.060> time<00:04:34.390> okay<00:04:34.990> well<00:04:35.290> I

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
it's really odd scores time okay well I

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.320 
it's really odd scores time okay well I
don't<00:04:37.030> know<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.390> we<00:04:37.450> know<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.600> think<00:04:37.780> today

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
don't know that we know I think today

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.640 
don't know that we know I think today
oddly<00:04:40.330> enough<00:04:40.420> is<00:04:40.720> gonna<00:04:40.930> be<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.110> dots<00:04:41.320> I

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
oddly enough is gonna be the dots I

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.010 
oddly enough is gonna be the dots I
actually<00:04:41.980> really<00:04:42.430> like<00:04:42.610> that<00:04:42.640> is<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.150> they

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
actually really like that is that they

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.290 
actually really like that is that they
get<00:04:44.170> stain<00:04:44.530> your<00:04:44.800> teeth<00:04:44.830> oh<00:04:45.400> that's<00:04:45.790> so<00:04:46.030> weird

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
get stain your teeth oh that's so weird

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.690 
get stain your teeth oh that's so weird
um<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:47.440> would<00:04:47.680> give<00:04:47.830> them<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.010> seven<00:04:48.430> out<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.580> ten

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
um I would give them a seven out of ten

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.620

the<00:04:50.100> grape<00:04:51.100> flavored<00:04:51.910> liquorice<00:04:52.690> stuff<00:04:54.630> it's

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
the grape flavored liquorice stuff it's

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.970 
the grape flavored liquorice stuff it's
funny<00:04:55.840> because<00:04:56.080> you<00:04:56.320> actually<00:04:56.500> get<00:04:56.830> more

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
funny because you actually get more

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.950 
funny because you actually get more
flavor<00:04:57.310> after<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:57.940> stop<00:04:58.180> eating<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:58.750> seems

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
flavor after you stop eating it it seems

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.860 
flavor after you stop eating it it seems
to<00:04:59.080> come<00:04:59.290> out<00:04:59.440> more<00:04:59.650> so<00:05:00.010> um<00:05:00.330> I'd<00:05:01.330> probably<00:05:01.390> give

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
to come out more so um I'd probably give

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.530 
to come out more so um I'd probably give
that<00:05:02.080> a<00:05:02.110> 6<00:05:02.440> not<00:05:02.920> bad<00:05:03.190> it's<00:05:03.520> not<00:05:03.700> it's<00:05:03.850> it's<00:05:04.240> very

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
that a 6 not bad it's not it's it's very

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.660 
that a 6 not bad it's not it's it's very
much<00:05:04.780> like<00:05:04.930> eating<00:05:05.290> a<00:05:05.530> an<00:05:06.040> electrical<00:05:06.490> cable

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
much like eating a an electrical cable

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.760 
much like eating a an electrical cable
with<00:05:07.030> goo<00:05:07.420> in<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.660> middle<00:05:07.900> but<00:05:08.110> um<00:05:08.260> other<00:05:08.740> than

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
with goo in the middle but um other than

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.540 
with goo in the middle but um other than
that<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.280> not<00:05:09.340> too<00:05:09.430> bad<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.980> pop<00:05:12.190> rocks

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
that it's not too bad and the pop rocks

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.760 
that it's not too bad and the pop rocks
I<00:05:12.910> think<00:05:13.540> will<00:05:13.660> probably<00:05:13.930> give<00:05:14.080> them<00:05:14.200> a<00:05:14.260> 6<00:05:14.590> as

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
I think will probably give them a 6 as

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.820 
I think will probably give them a 6 as
well<00:05:14.920> sort<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.780> know<00:05:16.780> it's<00:05:17.050> it's<00:05:17.230> strangers
