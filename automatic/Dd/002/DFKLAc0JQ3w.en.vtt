00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
latest face recognition technology so

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.670 
latest face recognition technology so
that<00:01:07.000> means<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.329> can<00:01:07.450> recognize<00:01:07.899> up<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.409> six

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that means it can recognize up to six

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.280 
that means it can recognize up to six
faces<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.870> prioritize<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:11.020> exposure

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
learn to recognize that person and then

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.800 
learn to recognize that person and then
in<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.340> shot<00:01:21.520> they'll<00:01:21.700> stand<00:01:21.909> out<00:01:22.120> well<00:01:22.330> it
