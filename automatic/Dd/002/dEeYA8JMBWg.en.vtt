00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
reviewed this figure yet so he thought

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.290 
reviewed this figure yet so he thought
it<00:00:16.260> would<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.470> cool<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.340> had<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.060> first

it would be cool if I had like a first

doesn't<00:00:46.050> rank<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:46.379> high<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:52.039> we'll<00:00:53.039> open<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
doesn't rank very high so we'll open the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.470 
doesn't rank very high so we'll open the
box<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:55.399> actually<00:00:56.399> haven't<00:00:56.789> even<00:00:57.000> opened<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
box I actually haven't even opened it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.020 
box I actually haven't even opened it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030

yet because he said that I should hurry
and<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:09.860> who<00:01:10.860> he<00:01:11.189> comes<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.640> a

and he has like a comic book and the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.460 
and he has like a comic book and the
instructions<00:01:46.780> I'll<00:01:47.780> put<00:01:47.960> those<00:01:48.050> over<00:01:48.230> here

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
instructions I'll put those over here

00:01:48.470 --> 00:02:06.580 
instructions I'll put those over here
I'll<00:01:48.950> use<00:01:49.130> those<00:02:02.950> here<00:02:03.950> he<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:06.260> he<00:02:06.350> comes

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590

with<00:02:06.800> some<00:02:06.980> other<00:02:07.130> stuff<00:02:07.400> too<00:02:07.640> looks<00:02:08.119> like

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
with some other stuff too looks like

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.090 
with some other stuff too looks like
extra<00:02:10.190> hands<00:02:10.900> can<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> sword<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:12.980> it

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
extra hands can like a sword and like it

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:24.360 
extra hands can like a sword and like it
done<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:19.100> like<00:02:19.660> some<00:02:20.660> clear<00:02:20.930> plastic<00:02:21.350> things

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.810 

i<00:02:25.690> also<00:02:26.690> have<00:02:27.020> classics<00:02:27.590> prime<00:02:27.860> because<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
i also have classics prime because the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.680 
i also have classics prime because the
instructions<00:02:29.420> say<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:31.030> he<00:02:32.030> can<00:02:32.239> attach<00:02:32.660> to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
instructions say that he can attach to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:43.770 
instructions say that he can attach to
him<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:35.120> robot<00:02:35.690> mode

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.020 

and<00:02:45.600> oops<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.900> dropped<00:02:47.050> them<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:50.200> says<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
and oops I dropped them and it says to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
and oops I dropped them and it says to
plug<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.510> into<00:02:53.170> their

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.560 

well<00:02:59.680> it<00:03:00.460> says<00:03:00.670> if<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.970> move<00:03:01.120> these<00:03:01.270> he

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
well it says if you move these he

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.870 
well it says if you move these he
becomes<00:03:01.960> a<00:03:02.260> jetpack<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.890> thought<00:03:06.550> that<00:03:06.610> that

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
becomes a jetpack so I thought that that

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.010 
becomes a jetpack so I thought that that
was<00:03:07.030> kind<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.390> cool<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:09.630> because<00:03:10.630> Optimus

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
was kind of cool I just because Optimus

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.710 
was kind of cool I just because Optimus
Prime<00:03:11.260> already<00:03:12.040> has<00:03:12.220> wings<00:03:12.460> so<00:03:13.360> he<00:03:13.390> can

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
Prime already has wings so he can

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.040 
Prime already has wings so he can
probably<00:03:14.010> already<00:03:15.010> fly<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.600> jetpack

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
probably already fly but the jetpack

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.480 
probably already fly but the jetpack
probably<00:03:17.530> gives<00:03:17.710> him<00:03:17.830> more<00:03:19.050> propulsion<00:03:20.490> kind

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
probably gives him more propulsion kind

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.710 
probably gives him more propulsion kind
of<00:03:21.550> like<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:22.090> glider<00:03:22.810> versus<00:03:23.560> like<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:24.010> jet<00:03:24.720> like

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
of like a glider versus like a jet like

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.960 
of like a glider versus like a jet like
a<00:03:25.750> jet<00:03:26.110> can<00:03:26.380> fly<00:03:26.650> faster<00:03:27.220> than<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.730> glider

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
a jet can fly faster than a glider

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.010 
a jet can fly faster than a glider
because<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.570> has<00:03:28.690> better<00:03:29.050> engines<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.900> think

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
because it has better engines so I think

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.630 
because it has better engines so I think
that's<00:03:32.350> kind<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.680> cool<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:33.100> might<00:03:33.280> leave<00:03:33.490> him

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
that's kind of cool I might leave him

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.980 
that's kind of cool I might leave him
like<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.820> for<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.270> while<00:03:34.410> when<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.440> display<00:03:35.860> him

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
like that for a while when I display him

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.640 
like that for a while when I display him
um<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:39.550> going<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:40.200> transform<00:03:41.200> him<00:03:41.410> for<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
um I'm going to transform him for the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:54.730 
um I'm going to transform him for the
first<00:03:41.770> time

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.990 

I'm<00:03:55.740> going<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.950> get<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> instructions<00:03:56.460> in<00:03:56.880> a

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
I'm going to get the instructions in a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.270 
I'm going to get the instructions in a
better<00:03:57.210> place<00:03:57.420> where<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.810> can<00:03:57.900> read<00:03:58.140> them<00:04:00.050> okay

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
better place where I can read them okay

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:20.420 
better place where I can read them okay
it<00:04:02.280> says<00:04:02.340> to

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:38.490 

hope<00:04:22.250> come<00:04:23.250> down<00:04:23.490> oh<00:04:25.970> there's<00:04:26.970> his<00:04:27.120> hands

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.250 

I<00:04:40.680> think<00:04:41.680> this<00:04:41.860> comes<00:04:42.100> up<00:04:42.750> otherwise<00:04:43.750> they

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
I think this comes up otherwise they

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:55.300 
I think this comes up otherwise they
would<00:04:44.410> be<00:04:44.500> in<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.710> way

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:18.150 

and<00:04:58.250> seat<00:04:59.250> think<00:05:00.180> these<00:05:00.389> are<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.689> feet<00:05:00.900> yeah

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:36.600 

where's<00:05:19.160> his<00:05:19.340> head<00:05:24.039> there<00:05:25.039> is

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.790 

and<00:05:37.610> now<00:05:37.819> it<00:05:37.879> looks<00:05:37.939> like<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:41.589> he's<00:05:42.589> pretty

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
and now it looks like it he's pretty

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.730 
and now it looks like it he's pretty
cool<00:05:46.210> has<00:05:47.210> like<00:05:47.479> a<00:05:47.509> bunch<00:05:47.839> of<00:05:47.960> stuff<00:05:48.229> and<00:05:48.499> I'm

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
cool has like a bunch of stuff and I'm

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.779 
cool has like a bunch of stuff and I'm
probably<00:05:49.009> going<00:05:49.369> to<00:05:49.490> breathe<00:05:49.669> the

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
probably going to breathe the

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.700 
probably going to breathe the
instructions<00:05:50.330> for<00:05:50.389> a<00:05:50.509> long<00:05:50.659> time<00:05:50.899> and<00:05:51.169> figure

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
instructions for a long time and figure

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.619 
instructions for a long time and figure
it<00:05:51.800> out<00:05:51.949> like<00:05:52.610> what<00:05:52.819> those<00:05:52.969> red<00:05:53.210> things<00:05:53.240> are

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
it out like what those red things are

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:59.019 
it out like what those red things are
for<00:05:53.839> I<00:05:54.369> know<00:05:55.369> he<00:05:55.580> has<00:05:55.699> like<00:05:56.029> a<00:05:56.240> sword<00:05:57.819> and<00:05:58.819> you

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
for I know he has like a sword and you

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:04.139 
for I know he has like a sword and you
can<00:05:59.180> probably<00:05:59.629> put<00:05:59.839> it<00:05:59.869> in<00:06:00.050> his<00:06:00.169> hand<00:06:02.559> oops

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149 
can probably put it in his hand oops

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:15.229 
can probably put it in his hand oops
hand<00:06:05.149> popped<00:06:05.389> off

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:15.239 

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:20.749 

oops<00:06:16.239> oh<00:06:16.539> I<00:06:17.199> guess<00:06:17.469> it's<00:06:17.679> really<00:06:17.919> two<00:06:18.099> swords

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:28.889 

or<00:06:21.759> maybe<00:06:26.969> his<00:06:27.969> hand<00:06:28.269> doesn't<00:06:28.569> want<00:06:28.689> to<00:06:28.809> go

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:28.899 
or maybe his hand doesn't want to go

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:38.620 
or maybe his hand doesn't want to go
back<00:06:29.110> on

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:49.080 

no<00:06:39.200> I'll<00:06:39.560> worry<00:06:39.800> about<00:06:39.830> his<00:06:40.100> hand<00:06:40.340> later<00:06:44.590> but

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.040 

so<00:06:50.170> all<00:06:51.170> in<00:06:51.380> all<00:06:51.440> I<00:06:51.500> think<00:06:51.740> he's<00:06:52.070> pretty<00:06:52.310> cool

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
so all in all I think he's pretty cool

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.900 
so all in all I think he's pretty cool
he<00:06:54.050> kind<00:06:54.290> of<00:06:54.380> has<00:06:54.530> like<00:06:54.770> a<00:06:55.040> little<00:06:55.340> Optimus

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
he kind of has like a little Optimus

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.880 
he kind of has like a little Optimus
Prime<00:06:56.120> head<00:06:57.220> but<00:06:58.480> if<00:06:59.480> you<00:07:00.320> haven't<00:07:00.620> asked<00:07:00.740> for

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
Prime head but if you haven't asked for
