00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.049
 hello to all you are a horrendous heat 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:12.090
 there is truth 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.380
 here it is a beautiful fresh Argentine 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.350
 fresh indeed they re mar 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.119
 the granita a sorbet even better than the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.369
 strawberries you can make it 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.099
 quietly without ice cream maker 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.500
 so it is a recipe suitable for everyone e 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.390
 now we live to list ingredients 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.290
 then to prepare your sorbet 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.390
 with strawberries you will need strawberries 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.880
 precisely 600 grams then vi 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:44.130
 300ml of water will be needed 300 g of 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.730
 sugar colors normal white a lemon 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:52.500
 and then ingredients and particular syrup 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.150
 to the navy precisely 100 ml e 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.240
 syrup to the ramiccia also of this 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.230
 100 ml syrup the sour cherry is a lot 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.200
 easy to find 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.220
 if you don't find the orange one there 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.100
 worried I could easily 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.009
 also use orange juice 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.290
 however if you find the syrup does not taste 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.270
 a little bit more intense recommend it 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.950
 now we are going to prepare the first one 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.829
 pass to make will prepare one 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.990
 syrup to make it we take a pot 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.420
 inside we go to put all 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.340
 how much water 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.340
 we also add all that is not 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.620
 goodies 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.740
 let's go to me and then the pieces of the peel 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.110
 of the lemon that I cut into this 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.690
 so big pieces because then we'll have to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 take them off and let's go put 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.119
 inside everyone so take 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.369
 40 written the peel of your lemon 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 precisely cut into large pieces and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.830
 put everything on the heat until 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.060
 boiling 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.890
 as soon as the thing was aimed at 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.080
 boil and let the mixture rest 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.539
 until it has cooled completely 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.450
 while this fire we recover time 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.130
 and let's do the rest then 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 let's take a container is fine either 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.750
 free government that also pans of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.070
 metal in such a way that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 they will collect alfred before inside 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.180
 of your freezer 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.100
 let's put the lemon juice 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.140
 obviously we use colors from here 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.100
 we took the kennel we go to 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:26.340
 add the cherry juice we add 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.709
 then the orange juice and let's go to 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.049
 put the strawberries we have 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.720
 previously blended with the help of 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.959
 a mixer or immersion blender the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.810
 of course we put all and go to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.540
 mix the mixture well and then 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.970
 We expect that instead of the water 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.130
 sugar and lemon zest are 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.750
 arrive at room temperature after 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.370
 boiling obviously because we should 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.450
 mix everything when it is a 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.090
 room temperature 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.190
 See you soon, just the water 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.900
 sugar and lemon have cooled 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.569
 as soon as the syrup will be la 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.189
 temperature 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.150
 nothing we are ready for the last one 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.010
 pass or pour it inside the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.989
 composed 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.450
 obviously keeping the skins aside 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.650
 in this case it is better not to put 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.889
 inside the sorbet 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.889
 here they are put aside and then 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.680
 let's mix well 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.939
 now we just have to put it all in 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.829
 put it in the freezer and 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:31.569
 stir the mixture at intervals of 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:34.060
 an hour after 4 hours should be ready 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.530
 ie having the typical consistency of the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.169
 granite sorbet I tell you should be 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.239
 ready because if the shapes are not all 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.209
 equal the freezers are not for 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.489
 we all have nothing for everything 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.439
 different so someone could 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.590
 put someone else much less 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:56.650
 instead much more so don't pay attention 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.079
 at the time the important thing is to mix one 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.519
 time every hour is what we then have 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.769
 added consistency from you 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.269
 you want that type allows 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.970
 just 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.180
 so now see you in at least 4 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.060
 hours and remember to mix anything 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.819
 will wake up proposed and here they are 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.919
 just spent the four hours and the 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.859
 your strawberry sorbet should 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:25.030
 having reached the perfect consistency 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.099
 ie beautiful creamy as you see how there 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.560
 I said before it was four 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.900
 hours in case it is still liquid thing 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.060
 very possible I am not surprised 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.919
 the important thing is that you continue to do the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.840
 mixing process every hour 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.139
 until added 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:46.120
 add this consistency to that 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:48.250
 just right of your sorbet 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.710
 now we are going to fill it all up 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.180
 how much and keep in mind with the quantities 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.930
 that I gave you 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:00.850
 you should get about ten 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:03.160
 glasses like this this amount goes 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.680
 great if you have to organize a 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.889
 example a party and in the end you want 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.080
 serve a nice strawberry subject I hope 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.940

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.520
