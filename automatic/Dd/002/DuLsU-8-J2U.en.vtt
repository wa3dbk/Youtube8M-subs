use and it looks quite well there's you

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.759 
use and it looks quite well there's you
know<00:02:35.909> bit<00:02:36.299> of<00:02:36.390> aliasing<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.230> edges<00:02:37.590> but

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
quite well but for something like the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.650 
quite well but for something like the
sims<00:03:52.709> 3<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.430> didn't<00:03:53.849> really<00:03:54.150> work<00:03:54.269> too<00:03:54.629> well

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
sims 3 it didn't really work too well

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.869 
sims 3 it didn't really work too well
but<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.049> was<00:03:55.230> more<00:03:55.379> because<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.459> sort<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.819> a

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
but that was more because it's sort of a

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.640 
but that was more because it's sort of a
point<00:03:57.150> in<00:03:57.389> clicks<00:03:57.659> or<00:03:57.840> an<00:03:57.959> interface<00:03:58.379> so<00:03:58.590> it

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
point in clicks or an interface so it

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.699 
point in clicks or an interface so it
just<00:03:58.799> works<00:03:58.980> better<00:03:59.340> with<00:03:59.639> touchscreen<00:04:00.329> and

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
just works better with touchscreen and

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.379 
just works better with touchscreen and
so<00:04:01.709> again<00:04:01.859> depending<00:04:02.609> on<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.970> kind<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.209> game

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
so again depending on the kind of game

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.729 
so again depending on the kind of game
you're<00:04:03.569> playing<00:04:03.870> most<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.409> them<00:04:04.500> were<00:04:04.530> quite

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
you're playing most of them were quite

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.949 
you're playing most of them were quite
well<00:04:05.099> at<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> controller<00:04:05.669> apart<00:04:06.180> from<00:04:06.269> some

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
well at the controller apart from some

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.539 
well at the controller apart from some
that<00:04:07.109> might<00:04:07.230> be<00:04:07.379> just<00:04:07.409> better<00:04:08.010> optimized<00:04:08.519> for

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
that might be just better optimized for

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.699 
that might be just better optimized for
touch<00:04:08.909> screen<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.810> terms<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.199> battery<00:04:10.409> life

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
touch screen in terms of battery life

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.559 
touch screen in terms of battery life
for<00:04:10.979> gaming<00:04:11.280> they<00:04:11.430> lasted<00:04:11.879> for<00:04:12.090> me<00:04:12.150> by<00:04:12.269> three

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.509 
for gaming they lasted for me by three
or<00:04:12.720> four<00:04:12.959> hours<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.560> continuous<00:04:14.010> gameplay<00:04:14.459> but

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519
