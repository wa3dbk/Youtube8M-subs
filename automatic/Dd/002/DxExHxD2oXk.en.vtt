00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.410
 good comes some sheets about that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.800

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.390

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.480

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.300
 be 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.350
 and the charger 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.350
 It is a charger 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.850

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.300

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 1300 amps 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 I hope it opens my battery 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.630
 as we saw 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.760
 Well, that same half was also coming and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.430
 manuals nothing more 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.680
 this is the cell phone and it comes 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 I ordered it in white there is a variety of 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.729
 colors and the texture of back is simple 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.800
 And simple 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.390
 as we know well low-end cell phones 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 no s 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.840
 a good quality in this the part of 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.990
 back is hard to open but I follow them 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.990
 talking 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.200
 let's see how is alcatel the 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.540
 first time I have an android and in 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.800

 the back cover that if it's really 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.810
 hard April 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.650
 and once the back cover is open and if 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.340
 it's a little hard actually and that's not 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.810
 It bothered me a little and it comes with a 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.209
 memory of 4 gb and that gift that for 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.440

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.630

 turn it on and I will bring you later 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.120
 a review about this phone that 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.440
 I just acquired 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.080

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.830
 comment down there and we will respond 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.830
 all of you 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.360
 another thing that I wanted to tell you that 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.260
 excuse the quality of the principle of 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.989
 video 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.819
 I was not really without memory in the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.280
 camera and it's recording in memory 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.049
 internal camera here did not record me 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.110
 in a good quality 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.470
 excuse me and now let's put the 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.470
 drums 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:02.810
 in this phone is at 120 dollars in 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:07.460
 plan in for payment with a one-year contract 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.850
 12 months let's turn it on 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.220
 the side buttons ss power and only 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.680
 has to raise and lower the volume only 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.680
 those two of those three buttons nothing more 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.190
 this is apart it is known that we can 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:28.200
 change in different colors there is a red 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.900
 purple lead and gray with their young in 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.950
 black and turquoise those colors the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.170
 we can change and good 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.650
 What I like is that they give you a 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.139
 screen protector so you avoid 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.229
 scratches 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.569
 and we are going to hope that pledge is going to 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.919
 take a little longer so your first 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:54.120
 it's on once it's already there 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.120
 we see here of the one touch 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.400
 and well that's going to be everything and I bring you 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.380
 the review about this phone that 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 which is I think is accessible to 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.210
 all of us 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.880

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.720
 right where I wanted to change
