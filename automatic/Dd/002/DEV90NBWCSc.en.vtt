it's<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.440> white<00:01:06.649> flesh<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:09.140> what<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.280> unique

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's a white flesh and what is unique

it's a white flesh and what is unique
about<00:01:10.820> these<00:01:11.240> compared<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.170> more

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
about these compared to the more

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.730 
about these compared to the more
conventional<00:01:12.770> potatoes<00:01:13.929> is<00:01:14.929> that<00:01:15.229> these<00:01:15.440> have

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
conventional potatoes is that these have

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.880 
conventional potatoes is that these have
a<00:01:16.300> very<00:01:17.860> mild<00:01:18.860> nutty<00:01:19.310> flavor<00:01:20.060> about<00:01:20.539> them<00:01:20.990> and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.249 

it's<00:01:24.909> probably<00:01:25.909> best<00:01:26.060> tasted<00:01:26.540> when<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.049> rice

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790
