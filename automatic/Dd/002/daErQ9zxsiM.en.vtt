00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.080

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.580

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.800
 that and good friend a lot of roll then I 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.169
 I like it quite well, so I decided to show you 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.490
 Make a makeup look and an outfit 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.140
 inspired is a little on this day 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.840
 then it is possible that you are thinking 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.690
 ok we have makeup and we have outfit 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.010
 but I do not know how to combine me good if you have 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.840
 seen my first youtube video the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.030
 first that I climbed of all you will know that to 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.620
 me what about hairstyles and hair care 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.980
 and all that because I'm not very good at 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.629
 but I know who's called family is 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.109
 a girl who makes videos a little bit 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.429
 of my style be makeup and hairstyles and 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.109
 all that good I like to say that I do not 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.460
 ordered videos but good and I 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.410
 you understand and between the two of us 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.120
 thought we could make a kind 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.269
 collaboration in which she will 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.020
 I will teach you another make up and a 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.640
 outfit so if you want to watch your video

 will open a tab that will take you to your 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.210
 video then you go to your video

 from the times tab or video do not stop 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.090
 terminis opens you this for people and then 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.280
 when it's finished 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.079
 you can go to see yours and if not also 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.679
 You will have a link to upload to the end of 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.679
 this so good without further delay 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.679
 we started 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 this is going to be a super makeup 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.720
 simple so for the eyeshadow 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.880
 the only thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.880
 use a shade of light pink cream 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.950
 do not 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.270
 then we will ensure that no 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.439
 we are left in cuts blurring 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.439
 shadows with a brush 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.040
 Now with a liquid eyeliner we are going to 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.790
 delineate our upper lashes 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.790
 ah 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.280
 we're going to get in the corner and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.140
 although at the beginning it is true that 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.710
 It costs a bit at the end with practice 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.710
 you will be fine 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.580
 then let's curl us the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.580
 tabs 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.870
 ah 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.920
 and to finish with the eyes we are going to 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.920
 apply mask 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.500
 ah 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.600
 and already going to the face you can use the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.640
 color you want, I'm going to use 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.840
 benetti because it is the most natural that 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.930
 I have and also the hardest 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.930
 ah 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.750
 ah 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.090
 ah 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.090
 i 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.400
 to start with the lips first I'm going 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.890
 to apply cocoa 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.170
 and then I'm going to use a dye of 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.849
 lips like this is very dark I'm just going 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.260
 to apply a little in the middle and then 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.260
 I'm going to blur it with my fingers 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.580
 and with this we have finished the makeup 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:33.150
 of course 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.920
 and if you do not have any plans then also 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.800
 you can leave in some pretty thing and such 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.000
 Once you consider me to be your plan 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.650
