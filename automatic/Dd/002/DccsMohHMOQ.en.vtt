00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.459
 that there are friends of youtube this is a 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.710
 new video tutorial of rhyme in 2010 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:15.170
 Today I come with this little program that 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:21.080
 llama invur is a cd burner 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.900
 divide you can create your images that 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.010
 transform your images made more the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.050
 cidh and I decided to pass the iso all that 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.050
 let's see how it works 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.160
 and the link I'll leave it in the description 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:41.920
 of the video uploaded to mediafire and then there's 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.770
 another video to teach you how to 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.910
 install and translate into Spanish 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.430
 good here is here is the interface 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:56.750
 this as you see is translatable Spanish is 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.960
 normally understands here record image 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.540
 on disk if you have an image 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.850
 like this I have one of windows 7 like 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.580
 is 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.620
 you can pass it 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.980
 from the iso to the divide 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.390
 we click 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.630
 here we give this folder here 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.080
 to look for it and if I have it in the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 desk 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.350
 I look for a 27 the selection and I give to 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.820
 open as I do not have any unit of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:42.200
 blank disc by hand right now no 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.960
 verified anything but if you if your 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.490
 disc you insert it and it is in the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.390
 tail efe 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.910
 they select it then they give the number of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.260
 copies that already want the power that 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.410
 wants 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.630
 who want the video to be recorded, sorry 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:06.670
 the file or the iso and then doing that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.280
 we give here to read and this option 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.600
 will appear selected and you will be given 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.600
 click and it will start there 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.490
 once this is done 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.760
 and a little music will come out 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.730
 congratulations that will tell me what has 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.520
 done very well 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.840
 good 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.930
 the righteous again for 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:38.129
 teach them how to copy an image 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.959
 he made a record that they released a record 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:44.030
 of a disk I have a game of 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.770
 Playstation 2 and insert and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.770
 in my pc 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.230
 so that it will copy the image 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.470
 of the disk 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.470
 to pc 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.770
 let's see what to load in the image 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.600
 As you can see, it has not been up yet now 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.630
 has gone up 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.910
 then we give you here to create image of 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.740
 disc we give here is the unit and where 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.730
 I have the disk 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.450
 it's much easier here we give 4 to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.780
 let her record with all her 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.480
 its component and it's going to go a little bit more 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.580
 slow but it will be recorded correctly 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:44.990
 then we give here the adif option 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:47.570
 and the iso image will start to load 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.870
 so that it did not take long I will pass the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.870
 video 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.690
 then I will show you how 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.160
 It is moving from a file a file is created 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.900
 to an image did 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.630
 once almost finished loading him 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.200
 a little music will come out announcing that 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.200
 He has completed 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.470
 those are now if you get this ad 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.540
 telling him that it was satisfactory 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.380
 satisfactorily but then it's already 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.330
 made the image here puts the destination 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.229
 of the image where you saved it 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.229
 we give the folder 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:37.669
 the image appears and I, who is this 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.669
 we were here 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.560
 what we see here appears 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.560
 good 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.580
 here we have finished but as I wanted 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.230
 show you some with two things 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.710
 other things more things that are 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.430
 this 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.550
 is to believe that give file image or 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.800
 good folders I 'm not going to do anything 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.090
 this why not 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:16.320
 I am not very specialized in this area 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.220
 the least is here but like this session 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.220
 of you also worth 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.319
 Well, now here is for 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:33.270
 and you hit your children or burn them 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:38.370
 as you want here you know how to pass files 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:43.710

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:49.140

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:53.160
