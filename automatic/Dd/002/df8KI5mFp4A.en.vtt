00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400

weapon i would if i would say the mp7 is
stronger<00:04:02.910> than<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> pp<00:04:03.390> 90<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.410> don't

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
stronger than the pp 90 but you don't

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.259 
stronger than the pp 90 but you don't
unlock<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:05.010> until<00:04:05.280> late<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.730> game<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.209> you

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
unlock it until late in the game so you

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.729 
unlock it until late in the game so you
just<00:04:06.420> don't<00:04:06.600> see<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.840> as<00:04:07.049> much<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.560> maybe

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
just don't see it as much so maybe

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.530 
just don't see it as much so maybe
that's<00:04:07.950> why<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.340> getting<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.910> PP<00:04:09.150> 90<00:04:09.480> s

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
that's why it's getting the PP 90 s

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.509 
that's why it's getting the PP 90 s
getting<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.810> rap<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.109> being<00:04:10.140> overpowered<00:04:10.829> but

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
getting the rap of being overpowered but

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.330 
getting the rap of being overpowered but
all<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.239> these<00:04:12.390> are<00:04:12.720> pretty<00:04:13.350> solid<00:04:13.829> options<00:04:14.220> I

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
all of these are pretty solid options I

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.440 
all of these are pretty solid options I
mean<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.640> pretty<00:04:14.700> much<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.000> same<00:04:15.239> as<00:04:15.390> you

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
mean this is pretty much the same as you

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.029 
mean this is pretty much the same as you
saw<00:04:15.630> trifles<00:04:15.989> there's<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.229> few<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.680> are<00:04:16.829> bad

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
saw trifles there's a few that are bad

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.759 
saw trifles there's a few that are bad
but<00:04:17.609> everything<00:04:18.000> else<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.450> don't<00:04:19.200> know<00:04:19.320> it's

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
but everything else I don't know it's

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.610 
but everything else I don't know it's
pretty<00:04:20.010> close<00:04:20.390> at<00:04:21.390> least<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:21.750> my<00:04:21.870> opinion<00:04:21.989> and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
pretty close at least in my opinion and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.620 
pretty close at least in my opinion and
maybe<00:04:22.800> my<00:04:22.950> opinions<00:04:23.340> not<00:04:23.520> worth<00:04:23.669> much<00:04:23.940> but<00:04:24.210> it

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
maybe my opinions not worth much but it

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.690 
maybe my opinions not worth much but it
is<00:04:24.750> mine<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.380> I'm<00:04:25.919> gonna<00:04:26.039> go<00:04:26.190> ahead<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.400> share

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
is mine so I'm gonna go ahead and share

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.580 
is mine so I'm gonna go ahead and share
it<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.330> think<00:04:27.810> there<00:04:27.930> are<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.110> lot<00:04:28.289> of<00:04:28.320> strong

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
it so I think there are a lot of strong

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.560 
it so I think there are a lot of strong
guns<00:04:28.890> let's<00:04:29.340> talk<00:04:29.550> about<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.940> secondaries

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
guns let's talk about the secondaries

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.790 
guns let's talk about the secondaries
it's<00:04:30.750> another<00:04:30.960> thing<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.409> gets<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.620> lot<00:04:31.650> of

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
it's another thing that gets a lot of

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.430 
it's another thing that gets a lot of
attention<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.370> fmg9<00:04:32.909> is<00:04:33.659> also<00:04:34.050> unlocked

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
attention the fmg9 is also unlocked

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.260 
attention the fmg9 is also unlocked
relatively<00:04:35.130> early

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
relatively early

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.530 
relatively early
Kimbo<00:04:36.630> there<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:36.960> beast<00:04:37.350> but<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:38.550> are<00:04:38.790> the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
Kimbo there a beast but so are the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.840 
Kimbo there a beast but so are the
scorpions<00:04:40.080> akimbo<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.830> use<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.280> scorpions<00:04:41.790> and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
scorpions akimbo I use the scorpions and

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.780 
scorpions akimbo I use the scorpions and
do<00:04:42.630> just<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.080> well<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.560> fmg9<00:04:43.800> maybe<00:04:44.670> I

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
do just as well as the fmg9 maybe I

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.610 
do just as well as the fmg9 maybe I
wouldn't<00:04:45.060> win<00:04:45.270> in<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.690> head-to-head<00:04:45.960> but<00:04:46.380> I

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
wouldn't win in a head-to-head but I

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.810 
wouldn't win in a head-to-head but I
think<00:04:47.100> I'd<00:04:47.220> have<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.400> pretty<00:04:47.640> good<00:04:47.700> chance

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
think I'd have a pretty good chance

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.700 
think I'd have a pretty good chance
because<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.720> don't<00:04:49.020> know<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.230> scorpions<00:04:49.650> are

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
because I don't know the scorpions are

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.250 
because I don't know the scorpions are
pretty<00:04:49.860> strong<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.640> g18<00:04:50.970> akimbo<00:04:51.150> also<00:04:51.990> quite

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
pretty strong the g18 akimbo also quite

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.100 
pretty strong the g18 akimbo also quite
strong<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.190> mp9<00:04:53.580> s<00:04:54.000> can<00:04:54.150> even<00:04:54.480> be<00:04:54.600> used<00:04:54.630> akimbo

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
strong the mp9 s can even be used akimbo

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.350 
strong the mp9 s can even be used akimbo
and<00:04:55.440> be<00:04:55.560> quite<00:04:55.830> strong<00:04:56.160> in<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.400> category<00:04:56.910> all

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
and be quite strong in that category all

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.760 
and be quite strong in that category all
the<00:04:57.750> pistols<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.200> me<00:04:58.290> are<00:04:58.410> pretty<00:04:58.590> much<00:04:58.710> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
the pistols to me are pretty much the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.770 
the pistols to me are pretty much the
same<00:04:58.980> but<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.790> machine<00:05:00.090> pistols<00:05:00.420> get<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.570> lot

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
same but the machine pistols get a lot

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.810 
same but the machine pistols get a lot
of<00:05:00.810> attention<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.260> as<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.530> secondary<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.640> is

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
of attention to as a secondary that is

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.300 
of attention to as a secondary that is
overpowered<00:05:03.510> but<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:04.350> me<00:05:04.530> they<00:05:04.740> seem<00:05:05.100> pretty

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
overpowered but to me they seem pretty

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.210 
overpowered but to me they seem pretty
balanced<00:05:06.090> among<00:05:06.480> each<00:05:06.630> other<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:07.260> mean<00:05:07.980> all<00:05:08.190> of

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
balanced among each other I mean all of

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.740 
balanced among each other I mean all of
these<00:05:08.490> classes<00:05:08.910> do<00:05:09.030> in<00:05:09.180> my<00:05:09.300> opinion<00:05:09.570> I've

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
these classes do in my opinion I've

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.540 
these classes do in my opinion I've
never<00:05:09.930> used<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.290> lmg<00:05:10.650> so<00:05:10.830> i<00:05:10.860> can't<00:05:11.130> speak<00:05:11.220> on

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
never used the lmg so i can't speak on

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.220 
never used the lmg so i can't speak on
that<00:05:11.610> they<00:05:11.940> have<00:05:12.120> for<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.510> snipers<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:13.020> much

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
that they have for the snipers that much

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.860 
that they have for the snipers that much
but<00:05:13.800> for<00:05:14.070> me<00:05:14.190> weapon<00:05:14.880> balance<00:05:15.240> isn't<00:05:15.420> an<00:05:15.660> issue

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
but for me weapon balance isn't an issue

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.120 
but for me weapon balance isn't an issue
and<00:05:16.200> there's<00:05:16.320> a<00:05:16.410> lot<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.590> other<00:05:16.800> things<00:05:16.860> to
