00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.429
 triple fears and summary charge in 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.530
 repair vouchers for asking until we 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.539

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.489

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.710
 quite short and not that I have so much 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.750

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.360
 video also to comment 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.360
 what he came to say is that he 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:38.990
 and the waters 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.990
 the winner of the three draw is like that 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.440
 teacher 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.080
 It's worth what the other winner 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.810
 of the draw so why has it been 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.490
 withdrawn this sending of the code and the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.580
 codes so good you choose to 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.830
 let me do what we do and that's 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.340
 good in the game pretty good 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.740
 Pretty little gun friend but the pp 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.740
 the earth are the ones that chocolate 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.209
 the accident arrived 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.650
 scavenger hard and hard line 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:24.650
 and good to the people a pretty departure 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.090
 movidita I wait with at least juste 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.239
 the race as while our part 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.920
 that was already half plan crap villa 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.540
 good distraction here you have to kill him 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.060
 well with good routines while two 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.090
 medical helicopters after which what 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.950
 I have the shot I threw it already good already I think 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.819
 that enrique are where you have insured not 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.819

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.540
 so good at 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.290
 my store this would also achieve 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 channel that you can still 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.189
 I think the visionaries 63 and a half 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.310
 cooks 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.609
 of them contain here something where 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.620
 we can make the kitchen of all 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.200
 you chat an email no longer has the click that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.939
 at half past six so it has been 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.739
 more unbalanced the time so 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.900
 say it asked us nothing I thought I 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:22.139

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.950

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.950

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.709
 in the houses 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.419
 but what happened was that they were 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.419
 exposing of the houses 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.550
 that can be more 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.200
 they were all and not only at the end 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.690
 but good the party life as I say and 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.670
