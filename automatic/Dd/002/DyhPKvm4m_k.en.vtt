00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.130
 the sony ericsson arc is a telephone 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.809
 with a high quality camera with which good photos and HD movies can be made 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 In addition, it has a variable screen and an HDMI output 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.230
 I think it's a super nice device 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.099
 it is beautifully designed so nice and slim 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.169
 it has a very large display 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.630
 in the displays it also turns around and are 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.630
 what does he do through agents who adjusts the actual to the circumstances 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.950
 the steep outside then he will ensure that the reflection removed 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.450
 therefore always becomes the best image 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.640
 nothing to it and runs on the google operating system finally 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.070
 and w with a touchscreen 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.120
 so when you enter text you do that via the qwerty keyboard on you 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.490
 screen appears 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.150
 in terms of internal storage capacity of ten, a little bit against 23 and what is it 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.200
 or actively supplied on a micro sd card 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.940
 this is still usable up to 32 flies so that should be more than sufficient 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.930
 A new bike on the phone is also the most beautiful and sleepy sun 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.690
 If Jan is talking and noisy environment ensures an active microphone 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.229
 in front of 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.740
 that the ambient noise is reduced 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.440
 what I find super beautiful at the phone stage you go out new design 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.040
 which you can close on your TV 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 and you can view your own photos and videos in HD quality 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.890
 in addition, he made the world go once again suitable as 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 media player and it is a very versatile device 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.470
 like all others and the phone back outside that your child 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.100
 aln with that time you can go through very easily I start now he is 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.160
 left columns 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.070
 and you may want to manage your applications 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.790
 we have to go now 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.150
 but touching 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.160
 and release it in the desired home screen 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.630
 in addition, the ark like me already has its very good camera from an 8 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.120
 megapixel camera with LED flash expired 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.680
 we will show something on the basis of an example how it works 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.460
 you can smell the room 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.880
 it is for sale 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 you can turn around 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 you focus and not the button to take a photo 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.039
 you want to set up just like with all phones and never very easy 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.559
 and judoka is actually a must to be able to do an application for you 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.699
 has to do but you can also simply add any webbies 0 to 14 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.179
 you can do your mail 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.569
 tno is a happy password 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.819
 in 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.840
 downloading and downloading the applications that I have already given you have a chance 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.559
 required 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.899
 and and you do one of them in the android market 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.349
 click on the icon one never make 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.450
 desired application click for name then done then appears in 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.409
 those circles that can sing main menu and which you can then divide into 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.409
 home screen 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.929
 the conclusion that the device is that it 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.480
 is nice his device is what works fast 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.249
 and has a very good camera 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.010
 and that in combination with year again does not matter whether a multimedia 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.269
 great purposes
