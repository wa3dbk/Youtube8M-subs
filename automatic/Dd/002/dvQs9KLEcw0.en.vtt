00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.430
 peoples we are back I love me 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.100
 create the Spanish brand seat too 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.889
 does the same with the presentation 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.690
 cain and abel and cain and abel exactly 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.340
 because we had now we talked about the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.230
 presentation of events and a vehicle 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.240
 that competes directly competes 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.920
 directly in this segment is toledo 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.660
 that's right and talk a little bit about the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.520
 Delight of Toledo is important because 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.740
 if we refer a little bit towards the year 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.150
 2000 more or less when it arrives in Toledo 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.080
 mexico that the truth that was a rival 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.269
 very important for the classic that that 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.579
 classic of the fourth generation that is 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.770
 about two years after leaving 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.540
 then the jetta fourth generation when 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.340
 comes to toledo the Mexican market and the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.410
 true that it was a very important shot 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.270
 that these two vehicles were being given 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.500
 at that time unfortunately for 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.270
 the seat brand came a change 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.570
 generational well a change design a 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.610
 different proposal broke with the with 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.230
 the lines that were offering this 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.850
 obviously it did not go well for the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.410
 previous generation of toledo so 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.870
 which they had to quickly put it into 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.609
 design to the laboratory and they delivered us 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.739
 a new toledo of the few errors that 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.810
 I remember in the race of valterna silva 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.159
 he took it well and tried to be a 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.039
 most utilitarian vehicle 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.460
 had a lot of trunk space a 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:18.710
 hybrid between a wagon and can not 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.899
 be so perfect the director 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.450
 observe the director responsible for 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.100
 design says all group folks pods and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.380
 is under your responsibility is 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.289
 lamborghini is bentley this way 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.289
 someone is audi skoda all brands 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.060
 they are not easy but what has 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.770
 achieved in all the rules clear is very 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.599
 popular is good there is a very 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.959
 important in toledo for this new 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.879
 generation look like new model 2016 there 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.679
 slight changes in the front there are 

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:47.899
 a very important improvement in the part of 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.119
 connectivity strengthen I think that a 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.610
 way very well to toledo to be a 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.079
 even more competitive vehicle and because 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.640
 more something very important in toledo is the 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.289
 offer of engines that is causing 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.810
 a compact sedan that has an offer 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.759
 of three engines, maybe it would be 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.069
 the only thing I would miss about having the 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.349
 engine to say ok but look we have a 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.420
 1.6 liter engine aspirated 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.030
 naturally we have a 1.2 engine 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.310
 turbocharged liters and we have an engine 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.470
 1.4 liters also tested loaded 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.510
 in the case of the 1.6-liter engine 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.870
 naturally aspirated is delivering 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.270
 110 horsepower and 7 discs 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.480
 force and 114 foot pounds of torque in the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.390
 1.2 tfsi case that only for the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.370
 style version has 110 horses but 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.480
 turbo which obviously helps you in 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.610
 cities like mexico monterrey 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.860
 Guadalajara to compensate a bit the subject 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.870
 of height and 129 foot pounds of torque 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.040
 but here comes the interesting the engine 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.799
 1.4 liter tfsi I also say everything has 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.480
 125 horsepower and 147 pounds 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.190
 director that I want also an offer 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.750
 very broad and transmissions because you 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.209
 I can offer a manual box of 5 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.400
 speeds in the versions / reference 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.420
 and you can already offer automatic 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.209
 6 speeds 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.580
 in the reference reference version 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.010
 titanic or you can already offer a box 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.250
 7 speed dsg for versions 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.180
 or for 1.4-liter engines the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.090
 prices range from 191,900 to 285 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.069
 thousand 300 pesos with this I think that 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.200
 toledo is from the sedans contacts 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.700
 rather I'm wrong is the sedan 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.549
 compact that best offer of 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.670
 engine and transmission has 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.730
 in the Mexican market even considering 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.079
 the lack of diesel that for the niche 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.079
 for good sale volumes 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.030
 yet so that significant 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.040
 offers but having these engines 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.049
 so efficient accumulated turbocharges 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.819
 the transmission is from that axis that also 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.010
 they act as a very sporty theme 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.709
 I think that not only in terms of engines 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.829
 I added a couple of arguments more I think 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.329
 that in terms of equipment 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.980
 cost-benefit and what at the end of 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.459
 day gives you as a presence because it is a 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.109
 extremely emotive design is the one given to 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.049
 overcome itself and also collectivity 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.519
 Android android car and car play are already 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.930
 available in the car in the with this 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.030
 Major link theme which is what you 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.900
 have on your mobile phone 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.569
 you can practically project in the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 This bullfighter's screen this removed him 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.049
 the magazine there is no need to be there 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.239
 link must see since that way 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.099
 no no not all that in how it operates and 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.049
 you then that you and I saw precisely 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.209
 these early attempts or what 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.750
 out back then the model 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.140
 conceptual lion 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.870
 if five years ago well now 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.690
 it's a fact in vehicles like this width 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.150
 happy idea that there will be 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.150
 lacking respect to the major
