00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
this in your car all the time now if you

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.020 
this in your car all the time now if you
live<00:02:09.480> in<00:02:09.510> some<00:02:09.960> iffy<00:02:10.560> area<00:02:11.010> or<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.580> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
live in some iffy area or you just you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.460 
live in some iffy area or you just you
know<00:02:12.150> very<00:02:12.390> cautious<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.680> might<00:02:13.890> want<00:02:14.160> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
know very cautious you might want to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.260 
know very cautious you might want to
move<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:15.010> panel<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.820> case<00:02:16.060> it's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
move this panel so in this case it's

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.240 
move this panel so in this case it's
possible<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.780> think<00:02:17.080> that's<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.560> Boston<00:02:18.070> right

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
possible I think that's the Boston right

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.980 
possible I think that's the Boston right
here<00:02:18.580> physical<00:02:19.030> Boston<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:19.540> when<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.810> press

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
here physical Boston so when you press

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.910 
here physical Boston so when you press
it<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.440> fascia<00:02:22.170> detaches<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.200> basically<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
it the fascia detaches and basically can

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.880 
it the fascia detaches and basically can
gather<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.610> away<00:02:24.820> with<00:02:25.030> you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
pretty pretty much all the radios have

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
this now radio data system so that's

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.570 
this now radio data system so that's
RDS<00:02:52.170> probably<00:02:53.170> 20<00:02:53.530> years<00:02:53.680> old<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.070> not<00:02:54.220> more<00:02:54.459> at

RDS probably 20 years old if not more at
the<00:02:54.670> moment<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.959> yeah<00:02:56.110> pretty<00:02:56.350> much<00:02:56.470> all<00:02:56.740> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
standards are there so you can use your

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.949 
standards are there so you can use your
iPhone<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.700> all<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.810> most

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
iPhone and all that and the most

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.020 
iPhone and all that and the most
important<00:03:02.500> thing<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.130> price<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.760> also

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
important thing for the price you also

get a microphone and that means that you
can<00:03:08.770> do<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> hands-free<00:03:09.520> calling<00:03:09.850> we're<00:03:10.270> going

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
radio and here you have looks like a

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.020 
radio and here you have looks like a
lavalier<00:04:24.760> microphone<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:27.039> basically<00:04:27.400> where

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
lavalier microphone and basically where

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.300 
lavalier microphone and basically where
would<00:04:28.210> login<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:29.110> you're<00:04:29.830> looking<00:04:30.070> at<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
would login if you're looking at the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.770 
would login if you're looking at the
windscreen<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.910> plug<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.240> somewhere<00:04:31.630> like

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
windscreen you plug in somewhere like

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.680 
windscreen you plug in somewhere like
this<00:04:31.930> pointing<00:04:32.410> towards<00:04:32.830> yourself<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.690> if

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
this pointing towards yourself and if

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.659 
this pointing towards yourself and if
you<00:04:34.960> want<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:35.590> could<00:04:35.680> even<00:04:35.740> put<00:04:36.160> some<00:04:36.220> sort<00:04:36.580> of

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
you want you could even put some sort of

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.820 
you want you could even put some sort of
foamy<00:04:37.150> thing<00:04:37.360> around<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.470> wind<00:04:38.680> noise

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
foamy thing around it so the wind noise

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.700 
foamy thing around it so the wind noise
will<00:04:39.190> not<00:04:39.340> be<00:04:39.550> obstructing<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.710> audio

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
will not be obstructing the audio

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.560 
will not be obstructing the audio
quality<00:04:42.450> making<00:04:43.450> it<00:04:43.660> worse<00:04:43.930> or<00:04:44.350> not<00:04:44.470> not<00:04:44.680> check

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
quality making it worse or not not check

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.920 
quality making it worse or not not check
inside

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
inside

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.560 
inside
we<00:04:47.260> obviously<00:04:47.410> have<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:49.090> bunch<00:04:49.389> of

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
we obviously have that you bunch of

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.360 
we obviously have that you bunch of
manuals<00:04:51.419> okay<00:04:52.419> that's<00:04:52.810> about<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:54.419> so

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
manuals okay that's about it so

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.490 
manuals okay that's about it so
obviously<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.580> manuals<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.990> whatnot

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
obviously you have manuals and whatnot

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.960 
obviously you have manuals and whatnot
for<00:04:59.950> all<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.220> numbers<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:02.730> radio<00:05:03.730> itself

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
for all the numbers and radio itself

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.640 
for all the numbers and radio itself
radio<00:05:04.540> is<00:05:04.750> very<00:05:05.290> light<00:05:06.780> part<00:05:07.780> of<00:05:07.990> that<00:05:08.200> is<00:05:08.440> I

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
radio is very light part of that is I

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.520 
radio is very light part of that is I
suppose<00:05:09.010> because<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.880> doesn't<00:05:10.390> have<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:10.630> CD<00:05:11.230> or

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
suppose because it doesn't have a CD or

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.730 
suppose because it doesn't have a CD or
a<00:05:11.919> DVD<00:05:12.400> or<00:05:13.120> whatnot<00:05:13.480> format<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:14.380> there's<00:05:14.560> no

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
a DVD or whatnot format so there's no

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.470 
a DVD or whatnot format so there's no
disc<00:05:15.040> format<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.669> be<00:05:15.700> played<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:16.360> it's

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
disc format to be played so it's

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.850 
disc format to be played so it's
basically<00:05:16.900> just<00:05:17.220> amplifier<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:18.580> the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
basically just amplifier and the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.460 
basically just amplifier and the
computational<00:05:20.860> part<00:05:21.960> for<00:05:22.960> what<00:05:23.260> you're<00:05:23.440> using

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
computational part for what you're using

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.820 
computational part for what you're using
it<00:05:23.890> for<00:05:23.919> looks<00:05:24.370> very<00:05:24.610> basic<00:05:25.120> from<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.479> front

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
it for looks very basic from the front

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.790 
it for looks very basic from the front
which<00:05:26.830> you'd<00:05:27.040> expect<00:05:27.190> for<00:05:27.880> this<00:05:28.770> type<00:05:29.770> of

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
which you'd expect for this type of

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.240 
which you'd expect for this type of
price<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.840> that's<00:05:31.840> how<00:05:32.080> it<00:05:32.229> looks<00:05:32.260> like<00:05:32.560> hope

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
price and that's how it looks like hope

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.920 
price and that's how it looks like hope
you<00:05:33.370> guys<00:05:33.550> can<00:05:33.820> see<00:05:34.150> it<00:05:35.910> there<00:05:36.910> we<00:05:37.000> go<00:05:37.150> nice<00:05:37.660> and

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
you guys can see it there we go nice and

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.880 
you guys can see it there we go nice and
shiny<00:05:38.110> surface<00:05:38.770> now<00:05:39.900> for<00:05:40.900> as<00:05:41.260> I<00:05:41.410> said<00:05:41.650> I<00:05:41.680> won't

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
shiny surface now for as I said I won't

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.350 
shiny surface now for as I said I won't
go<00:05:42.070> for<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.370> menus<00:05:42.729> or<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:42.970> portions

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
go for the menus or the portions

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.540 
go for the menus or the portions
basically<00:05:43.810> either<00:05:43.930> have<00:05:44.590> a<00:05:44.620> phone<00:05:44.979> answer

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
basically either have a phone answer

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.460 
basically either have a phone answer
reject<00:05:46.000> bottom<00:05:46.390> here<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:46.960> have<00:05:47.050> your

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
reject bottom here you have your

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.350 
reject bottom here you have your
up-and-down<00:05:47.919> for<00:05:48.490> suppose<00:05:48.880> your<00:05:49.060> radio

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
up-and-down for suppose your radio

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.360 
up-and-down for suppose your radio
stations<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.110> have<00:05:50.229> iPod<00:05:50.740> mode

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
stations you have iPod mode

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.290 
stations you have iPod mode
playback<00:05:51.910> controls<00:05:52.560> every<00:05:53.560> USB<00:05:54.250> oh<00:05:54.550> pretty

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
playback controls every USB oh pretty

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.060 
playback controls every USB oh pretty
neat<00:05:55.539> so<00:05:55.810> it's<00:05:55.900> actually<00:05:56.260> an<00:05:56.350> opening<00:05:56.680> dawn<00:05:56.890> or

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
neat so it's actually an opening dawn or

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.640 
neat so it's actually an opening dawn or
the<00:05:57.160> rubber<00:05:57.340> thingy<00:05:58.440> or<00:05:59.440> USB<00:06:00.690> auxiliary<00:06:01.690> in<00:06:02.350> so

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
the rubber thingy or USB auxiliary in so

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.870 
the rubber thingy or USB auxiliary in so
for<00:06:02.830> that's<00:06:03.039> for<00:06:03.220> three-and-a-half

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
for that's for three-and-a-half

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.190 
for that's for three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:06:05.430> this<00:06:06.430> I<00:06:06.760> suppose<00:06:07.150> yep<00:06:07.660> that<00:06:07.930> does

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
millimeter this I suppose yep that does

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.040 
millimeter this I suppose yep that does
remove<00:06:08.650> the<00:06:08.830> front<00:06:09.130> panel<00:06:09.479> so<00:06:10.479> it<00:06:10.660> would<00:06:10.870> look

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
remove the front panel so it would look

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.260 
remove the front panel so it would look
like<00:06:11.260> so<00:06:11.560> when<00:06:11.770> it's<00:06:11.950> removed<00:06:12.160> I'll<00:06:13.120> actually

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
like so when it's removed I'll actually

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.880 
like so when it's removed I'll actually
put<00:06:13.690> this<00:06:13.780> away<00:06:13.960> for<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.350> moment<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:14.770> that

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
put this away for the moment so that

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.270 
put this away for the moment so that
would<00:06:14.979> be<00:06:15.100> easier<00:06:15.370> for<00:06:15.550> me<00:06:15.669> to<00:06:15.700> show<00:06:15.820> you<00:06:16.030> there

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
would be easier for me to show you there

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.680 
would be easier for me to show you there
types<00:06:18.280> of<00:06:18.520> bushings<00:06:19.060> on<00:06:19.240> this<00:06:21.270> what<00:06:22.270> else<00:06:22.450> do

I'm<00:06:31.870> not<00:06:32.020> sure<00:06:32.169> what<00:06:32.320> that<00:06:32.350> changes<00:06:32.919> and<00:06:33.160> the

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
I'm not sure what that changes and the

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.240 
I'm not sure what that changes and the
volume<00:06:33.729> knob<00:06:35.610> seems<00:06:36.610> solid<00:06:36.849> enough<00:06:37.090> and<00:06:38.250> has

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
volume knob seems solid enough and has

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.890 
volume knob seems solid enough and has
some<00:06:39.460> sort<00:06:39.640> of<00:06:39.729> push<00:06:39.940> function

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
some sort of push function

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.020 
let's go touch for the back now very
interesting<00:06:45.730> where<00:06:46.389> the<00:06:46.780> actual<00:06:47.760> there<00:06:48.760> we<00:06:48.880> go

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
interesting where the actual there we go

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.120 
interesting where the actual there we go
so<00:06:49.660> in<00:06:49.960> the<00:06:50.110> back<00:06:50.229> you<00:06:50.470> actually<00:06:50.830> have<00:06:50.949> this

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
so in the back you actually have this

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.820 
so in the back you actually have this
cable<00:06:51.400> collect<00:06:51.910> connected<00:06:52.810> and<00:06:53.050> that's<00:06:53.620> your

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
cable collect connected and that's your

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.590 
cable collect connected and that's your
microphone<00:06:54.370> input<00:06:54.790> so<00:06:55.060> you<00:06:55.120> don't<00:06:55.300> have<00:06:55.449> to

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
microphone input so you don't have to

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.270 
microphone input so you don't have to
plug<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.080> microphone<00:06:56.380> in<00:06:56.770> front<00:06:56.830> you<00:06:57.250> just

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
plug the microphone in front you just

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.360 
plug the microphone in front you just
plug<00:06:57.610> it<00:06:57.639> in<00:06:57.820> behind<00:06:58.240> the<00:06:58.360> dashboard<00:06:59.190> wire<00:07:00.190> the

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
plug it in behind the dashboard wire the

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.030 
plug it in behind the dashboard wire the
cable<00:07:00.760> way<00:07:00.880> you<00:07:00.940> want<00:07:01.330> to<00:07:01.510> pop<00:07:02.139> out<00:07:02.350> and<00:07:02.710> that's

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
cable way you want to pop out and that's

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.640 
cable way you want to pop out and that's
it<00:07:03.220> that's<00:07:04.120> your<00:07:04.330> aerial<00:07:04.870> in<00:07:05.020> that's<00:07:05.440> just

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
it that's your aerial in that's just

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.740 
it that's your aerial in that's just
because<00:07:05.800> left<00:07:06.220> and<00:07:06.520> right<00:07:06.910> and<00:07:07.270> your

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
because left and right and your

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.159 
because left and right and your
subwoofer<00:07:09.090> actually<00:07:10.860> should<00:07:11.860> go<00:07:13.169> through

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
subwoofer actually should go through

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.500 
subwoofer actually should go through
here<00:07:14.710> I'm<00:07:14.889> not<00:07:15.070> sure<00:07:15.370> which<00:07:15.580> which<00:07:15.940> one<00:07:16.180> is<00:07:16.330> now

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510 
here I'm not sure which which one is now

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.659 
here I'm not sure which which one is now
for<00:07:16.900> subwoofer<00:07:17.470> it<00:07:17.590> doesn't<00:07:17.889> say<00:07:18.130> much<00:07:18.430> but

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
for subwoofer it doesn't say much but

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.340 
for subwoofer it doesn't say much but
I'm<00:07:21.669> sure<00:07:21.940> if<00:07:22.090> I<00:07:22.210> went<00:07:22.389> for<00:07:22.570> the<00:07:22.660> manuals<00:07:23.050> there

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350 
I'm sure if I went for the manuals there

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.750 
I'm sure if I went for the manuals there
should<00:07:23.590> be<00:07:23.710> something<00:07:23.919> for<00:07:24.160> the<00:07:24.220> subwoofer

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760 
should be something for the subwoofer

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.550 
should be something for the subwoofer
usually<00:07:25.150> I'd<00:07:25.240> be<00:07:25.270> used<00:07:25.900> to<00:07:26.080> say<00:07:26.260> woofer
