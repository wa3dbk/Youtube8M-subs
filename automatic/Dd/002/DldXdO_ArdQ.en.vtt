00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
hoping I'll do it soon but it's just

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.150

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.279 
looking kills and thinking right if I
get<00:04:49.820> killed<00:04:50.060> now<00:04:50.240> it's<00:04:50.840> not<00:04:50.960> gonna<00:04:51.110> be<00:04:51.260> a

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
get killed now it's not gonna be a

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.510 
get killed now it's not gonna be a
biggie<00:04:51.500> because<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.860> games<00:04:52.010> about<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.250> end

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
biggie because the games about to end

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.490 
biggie because the games about to end
anyway<00:04:52.789> I<00:04:53.060> would<00:04:53.630> have<00:04:53.720> been<00:04:53.810> pissed<00:04:53.990> off<00:04:54.110> but

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
anyway I would have been pissed off but

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.050 
anyway I would have been pissed off but
that<00:04:54.530> definitely<00:04:55.190> helps<00:04:55.460> me<00:04:55.520> there<00:04:55.699> I<00:04:55.729> think

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
that definitely helps me there I think

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.659 
that definitely helps me there I think
that<00:04:56.240> counts<00:04:56.510> as<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> kill<00:04:56.960> shooting<00:04:57.440> an<00:04:58.070> IMS<00:04:58.520> or

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
that counts as a kill shooting an IMS or

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.029 
that counts as a kill shooting an IMS or
something<00:04:59.470> but<00:05:00.470> yeah<00:05:00.590> but<00:05:00.710> there's<00:05:00.860> four

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
something but yeah but there's four

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.180 
something but yeah but there's four
kills<00:05:01.310> needed<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:02.919> yeah<00:05:03.919> I'm<00:05:04.010> not<00:05:04.160> really

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
kills needed and yeah I'm not really

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.409 
kills needed and yeah I'm not really
counting<00:05:04.580> my<00:05:04.639> chickens<00:05:04.940> up<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.090> minute<00:05:05.300> I'm
