00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.059 
just have to make this tutorial anyway
once<00:02:11.170> that's<00:02:11.380> done<00:02:11.530> make<00:02:11.770> sure<00:02:11.800> they're

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
once that's done make sure they're

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.680 
once that's done make sure they're
flipped<00:02:12.340> over<00:02:13.350> dad<00:02:14.350> once<00:02:14.830> I've<00:02:15.010> done<00:02:15.690> trying

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
flipped over dad once I've done trying

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.730 
flipped over dad once I've done trying
to<00:02:16.750> water<00:02:16.900> off<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.290> leave<00:02:17.410> them<00:02:17.440> there<00:02:17.560> for

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
to water off and leave them there for

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.500 
to water off and leave them there for
about<00:02:20.100> I'd<00:02:21.100> say<00:02:21.160> three<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.760> five<00:02:22.000> minutes<00:02:22.360> so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
about I'd say three to five minutes so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.120 
about I'd say three to five minutes so
you<00:02:22.570> can<00:02:22.750> soak<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.350> get<00:02:23.500> all<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.770> crusty

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
you can soak in and get all that crusty

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.940 
you can soak in and get all that crusty
dirt<00:02:24.490> make<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.060> all<00:02:25.150> soft<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.840> take<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.740> scrub

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
dirt make it all soft and take a scrub

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.400 
dirt make it all soft and take a scrub
it<00:02:27.070> off<00:02:27.100> easier<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.120> go<00:02:29.050> ahead<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.230> leave<00:02:29.350> that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
it off easier so go ahead and leave that

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.949 
it off easier so go ahead and leave that
for<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.130> couple<00:02:31.090> minutes<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.630> going<00:02:31.780> back

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
for a couple minutes and it's going back

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.650 
for a couple minutes and it's going back
to<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> they're<00:02:32.560> done<00:02:32.590> sitting<00:02:32.950> there<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.310> now

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.110 

and<00:04:08.659> then<00:04:08.989> that's<00:04:09.379> pretty<00:04:10.129> much<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:11.030> he

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
and then that's pretty much it then he

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
process with the next four wheels um so

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.900 
process with the next four wheels um so
yeah<00:04:18.039> all<00:04:19.039> right<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.400> finished<00:04:19.579> rubbing

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
yeah all right so I finished rubbing

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.620 
yeah all right so I finished rubbing
them<00:04:20.090> down<00:04:21.280> good<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.400> go<00:04:22.520> just<00:04:23.090> let<00:04:23.270> them<00:04:23.330> dry

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
and once they're fully dried you'll be

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.850 
and once they're fully dried you'll be
able<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.930> tell<00:04:27.080> if<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.259> got<00:04:27.350> all<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.560> dirt<00:04:27.740> or

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
not because the dirt will reappear and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.460 
not because the dirt will reappear and
like<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.460> said<00:04:31.570> about<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.720> tread<00:04:33.020> make<00:04:33.440> sure

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
like I said about the tread make sure

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.930 
like I said about the tread make sure
you<00:04:33.740> brush<00:04:33.949> it<00:04:34.009> in<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.310> way<00:04:34.460> where<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.729> can<00:04:34.759> get

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
you brush it in a way where you can get

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.730 
you brush it in a way where you can get
the<00:04:35.090> bristles<00:04:35.509> to<00:04:35.660> go<00:04:35.840> through<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.440> tread

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740
