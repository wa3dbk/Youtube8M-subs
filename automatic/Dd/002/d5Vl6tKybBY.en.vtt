00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.810
 how well she copes with 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.970
 road bumps for today we will 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.740
 check 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.510
 another system another characteristic 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.010
 car more precisely this system 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.539
 electronic parking sepo is called 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.910
 only stop to a little bit 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.400
 skip the traffic and try to explain 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.940
 how does the valet service itself we need for 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.240
 this click here here to the left of the steering wheel 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.820
 Autoparking auto switch on button 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.940
 icons appear on the central display 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.560
 between analog devices and all we need 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.560
 gives you a chance to park 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.280
 parallel only on the right side 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.960
 roads since we are built by traffic 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.420
 he sees it here instead of much 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.800
 finds us this place but here it can 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.800
 bear park me more 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.110
 like this place between the trades and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 altimo try to park the car but 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.540
 here we are just going to wait bye 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.420
 parks 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.120
 here it is again to show that behind this 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.130
 there is a place on this this place is big for us 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:26.890
 need less so let's still here 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.770
 we are going to wait until the system can find 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:37.980
 we have something here she found the emergency gang 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:42.640
 included reverse gear releasing the role 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:46.170
 he fin begin to pack I only 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 slightly hold the brake 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:59.150
 on gas naturally recently and we are trying 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:04.030
 the system tries us to park the steering 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.470
 with something there twists unscrews 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.690
 looked around like us hair salute with 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.660
 bodies everything goes perfectly important thing 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.150
 it is fast that is 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.480
 yourself don't let go of the brake pedal because 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.970
 that then the system understands it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.920
 parktronic confused on suggests that 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:42.920
 close trade wind is very critical so 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:53.110
 Nearing this does not want the same role 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:53.110
 himself will be certain actions 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.660
 Well , it means that somehow we are for 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.660
 parked 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:14.319
 Well, in principle, not bad so that girls have 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.280
 whom a little experience and the boys advise 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.140
 you acquire corolla with this 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.140
 system really helps
