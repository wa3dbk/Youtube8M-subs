00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.309
 The old Bismarck clock had not dreamed that the same 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.300
 behind his back so many runners get up early in the morning 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.429
 sinful mile 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.699
 to trample 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.239

 the symbol of the free Hanseatic city 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.340
 Anna would be the other way around, she would all see the big one behind 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.310
 Runner field 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.050
 In the last few years there was something unique about theirs 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.690
 there were three corridors started at 9 o'clock at 0 05 and 0 0 10 today 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.560
 beats Germany's biggest top four at nine o'clock and then 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.030
 is it starting 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.810
 times 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.250

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.930
 got to know Norway quite relaxed just before 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 Lauk still 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.380
 Countdown has expired 22 years died at the fairground 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 That's history 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.390
 Now here's the direction on the boards 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.350
 three runner streams are they too 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.710
 It is a pity that Schuon 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.079
 but she stands at the beginning of this one runner line 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.520
 Ulrike Maisch on the way to the Olympic norms 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.210
 Question mark 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.350
 behind her 23 thousand is not quite enough 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.350
 Runners and runners

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.200
 Angela Suleman instead of "Now they all have the bell 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.790
 in Hamburg in New York, the Wala has ham in the belly 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.240
 gallon 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 for both the FIFA ship bell 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.970
 this bell he not only just ushered in the race sun of course 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.420
 also a lot of superlatives and some novelties 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.819
 here in the Hanseatic city what a picture 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.069

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.999
 lets the big stem and trample the feet at the start of the sinful 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.319
 Mile of the earthquake earthquake or shivering on the Reeperbahn and back 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.019
 at the end of the field 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.290
 The foundation Felix for children suffering from cancer is collected 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.909
 good tradition in the Hanseatic city 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
 that will not only run but also all the others thought 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.599
 What a wonderful colorful crowd economy at unusual hour 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.669

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.029
 Marathon of the world though 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.449

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.809
 to the hamburger 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.639
 many say the most beautiful in the world 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.639
 the deadlines could have been everywhere 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.760

 Quirks at the start 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.079

 in this city 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.409
 on bubbles 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.319
 instead of connecting a variant of the Michel would have been the same to the 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.360
 Corner stands 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.360

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.979

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.190
 As this advised city bubbles 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.190

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.809
 and she has this great run 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:42.129
 In the early morning, the weather started blindingly 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.430
 like on the Reeperbahn 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.430
 is run on both sides of the road 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:49.780
 maybe 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.780
 spectacular is the first marathon kilometer worldwide shrunk on the 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.460

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.919
 Powder keg answer to the COMEN 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.840

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.490
 Ron Wilson now it starts no matter what you have open three or 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.349

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.680
 ever finish 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 that's the biggest goal for most 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.580
 since the goods Spielbudenplatz St -pauli-theater hans-albers-platz 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.629
 Erotic Art Museum madhouse and the great freedom 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.210

 Every year, the world-famous mile attracts around 25 million onlookers today 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.460
 in one fell swoop, about twenty thousand neuffer 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.180
 once a year I appreciate that the Milky Way is over as the 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.659
 Countless clubs and bars and cafes and pubs in the area here market 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.719
 Even behind this dusty says no reason to excite the time in 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.979
 who took it when project gets me rolling 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:13.840
 the club boss 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.639

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.839
 everyone can shop or rent 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.699
 the red life juice stood in the year 1996 still the time-honored Millerntor 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:25.979
 Skyscraper that was then 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.860
 blown up because asbestos contaminated 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.349
