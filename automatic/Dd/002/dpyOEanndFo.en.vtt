00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello girls I'm g m2 loquillo we're 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.419
 with a budget of 800 900 euros 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.269
 remember that the budget does not bring 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:13.400
 assembly but I encourage you all to 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.799
 mount it in your houses since you thought 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.750
 which is something very easy and simple and with 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.060
 what you can enjoy doing 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.250
 you also have a video on my channel 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.099
 how to do these steps so good 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.009
 we go to the budget and the goals towers 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.380
 of motherboards we have chosen one ms 97 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.110
 matte times motherboard is a motherboard 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.270
 tx brings 4 modules to fit for me 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.640
 sorry to enter 4 direct there's 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.789
 four slots to enter four 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.230
 ram modules thing we'll use two in 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.850
 this case to take advantage of the dual 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.620
 channel and in the future we can use 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.530
 another two to expand our memory 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.239
 ram brings an express pci and an additional one 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.350
 in case we would like to do the slide 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.850
 crossfire and 32 pc and a good normal pc and 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.550
 another two pc and to be able to connect 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.220
 sound cards or video cards or 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.050
 what we want 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.710
 the processor we have chosen an intel 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.310
 core i5 4.460 is one of the haswell range 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.050
 ok going to a speed of 32 is a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.230
 processor to play and what what 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.030
 let's use is pretty pretty 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.980
 decent or is ready to play 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.410
 to ultra i7 you already know that I just 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.170
 I recommend when it comes to editing 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.970
 video or editing stuff like that is worth it since 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.430
 with eddie 5 we would see it behind work 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.520
 without any disk problems 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.770
 hard we have chosen a terabyte of caviar 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.510
 blue digital western pardon and it's a 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.280
 hard drive where we can install and 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.110
 put all the data that we want in a 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.750
 future yes I would recommend putting a 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.160
 ssd system is worth to start 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.650
 faster and such what happens that of 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.690
 At the moment I think they are a bit expensive 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.340
 they will share that card option 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.350
 graphic we have gone we have invested in 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.700
 Castilla most of the budget for the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.020
 fact that he will be the one who is engaged 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.490
 We in the games since ran the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.190
 we will have cover on the processor 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.180
 we have also chosen a gigabyte 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.770
 has gtx 970 whitford 3x that is coming 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.500
 given from factory by the company arrives 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.229
 dance has 4 gigas of ram 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.759
 pr5 that graphics card we should not 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.380
 have any kind of problem at the time 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.840
 to play since it's a graphics card 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.370
 that will give us absolutely good and 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.350
 We will go great on almost everyone 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.790
 come out now weird would it be that there 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.140
 some game that asked us more of this 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.690
 graphic back 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.959
 of ram we have chosen those of 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.760
 we always check the skin x ddr3 to 1600 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.530
 in two 4gb modules to be able 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.370
 take advantage of the dual channel with a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.150
 latency cl 9 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.030
 length of the stand in order to use the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.250
 old better the box in this case we have 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.560
 chosen one in the sea one in the max 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.959
 ström black and white vélez I think to use 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.480
 Pretty pretty house and it's not the done 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.040
 of having flow over everything that I have 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.260
 looked for this house that did not know 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 a lot of cost is insane and is located at 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.629
 the hymen touch account is because it is 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.430
 very important that the source 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.250
 power fence located in the part 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.900
 bottom of the box since all the air 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.159
 to focus on the source 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.530
 you will press it towards 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.000
 outside I started in in the other 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.129
 boxes the power supply could be 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.140
 see up here and expelled to the air 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.860
 inside what is the box I have very 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.870
 close the processor 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.760
 of heatsinks in an intense going to 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.650
 heat almost nothing because we have chosen a 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.630
 basic heatsink circulating the master 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.630
 hyper xx 3 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.040
 then selection basically to have 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.470
 the best that the factory is going to be 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.020
 that the factory is bad enough and the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.510
 of inmates tend to heat more 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.129
 no way 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.700
 and from power supply then what of 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.260
 always a noc surano vx 750w that is 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.720
 a food source that will give us 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.189
 quite enough of each other for what 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.790
 we will want since the new 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.769
 graphics gtx 970 do not consume much I have not 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.150
 chosen a little more power by the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.890
 fact that the sources that bring us 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.319
 80 plus certificate usually yield 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.239
 quite below the level that says 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.500
 then without any problem our 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.390
 big with this power supply 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.519
 we will be able to go pulling 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.049
 we also recommend of course it is 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.629
 that you do a control of all the 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.980
 when you count it, it's worth it and this has been 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.840
 all guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.389
 leave that like us try light 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:19.600
 favorites and see you soon by the way in 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:21.459
 the special polls to vote 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.620
 by twitter because it interests 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.280
 Lord earn life habits and see you soon 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.280
 888
