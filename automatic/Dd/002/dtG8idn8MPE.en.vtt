00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.360 
another thing I'd like to show you you
can<00:02:49.389> change<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.810> time<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.200> day<00:02:50.409> through<00:02:51.219> these

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
can change the time of day through these

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.550 
can change the time of day through these
same<00:02:51.819> commands<00:02:52.299> as<00:02:52.950> well<00:02:53.950> as<00:02:54.069> teleport<00:02:54.639> so

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
same commands as well as teleport so

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.869 
same commands as well as teleport so
let's<00:02:56.560> try<00:02:56.739> teleporting<00:02:57.340> there's<00:02:57.609> no<00:02:57.760> one

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
let's try teleporting there's no one

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.459 
let's try teleporting there's no one
else<00:02:57.939> in<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.209> server<00:02:58.450> right<00:02:58.659> now<00:02:58.810> but<00:02:59.109> just<00:02:59.290> an

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
else in the server right now but just an

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.399 
else in the server right now but just an
example<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.489> would<00:03:00.609> type<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:00.939> TP<00:03:01.389> and<00:03:01.599> then

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
example you would type in TP and then

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.659 
example you would type in TP and then
the<00:03:02.919> name<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.609> person<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.299> would<00:03:04.900> like<00:03:05.169> to

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
the name of the person you would like to

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.649 
the name of the person you would like to
teleport<00:03:06.669> to<00:03:06.969> the<00:03:07.000> person<00:03:07.329> who<00:03:07.419> will<00:03:07.569> be

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
teleport to the person who will be

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.240 
teleport to the person who will be
moving<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.799> name<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.099> person

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
moving and then the name of the person

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.610 
moving and then the name of the person
that's<00:03:09.669> their<00:03:09.939> destination<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.319> this<00:03:11.439> would

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that's their destination so this would

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.209 
that's their destination so this would
have<00:03:11.739> transported<00:03:12.250> Bob<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:13.919> Jamal<00:03:14.919> to<00:03:15.069> Bob

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
have transported Bob to Jamal to Bob

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.300 
have transported Bob to Jamal to Bob
this<00:03:15.519> would<00:03:15.819> have<00:03:15.909> transported<00:03:16.419> Bob<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.780> Jamal

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
this would have transported Bob to Jamal

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.800 
this would have transported Bob to Jamal
but<00:03:18.310> there's<00:03:18.549> only<00:03:19.000> one<00:03:19.329> player<00:03:19.659> in<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
but there's only one player in the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.959 
but there's only one player in the
server<00:03:20.049> right<00:03:20.230> now<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:24.250> now<00:03:24.370> also<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.760> can

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:24.969 
server right now so now also you can

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.720 
server right now so now also you can
change<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.419> time<00:03:25.599> of<00:03:25.750> day<00:03:26.019> in<00:03:26.949> your<00:03:27.280> Minecraft

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
change the time of day in your Minecraft

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.349 
change the time of day in your Minecraft
world<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.590> can<00:03:29.739> add<00:03:29.889> time<00:03:30.159> values<00:03:30.549> most<00:03:31.209> of

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
world so you can add time values most of

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.789 
world so you can add time values most of
them<00:03:31.540> will<00:03:31.719> not<00:03:31.900> make<00:03:32.139> much<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.379> a<00:03:32.530> difference

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
them will not make much of a difference

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.099 
them will not make much of a difference
for<00:03:32.889> example<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.579> 100<00:03:34.510> change<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.930> time

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
for example a 100 change in the time

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.119 
for example a 100 change in the time
value<00:03:35.319> looks<00:03:35.889> like<00:03:36.069> nothing<00:03:36.280> even<00:03:36.519> happened<00:03:36.900> a

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
value looks like nothing even happened a

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.809 
value looks like nothing even happened a
1000<00:03:39.129> change<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.609> time<00:03:39.790> value<00:03:40.259> and<00:03:41.819> let's

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
1000 change in the time value and let's

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.559 
1000 change in the time value and let's
see<00:03:44.129> it's<00:03:45.129> a<00:03:45.220> little<00:03:45.250> bit<00:03:45.699> later<00:03:45.879> still<00:03:46.359> can't

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
see it's a little bit later still can't

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.009 
see it's a little bit later still can't
really<00:03:46.780> tell<00:03:46.989> what's<00:03:47.169> your<00:03:47.319> difference<00:03:49.019> now

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
really tell what's your difference now

00:03:50.019 --> 00:04:02.240 
really tell what's your difference now
let's<00:03:50.199> try<00:03:50.560> uh<00:03:53.220> let's<00:03:54.220> go<00:03:54.340> 10,000

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.160 

there<00:04:02.880> we<00:04:03.000> go<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.360> now<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.900> dead<00:04:04.140> of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
there we go so now it's the dead of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.560 
there we go so now it's the dead of
night<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:05.820> if<00:04:05.910> you'd<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.210> have<00:04:06.420> fun

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
changing the time of day you can do that

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.220
