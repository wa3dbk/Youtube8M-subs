00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
tissue up specially in the section here

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.710

or<00:03:00.519> just<00:03:00.760> get<00:03:00.880> wherever<00:03:01.150> your<00:03:01.269> type<00:03:01.450> that's

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
or just get wherever your type that's

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.690 
or just get wherever your type that's
basically<00:03:02.139> where<00:03:02.349> I'm<00:03:02.500> tight<00:03:02.709> on<00:03:03.010> both<00:03:03.400> sides

cool thing about this that I kind of

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
of use this that's not because what you

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.090 
of use this that's not because what you
can<00:04:56.770> do

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
can do

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.960 
can do
you<00:04:57.370> should<00:04:57.550> get<00:04:57.720> tight<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:59.470> make<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.970> shorter

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
you should get tight to make it shorter

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.840 
you should get tight to make it shorter
or<00:05:01.120> more<00:05:01.300> tense<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.130> allows<00:05:03.490> actually

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
or more tense and that allows actually

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.830 
or more tense and that allows actually
get<00:05:03.970> more<00:05:04.150> attention<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.540> little<00:05:04.600> bit<00:05:04.750> more

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
get more attention a little bit more

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.170 
get more attention a little bit more
kind<00:05:05.350> of<00:05:05.550> slope<00:05:06.550> something<00:05:06.850> different

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
kind of slope something different

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.160 
kind of slope something different
different<00:05:07.510> kind<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:07.870> resistance<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:10.170> that's

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
different kind of resistance and that's

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.810 
different kind of resistance and that's
pretty<00:05:11.290> much<00:05:11.470> what<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.680> do<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:12.070> know<00:05:12.100> that

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
pretty much what I do you know that

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.760 
pretty much what I do you know that
squat<00:05:13.620> position<00:05:14.620> on<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.700> bar<00:05:16.620> straight<00:05:17.620> she

still<00:05:22.220> far<00:05:22.430> from<00:05:22.550> perfect<00:05:22.639> I<00:05:23.300> do<00:05:23.990> want<00:05:24.259> to

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
still far from perfect I do want to

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:31.689 
still far from perfect I do want to
demonstrate<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.830> can<00:05:24.979> do<00:05:25.100> what<00:05:30.400> so<00:05:31.400> far

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
demonstrate that I can do what so far

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.330 
demonstrate that I can do what so far
cuz<00:05:31.880> I<00:05:31.970> think<00:05:32.030> my<00:05:32.570> bar<00:05:32.750> is<00:05:32.840> not<00:05:32.990> wide<00:05:33.169> enough

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
cuz I think my bar is not wide enough

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.400 
cuz I think my bar is not wide enough
there<00:05:34.340> are<00:05:34.370> no<00:05:34.580> bar<00:05:34.789> bells<00:05:35.030> here<00:05:38.080> anyways<00:05:39.080> what

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
there are no bar bells here anyways what

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.200 
there are no bar bells here anyways what
I<00:05:39.440> was<00:05:39.800> like<00:05:39.919> what<00:05:40.130> I<00:05:40.160> got<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.669> promise<00:05:41.120> that's

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
I was like what I got I promise that's

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.610 
I was like what I got I promise that's
what<00:05:41.389> I<00:05:41.419> would<00:05:41.570> do<00:05:41.660> on<00:05:41.690> this<00:05:41.870> video<00:05:42.440> number

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
what I would do on this video number

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.279 
what I would do on this video number
seven<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:44.240> spent<00:05:44.479> about<00:05:44.509> 90<00:05:44.900> minutes<00:05:45.050> doing

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
seven and I spent about 90 minutes doing

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.300 
seven and I spent about 90 minutes doing
that<00:05:45.410> I<00:05:45.530> could<00:05:45.650> probably<00:05:45.800> cut<00:05:45.979> that<00:05:46.100> down<00:05:46.250> to

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
that I could probably cut that down to

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.970 
that I could probably cut that down to
30<00:05:47.000> to<00:05:47.180> 45<00:05:47.630> minutes<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.949> thank<00:05:49.880> you
