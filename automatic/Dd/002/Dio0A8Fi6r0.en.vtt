00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.210
 what I put on the face is a cream of benefit 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.820
 reducing visibility so far, that's it 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.150
 looked cream has a very nice 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.949
 texture and moisturizes the skin well 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.089
 but by that I take benefit checks and put 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.089
 it under the lower eyelids 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.980

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.149

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.510

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.229
 I like the way they fall on the skin and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.739
 gives the cheek a very natural 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.739
 pinkish tint 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.870
