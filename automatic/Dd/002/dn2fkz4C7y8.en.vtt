00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
before she died and it's obviously a

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.510 
before she died and it's obviously a
family<00:01:15.439> plot<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.770> one<00:01:15.920> that's<00:01:16.130> got<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.310> lot<00:01:16.460> of

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520
