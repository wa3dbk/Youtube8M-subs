00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello to all and hello to all and to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.220
 kiev or trick that an easy word and we get 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.770
 found today for a new 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.380
 video so a video a bit special so 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.580
 i'm going to talk about a cam trick so 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.500
 a kama trick that you will be able to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 do from the start, ie with 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.379
 1000 range to about you will be able 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.970
 start so I would say it's even 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.710
 the first tip that you go 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.390
 can do on the game starting 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.130
 the game on a new server by 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.560
 example so we will be interested in 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 so familiar to families and therefore to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.929
 several families and so I can you 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.430
 quote the names now so I 'll you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.410
 already study the principle I you 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.880
 will show how to optimize this 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.460
 technique increases its insert 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.200
 to be interested in forgiving the ghosts of 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.270
 familiar with family and by bompas 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.680
 moutier so that's what you can 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.890
 see present the ghost of shakira will be 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.020
 sold 4487 kama and boxing ghosts 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.530
 have sold about 4000 kama so in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.300
 average of which we will be interested in these 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 its 50 ohms so here are fifty years 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 because these are the families who 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.829
 cost the least to buy 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.160
 we can see that the block is even 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.710
 not 1000 camara including 4000 kama and 400 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.770
 km own gifts and that the cat is getting 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.229
 found at 790 kamano about 800 cases me 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.070
 often these misses milan so really 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.270
 often because people form 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.890
 a lot of duplicate drops or suddenly 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 wholesale master all the same yeah that's 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.350
 that I think we get like that in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.509
 in short we are more how to become one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 what will you incite while hd go 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.590
 so the technique at my will build up in 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.750
 made to sweat the families and you go 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.850
 buy so we will kill these five 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.950
 familiar 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.900
 so the goal is of course there is a 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.100
 family 10 points 10 years so that's it 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.689
 would be nice it exists also in real to 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.509
 imagine your dog with 10 points 10 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.650
 finally good so your soul there will be ten 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.780
 empty points we will have to go the most 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.950
 quickly possible 10.10 in order to kill 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.530
 so we kill him years we will go from one 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.220
 camaro cha cha mission at 4500 kama so 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.110
 we will multiply by about five 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.880
 its selling price is the same for the bob 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.950
 at 4 nikam has and we will not buy it 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.119
 unlikely 2,400 cases so why me 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.159
 advance family simply that it is 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.930
 feed the dragons and no I will say 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.710
 the dragonnades excuse me the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.420
 familiar , for example, I drag my 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.540
 family we are already what am I stupid 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.770
 happy dragon fight 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.630
 so we can see present the last 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.009
 ghost meal cha cha you can 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.870
 also see with last meal 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.650
 ghost of wood that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.650
 good player who has had 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.960
 food unknown to the known human here 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.940
 for seems a ghost of beautiful abs 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.650
 so people buy them for 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.140
 feed and so as a result this video 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.300
 you can also either for example 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.820
 a breeding of pets is the resales 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.890
 so what are we going to do so for x 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.440
 against by five their price even by ten 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.050
 for the arms so I'm going to buy a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.880
 small water tank for example 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.000
 here is a little Bordeaux 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.970
 and a cat here are two women there are 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.110
 so I paid 400 kama and 590 case me 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.880
 so people when they want to buy 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.020
 ghost they will take the cheapest we 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.340
 it's useless in front of researchers in 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.920
 especially they are no better than the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.540
 painted wood hookups people them 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.879
 here it is 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.829
 it does not necessarily spoil on that but I have 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.560
 just wanted to see something if the 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.370
 changeable food the effects of the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.650
 dragodinde them their lawyers decidedly 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.329
 the effects of the dhr at the end photo mh 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.680
 two blocks no frankly here is 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.239
 so who will buy it really the least 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.440
 so dear for that I'm going to kill myself 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.350
 several times 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.310
 so I kill myself near the phoenix them from here 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.990
 like that then I'll show you the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.240
 card with all the phoenixes and we can 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.270
 a little bit about the phoenix the 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.380
 closer and the furniture and the more the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.000
 I do not want to say the words 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.080
 the closest to the phoenix in order to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.520
 resurrect not far from power 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.840
 chase down and win 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.550
 easily and therefore easily kill 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.180
 our families and so well in a few 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.940
 seconds 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.780
 with zero energy so we're back 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.790
 after a few minutes 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.350
 so here I saw that I have more 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.480
 of energy so I have a thousand of energy 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.310
 inevitably fight I want to die so 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.870
 jean monnet right now so I 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.430
 reappear and so I'm going to be in 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.270
 Game Ghost not immediately reappear 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.430
 to the phoenix because I 'm going to show you 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.110
 two three little things first so 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.920
 you can see it on the map ago 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.460
 full of bluefin tuna 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.230
 so that corresponds to the phoenix so what 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.940
 is going to be good is that 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.379
 there will be mof on some felix on 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.260
 the same map so as for example here at 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.120
 astruc so we'll be able to chain 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.530
 fighting on the same map with the phoenix 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.620
 right next door so no need to walk 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.940
 nothing at all and so we'll do it at this 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.319
 trick because of course it's a 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.159
 bl technical where that's not true a 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.260
 beautiful you can do it to you 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.100
 but from 515 months to 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.160
 to have four thousand five hundred it's 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.410
 rather a technique bl so I wanted to 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.060
 to specify a super good thing is that 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.680
 a fight that is launched on a map 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.199
 but that is not won is going 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.430
 automatically reappear and up 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.600
 infinity until he is beaten on 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.800
 fight and we did what they did to us 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.260
 allow to chain on a single 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.320
 fight and without having latency 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.000
 so without having to wait 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.639
 so we will be able to follow quickly 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.260
 and I will of course make a 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.650
 live demo for that i 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.139
 expected 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.210
 I bought sorry I bought a cat 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.620
 who has 10 points 10 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.960
 so I 'll reappear quietly 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.900
 and we will kill him together so in fact 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.830
 I simply timed via 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.720
 my phone 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.460
 how long have I removed the ten 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.690
 shass views of forgiveness 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.220
 that the ten points of life is the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.080
 maximum that finally millet not see and that 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.180
 you will rarely have family is 10.10 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.190
 in hd go because people swat it 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.470
 have already kept either one already fought 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.639
 with or whatsoever or wishing 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.229
 keep in bank and long gloves by 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.250
 after that there will almost never be said 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.690
 point of view as you saw before 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.580
 to buy the first tanks I 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.009
 did not have 10.26 I even had to pay 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.530
 more expensive to have jackfruit 10.26 so 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.740
 I started the fight I put my cat 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.680
 who said 10 points and I run 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.419
 the stopwatch is here we go 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.160
 we're going to chain fight so there you 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.090
 put your fingers on a center and help 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.610
 you make my year done twice 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.560
 return 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.699
 but not too fast or it the 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.550
 will not do better than you are liberal 30 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.780
 and you do it again so I 'll see 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.310
 explain if it was not very clear 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.659
 bogans it's the fight makes you 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.860
 give up even in preparation phase 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.860
 you are back once 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.139
 3 it does not work it does not matter 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.419
 chains 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.719
 so here is ours soul there are already nine 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.520
 points of life abandoned here you 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.110
 to make your weapon here so in fact the 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.430
 full it's you first do yes and 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.590
 then everything is ok and you will arrive 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.150
 quickly at home redo this is a 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.520
 mentionned 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.750
 at some point you do you hui 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.730
 wait for you to come in 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.440
 and you talk to us in meeting a 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.740
 sometimes that's it 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.370
 So here abandoned 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.850
 8 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.979
 very et cetera or really fighting 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.880
 risk so directly do not know if 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.410
 it's all the time the same but I have 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.080
 the impression 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.910
 so here's entries whose familiar 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.330
 four life 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.300
 so we will finish that quickly abandoned 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.470
 8 entries here where the fight puts that 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.270
 a few seconds to rispal gentlemen 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.010
 fight layec on service bad it's 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.390
 just that makes them say my opinion 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.410
 take into account that the fight not been 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:53.240
 managed and so who can put it back 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.740
 so here's the fights respawn 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.450
 just wait a few short seconds 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.030
 but here with two fights you can 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.530
 chain it quickly just do not have 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.310
 how many media info points are there 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.990
 so a logical point 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.960
 you will see that the unfamiliar is going 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.580
 to feed here so abandoned so as 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.850
 I said yes then you press 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.280
 Entrance 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.690
 quickly you can do it 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.450
 encompobe proves that I could but familiar 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:17.090
 next to me in my resources 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.220
 I have a ghost cha cha so here 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.500
 the ghosts and we asked pardon for 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.560
 name we put it a minute 45 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.960
 so a minute 45 for 46 I even believe 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.460
 a 40 56 to kill so to do four 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.600
 thousand kama you can click beautiful 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.370
 it's really good knowing that they are going 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.240
 really are selling fast and 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.270
 easily 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.530
 so I'm repeating enough the four blocks and 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.800
 the ghost of researchers who are going 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.320
 to sell 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:46.440
 super good so I put it too windy 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:50.280
 ghost of familiar ghosts did not look 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.900
 so that's 4450 cases my voice there and so 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.340
 that she will go away easily 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.630
 so I hope it was helpful so 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.830
 really you can close this 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.200
 technique has a lot a lot of 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.620
 familiar and I hope she 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.700
 will please you 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.950
 if you have comments do not hesitate 

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.400
 not to share them and I tell you to 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.400
 very soon
