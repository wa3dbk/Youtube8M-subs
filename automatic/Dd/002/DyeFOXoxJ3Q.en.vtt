00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 the topic that I want us to review sun that is the intragastric balloon 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.599
 as a method 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.189
 for aids in losing 3 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.049
 really the problem of obesity in Colombia as well as in the 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:17.909
 has been increasing 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.400
 every time we see more patients with weight problems 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.989
 the continuous decline 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.549
 they need help because with traditional methods they have not been able to 

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:29.549
 have the weight loss 13 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.100
 these patients have already gone through diets for medical treatment treatments 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.400
 with medication and long-term results have been more achieved 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.100
 with a diet many times lose the weight that you 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.770
 but maintaining long-term weight loss is practically impossible 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.310
 that's why there are methods that can help you lose weight like the ball 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 intragastric 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.690
 is placed through an endoscopy 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.920
 what is done with sedation to avoid the patient's discomfort to the maximum 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.950
 is in 2 copy was being 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.610
 you have to support by a team 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.670
 in which 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.140
 and they include plasm prolog anesthesiologist 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.149
 nurses prepared for that purpose 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.710
 and the bariatric surgeon 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 to follow and the one that leads the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.140
 this procedure is performed in a traveling gold 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.310
 that is, the patient does not need to be hospitalized 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.430
 we put a ball in a 20 minute procedure 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.060
 in those 20 minutes making their counterparts we put the ball we reviewed 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.810
 the ball has made it clear 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.370
 and we send it to your house 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.549
 with a folder where we tell you the diet you should take 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.549
 and the behavior habits that 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.730
 after placing the ball 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.450
 the patient has the guidance of their children didactic manual in that case 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.280
 I 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.970
 the patient goes to his house has a capacity of three days usually what 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.579
 we put a Friday so that during that weekend 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.220
 the patient is at home 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.950
 despite the proper care of the placement of the ball was 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.330
 Occasionally they include 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.479
 vomit and pain that is handled during those three days from Monday of the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.030
 next week the patient is already over and normal and has a life 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.030
 completely normal 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:23.219
 with a bar in prague put in front a patient can lose between 12 and 15 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.219
 kilograms during the six or seven months that the treatment lasts 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.819
 This male must be placed by a multidisciplinary team must be 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.599
 headed by the surgeon there must be a nutritionist charge in some cases 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.109
 psychologist or internal medicine psychiatrist collaborates with us and the placement and 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.439
 withdrawal must be done in an institution that has all the 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.379
 resources to guarantee the patient good results and a minimum 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.009
 risk 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.009
 that is to say thanks accompanied with a 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.199
 with trained nurses for this purpose and thus the results are obtained 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.689
 that experience has shown us get what the patient likes to lose 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.549
 It is recommended that the balloon be directed inside the stomach of a 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.650
 patient 6 maximum seven months 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.380
 after that time yes smile 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.999
 although unemployment could be broken 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.479
 then we do not recommend under any circumstances that a patient with a balloon 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.969
 intragastric lasts more than six months with the device placed today 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.439
 in the same way that it was placed in an institution in a clinic with all 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.240
 the resources 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.770
 and the technology for that purpose
