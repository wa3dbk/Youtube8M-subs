enough to this guy has hspa+ support on
it<00:05:31.020> it's<00:05:32.020> been<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.319> fastest<00:05:32.770> hspa+<00:05:33.699> device

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060

test<00:05:35.680> your<00:05:35.889> live<00:05:36.009> on<00:05:36.039> camera<00:05:36.400> so<00:05:37.060> I'm<00:05:37.120> going<00:05:37.240> to

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
test your live on camera so I'm going to

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.709 
test your live on camera so I'm going to
go<00:05:37.389> ahead<00:05:37.449> and<00:05:37.539> turn<00:05:37.750> off<00:05:37.960> Wi-Fi<00:05:39.090> go<00:05:40.090> ahead<00:05:40.360> and

go ahead and turn off Wi-Fi go ahead and

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.860 
go ahead and turn off Wi-Fi go ahead and
do<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:40.990> so<00:05:41.259> Wi-Fi<00:05:41.650> is<00:05:41.710> turned<00:05:42.130> off<00:05:42.430> here

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870

lucky to get to it on a good day we'll
see<00:05:49.810> you<00:05:49.870> this<00:05:49.990> behaves<00:05:50.349> on<00:05:50.590> camera<00:05:50.979> but<00:05:51.190> Wi-Fi

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
see you this behaves on camera but Wi-Fi

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.980 
see you this behaves on camera but Wi-Fi
has<00:05:51.669> been<00:05:51.819> turned<00:05:51.969> off<00:05:52.120> I'm<00:05:52.690> gonna<00:05:52.810> go<00:05:52.930> ahead

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990

and<00:05:53.080> begin<00:05:53.229> test<00:05:53.699> and<00:05:54.699> we'll<00:05:54.819> see<00:05:55.000> but<00:05:55.150> I'm

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
and begin test and we'll see but I'm

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.540 
and begin test and we'll see but I'm
seeing<00:05:55.509> speeds<00:05:55.870> on<00:05:56.080> occasion<00:05:56.500> with<00:05:56.590> hspa+<00:05:57.310> and

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
seeing speeds on occasion with hspa+ and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.209 
seeing speeds on occasion with hspa+ and
the<00:05:57.610> 526<00:05:58.240> megabits<00:05:58.779> per<00:05:58.840> second<00:05:59.229> down<00:05:59.349> which

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
the 526 megabits per second down which

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:01.559 
the 526 megabits per second down which
certainly<00:06:00.669> is<00:06:00.849> slower<00:06:01.090> than<00:06:01.180> what<00:06:01.449> it's

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
certainly is slower than what it's

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.180 
certainly is slower than what it's
theoretically<00:06:01.960> capable<00:06:02.139> of<00:06:02.469> but<00:06:02.650> it's<00:06:02.770> faster

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
theoretically capable of but it's faster

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.029 
theoretically capable of but it's faster
than<00:06:03.340> any<00:06:03.520> hspa+<00:06:04.300> I've<00:06:04.509> ever<00:06:04.659> tested<00:06:05.080> here<00:06:05.889> in

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
than any hspa+ I've ever tested here in

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.890 
than any hspa+ I've ever tested here in
Southern<00:06:06.759> California<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:07.509> it<00:06:07.659> looks<00:06:07.810> like

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
Southern California and it looks like

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.930 
Southern California and it looks like
for<00:06:08.560> one<00:06:08.800> of<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:08.949> very<00:06:09.099> few<00:06:09.279> times<00:06:09.340> things<00:06:09.819> are

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
for one of the very few times things are

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.899 
for one of the very few times things are
behaving<00:06:10.210> on<00:06:10.419> camera<00:06:10.779> the<00:06:11.590> up<00:06:11.770> not<00:06:12.639> overly

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
behaving on camera the up not overly

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.029 
behaving on camera the up not overly
fast<00:06:13.240> but<00:06:13.630> yeah<00:06:14.139> we<00:06:14.289> got<00:06:14.380> almost<00:06:14.560> five<00:06:14.800> there

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
fast but yeah we got almost five there

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.510 
fast but yeah we got almost five there
4.6<00:06:15.880> down<00:06:16.659> this<00:06:16.900> is<00:06:17.050> incredibly<00:06:18.009> fast<00:06:18.310> which

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
4.6 down this is incredibly fast which

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.959 
4.6 down this is incredibly fast which
makes<00:06:18.729> me<00:06:18.849> even<00:06:18.909> more<00:06:19.120> excited<00:06:19.360> about<00:06:20.250> LTE<00:06:21.250> I'm

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
makes me even more excited about LTE I'm

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.730 
makes me even more excited about LTE I'm
curious<00:06:22.360> what<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:22.900> battery<00:06:23.259> is<00:06:23.380> going<00:06:23.560> to<00:06:23.650> be

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
curious what the battery is going to be

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.800 
curious what the battery is going to be
on<00:06:23.919> the<00:06:24.069> LTE<00:06:24.400> version<00:06:24.639> of<00:06:24.880> ETA<00:06:25.090> T<00:06:25.270> puts<00:06:25.509> out<00:06:25.630> and

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
on the LTE version of ETA T puts out and

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.330 
on the LTE version of ETA T puts out and
hopefully<00:06:25.960> will<00:06:26.650> sue<00:06:26.800> be<00:06:26.860> able<00:06:26.979> to<00:06:27.039> get<00:06:27.190> that

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
hopefully will sue be able to get that

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.620 
hopefully will sue be able to get that
same<00:06:27.580> battery<00:06:27.940> life<00:06:28.090> but<00:06:28.240> knowing<00:06:28.419> that<00:06:28.539> I've

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
same battery life but knowing that I've

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.629 
same battery life but knowing that I've
got<00:06:28.810> almost<00:06:29.050> a<00:06:29.199> 40<00:06:29.560> to<00:06:29.620> 50<00:06:29.889> percent<00:06:30.190> buffer<00:06:30.550> and

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
got almost a 40 to 50 percent buffer and

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.079 
got almost a 40 to 50 percent buffer and
battery<00:06:31.110> is<00:06:32.110> very<00:06:32.340> happy<00:06:33.340> makes<00:06:33.880> me<00:06:34.000> happy

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089 
battery is very happy makes me happy

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.060 
battery is very happy makes me happy
it's<00:06:34.690> very<00:06:34.870> happy<00:06:35.229> it<00:06:35.409> makes<00:06:35.529> me<00:06:35.680> happy<00:06:35.770> to

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
it's very happy it makes me happy to

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.070 
it's very happy it makes me happy to
know<00:06:36.190> that<00:06:36.580> we<00:06:37.029> got<00:06:37.060> that<00:06:37.360> much<00:06:37.570> battery<00:06:37.930> life

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
know that we got that much battery life

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.839 
know that we got that much battery life
at<00:06:38.770> his<00:06:39.070> phone<00:06:39.250> and<00:06:39.370> hopefully

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
at his phone and hopefully

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.159 
at his phone and hopefully
to<00:06:39.939> e<00:06:39.999> is<00:06:40.179> to<00:06:40.300> be<00:06:40.389> able<00:06:40.449> to<00:06:40.569> get<00:06:40.659> that<00:06:40.779> full<00:06:40.990> day

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169
