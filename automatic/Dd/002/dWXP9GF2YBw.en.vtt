as you're jumping now you can do it
right<00:02:51.709> away<00:02:51.740> like<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.310> did<00:02:52.340> or<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.270> wait

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
right away like I did or you can wait

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.150 
right away like I did or you can wait
till<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.810> clear<00:02:54.140> everybody<00:02:54.500> out<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.070> the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
till you clear everybody out and the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.890 
till you clear everybody out and the
missions<00:02:55.520> over<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.030> then<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.600> try<00:02:56.840> to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
missions over and then you can try to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.230 
missions over and then you can try to
jump<00:02:57.140> up<00:02:57.290> there<00:02:57.320> undisturbed<00:02:57.950> but<00:02:58.820> there<00:02:59.120> is

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
jump up there undisturbed but there is

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.280 
jump up there undisturbed but there is
still<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.450> little<00:02:59.600> bit<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.840> pressure<00:03:00.020> because

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
still a little bit of pressure because

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.080 
still a little bit of pressure because
you<00:03:00.530> are<00:03:00.709> on<00:03:00.860> that<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.550> think<00:03:01.640> it's<00:03:01.970> like<00:03:02.060> a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
you are on that I think it's like a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.610 
you are on that I think it's like a
30-second<00:03:02.810> timer<00:03:02.959> once<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.350> finish<00:03:03.590> a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
30-second timer once you finish a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.160 
30-second timer once you finish a
mission<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.130> watch<00:03:04.370> out<00:03:04.520> for<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:05.170> alright

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
mission so watch out for that alright

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.170 
mission so watch out for that alright
that's<00:03:06.260> gonna<00:03:06.470> be<00:03:06.620> six<00:03:06.980> dead<00:03:07.190> goes<00:03:07.490> three<00:03:08.000> more

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
that's gonna be six dead goes three more

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
shortcut maybe with arc blades you can

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.100 
shortcut maybe with arc blades you can
blink<00:04:08.770> through<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.400> do<00:04:09.520> your<00:04:09.640> swipes<00:04:10.110> that'll

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
blink through and do your swipes that'll

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.510 
blink through and do your swipes that'll
probably<00:04:11.319> work<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.890> that'll<00:04:12.220> be<00:04:12.370> some

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
probably work but that'll be some

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.979 
probably work but that'll be some
