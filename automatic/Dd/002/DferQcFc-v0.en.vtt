00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.610 
that's the man let's the female just
feel<00:02:10.860> wind<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.490> laid<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.850> egg<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.620> basically

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
feel wind that laid one egg to basically

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.510 
feel wind that laid one egg to basically
the<00:02:14.550> lady<00:02:14.820> like<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:16.110> lady<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.710> egg<00:02:16.950> after

that they got paired themselves after a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.760 
that they got paired themselves after a
week<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.280> think<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:21.690> maximum<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.350> week<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
week and I think that maximum a week the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.210 
week and I think that maximum a week the
lady<00:02:22.980> egg<00:02:23.220> louis<00:02:23.790> fast<00:02:24.150> i<00:02:24.360> was<00:02:24.480> fish<00:02:24.780> shop<00:02:25.220> and
