00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
be a throw-in advantage I mean so that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.910 
be a throw-in advantage I mean so that
was<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.729> shot<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.300> think<00:01:49.660> that<00:01:49.990> he<00:01:50.380> attempted<00:01:50.709> to

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920

whistling for him Friedman in his favor
and<00:06:34.080> I<00:06:34.199> think<00:06:34.259> that<00:06:34.620> was<00:06:34.710> our<00:06:34.770> play<00:06:35.009> so<00:06:35.279> well<00:06:35.490> I

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
and I think that was our play so well I

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.639 
and I think that was our play so well I
think<00:06:36.059> that<00:06:36.180> the<00:06:36.270> final<00:06:36.569> touch<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:37.319> ball<00:06:37.499> was

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:37.649 
think that the final touch the ball was

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:39.829 
think that the final touch the ball was
a<00:06:37.680> bit<00:06:37.979> heavy<00:06:38.219> and<00:06:38.550> it<00:06:38.939> lacked<00:06:39.210> that<00:06:39.300> direction

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
a bit heavy and it lacked that direction

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.529 
a bit heavy and it lacked that direction
but<00:06:40.229> it's<00:06:40.620> important<00:06:41.159> to<00:06:41.189> also<00:06:41.370> rip<00:06:41.669> past<00:06:42.270> with

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
but it's important to also rip past with

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:49.010 
but it's important to also rip past with
it<00:06:42.629> through<00:06:42.839> there<00:06:43.080> oh<00:06:46.909> crap<00:06:47.969> Augustine<00:06:48.509> into

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
it through there oh crap Augustine into

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
narrowly but that could have still the
