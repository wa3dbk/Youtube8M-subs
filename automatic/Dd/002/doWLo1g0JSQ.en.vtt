00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.860
 very good night of course you are me 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.360
 without welcome taken public already 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.910
 you know once or more a week 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.440
 attacks located Jews have him dollar 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.119
 is a heaven and as not being the 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.490
 alcohol la chains or the weapon with which 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.960
 I'm now taking me out in which one that 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.520
 what is resisting is not 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.950
 costing the truth that you already know that 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.210
 just lack the safe chains the jump and 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.529
 then all francs mergers 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.960
 all the players and all the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.550
 Shotguns for promotion as a weapon 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.249
 main so let's say it's me 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.329
 resisting and good is costing because 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.999
 good because it's getting harder and harder 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.760
 get burned ghosts and between that and 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.229
 other things so the people are leaving 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.089
 a little bit more easily and such 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.679
 he is sleeping with this 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.410
 camouflage that I wear as flagelan deras 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.840
 good what 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.580
 is pretty cool and that from time to time 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 when I'm changing camouflages 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.210
 so that the weapons that different for 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.970
 motivate me more you know that always 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.620
 I have a favorite camouflage in the black 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.200
 ops 2 is the cyborg that here for example 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.729
 is that of the eyeballs that looks 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.140
 that whenever you wear camouflage they give me 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.850
 luck and then he always gets me out 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 things not then at the end that has my 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.869
 team in that camouflage to be able 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.180
 get me the one because the one with the cj 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 for example it cost me I had to move in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 formed by short zones and I had to 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.619
 to draw at the end in tremor but good but 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.149
 the change show is like and not me 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.130
 I can take it out that you in a site x 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.380
 moving and as soon as you get three 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.170
 shots are the three shots are let's say 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 normal and the yellow ones and does not give you the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.759
 bullets or as we have the precision from 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.979
 they blow you away hard and it's good 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.210
 impossible not in this game with the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.780
 chains or motivated me to say more than one 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.909
 streak of 15 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.890
 and make a wrong decision you are going to see 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.049
 Good thing you already know that this is going 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.479
 the chaos of making good decisions about 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.940
 I do not take them, it's harder for me to learn in the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.590
 rest on obviously the maps 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.479
 maps as is betrayal not because they are 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.520
 maps is magician that is a very small map 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.590
 but maps as is a heaven in the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.479
 that the respado can be quite broken 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.580
 such as the flag of the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.920
 flag of efe flag sometimes 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.020
 making a decision implies that implies 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.800
 just die not why you're going to see 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.360
 that when I have a run of 17 I turn a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.410
 moment without looking behind me at 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.330
 response that I have on my back and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.070
 I was born one there 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.630
 kills and the streak ends 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.190
 a bitch and surely if there 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.560
 seen to the right immediately after leaving 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.840
 site where they kill me because it would have 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.920
 got the one that had got me the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.690
 tail 61 annoyed and good but let's go 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.130
 learning and you know that the next time 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.890
 you do not have to do it if you do not 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.390
 is to have them twice and sometimes the same 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.280
 well you know that you have a problem in 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.250
 head and you have to fix it 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.140
 also tell you that nothing is good that in 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.030
 golf, as long as I'm going to play with 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.160
 the tension because I am very calm 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.690
 because I know how easy it is not and because I know 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.400
 that it can take me time that yes 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.200
 I always try to play in a group because I already 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.709
 you know that these cases in which there is 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.760
 a sat well then it is always 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.260
 better go with kalushita then I like it 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.750
 more play in a group, you also know that I 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.220
 game for fun and that many times 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.540
 when I play just good it's a game of 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.850
 I just do not get bored I have fun 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.500
 enough but his public game just so 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.840
 Allied enemies leave enemies 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.190
 they go and the truth is that it is super boring 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.989
 play alone so I always try to play 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.730
 in a group, even if it is 1 of 2 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.320
 that is always with a little company 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.940
 to give us a laugh because sometimes 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.800
 It is very complicated to take it sometimes in a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.810
 complicated mts 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.940
 and everyone knows everyone, so you finish 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.800
 down to the bones then well it is 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.150
 better to play in company because that's how you 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.090
 you have more fun and well, they have the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.970
 chances of getting a streak 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.550
 and what to tell you that the chains right now 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.560
 you are going to see difference with answer 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.569
 to the map of a jerte that is the one of the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.250
 remasterization of domez and is that I have 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.870
 put prestidigitation because he was 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.060
 tired of how slow lachance recharged 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.040
 one in general all the light st that 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.019
 there is prestidigitation on the subject of 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.930
 light in the cost is an advance 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.549
 pretty cool remember that in 22 no 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.290
 there is the prestidigitation advantage 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.480
 there is simply the accessory charger 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.160
 fast and that for the light ones was not 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.379
 so it takes half a year to recharge 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.880
 I think it's a point that there's a press 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.890
 and fingering to recharge that lightly 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.750
 since even if you have for example 80 to 100 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.400
 bullets it's a bit beginning to have 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.109
 is recharging every time you change the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.570
 charger and well this gives you a 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.550
 puntazo in exchange that I have sacrificed then 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.130
 the hard line advantage is sacrificed 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.800
 that you already know is my favorite and that 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.069
 I have a hard time sacrificing the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.520
 good but as I tried how the best is 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.780
 of being would reduce the casualties to 2 - and line 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.940
 it lasts because you already know that four 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.120
 assists would count as two more casualties 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.889
 the extra positive reduction in three losses does not 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.300
 Well, he sacrificed it and changed it 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.940
 prestidigitation because I think it 's 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.090
 quite important depending on the map 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.159
 also if we play more pay that is more 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.319
 let's say crazy respawn where I can 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.030
 make more expeditious because I do not know how you can 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.580
 be is betrayal because maybe the line 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.650
 hard, it's convenient to leave it because 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.080
 you can do assists that are that 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.460
 they can become low they settled 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.780
 In general, you know that only 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.819
 bring the same advantages shield 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.830
 guard to avoid being killed with 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.909
 the explosives because it was a lot of people if 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.099
 not everyone carries explosives 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.569
 improvised and the one that takes it with the 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.849
 advantage is to do more damage than 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.469
 explosives is a bolivar bolivar 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.270
 that also the prestidigitación of time 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.830
 in when the hard line 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.300
 the hunter when it's a long weapon like 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.159
 they are a weapon cutting a silence 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.120
 deadly and the subject of amplify good 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.919
 Well, I have a bit of annoyance about 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.990
 helmets and for him advisory mind not 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.880
 it has to amplify because what's in the boot already 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.469
 you know what to listen to more although the truth 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.670
 that if you want to go to because even if it's a 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.560
 little pig then 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.940
 It is very useful because you listen to 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.240
 the enemies how they go like dinosaurs 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.770
 stepping around but not that good 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.630
 usual custom already like it 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.000
 play without amplifying and only when 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.290
 so get a shotgun that requires 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.450
 Well, a lot of concentration 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.860
 we will put the helmets with amplify but 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.980
 if not the truth that has accustomed me to 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.870
 play without it and then thank you 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.700
 and nothing small to tell you also that what 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.560
 We are already two thousand subscribers that we are 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.270
 almost a community that the thing is going very 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.270
 well and that the hardest thing is to start that 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.160
 without applying without almost promotions and now 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.290
 it 's very difficult and youtube because nothing 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.440
 I thank everyone that you follow me 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.880
 see my videos and obviously this 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.320
 will have its special that I hope not 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.760
 take a long time but there were problems with 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.890
 the editorial do not worry because the 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.630
 the clips are already removed and 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.100
 when early it will rise and we will be 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.140
 special of lakes distract you the trailer 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.960
 of the channel so you can do it all and 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.690
 you can enjoy we can comment 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.710
 all in it and etcetera etcetera assigned 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.090
 guys, I hope you liked the 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.570

 upload things I do not know what I'll upload but 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.090
 I hope it is gochu throughout the year 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.090
 this work was small
