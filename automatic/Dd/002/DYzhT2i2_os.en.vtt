comparison here of the new Apple Smart

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.320 
comparison here of the new Apple Smart
Case<00:00:10.200> which<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.400> right<00:00:11.550> here<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.059> red

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
Case which I have right here in the red

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.300 
Case which I have right here in the red
color<00:00:13.759> compared<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.780> actual<00:00:16.109> Apple<00:00:16.980> Smart

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
color compared to the actual Apple Smart

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.599 
color compared to the actual Apple Smart
Cover

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
Cover

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.939 
Cover
some<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> benefits<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> downsides

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
some of the benefits and the downsides

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.400 
some of the benefits and the downsides
and<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.520> also<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:22.080> case

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
and I also have here the in case

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.500 
and I also have here the in case
magnetic<00:00:23.039> snap<00:00:23.250> back<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
magnetic snap back and I think this is

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.820 
magnetic snap back and I think this is
going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.140> good<00:00:25.260> alternative<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
going to be a really good alternative to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
going to be a really good alternative to
the<00:00:26.070> smart<00:00:26.310> case<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:26.910> considering

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the smart case if you are considering

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
the smart case if you are considering
one<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> other<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.519> let<00:00:29.699> me<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.939> back

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
one or the other so let me just back

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.279 
one or the other so let me just back
this<00:00:30.179> up<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.480> bit<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.050> get

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this up a little bit and I'm gonna get

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.690 
this up a little bit and I'm gonna get
right<00:00:31.500> into<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> show<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> some<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
right into this and show you some of the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.340 
right into this and show you some of the
stand<00:00:32.940> alternatives<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.110> can

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
stand alternatives and how we can

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
stand alternatives and how we can
actually<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> smart<00:00:35.309> smart<00:00:36.030> case<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
actually use the smart smart case and a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.299 
actually use the smart smart case and a
few<00:00:37.110> different<00:00:37.380> viewing<00:00:37.559> options<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> they

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
few different viewing options that they

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
few different viewing options that they
don't<00:00:38.460> advertise<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.840> actually<00:00:40.200> work

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
don't advertise that actually work

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.430 
don't advertise that actually work
really<00:00:40.620> well<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.910> go<00:00:42.379> alright<00:00:43.379> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
really well so here we go alright so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
really well so here we go alright so
first<00:00:43.890> off<00:00:44.040> let's<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.520> quickly<00:00:45.059> run<00:00:45.360> through

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
first off let's just quickly run through

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
first off let's just quickly run through
the<00:00:45.690> actual<00:00:46.079> different<00:00:47.039> case<00:00:47.219> option<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the actual different case option or the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.830 
the actual different case option or the
stand<00:00:48.270> options<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> our<00:00:50.840> smart

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
stand options here so here is our smart

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.380 
stand options here so here is our smart
case<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:53.129> we've<00:00:53.430> taught<00:00:53.699> -<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> did<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> quick

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
case I know we've taught - I did a quick

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.729 
case I know we've taught - I did a quick
review<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.170> look<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.500> channel

benefits some of the pros the cons now
the<00:01:02.160> top<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> work<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the top is going to work just like the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
the top is going to work just like the
regular<00:01:03.840> smart<00:01:04.290> cover<00:01:04.470> where<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.729> our

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
regular smart cover where we have our

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.510 
regular smart cover where we have our
regular<00:01:06.180> typing<00:01:06.689> angle<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.460> we

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
regular typing angle here and then we

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.590 
regular typing angle here and then we
have<00:01:08.729> our<00:01:08.939> stand<00:01:09.360> angle<00:01:09.920> right<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.090> now<00:01:12.090> one

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
have our stand angle right here now one

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.550 
have our stand angle right here now one
of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> biggest<00:01:12.960> complaints<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
of the biggest complaints with this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.469 
of the biggest complaints with this
particular<00:01:13.799> smart<00:01:14.220> case<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.880> far<00:01:15.090> has<00:01:15.450> been

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
particular smart case so far has been

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.350 
particular smart case so far has been
even<00:01:15.960> though<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.200> only<00:01:16.259> been<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> couple<00:01:16.560> days

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
even though it's only been a couple days

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.020 
even though it's only been a couple days
is<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.869> stand<00:01:19.439> actually<00:01:19.770> does<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.100> hold

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
is that the stand actually does not hold

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.490 
is that the stand actually does not hold
up<00:01:21.150> very<00:01:21.180> well<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:21.689> which<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.140> true<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
up very well up here which is true it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.539 
up very well up here which is true it
does<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:23.220> give<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:25.549> how

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
does actually give a little bit of a how

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
does actually give a little bit of a how
you'd<00:01:26.700> say<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.659> quite<00:01:27.900> stable

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you'd say but just it's not quite stable

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.190 
you'd say but just it's not quite stable
okay<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.880> trick<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
okay so one trick here is with the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.399 
okay so one trick here is with the
actual<00:01:31.439> smart<00:01:31.770> cover<00:01:32.640> flap<00:01:33.360> pull<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> back

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
actual smart cover flap pull it back

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.130 
actual smart cover flap pull it back
just<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.680> bit<00:01:35.630> where<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.689> creates<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
just a little bit where it creates a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
just a little bit where it creates a
little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.030> quite

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
little bit of a it's not quite

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.660 
little bit of a it's not quite
magnetically<00:01:40.259> sound<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
magnetically sound down here but it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.080 
magnetically sound down here but it
creates<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.119> bit<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.570> gap<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
creates a little bit of a gap here and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.190 
creates a little bit of a gap here and
that<00:01:45.090> allows<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:45.899> bit<00:01:46.049> more

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that allows you to get a little bit more

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.990 
that allows you to get a little bit more
stability<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> case<00:01:47.399> itself<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
stability on the case itself and it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.460 
stability on the case itself and it
leans<00:01:48.180> back<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:48.930> bit<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.259> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
leans back just a little bit so that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.330 
leans back just a little bit so that
actually<00:01:50.040> works<00:01:50.220> quite<00:01:50.490> well<00:01:51.200> as<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.619> now

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
actually works quite well as you see now

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.950 
actually works quite well as you see now
with<00:01:53.759> any<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.119> these<00:01:54.210> smart<00:01:54.479> covers<00:01:54.750> you're

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
with any of these smart covers you're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.969 
with any of these smart covers you're
gonna<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.649> bit<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:57.770> sign<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> be

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
gonna get a little bit of a sign to be

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.889 
gonna get a little bit of a sign to be
super<00:01:59.280> stable<00:01:59.490> okay<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.689> kind<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
super stable okay so you have to kind of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.800 
super stable okay so you have to kind of
bear<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.320> mind<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.040> that's<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.490> okay<00:02:03.299> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
bear that in mind but that's one okay so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.010 
bear that in mind but that's one okay so
we'll<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.560> next<00:02:05.689> is<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.960> be

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
we'll do that the next is going to be

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.690 
we'll do that the next is going to be
when<00:02:07.560> you're<00:02:07.680> doing<00:02:07.710> general<00:02:08.190> typing<00:02:08.550> here

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
when you're doing general typing here

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.369 
when you're doing general typing here
and<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.879> need<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.060> move<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> little<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.319> if

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and I need to move a little bit so if

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.900 
and I need to move a little bit so if
I'm<00:02:10.470> doing<00:02:10.679> general<00:02:10.979> typing<00:02:11.340> that's<00:02:11.760> our

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
I'm doing general typing that's our

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.809 
I'm doing general typing that's our
regular<00:02:12.180> angle

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
regular angle

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.250 
regular angle
but<00:02:12.999> sometimes<00:02:13.359> this<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.689> a<00:02:13.719> little<00:02:14.019> bit<00:02:14.109> too

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
but sometimes this is a little bit too

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.380 
but sometimes this is a little bit too
flat<00:02:14.680> okay<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.519> I've<00:02:15.609> noticed<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.269> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
flat okay and I've noticed that with the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.709 
flat okay and I've noticed that with the
new<00:02:16.510> smart<00:02:16.810> case<00:02:17.049> because<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.829> this<00:02:18.450> top<00:02:19.450> part

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
new smart case because of this top part

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.099 
new smart case because of this top part
here<00:02:20.219> okay<00:02:21.219> has<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> tendency<00:02:21.879> to<00:02:22.209> go<00:02:22.870> down<00:02:23.079> a

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
here okay has a tendency to go down a

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.330 
here okay has a tendency to go down a
little<00:02:23.260> bit<00:02:23.349> farther<00:02:23.650> than<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.980> wool<00:02:24.159> with<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
little bit farther than a wool with the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.369 
little bit farther than a wool with the
normal<00:02:24.609> Smart<00:02:24.879> Cover<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.480> I'd<00:02:25.540> say<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.170> should

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
normal Smart Cover so I'd say it should

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.589 
normal Smart Cover so I'd say it should
be<00:02:26.409> about<00:02:26.620> right<00:02:26.769> here<00:02:27.129> now<00:02:27.819> with<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.329> actual

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
be about right here now with this actual

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.879 
be about right here now with this actual
Smart<00:02:29.049> Cover<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:29.349> because<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.829> the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
Smart Cover here because of the

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.379 
Smart Cover here because of the
polyurethane<00:02:30.159> on<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.639> back<00:02:30.849> they're

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
polyurethane on the back they're

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:32.879 
polyurethane on the back they're
basically<00:02:31.659> gonna<00:02:31.840> stick<00:02:32.139> together<00:02:32.290> which<00:02:32.799> is

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
basically gonna stick together which is

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.580 
basically gonna stick together which is
actually<00:02:33.159> really<00:02:33.280> nice<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.409> do<00:02:35.500> this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
actually really nice so if I can do this

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.250 
actually really nice so if I can do this
no<00:02:37.799> so<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:38.859> have<00:02:39.129> is<00:02:39.510> unfolded<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.750> Smart

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
no so you have is unfolded the Smart

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.330 
no so you have is unfolded the Smart
Cover<00:02:41.379> a<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:41.709> bit<00:02:42.689> and<00:02:44.129> that's<00:02:45.129> your

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
Cover a little bit and that's your

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.369 
Cover a little bit and that's your
second<00:02:45.939> basically<00:02:46.870> typing<00:02:47.319> angle<00:02:47.560> there<00:02:47.709> now

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
second basically typing angle there now

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.589 
second basically typing angle there now
it's<00:02:50.379> pretty<00:02:50.590> stable<00:02:50.859> okay<00:02:51.639> if<00:02:52.120> you're<00:02:52.239> typing

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
it's pretty stable okay if you're typing

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.009 
it's pretty stable okay if you're typing
a<00:02:52.780> lot<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.489> can<00:02:54.909> you<00:02:55.329> know<00:02:55.389> move<00:02:55.689> it<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:55.900> and

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
a lot so you can you know move it up and

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.199 
a lot so you can you know move it up and
down<00:02:56.109> based<00:02:56.319> on<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:56.590> needs<00:02:57.280> itself<00:02:57.669> but

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
down based on your needs itself but

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.209 
down based on your needs itself but
because<00:02:58.389> of<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.199> polyurethane<00:02:59.500> back<00:03:00.010> it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219 
because of the the polyurethane back it

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.439 
because of the the polyurethane back it
actually<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.549> little<00:03:00.609> bit<00:03:00.730> stickier<00:03:01.209> so

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:01.449 
actually is a little bit stickier so

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.899 
actually is a little bit stickier so
it's<00:03:01.599> gonna<00:03:01.739> kind<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.799> stick<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.549> back<00:03:03.730> of

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
it's gonna kind of stick to the back of

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.220 
it's gonna kind of stick to the back of
the<00:03:04.000> case<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.419> the<00:03:04.510> front<00:03:04.719> of<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.870> case<00:03:05.019> here

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
the case in the front of the case here

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.599 
the case in the front of the case here
so<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.530> way<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.709> doesn't<00:03:05.859> move<00:03:06.099> as<00:03:06.250> much<00:03:06.430> and

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
so that way it doesn't move as much and

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.979 
so that way it doesn't move as much and
it<00:03:06.699> gives<00:03:06.849> you<00:03:06.969> a<00:03:07.000> much<00:03:07.150> higher<00:03:07.419> angle<00:03:07.810> so

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
it gives you a much higher angle so

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.339 
it gives you a much higher angle so
again<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.769> compare<00:03:08.919> this<00:03:09.219> from<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.579> side

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
again if you compare this from the side

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.289 
again if you compare this from the side
that's<00:03:11.349> this<00:03:11.560> new<00:03:11.769> angle<00:03:11.949> here<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.849> if<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.090> fold

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
that's this new angle here and if I fold

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.709 
that's this new angle here and if I fold
this<00:03:13.419> back<00:03:13.599> up<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.120> actual<00:03:16.329> angle<00:03:16.480> so

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:16.719 
this back up that's the actual angle so

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.610 
this back up that's the actual angle so
you<00:03:16.780> see<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.019> quite<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.439> bit<00:03:17.590> lower<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.099> lastly

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you see it's quite a bit lower so lastly

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.229 
you see it's quite a bit lower so lastly
what<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.680> want<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.889> do<00:03:21.009> is<00:03:21.220> put<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.879> smart<00:03:22.090> cover

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
what I want to do is put the smart cover

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.689 
what I want to do is put the smart cover
on<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.449> back<00:03:22.599> here<00:03:23.040> now<00:03:24.040> if<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.400> have<00:03:24.549> the

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
on the back here now if you have the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.520 
on the back here now if you have the
Smart<00:03:24.939> Cover<00:03:25.030> flat<00:03:25.389> I'm<00:03:25.959> gonna<00:03:26.169> go<00:03:26.259> ahead<00:03:26.349> and

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
Smart Cover flat I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.979 
Smart Cover flat I'm gonna go ahead and
fold<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:26.889> up<00:03:27.329> creating<00:03:28.329> a<00:03:28.509> flat<00:03:29.159> back<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
fold this up creating a flat back and

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.899 
fold this up creating a flat back and
here<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.139> get<00:03:35.439> another<00:03:35.680> angle<00:03:36.009> here<00:03:36.220> now<00:03:36.430> this

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
here I get another angle here now this

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.729 
here I get another angle here now this
one's<00:03:37.090> not<00:03:37.209> quite<00:03:37.389> as<00:03:37.629> stable<00:03:37.810> because<00:03:38.409> of<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
one's not quite as stable because of the

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.610 
one's not quite as stable because of the
the<00:03:39.519> lip<00:03:39.790> down<00:03:40.030> here<00:03:40.299> but<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:41.229> also<00:03:41.470> is

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the lip down here but this also is

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.020 
the lip down here but this also is
another<00:03:41.979> really<00:03:42.220> good<00:03:42.459> alternative<00:03:42.669> for

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
another really good alternative for

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.119 
another really good alternative for
typing<00:03:43.449> and<00:03:43.629> things<00:03:43.780> like<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.319> these<00:03:44.949> are

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
typing and things like that so these are

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.589 
typing and things like that so these are
a<00:03:45.159> couple<00:03:45.250> different<00:03:45.790> angles<00:03:45.909> you<00:03:46.120> can<00:03:46.269> use

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
a couple different angles you can use

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.420 
a couple different angles you can use
with<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.199> new<00:03:47.349> smart<00:03:47.650> case<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:48.129> actually

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
with the new smart case that actually

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.339 
with the new smart case that actually
will<00:03:48.579> give<00:03:48.729> you<00:03:48.879> some<00:03:49.060> alternatives<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.629> say

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
will give you some alternatives to say

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.860 
will give you some alternatives to say
using<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.739> just<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.979> regular<00:03:51.280> way<00:03:51.430> now<00:03:52.329> with

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
using it just the regular way now with

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.369 
using it just the regular way now with
that<00:03:53.079> I<00:03:53.409> just<00:03:54.159> want<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.549> compare<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:56.169> get<00:03:56.259> this

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
that I just want to compare and get this

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.939 
that I just want to compare and get this
out<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.650> smart<00:03:56.919> case<00:03:58.409> I'm<00:03:59.409> gonna<00:03:59.590> compare

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
out of the smart case I'm gonna compare

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:05.020 
out of the smart case I'm gonna compare
it<00:04:00.129> those<00:04:00.519> stand<00:04:00.879> options

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.860 

-<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> Smart<00:04:06.450> Cover<00:04:08.300> is<00:04:09.300> there<00:04:09.480> Smart<00:04:09.690> Cover

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
- the Smart Cover is there Smart Cover

- the Smart Cover is there Smart Cover
here<00:04:13.370> okay<00:04:14.400> again<00:04:15.270> no<00:04:15.540> cover<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.990> back

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
here okay again no cover on the back

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.550 
here okay again no cover on the back
that<00:04:16.980> you<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:18.800> your<00:04:19.800> regular<00:04:19.920> typing<00:04:20.430> angle

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
that you have your regular typing angle

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.230 
that you have your regular typing angle
like<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.710> see<00:04:22.950> what<00:04:23.610> I'm<00:04:23.700> talking<00:04:23.850> about<00:04:24.000> here

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
like you see what I'm talking about here

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.880 
like you see what I'm talking about here
this<00:04:24.390> is<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.570> little<00:04:24.870> bit<00:04:24.990> higher<00:04:25.200> than<00:04:25.470> the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
this is a little bit higher than the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.740 
this is a little bit higher than the
actual<00:04:26.100> smart<00:04:26.460> case<00:04:26.640> because<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.420> doesn't

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
actual smart case because it doesn't

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.570 
actual smart case because it doesn't
drop<00:04:27.930> down<00:04:28.200> quite<00:04:28.500> as<00:04:28.650> much<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.400> then<00:04:29.490> you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
drop down quite as much and then you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.440 
drop down quite as much and then you
have<00:04:29.760> your<00:04:30.920> stand<00:04:31.920> option<00:04:32.190> here<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:33.300> can

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
have your stand option here and you can

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.830 
have your stand option here and you can
see<00:04:33.860> much<00:04:34.860> more<00:04:34.890> stable<00:04:35.340> now<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:36.120> can<00:04:36.510> also<00:04:36.630> do

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
see much more stable now I can also do

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.150 
see much more stable now I can also do
the<00:04:36.930> same<00:04:37.080> thing<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.590> where<00:04:37.770> I<00:04:37.800> pop<00:04:38.010> this

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
the same thing here where I pop this

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.530 
the same thing here where I pop this
back<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.730> can<00:04:38.910> see<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.360> doesn't

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
back but you can see that it doesn't

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.330 
back but you can see that it doesn't
stay<00:04:39.930> because<00:04:40.170> it<00:04:40.440> doesn't<00:04:40.680> have<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:41.010> sticky

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
stay because it doesn't have that sticky

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.490 
stay because it doesn't have that sticky
polyurethane<00:04:41.910> on<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.120> back<00:04:42.300> here<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
polyurethane on the back here so the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.050 
polyurethane on the back here so the
alternative<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.040> we're<00:04:44.730> gonna<00:04:44.850> take<00:04:45.000> a

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
alternative to that we're gonna take a

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.680 
alternative to that we're gonna take a
look<00:04:45.210> at<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:46.430> encase<00:04:47.430> magnetic<00:04:48.270> snap<00:04:48.510> back

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
look at the encase magnetic snap back

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.990 
look at the encase magnetic snap back
case<00:04:48.930> which<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.980> also<00:04:50.160> have<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> review<00:04:50.670> for<00:04:50.760> if

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
case which I also have a review for if

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.910 
case which I also have a review for if
you<00:04:51.090> check<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.360> out<00:04:51.420> on<00:04:51.540> my<00:04:51.630> channel<00:04:51.870> I'm<00:04:52.800> gonna

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
you check it out on my channel I'm gonna

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.120 
you check it out on my channel I'm gonna
go<00:04:53.010> ahead<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.160> pop<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:53.460> guy<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:55.700> yes<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:56.850> first

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
go ahead and pop this guy on yes I first

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.610 
go ahead and pop this guy on yes I first
do<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.220> ends<00:04:59.570> now<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.600> usually<00:05:01.110> use<00:05:01.260> this<00:05:01.410> as<00:05:01.590> my

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
do the ends now I usually use this as my

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.220 
do the ends now I usually use this as my
everyday<00:05:01.980> case<00:05:02.310> here<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:03.450> that's<00:05:03.750> because<00:05:04.020> I

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
everyday case here and that's because I

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.540 
everyday case here and that's because I
like<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.650> be<00:05:04.710> able<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.920> have<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.220> option<00:05:05.340> to

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
like to be able to have the option to

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.460 
like to be able to have the option to
take<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.760> smart<00:05:06.000> cover<00:05:06.150> off<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.660> also<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
take the smart cover off and also on the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.380 
take the smart cover off and also on the
back<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.860> case<00:05:08.070> here<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:09.150> see<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
back of the case here you see the

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.690 
back of the case here you see the
speaker<00:05:09.660> is<00:05:09.750> not<00:05:09.930> closed<00:05:10.710> in<00:05:10.920> but<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.550> have

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
speaker is not closed in but you have

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.160 
speaker is not closed in but you have
these<00:05:11.820> magnetic<00:05:12.060> strips<00:05:12.600> and<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.020> the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
these magnetic strips and this is the

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.870 
these magnetic strips and this is the
actual<00:05:13.350> best<00:05:13.650> part<00:05:13.890> of<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.040> case<00:05:14.220> itself<00:05:14.580> so

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
actual best part of the case itself so

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.240 
actual best part of the case itself so
let's<00:05:15.510> go<00:05:15.690> ahead<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.870> put<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.830> smart<00:05:17.010> cover

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
let's go ahead and put the smart cover

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.680 
let's go ahead and put the smart cover
back<00:05:17.370> on<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.740> close<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.190> up<00:05:20.480> looks<00:05:21.480> really

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
back on and close it up looks really

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.720 
back on and close it up looks really
nice<00:05:21.840> okay<00:05:22.380> when<00:05:22.530> it's<00:05:22.650> by<00:05:22.710> itself<00:05:22.800> now<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.610> has

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
nice okay when it's by itself now it has

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.040 
nice okay when it's by itself now it has
a<00:05:23.760> hard<00:05:24.060> back<00:05:24.240> so<00:05:24.510> if<00:05:24.600> you're<00:05:24.720> putting<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:24.990> down

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
a hard back so if you're putting it down

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.780 
a hard back so if you're putting it down
the<00:05:25.170> table<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.500> lot<00:05:25.710> I'm<00:05:25.950> afraid<00:05:26.220> sometimes<00:05:26.640> it

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
the table a lot I'm afraid sometimes it

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.370 
the table a lot I'm afraid sometimes it
might<00:05:26.880> crack<00:05:27.240> or<00:05:27.510> scratch<00:05:27.810> or<00:05:27.990> anything<00:05:28.140> like

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
might crack or scratch or anything like

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.510 
might crack or scratch or anything like
that<00:05:28.410> but<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.920> know<00:05:29.040> it's<00:05:29.190> just<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.370> back

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
that but you know it's just a back

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.190 
that but you know it's just a back
protector<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:30.120> what<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.300> gonna<00:05:30.390> do<00:05:30.510> now<00:05:31.140> the

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
protector so what you gonna do now the

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.090 
protector so what you gonna do now the
magnetic<00:05:32.040> strips<00:05:32.670> on<00:05:32.790> the<00:05:32.820> back<00:05:33.800> hold<00:05:34.800> the

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
magnetic strips on the back hold the

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.280 
magnetic strips on the back hold the
smart<00:05:35.790> cover<00:05:35.940> in<00:05:36.090> place<00:05:37.730> not<00:05:38.730> going<00:05:38.970> anywhere

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
smart cover in place not going anywhere

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.440 
smart cover in place not going anywhere
now<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.320> have<00:05:40.620> two<00:05:40.860> options<00:05:41.040> here<00:05:41.400> see<00:05:42.360> that

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
now you have two options here see that

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.880 
now you have two options here see that
top<00:05:42.660> one<00:05:42.810> is<00:05:42.930> going<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.110> be<00:05:43.230> for<00:05:43.440> holding<00:05:43.770> the

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
top one is going to be for holding the

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.750 
top one is going to be for holding the
case<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:45.510> smart<00:05:45.750> cover<00:05:45.870> in<00:05:46.020> place<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:47.400> second

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
case the smart cover in place the second

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.090 
case the smart cover in place the second
one<00:05:47.880> is<00:05:48.060> going<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.720> give<00:05:48.900> us<00:05:48.930> some<00:05:49.590> other<00:05:49.770> stand

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
one is going to give us some other stand

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.160 
one is going to give us some other stand
options<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.730> this<00:05:51.330> is<00:05:51.480> why<00:05:51.630> I'm<00:05:51.720> comparing<00:05:52.020> it

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
options and this is why I'm comparing it

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.540 
options and this is why I'm comparing it
to<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.530> smart<00:05:52.770> case<00:05:52.890> because<00:05:53.160> you<00:05:53.340> actually

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
to the smart case because you actually

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.690 
to the smart case because you actually
can<00:05:53.940> kind<00:05:54.930> of<00:05:55.110> get<00:05:55.320> this<00:05:55.590> similar<00:05:56.340> type<00:05:56.490> of

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
can kind of get this similar type of

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.279 
can kind of get this similar type of
stand<00:05:57.030> out<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.990> smart<00:05:58.470> case<00:05:59.210> here

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:08.529 

if<00:06:03.289> you<00:06:03.409> set<00:06:03.649> it<00:06:03.740> up<00:06:03.830> correctly<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:07.539> that's

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
if you set it up correctly so that's

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.719 
if you set it up correctly so that's
your<00:06:08.689> smart<00:06:08.990> I<00:06:09.499> was<00:06:10.249> there<00:06:10.369> so<00:06:10.490> my<00:06:10.580> opinion

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
your smart I was there so my opinion

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.399 
your smart I was there so my opinion
there<00:06:10.969> so<00:06:11.059> it's<00:06:11.149> gonna<00:06:11.240> be<00:06:11.330> hard<00:06:11.389> to<00:06:11.539> stay<00:06:11.719> but

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
there so it's gonna be hard to stay but

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.070 
there so it's gonna be hard to stay but
that<00:06:13.219> would<00:06:13.339> be<00:06:13.369> your<00:06:13.599> similar<00:06:14.599> stand<00:06:14.869> there

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
that would be your similar stand there

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.230 
that would be your similar stand there
okay<00:06:17.050> so<00:06:18.050> we<00:06:18.139> have<00:06:18.229> that<00:06:18.379> one<00:06:18.969> and<00:06:19.969> then

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
okay so we have that one and then

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.339 
okay so we have that one and then
similarly<00:06:20.869> we<00:06:21.050> have<00:06:21.289> in<00:06:22.509> regular<00:06:23.509> landscape

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
similarly we have in regular landscape

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.939 
similarly we have in regular landscape
mode<00:06:24.499> here<00:06:24.909> if<00:06:25.909> we<00:06:26.409> hook<00:06:27.409> this<00:06:27.529> a<00:06:27.619> little<00:06:27.740> bit

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
mode here if we hook this a little bit

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.820 
mode here if we hook this a little bit
you<00:06:28.819> also<00:06:28.999> have<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:29.929> same<00:06:30.169> type<00:06:30.439> of<00:06:30.469> stand

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
you also have the same type of stand

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.829 
you also have the same type of stand
here<00:06:31.009> that<00:06:31.249> will<00:06:31.399> put<00:06:31.849> it<00:06:31.969> back<00:06:32.089> just<00:06:32.270> tilt<00:06:32.689> it

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:32.839 
here that will put it back just tilt it

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.869 
here that will put it back just tilt it
back<00:06:32.959> a<00:06:32.990> little<00:06:33.110> bit<00:06:33.499> more<00:06:33.740> this<00:06:34.610> is<00:06:34.759> our

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
back a little bit more this is our

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.529 
back a little bit more this is our
regular<00:06:35.029> stand<00:06:35.589> you<00:06:36.589> see<00:06:36.740> how<00:06:36.860> high<00:06:37.069> is<00:06:37.539> tilted

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
regular stand you see how high is tilted

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.739 
regular stand you see how high is tilted
back<00:06:39.099> if<00:06:40.099> a<00:06:40.219> better<00:06:40.369> option<00:06:40.580> so<00:06:41.360> that's

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:41.749 
back if a better option so that's

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:42.730 
back if a better option so that's
basically<00:06:42.019> it<00:06:42.110> guys<00:06:42.229> if<00:06:42.439> you<00:06:42.529> have<00:06:42.619> any

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
basically it guys if you have any

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.619 
basically it guys if you have any
questions<00:06:43.069> let<00:06:43.249> me<00:06:43.279> know<00:06:43.339> I'm<00:06:43.939> still<00:06:44.300> kind<00:06:44.599> of

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629 
questions let me know I'm still kind of

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.269 
questions let me know I'm still kind of
getting<00:06:44.839> used<00:06:44.959> to<00:06:45.080> using<00:06:45.379> the<00:06:45.619> smart<00:06:45.860> case<00:06:46.039> and

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:46.279 
getting used to using the smart case and

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.859 
getting used to using the smart case and
I'm<00:06:46.339> trying<00:06:46.610> to<00:06:46.639> get<00:06:46.849> any<00:06:47.269> more<00:06:47.449> questions

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:47.869 
I'm trying to get any more questions

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:51.009 
I'm trying to get any more questions
answered<00:06:48.229> that<00:06:48.409> I<00:06:48.439> have<00:06:48.649> and<00:06:49.719> you<00:06:50.719> know<00:06:50.839> I've

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:51.019 
answered that I have and you know I've

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:52.929 
answered that I have and you know I've
also<00:06:51.199> found<00:06:51.499> that<00:06:51.679> they're<00:06:51.949> saying<00:06:52.189> when<00:06:52.789> you

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:52.939 
also found that they're saying when you

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:54.820 
also found that they're saying when you
close<00:06:53.269> this<00:06:53.479> smart<00:06:53.779> clever<00:06:53.929> case<00:06:54.199> yes<00:06:54.589> it<00:06:54.740> is

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
close this smart clever case yes it is

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.049 
close this smart clever case yes it is
annoying<00:06:55.189> to<00:06:55.279> have<00:06:55.369> to<00:06:55.429> do<00:06:55.610> this<00:06:55.669> every<00:06:55.909> time

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:56.059 
annoying to have to do this every time

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:57.429 
annoying to have to do this every time
and<00:06:56.300> I've<00:06:56.389> been<00:06:56.779> using<00:06:56.899> it<00:06:57.050> for<00:06:57.110> a<00:06:57.199> couple<00:06:57.289> days

00:06:57.429 --> 00:06:57.439 
and I've been using it for a couple days

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.679 
and I've been using it for a couple days
so<00:06:57.559> I<00:06:57.979> can<00:06:58.399> bash<00:06:58.519> to<00:06:58.669> that<00:06:58.819> but<00:06:58.999> when<00:06:59.479> you<00:06:59.569> turn

00:06:59.679 --> 00:06:59.689 
so I can bash to that but when you turn

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.589 
so I can bash to that but when you turn
it<00:06:59.869> over<00:07:00.309> this<00:07:01.309> lip<00:07:01.610> right<00:07:01.789> here<00:07:01.849> does<00:07:02.330> stick

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
it over this lip right here does stick

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.509 
it over this lip right here does stick
to<00:07:02.719> the<00:07:02.839> iPad<00:07:03.139> and<00:07:03.169> so<00:07:03.379> unless<00:07:03.860> you're<00:07:04.039> shaking

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:04.519 
to the iPad and so unless you're shaking

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:06.219 
to the iPad and so unless you're shaking
it<00:07:04.610> really<00:07:04.879> hard<00:07:05.089> it's<00:07:05.629> gonna<00:07:05.749> stay<00:07:05.990> in<00:07:06.050> place

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
it really hard it's gonna stay in place

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.600 
it really hard it's gonna stay in place
okay<00:07:06.829> so<00:07:06.889> I<00:07:07.039> wouldn't<00:07:07.279> really<00:07:07.369> worry<00:07:07.579> about

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
okay so I wouldn't really worry about

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.850 
okay so I wouldn't really worry about
that<00:07:07.909> but<00:07:08.719> if<00:07:09.019> you<00:07:09.169> guys<00:07:09.259> have<00:07:09.409> any<00:07:09.529> questions

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
that but if you guys have any questions

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.619
