 it's just important that we win 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.939
 but we know that Belgium is a tough job 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.950
 black countries play good playful football 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.450
 sense the level of the Belgian clubs 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.759
 so goes up the level of it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.070
 national team will also go up 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.450
 and we must, we can not ie Belgium 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 underestimate because that was a whole 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.350
 exciting match I think 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.380
 You are already top scorer for this accident 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.810
 the women's bene league with suspension suspension 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.490
 you are number 7 goal also at the top 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 in a world cup ranking 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.270
 qualification europe 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.950
 is that something you play for or is 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.180
 that is not the intention no that is what I want 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.850
 not even the ordinary intention that you like 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
 team wins and yes it is nice that I am there 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.280
 important 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.159
 can be scary but it goes natural 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.659
 just end up getting the team result 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.610
 with no do you think of the week against 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.829
 twente also a topper 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 you see that yes naja it is used 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.470
 of course the better 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.880
 plow and 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.470
 i just hope we have a good day 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.860
 maybe have a bit of can 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 get it 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.450
 I think we as a team with Heerenveen 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.430
 just signal everyone from everyone 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.470
 can win but also from everyone 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.850
 can lose so yes we just have to 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.600
 everything with ourselves to him perhaps 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.880
 what it will be 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.880
