00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the beginning how important is it to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.040 
the beginning how important is it to
define<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.190> objectives<00:00:38.850> well<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:39.960> of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
define your objectives well I think of

you<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.860> critical<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> start<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you it's critical to start there and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.819 
you it's critical to start there and
like<00:00:42.329> anything<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.870> life<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.500> clear

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
like anything in life if you're clear

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
like anything in life if you're clear
about<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.370> direction<00:00:44.670> you're<00:00:44.940> headed<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
about the direction you're headed in

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.940 
about the direction you're headed in
then<00:00:45.510> much<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.320> chance<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.860> going

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
then much more chance that you're going

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
then much more chance that you're going
to<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.670> sort<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.300> obvious

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to get there it's a sort of an obvious

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
to get there it's a sort of an obvious
piece<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> common<00:00:49.170> sense<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:50.010> goes<00:00:50.280> for

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
piece of common sense and that goes for

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
piece of common sense and that goes for
selling<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.910> well<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> means<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.590> need<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
selling as well so it means you need to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
selling as well so it means you need to
be<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.219> clear<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.610> who<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.149> customers

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
be very clear about who your customers

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
be very clear about who your customers
are<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.190> exactly<00:00:56.670> how<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.120> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
are and then exactly how you want to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.639 
are and then exactly how you want to
target<00:00:57.420> them<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> wish<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
target them in the way that you wish to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
target them in the way that you wish to
sell<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.850> said<00:01:00.030> obvious<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
sell to them as I said obvious but a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
sell to them as I said obvious but a
very<00:01:01.170> important<00:01:01.620> starting<00:01:01.859> point<00:01:02.010> okay<00:01:02.730> so

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
very important starting point okay so

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.820 
very important starting point okay so
having<00:01:03.300> done<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.960> suppose<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.710> then

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
having done that I suppose it's then

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
having done that I suppose it's then
crucial<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> ensure<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.820> you've<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
crucial to ensure that you've got the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.109 
crucial to ensure that you've got the
best<00:01:06.659> team<00:01:06.990> available<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
best team available well I think so I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.370 
best team available well I think so I
mean<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> things<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.080> need<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
mean one of the things that you need to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.899 
mean one of the things that you need to
ensure<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.799> well<00:01:10.950> before<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
ensure as well before you go there is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.370 
ensure as well before you go there is
that<00:01:12.030> you've<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> clear<00:01:12.570> methodology<00:01:13.229> so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that you've got a clear methodology so

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.840 
that you've got a clear methodology so
you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.619> exactly<00:01:13.770> how<00:01:14.369> you're<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you know exactly how you're going to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.429 
you know exactly how you're going to
sell<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.390> you're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.020> and

sell and what you're going to do and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.539 
sell and what you're going to do and
then<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.650> course<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.040> need<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> make<00:01:17.340> sure<00:01:17.400> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
then of course you need to make sure you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
then of course you need to make sure you
have<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> right<00:01:17.939> team<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> traps<00:01:19.080> we

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
have the right team one of the traps we

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
have the right team one of the traps we
find<00:01:19.619> gazing<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.310> people<00:01:20.610> fall<00:01:20.820> into<00:01:21.000> an

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
of the things too is first of all define

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
of the things too is first of all define
the<00:01:33.780> sort<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> process<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.040> to

the sort of process that you want to
follow<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:35.700> obviously<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.659> want<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
follow and then obviously you want to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.270 
follow and then obviously you want to
have<00:01:37.079> an<00:01:37.200> effective<00:01:37.619> recruiting<00:01:38.100> process

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
have an effective recruiting process

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
have an effective recruiting process
that's<00:01:38.790> practical<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.630> works<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.470> then

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that's practical and that works but then

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.870 
that's practical and that works but then
once<00:01:40.799> you've<00:01:40.950> got<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.460> need<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> ensure

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
once you've got that you need to ensure

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
once you've got that you need to ensure
that<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.329> spend<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.750> long<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.619> as

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that you spend as long as you can and as

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.170 
that you spend as long as you can and as
much<00:01:43.890> time<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.280> developing<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
much time as you can developing the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.789 
much time as you can developing the
skills<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> salespeople<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.320> work<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
skills of the salespeople to work and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499 
skills of the salespeople to work and
one<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.579> things<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.909> talk<00:01:48.090> about<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
one of the things we talk about is a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.810 
one of the things we talk about is a
practice<00:01:48.990> culture<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:50.100> remarkably

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
practice culture it's remarkably

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.149 
practice culture it's remarkably
difficult<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.540> companies<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.159> understand

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
difficult for companies to understand

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.780 
difficult for companies to understand
the<00:01:53.340> value<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.970> practicing<00:01:55.369> skills<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.700> they

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the value of practicing skills that they

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.940 
the value of practicing skills that they
want<00:01:56.969> their<00:01:57.119> salespeople<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.719> use<00:01:57.990> which

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
want their salespeople to use which

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.530 
want their salespeople to use which
doesn't<00:01:59.340> happen<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.700> sport<00:02:00.060> doesn't<00:02:00.420> happen

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
doesn't happen in sport doesn't happen

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.539 
doesn't happen in sport doesn't happen
in<00:02:00.780> any<00:02:00.899> other<00:02:01.110> area<00:02:01.469> where<00:02:02.009> skill<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
in any other area where skill is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209 
in any other area where skill is
important<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.600> actually<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.530> say<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.189> of

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
important so actually I would say one of

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.950 
important so actually I would say one of
the<00:02:05.369> number<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.700> things<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.509> companies

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the number one things is for companies

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.800 
the number one things is for companies
to<00:02:06.990> focus<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.160> practicing<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.420> skills<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
to focus on practicing the skills that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.910 
to focus on practicing the skills that
they<00:02:09.989> want<00:02:10.170> their<00:02:10.319> salespeople<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
they want their salespeople to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.090 
they want their salespeople to
demonstrate<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.790> front<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.420> their<00:02:12.569> customer

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
demonstrate in front of their customer

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.620 
demonstrate in front of their customer
so<00:02:13.340> theory<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.790> all<00:02:13.910> very<00:02:14.120> well<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:14.390> it's

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
so theory is all very well but it's

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.330 
so theory is all very well but it's
about<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.050> actual<00:02:15.320> practice<00:02:15.770> on<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.040> it's

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
about the actual practice on it it's

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.830 
about the actual practice on it it's
like<00:02:16.490> anything<00:02:16.790> once<00:02:17.060> you've<00:02:17.270> embedded<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
like anything once you've embedded the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.870 
like anything once you've embedded the
technique<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.920> if<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.220> golf<00:02:19.460> once<00:02:19.700> you've

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
technique so if it's golf once you've

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.280 
technique so if it's golf once you've
embedded<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.300> technique<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.780> puting<00:02:21.170> or

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
embedded the technique of puting or

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.900 
embedded the technique of puting or
driving<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.710> ball<00:02:21.830> off<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.070> off<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.580> tee

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
driving the ball off the off the tee

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.310 
driving the ball off the off the tee
then<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.570> need<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> make<00:02:23.930> sure<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.260> you

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
then you need to make sure that you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.170 
then you need to make sure that you
practice<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.830> many<00:02:25.070> many<00:02:25.160> times<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.030> when

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
practice it many many times so that when

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.970 
practice it many many times so that when
it<00:02:26.300> comes<00:02:26.480> down<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.260> you're<00:02:27.620> under

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
it comes down to it and you're under

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.130 
it comes down to it and you're under
pressure<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:29.030> sales<00:02:29.270> situation<00:02:29.960> whether

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
pressure in a sales situation whether

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.720 
pressure in a sales situation whether
that's<00:02:30.380> face-to-face<00:02:31.070> or<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.460> telephone

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
that's face-to-face or on the telephone

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.390 
that's face-to-face or on the telephone
you<00:02:32.450> need<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.690> be<00:02:32.840> very<00:02:32.990> clear<00:02:33.440> about<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
you need to be very clear about the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.740 
you need to be very clear about the
process<00:02:34.820> you're<00:02:34.970> going<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.240> go<00:02:35.330> through<00:02:35.540> and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
process you're going to go through and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.690 
process you're going to go through and
that<00:02:36.140> comes<00:02:36.410> from<00:02:36.560> practice<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.370> assume

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
that comes from practice and I assume

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.430 
that comes from practice and I assume
you<00:02:37.790> continually<00:02:38.300> develop<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.260> learn

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
you continually develop and you learn

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.410 
you continually develop and you learn
nuances<00:02:39.980> new<00:02:40.160> techniques<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.060> you're

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
nuances new techniques and and you're

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.060 
nuances new techniques and and you're
constantly<00:02:42.080> learning<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.710> your<00:02:42.830> sales

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
constantly learning in your sales

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.040 
constantly learning in your sales
process<00:02:43.250> there's<00:02:44.150> no<00:02:44.270> doubt<00:02:44.450> about<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.720> and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
process there's no doubt about that and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.290 
process there's no doubt about that and
the<00:02:45.260> business<00:02:45.560> world<00:02:45.770> is<00:02:45.950> increasingly

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
the business world is increasingly

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.340 
the business world is increasingly
dynamics<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:47.510> one<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.870> things<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.140> have

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
dynamics so one of the things you have

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.080 
dynamics so one of the things you have
to<00:02:48.470> have<00:02:48.620> within<00:02:48.830> your<00:02:49.010> selling<00:02:49.310> process<00:02:49.730> is

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
to have within your selling process is

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.240 
to have within your selling process is
one<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.540> extremely<00:02:51.200> responsive<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
one that is extremely responsive to the

one that is extremely responsive to the
customer<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.910> market<00:02:53.300> too<00:02:53.930> many

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
customer in the market too many

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.910 
customer in the market too many
companies<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.100> our<00:02:55.190> own<00:02:56.140> experience<00:02:57.140> find

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
companies in our own experience find

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.610 
companies in our own experience find
that<00:02:58.400> they're<00:02:58.850> selling<00:02:59.510> process<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.140> focused

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
that they're selling process is focused

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.560 
that they're selling process is focused
on<00:03:00.710> them<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.220> their<00:03:01.400> product<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.000> not<00:03:02.420> on

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
on them and their product and not on

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.390 
on them and their product and not on
their<00:03:02.720> customer<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.440> therefore<00:03:04.100> it's<00:03:04.220> very

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
their customer and therefore it's very

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.070 
their customer and therefore it's very
difficult<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.850> respond<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.450> adapt<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.990> the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
difficult to respond and adapt in the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.420 
difficult to respond and adapt in the
way<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.260> need<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.680> all<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.860> customer<00:03:07.250> wants

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
way you need to all the customer wants

increasingly over the internet and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.080 
increasingly over the internet and
people<00:04:07.190> say<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.400> us<00:04:07.640> well<00:04:07.850> there's<00:04:08.000> no

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
i think the reverse is true when you're

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.820 
i think the reverse is true when you're
over<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.810> internet<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.350> don't<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.680> the

or over the telephone it's even more

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.760
