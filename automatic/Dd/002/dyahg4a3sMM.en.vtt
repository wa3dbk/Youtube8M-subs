it's very likely that we'll be seeing a
4.7<00:00:37.649> inch<00:00:37.800> version<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.850> iphone<00:00:39.270> 6<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.870> may

also be kind of a 5.5 inch version as
well<00:00:42.420> however<00:00:43.140> personally<00:00:43.559> i<00:00:43.590> would<00:00:43.890> say<00:00:44.129> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
well however personally i would say that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
well however personally i would say that
apple<00:00:44.730> will<00:00:44.879> kind<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> stick<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.989> one

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
version it's quite a big jump from a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.670 
version it's quite a big jump from a
4-inch<00:00:50.760> phone<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> iphone<00:00:51.690> 5s<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.559> go

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
4-inch phone like the iphone 5s to go

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
4-inch phone like the iphone 5s to go
straight<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> 4.7<00:00:53.879> inch<00:00:54.000> version<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.840> going

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
straight to a 4.7 inch version so going

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
straight to a 4.7 inch version so going
to<00:00:55.559> include<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> 4.7<00:00:57.210> inch<00:00:57.360> version

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to include kind of a 4.7 inch version

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.959 
to include kind of a 4.7 inch version
and<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> 5.5<00:00:58.829> inch<00:00:59.039> version<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.460> well<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and then a 5.5 inch version as well I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.459 
and then a 5.5 inch version as well I
personally<00:01:00.510> don't<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.930> happening<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
personally don't see that happening it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
personally don't see that happening it
might<00:01:01.680> happen<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:02.879> eyes<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.180> don't

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
might happen but just in my eyes I don't

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
might happen but just in my eyes I don't
really<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> realistic<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
really see it as that realistic the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.830 
really see it as that realistic the
resolution<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.850> display<00:01:06.210> may<00:01:06.450> come<00:01:06.689> in

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
resolution of this display may come in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.120 
resolution of this display may come in
at<00:01:06.990> 960<00:01:07.890> x<00:01:08.479> 1704<00:01:09.479> pixels<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.530> give<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.740> iphone

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
at 960 x 1704 pixels now give the iphone

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.210 
at 960 x 1704 pixels now give the iphone
6<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.520> pixel<00:01:11.880> density<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.560> 416<00:01:13.560> pixels<00:01:14.010> per<00:01:14.189> inch

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
6 a pixel density of 416 pixels per inch

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
6 a pixel density of 416 pixels per inch
that's<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.820> fantastic<00:01:15.210> resolution<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:15.990> a

on<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.210> iphone<00:01:27.570> 6<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.049> well<00:01:28.409> we've<00:01:28.770> already

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
on the iphone 6 as well we've already

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
on the iphone 6 as well we've already
seen<00:01:29.159> design<00:01:29.490> changes<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> ipod<00:01:30.509> touch

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
seen design changes in the ipod touch

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.719 
seen design changes in the ipod touch
line<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> ipod<00:01:31.530> touch<00:01:31.710> 5th<00:01:32.009> generation<00:01:32.220> is

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
line the ipod touch 5th generation is

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
line the ipod touch 5th generation is
probably<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.600> resemble<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.229> iphone<00:01:34.560> 6

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
probably what will resemble the iphone 6

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.140 
probably what will resemble the iphone 6
mostly<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.880> those<00:01:35.970> around

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
mostly if you have one of those around

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.179 
mostly if you have one of those around
it<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.170> probably<00:01:37.380> end<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.740> looking<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it will probably end up looking like a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.460 
it will probably end up looking like a
larger<00:01:38.820> version<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.869> ipad<00:01:39.990> line<00:01:40.320> is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
larger version of that the ipad line is

and also on the camera sensor on the
back<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.409> basically<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.950> stop<00:02:23.280> scratches

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879

all<00:02:44.280> over<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.269> very<00:02:45.629> very<00:02:46.019> unlikely<00:02:46.409> you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
all over it's very very unlikely you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.589
