rationale<00:04:12.020> for<00:04:12.290> using<00:04:12.440> those<00:04:12.830> is<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.070> as

rationale for using those is that as

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
well if we consider the remember the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.530 
well if we consider the remember the
property<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:16.040> an<00:04:16.430> autoimmune<00:04:16.790> disease

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
property is an autoimmune disease

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.710 
property is an autoimmune disease
and<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.500> antibody<00:04:18.980> must<00:04:19.880> be<00:04:20.740> produced<00:04:21.740> by

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
and so the antibody must be produced by

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.370 
and so the antibody must be produced by
cells<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.990> are<00:04:24.170> from<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.560> B<00:04:24.740> cell<00:04:25.070> lineage

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
could have been with the property so it

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.910 
could have been with the property so it
does<00:04:58.070> therefore<00:04:58.580> make<00:04:58.790> sense<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.540> use<00:04:59.920> an
