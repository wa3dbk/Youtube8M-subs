G major by the way before I forget

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.529 
G major by the way before I forget
because<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.680> always<00:00:25.859> forget<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:27.000> want<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.240> capo

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
because I always forget we want a capo

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.960 
because I always forget we want a capo
on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.930> fret<00:00:28.429> I've<00:00:29.429> seen<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> lot<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
on the first fret I've seen a lot of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.310 
on the first fret I've seen a lot of
different<00:00:30.179> ways<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> play<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
different ways to play this but this is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.749 
different ways to play this but this is
definitely<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> easiest<00:00:31.830> way<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
definitely the easiest way is to have a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.639 
definitely the easiest way is to have a
capo<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.239> first<00:00:33.540> fret<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.230> use<00:00:34.469> these

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
capo on the first fret and use these

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.090 
capo on the first fret and use these
chords<00:00:35.040> which<00:00:35.670> again<00:00:36.149> let<00:00:36.600> me<00:00:36.630> explain<00:00:37.140> for

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
chords which again let me explain for

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.630 
chords which again let me explain for
our<00:00:38.190> intro<00:00:38.550> G<00:00:39.360> major<00:00:40.670> B<00:00:41.670> minor<00:00:43.100> D<00:00:44.100> major<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
our intro G major B minor D major and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
our intro G major B minor D major and
then<00:00:45.739> back<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.950> G<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:48.829> major<00:00:50.780> B<00:00:51.780> minor

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
then back to G a major B minor

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
then back to G a major B minor
now<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> strumming<00:00:53.190> pattern<00:00:53.219> I've<00:00:53.610> decided

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
now the strumming pattern I've decided

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
now the strumming pattern I've decided
to<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.480> follows<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> bass<00:00:55.350> line<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to go as follows the bass line kind of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:06.890 
to go as follows the bass line kind of
all<00:00:56.550> downstrokes<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.539> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380 

so<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.040> sing<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> lead<00:01:08.580> part<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.180> kind

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so if I sing the lead part you can kind

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.030 
so if I sing the lead part you can kind
of<00:01:09.450> hear<00:01:09.660> how<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.230> goes<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:10.770> gee

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.790 

that<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.790> G

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
that the G

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:28.530 
that the G
Meyer

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.760 

and<00:01:28.960> then<00:01:29.170> we<00:01:29.260> end<00:01:29.440> on<00:01:29.650> D<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:32.110> how<00:01:32.440> we

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
and then we end on D so that is how we

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.520
