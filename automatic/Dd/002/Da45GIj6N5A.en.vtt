though for example here you see the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.690 
though for example here you see the
zombies<00:01:17.810> need<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.380> plant<00:01:18.590> several<00:01:19.130> bombs<00:01:19.369> to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
secure victory what makes gardens and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.779 
secure victory what makes gardens and
graveyards<00:01:26.990> really<00:01:27.800> work<00:01:28.039> though<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.429> how<00:01:28.580> all

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
graveyards really work though is how all

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.240 
graveyards really work though is how all
the<00:01:29.149> classes<00:01:29.630> play<00:01:29.840> off<00:01:30.020> each<00:01:30.050> other<00:01:30.470> there

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
the classes play off each other there

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.790 
the classes play off each other there
are<00:01:31.490> four<00:01:31.850> classes<00:01:32.450> per<00:01:32.630> side<00:01:32.899> and<00:01:33.229> each<00:01:33.619> of

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
are four classes per side and each of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.730 
are four classes per side and each of
them<00:01:33.890> sport<00:01:34.280> three<00:01:34.729> unique<00:01:35.240> abilities<00:01:35.869> for

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
them sport three unique abilities for

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.160 
them sport three unique abilities for
example<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.280> foot<00:01:37.520> soldiers<00:01:37.759> zpg<00:01:38.659> might<00:01:38.929> take

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
example the foot soldiers zpg might take

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.770 
example the foot soldiers zpg might take
a<00:01:39.200> while<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.860> fire<00:01:40.100> but<00:01:40.789> it<00:01:40.819> does<00:01:41.149> massive

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
a while to fire but it does massive

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.980 
a while to fire but it does massive
damage

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.889 

likewise<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.340> scientists<00:01:46.970> warp<00:01:47.270> ability<00:01:47.720> can

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
likewise the scientists warp ability can

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.990 
likewise the scientists warp ability can
rapidly<00:01:48.170> close<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.829> gap<00:01:49.009> between<00:01:49.189> you<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.850> an

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
rapidly close the gap between you and an

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.940 
rapidly close the gap between you and an
enemy<00:01:50.299> getting<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.229> in<00:01:51.380> range<00:01:51.649> for<00:01:51.890> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
enemy getting you in range for the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.340 
enemy getting you in range for the
shotgun<00:01:52.399> like<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.850> blaster<00:01:53.420> meanwhile<00:01:54.320> the

shotgun like you blaster meanwhile the

shotgun like you blaster meanwhile the
sunflower<00:01:55.009> provides<00:01:55.460> much<00:01:55.790> needed<00:01:55.820> healing

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
sunflower provides much needed healing

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.660 
sunflower provides much needed healing
which<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:56.960> make<00:01:57.110> for<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> devastating<00:01:58.220> combo

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
which can make for a devastating combo

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.730 
which can make for a devastating combo
when<00:01:59.090> you've<00:01:59.210> got<00:01:59.360> multiple<00:01:59.750> sunflowers

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
when you've got multiple sunflowers

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.609 
when you've got multiple sunflowers
working<00:02:01.220> together<00:02:01.899> another<00:02:02.899> favorite<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
working together another favorite is the

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.279 
working together another favorite is the
patient's<00:02:04.310> ability<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:05.090> root<00:02:05.299> turning<00:02:06.140> his
