can<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.800> happens<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.129> other

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
can see there happens on the other

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.939 
can see there happens on the other
because<00:00:57.449> there's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.199> red<00:00:58.410> dot<00:00:58.710> know

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
because there's a little red dot know

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.400 
because there's a little red dot know
that<00:00:59.160> door<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.699> always<00:01:00.090> important<00:01:00.840> depending

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that door is always important depending

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.799 
that door is always important depending
on where<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.000> you've<00:01:03.270> moved<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
on where a you know you've moved the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.179 
on where a you know you've moved the
prem<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:08.060> go<00:01:09.060> wrong<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.600> times

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
prem and it can go wrong at times

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.830 
prem and it can go wrong at times
unfortunately<00:01:11.210> it's<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> foolproof

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
unfortunately it's not a foolproof

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.219 
unfortunately it's not a foolproof
method<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.460> easier<00:01:14.780> now<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:15.840> tend

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
method but it's a lot easier now i tend

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.950 
method but it's a lot easier now i tend
to<00:01:16.320> use<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> standard<00:01:21.509> brush<00:01:21.780> i

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to use it not with the standard brush i

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.609 
to use it not with the standard brush i
tend<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.860> Move<00:01:23.100> blush<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.820> lot<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> i

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
tend to use the Move blush a lot so i

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
tend to use the Move blush a lot so i
can<00:01:25.979> create<00:01:26.310> things<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> tends<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
can create things because it tends to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
can create things because it tends to
know<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:29.450> messed<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.049> mayor<00:01:31.290> shop<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.780> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
know a messed up the mayor shop a lot so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.870 
know a messed up the mayor shop a lot so
say<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> wanted<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.799> create<00:01:35.100> our<00:01:35.520> face

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
say I wanted to create our face

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.029 
say I wanted to create our face
and<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.210> can<00:01:38.570> move<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.560> end<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:41.149> knauss

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
and I can move it end to the knauss

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.880 
and I can move it end to the knauss
slightly<00:01:43.039> irongloat<00:01:43.369> move<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.090> Izone<00:01:44.890> deals

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
slightly irongloat move the Izone deals

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:56.850 
slightly irongloat move the Izone deals
the<00:01:46.189> IE<00:01:46.880> pose<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:49.280> then<00:01:49.399> move<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:51.500> fear<00:01:51.740> so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860

and<00:01:57.250> all<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.420> do<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.710> drop<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.980> size<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
and all you do is drop the size of the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.140 
and all you do is drop the size of the
brush

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150

and<00:02:12.350> get<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.490> roughly<00:02:14.120> right<00:02:14.330> with<00:02:14.720> son<00:02:14.960> world

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and get it roughly right with son world

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.400 
and get it roughly right with son world
but<00:02:16.760> that's<00:02:17.330> basically<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:19.540> transform<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
but that's basically the transform you

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.390 
but that's basically the transform you
know<00:02:21.530> activate<00:02:22.160> cemetery<00:02:22.850> or<00:02:23.000> metal<00:02:23.480> drawing

know<00:02:53.260> every<00:02:53.950> time<00:02:54.189> you<00:02:54.370> want<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:55.230> mess<00:02:56.230> about

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
know every time you want to mess about

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.640 
know every time you want to mess about
with<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:57.069> Lord<00:02:57.969> tool<00:02:58.420> because<00:02:59.019> these<00:02:59.379> are

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
with it Lord tool because these are

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.050 
with it Lord tool because these are
considered<00:03:00.189> tools<00:03:00.489> not<00:03:00.849> crumbs<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:03.819> will

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
considered tools not crumbs and it will

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.740 
considered tools not crumbs and it will
appear<00:03:04.659> there<00:03:05.129> before<00:03:06.129> you<00:03:06.579> use<00:03:06.849> sculpted

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
appear there before you use sculpted

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.199 
appear there before you use sculpted
because<00:03:08.049> sometimes<00:03:08.620> when<00:03:09.099> you<00:03:09.549> use<00:03:09.790> something

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
because sometimes when you use something

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.610 
because sometimes when you use something
like<00:03:10.420> geometry<00:03:11.430> which<00:03:12.430> divides<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.840> mesh<00:03:14.349> as

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
like geometry which divides the mesh as

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.849 
like geometry which divides the mesh as
you<00:03:14.769> can<00:03:14.950> see<00:03:15.189> it's<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.609> much<00:03:15.909> finer<00:03:16.439> point<00:03:17.439> than

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
you can see it's a much finer point than

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.890 
you can see it's a much finer point than
what<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.430> was<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:21.579> leave<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.299> and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
what it was and if you leave that on and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.129 
what it was and if you leave that on and
your<00:03:23.590> head<00:03:23.769> sculpt<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.609> without<00:03:25.269> saving<00:03:25.689> it

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
your head sculpt it without saving it

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.629 
your head sculpt it without saving it
tons<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:27.579> object<00:03:28.419> and<00:03:28.599> turn<00:03:28.900> all<00:03:29.199> BG<00:03:29.859> rather

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
tons that object and turn all BG rather

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.890 
tons that object and turn all BG rather
than<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.329> sculptor<00:03:32.199> so<00:03:32.949> and<00:03:33.400> there<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.419> program

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
than a sculptor so and there the program

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.619 
than a sculptor so and there the program
can<00:03:35.260> crash<00:03:35.769> it's<00:03:36.430> been<00:03:36.579> known<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:37.030> crash<00:03:37.389> with

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
can crash it's been known to crash with

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.759 
can crash it's been known to crash with
a<00:03:37.689> Z<00:03:38.079> sculpt<00:03:38.439> this<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:38.889> always<00:03:39.639> save<00:03:40.269> before

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
a Z sculpt this so always save before

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.869 
a Z sculpt this so always save before
you<00:03:41.769> do<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.090> that's<00:03:43.569> how<00:03:43.719> you<00:03:43.870> save<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.879> I

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
you do that so that's how you save and I

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.809 
you do that so that's how you save and I
will<00:03:46.449> see<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.049> in<00:03:47.439> the<00:03:47.620> next<00:03:47.799> tutorial<00:03:48.010> where

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
will see you in the next tutorial where

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.030 
will see you in the next tutorial where
we<00:03:49.090> get<00:03:49.299> started<00:03:49.810> on<00:03:50.699> creation<00:03:52.379> not<00:03:53.379> creation

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
we get started on creation not creation

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.249 
we get started on creation not creation
like<00:03:54.220> pendant<00:03:54.609> down<00:03:54.790> God<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:55.599> creation<00:03:56.139> eyes

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
like pendant down God but creation eyes

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.949 
like pendant down God but creation eyes
and<00:03:56.500> creation<00:03:56.889> of<00:03:56.979> prims<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:58.120> I'll<00:03:58.720> see<00:03:58.930> you

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
and creation of prims so I'll see you

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.159 
and creation of prims so I'll see you
