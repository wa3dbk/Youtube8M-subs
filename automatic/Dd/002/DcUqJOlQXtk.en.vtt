00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.540 

that's<00:00:01.020> an<00:00:01.199> interesting<00:00:01.829> question<00:00:01.979> I've

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
that's an interesting question I've

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.570 
that's an interesting question I've
never<00:00:02.850> thought<00:00:03.090> about<00:00:03.149> that<00:00:03.540> at<00:00:03.870> all

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
never thought about that at all

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.249 
never thought about that at all
we<00:00:05.580> always<00:00:05.779> meet<00:00:06.779> when<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.049> think<00:00:07.140> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
we always meet when we think of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.140 
we always meet when we think of
astronomy<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.859> often<00:00:08.130> think<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.400> stars<00:00:08.760> and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
astronomy we often think of stars and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
astronomy we often think of stars and
the<00:00:09.540> night<00:00:09.570> sky<00:00:09.929> being<00:00:10.290> full<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.559> stars<00:00:10.800> and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the night sky being full of stars and

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.919 
the night sky being full of stars and
everyone<00:00:11.730> knows<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.360> Sun<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.870> just

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
everyone knows that the Sun is just

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.140 
everyone knows that the Sun is just
another<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.650> these<00:00:13.860> stars<00:00:14.160> when<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.849> look

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
another one of these stars when you look

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.420 
another one of these stars when you look
at<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> night<00:00:15.540> sky<00:00:15.570> full<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.350> stars<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:17.310> you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
at the night sky full of stars do you

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
at the night sky full of stars do you
think<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.760> them<00:00:17.910> as<00:00:18.029> Suns<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.020> put<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
think of them as Suns or do you put the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.510 
think of them as Suns or do you put the
Sun<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> different<00:00:19.920> category<00:00:20.039> no<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
Sun in a different category no I

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.279 
Sun in a different category no I
definitely<00:00:20.760> think<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.300> them<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.539> Suns<00:00:21.810> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
definitely think of them as Suns and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.470 
definitely think of them as Suns and
I'll<00:00:22.710> tell<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.100> good<00:00:23.789> way<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> think<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I'll tell you a good way to think of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320 
I'll tell you a good way to think of
that<00:00:24.539> there's<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.260> cluster<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.160> Cancer<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that there's a cluster in Cancer the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.290 
that there's a cluster in Cancer the
crab<00:00:27.420> which<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:27.960> called<00:00:28.230> m67<00:00:29.010> that's<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
crab which is called m67 that's one of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.179 
crab which is called m67 that's one of
the<00:00:30.390> oldest<00:00:30.810> clusters<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.769> know<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.070> that's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the oldest clusters we know if that's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
the oldest clusters we know if that's
the<00:00:32.309> oldest<00:00:32.640> cluster<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.300> Messier

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the oldest cluster in the Messier

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.650 
the oldest cluster in the Messier
catalog<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.520> thought<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.239> 4

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
catalog and it's thought to be about 4

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
catalog and it's thought to be about 4
billion<00:00:37.140> years<00:00:37.290> old<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.980> cluster<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
billion years old that cluster so that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.430 
billion years old that cluster so that
means<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> stars<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.719> formed<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
means all the stars that formed in it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
means all the stars that formed in it
formed<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> same<00:00:41.430> sort<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.760> time<00:00:42.000> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
formed about the same sort of time that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
formed about the same sort of time that
the<00:00:42.270> Sun<00:00:42.450> formed<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.530> known<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.070> there

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the Sun formed and it's known that there

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
the Sun formed and it's known that there
are<00:00:44.340> hundred<00:00:45.090> members<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.780> cluster<00:00:46.020> at

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
are hundred members of that cluster at

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040 
are hundred members of that cluster at
least<00:00:46.590> which<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:47.039> very<00:00:47.219> sun-like<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.930> can

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
least which are very sun-like so we can

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.049 
least which are very sun-like so we can
study<00:00:49.260> those<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.129> an<00:00:50.219> idea<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
study those and we can get an idea of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.709 
study those and we can get an idea of
how<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> Sun<00:00:51.539> works<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.620> amazingly<00:00:53.610> 30%<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
how the Sun works but amazingly 30% of

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
how the Sun works but amazingly 30% of
those<00:00:54.899> Suns<00:00:55.320> very<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.550> our<00:00:56.760> own<00:00:56.850> Sun<00:00:57.180> are

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
those Suns very like our own Sun are

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.349 
those Suns very like our own Sun are
showing<00:00:58.170> enhance<00:00:58.620> activity<00:00:59.280> way<00:00:59.609> beyond<00:01:00.000> what

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
showing enhance activity way beyond what

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.920 
showing enhance activity way beyond what
our<00:01:00.600> own<00:01:00.750> Sun<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.379> showing<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.480> yeah<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.809> can

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
our own Sun is showing so yeah you can

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
our own Sun is showing so yeah you can
definitely<00:01:04.170> feel<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.430> star<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
definitely feel that that is a star like

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
definitely feel that that is a star like
all<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.360> stars<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
all the other stars out there and you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
all the other stars out there and you
can<00:01:07.710> definitely<00:01:07.950> also<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> feeling<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
can definitely also get a feeling for

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
can definitely also get a feeling for
the<00:01:09.450> fact<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.810> even<00:01:10.680> though<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.100> pretty

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the fact that even though it's pretty

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
the fact that even though it's pretty
stable<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.970> us<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> moment<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
stable for us at the moment we like to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
stable for us at the moment we like to
go<00:01:13.260> outside<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.860> sunbathe<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> whatever<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
go outside and sunbathe and whatever it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.600 
go outside and sunbathe and whatever it
doesn't<00:01:15.479> always<00:01:15.689> behave<00:01:16.110> quite<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.490> would

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
doesn't always behave quite as we would

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
doesn't always behave quite as we would
expect<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> behave<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.140> we've<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
expect it to behave so we've got a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.870 
expect it to behave so we've got a
treaty<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> bit<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> respect<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
treaty with a bit of respect I think the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
treaty with a bit of respect I think the
Sun<00:01:21.320> when<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> say<00:01:22.710> these<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.369> other<00:01:23.549> guys

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
Sun when you say these these other guys

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
Sun when you say these these other guys
are<00:01:23.790> having<00:01:24.420> enhanced<00:01:24.869> activity<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.590> can

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
are having enhanced activity that we can

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.200 
are having enhanced activity that we can
even<00:01:25.860> monitor<00:01:26.100> all<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> way<00:01:26.759> from<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.119> on

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
even monitor all the way from here on

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.960 
even monitor all the way from here on
earth<00:01:27.390> does<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.290> mean<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.530> our<00:01:28.860> Sun<00:01:29.549> decided

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
earth does that mean if our Sun decided

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
earth does that mean if our Sun decided
to<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.900> spells<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to have one of these little spells of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.660 
to have one of these little spells of
enhanced<00:01:32.430> activity<00:01:32.960> we'd<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.140> trouble<00:01:34.670> I

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
enhanced activity we'd be in trouble I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
enhanced activity we'd be in trouble I
think<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.150> could<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.450> interesting<00:01:36.960> times

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
think we could have interesting times

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.480 
think we could have interesting times
yeah<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.939> mean<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> average<00:01:40.490> activity

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
yeah I think I mean the average activity

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420 
yeah I think I mean the average activity
of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> Sun<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.600> pretty<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.439> our

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
of the Sun is is pretty good for our

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.190 
of the Sun is is pretty good for our
existence<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.390> earth<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.990> doesn't

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
existence here on earth but it doesn't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.580 
existence here on earth but it doesn't
take<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:46.439> awful<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> change<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> output<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
take an awful lot of change in output to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
take an awful lot of change in output to
alter<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.860> situation<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> be

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
alter that situation I don't to be

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.179 
alter that situation I don't to be
alarmist<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.380> mean<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.979> for

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
alarmist but I mean you can get for

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.240 
alarmist but I mean you can get for

one<00:02:11.849> was<00:02:12.150> spotted

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
one was spotted

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.920 
one was spotted
like<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:14.520> had<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> massive<00:02:15.150> auroral

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
like and we had a massive auroral

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.380 
like and we had a massive auroral
displays<00:02:16.220> following<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.850> there's<00:02:18.330> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
displays following that so there's a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
these amazing natural light displays but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.830 
these amazing natural light displays but
also<00:02:25.080> they<00:02:25.740> can<00:02:25.770> interfere<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:26.840> electronics

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
also they can interfere with electronics

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.960 
also they can interfere with electronics
they<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.430> cause<00:02:29.990> weld<00:02:30.990> joints<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.950> huge<00:02:32.610> pipe

they can cause weld joints in huge pipe

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.350 
they can cause weld joints in huge pipe

course<00:02:42.240> we're<00:02:42.390> very<00:02:42.420> reliant<00:02:43.020> on<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.500> fact

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
course we're very reliant on the fact

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.520 
course we're very reliant on the fact
that<00:02:43.830> we've<00:02:44.010> got<00:02:45.140> communications<00:02:46.140> we've<00:02:46.410> got

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that we've got communications we've got

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.490 
that we've got communications we've got
GPS<00:02:46.770> satellites<00:02:47.580> we've<00:02:47.910> got<00:02:48.230> everything<00:02:49.230> is

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
GPS satellites we've got everything is

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.070 
GPS satellites we've got everything is
basically<00:02:49.980> electronics<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.270> think<00:02:51.690> it's

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
basically electronics so I think it's

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.930 
basically electronics so I think it's
it's<00:02:52.650> something<00:02:53.010> which<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.400> shouldn't<00:02:53.760> be

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
it's something which we shouldn't be

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
it's something which we shouldn't be
complacent<00:02:54.300> about<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:58.860> think<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.680> simplest

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
complacent about I think the simplest

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.880 
complacent about I think the simplest
way<00:03:01.770> towards<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.430> no<00:03:03.290> because<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.680> a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
way towards that is no because it's a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.530 
way towards that is no because it's a
really<00:03:05.100> very<00:03:05.370> average<00:03:05.880> start<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.270> not<00:03:06.300> very

here on our planet

but on some other worlds the activity is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.800

and<00:03:37.080> there<00:03:37.170> was<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> good<00:03:37.650> example<00:03:37.980> recently<00:03:38.730> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and there was a good example recently of

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.440 
and there was a good example recently of
an<00:03:39.870> observation<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:41.640> planet<00:03:42.209> which<00:03:42.330> had

been vaporized by a flare from its
parent<00:03:45.570> star<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:46.260> wouldn't<00:03:47.160> do<00:03:47.250> us<00:03:47.370> an<00:03:47.520> awful

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
parent star I wouldn't do us an awful

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.520 
parent star I wouldn't do us an awful
lot<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:47.880> good<00:03:48.000> if<00:03:48.239> we<00:03:48.360> had<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> super<00:03:48.900> flare<00:03:49.290> that

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
lot of good if we had a super flare that

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.420 
lot of good if we had a super flare that
the<00:03:50.340> two<00:03:50.550> cuts<00:03:50.790> act<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.270> well<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.380> no<00:03:53.040> it's<00:03:53.280> not

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
the two cuts act as well so no it's not

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.250 
the two cuts act as well so no it's not
particularly<00:03:53.820> special<00:03:54.030> at<00:03:54.300> all<00:03:54.450> obviously

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
particularly special at all obviously

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.540 
particularly special at all obviously
you<00:03:55.350> don't<00:03:55.500> want<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.739> live<00:03:55.920> near<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.220> stand

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
you don't want to live near that stand

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.790 
you don't want to live near that stand
that's<00:03:56.670> gonna<00:03:56.820> vaporize<00:03:57.590> but<00:03:58.590> do<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.739> ever

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
that's gonna vaporize but do you ever

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.790 
that's gonna vaporize but do you ever
wish<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.130> had<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.660> better<00:04:00.660> star<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.260> sit<00:04:01.590> here

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
wish you had a better star to sit here

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.800 
wish you had a better star to sit here
and<00:04:02.010> point<00:04:02.430> your<00:04:02.640> telescope<00:04:02.940> at<00:04:03.450> each<00:04:03.570> day

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
and point your telescope at each day

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.140 
and point your telescope at each day
that's<00:04:04.620> an<00:04:04.800> interesting<00:04:05.430> question<00:04:05.610> I've

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
that's an interesting question I've

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.430 
that's an interesting question I've
never<00:04:06.450> thought<00:04:06.690> about<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.140> at<00:04:07.470> all

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
never thought about that at all

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.930 
never thought about that at all
sometimes<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:11.220> answer<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.640> would<00:04:11.910> be

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
sometimes the answer to that would be

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.810 
sometimes the answer to that would be
yes<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:13.470> reason<00:04:13.950> for<00:04:13.980> saying<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.640> is

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
yes and the reason for saying that is

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.940 
yes and the reason for saying that is
that<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.570> these<00:04:15.840> filters<00:04:16.290> are<00:04:16.620> quite

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that this these filters are quite

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.670 
that this these filters are quite
expensive<00:04:17.340> filters<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.209> buy<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.720> they<00:04:19.530> used

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
expensive filters to buy and they used

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.400 
expensive filters to buy and they used
to<00:04:19.769> be<00:04:19.830> horrendously<00:04:20.640> expensive<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.960> used<00:04:22.169> one

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
to be horrendously expensive I used one

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.870 
to be horrendously expensive I used one
of<00:04:22.440> these<00:04:22.650> when<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.979> was<00:04:23.100> at<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.280> University<00:04:23.850> of

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
of these when I was at the University of

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.610 
of these when I was at the University of
Leicester<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.020> used<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.229> be<00:04:25.320> brought<00:04:25.500> out

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
Leicester and it used to be brought out

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.580 
Leicester and it used to be brought out
like<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.919> crown<00:04:26.130> jewel

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
like the crown jewel

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.890 
like the crown jewel
and<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.130> used<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.400> take<00:04:27.790> it<00:04:28.090> out<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.540> put<00:04:28.720> it

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
and you used to take it out and put it

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.350 
and you used to take it out and put it
very<00:04:29.260> carefully<00:04:29.530> into<00:04:30.070> place<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:31.240> they've

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
very carefully into place but they've

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.840 
very carefully into place but they've
become<00:04:31.480> more<00:04:31.810> affordable<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.530> light<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.220> lots

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
become more affordable of light and lots

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.520 
become more affordable of light and lots
and<00:04:33.970> lots<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.210> people<00:04:34.540> have<00:04:34.630> got<00:04:34.840> into<00:04:35.200> buying

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
and lots of people have got into buying

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.940 
and lots of people have got into buying
them<00:04:35.770> on<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.220> premise<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.610> solar<00:04:37.210> observing

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
them on the premise that solar observing

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.409 
them on the premise that solar observing
hydrogen-alpha<00:04:38.950> solar<00:04:39.400> observing<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.180> an

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
hydrogen-alpha solar observing is an

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.830 
hydrogen-alpha solar observing is an
amazing<00:04:41.080> thing<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.350> experience<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.580> is

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
amazing thing to experience and it is

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.210 
amazing thing to experience and it is
but<00:04:43.840> we're<00:04:43.960> coming<00:04:44.139> up<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.320> solar<00:04:44.530> maximum<00:04:44.919> now

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
but we're coming up to solar maximum now

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.430 
but we're coming up to solar maximum now
so<00:04:45.430> we<00:04:45.550> should<00:04:45.760> be<00:04:45.900> experiencing<00:04:46.900> lots<00:04:47.230> and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
so we should be experiencing lots and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.860 
so we should be experiencing lots and
lots<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:47.710> sunspots<00:04:48.370> huge<00:04:48.880> sunspots<00:04:49.450> huge

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
lots of sunspots huge sunspots huge

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.920 
lots of sunspots huge sunspots huge
prominences<00:04:50.530> loads<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.190> flares<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:52.630> Sun

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
prominences loads of flares and the Sun

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.100 
prominences loads of flares and the Sun
has<00:04:53.080> been<00:04:53.230> pretty<00:04:53.470> quiet<00:04:53.710> really<00:04:54.370> so

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
has been pretty quiet really so

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.030 
has been pretty quiet really so
sometimes<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.260> just<00:04:56.500> want<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.680> go<00:04:56.770> out<00:04:56.889> there

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
sometimes you just want to go out there

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.950 
sometimes you just want to go out there
and<00:04:57.160> give<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.370> bit<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.610> kick<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.120> say<00:04:58.389> go

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
and give it a bit of a kick and say go

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.200 
and give it a bit of a kick and say go
on<00:04:59.080> give<00:04:59.260> us<00:04:59.290> something<00:04:59.620> really<00:05:00.100> exciting<00:05:00.430> to

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
on give us something really exciting to

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.490 
on give us something really exciting to
look<00:05:01.389> at<00:05:01.570> now<00:05:06.450> computer<00:05:07.450> screen<00:05:07.780> now<00:05:08.229> this<00:05:08.380> is

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
look at now computer screen now this is

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.850 
look at now computer screen now this is
looks<00:05:08.740> rather<00:05:09.010> like<00:05:09.370> a<00:05:09.550> Heath<00:05:09.910> Robinson

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
looks rather like a Heath Robinson

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.190 
looks rather like a Heath Robinson
arrangement<00:05:11.860> here<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.820> is<00:05:13.050> this<00:05:14.050> is

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
arrangement here and it is this is

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.500 
arrangement here and it is this is
basically<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:15.030> computer<00:05:16.680> desk<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.300> I've<00:05:19.300> got<00:05:19.479> a

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
basically a computer desk and I've got a

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.270 
basically a computer desk and I've got a
framework<00:05:20.050> built<00:05:20.410> onto<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.680> top<00:05:20.889> of<00:05:21.010> it<00:05:21.130> and

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
framework built onto the top of it and

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.090 
framework built onto the top of it and
this<00:05:21.700> tarpaulin<00:05:22.690> over<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.990> top<00:05:23.139> of<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.320> so

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
this tarpaulin over the top of that so

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.770 
this tarpaulin over the top of that so
that<00:05:24.250> means<00:05:24.520> that<00:05:24.790> if<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:25.030> pull<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.360> tarpaulin

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
that means that if I pull the tarpaulin

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.490 
that means that if I pull the tarpaulin
over<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:27.760> they've<00:05:27.910> got<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.060> laptop<00:05:28.450> inside<00:05:28.870> if

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
over and they've got a laptop inside if

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.080 
over and they've got a laptop inside if
you<00:05:29.560> can<00:05:29.710> see<00:05:29.889> that<00:05:30.070> but<00:05:30.430> it's<00:05:30.550> also<00:05:30.700> it's<00:05:30.970> got

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
you can see that but it's also it's got

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.770 
you can see that but it's also it's got
nice<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.630> dark<00:05:31.900> inside<00:05:32.440> now
