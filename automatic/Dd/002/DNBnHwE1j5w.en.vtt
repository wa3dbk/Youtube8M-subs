hey youtubers our garden Aryans 8:24
eise<00:00:04.380> no<00:00:04.770> blower<00:00:05.120> what's<00:00:06.120> happening<00:00:06.480> with

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
eise no blower what's happening with

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.750 
eise no blower what's happening with
this<00:00:06.750> one<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.529> believe<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> connecting<00:00:08.550> rod

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
this one is I believe the connecting rod

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.089 
this one is I believe the connecting rod
is<00:00:08.790> broken<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> engine<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.530> when<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> pull

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
is broken in the engine so when I pull

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.450 
is broken in the engine so when I pull
it<00:00:11.130> over<00:00:11.480> nothing<00:00:12.480> happens

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
it over nothing happens

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.919 
it over nothing happens
all<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.849> hear<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.299> rod<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.719> there

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
all you can hear is the rod in there

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.769 
all you can hear is the rod in there
there<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.470> spark<00:00:16.920> as<00:00:17.699> well<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.600> thought

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
there is spark as well first I thought

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.960 
there is spark as well first I thought
maybe<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.410> coil<00:00:19.800> got<00:00:20.130> undone<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.730> was

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
maybe the coil got undone and was

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.370 
maybe the coil got undone and was
jamming<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> flywheel<00:00:21.960> because

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
jamming up the flywheel because

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
jamming up the flywheel because
previously<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.250> could<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:23.910> turn<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> motor<00:00:24.449> at

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
previously I could not turn a motor at

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.769 
previously I could not turn a motor at
all<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> would<00:00:25.260> jam<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.970> no<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.210> put<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> spark

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
all I would jam up no if I put the spark

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.830 
all I would jam up no if I put the spark
plug<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.199> there's<00:00:28.680> no<00:00:28.830> difference<00:00:32.540> all<00:00:33.540> you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
plug in there's no difference all you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.270 
plug in there's no difference all you
can<00:00:33.989> hear<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> connecting<00:00:34.739> rod<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
can hear is the connecting rod in the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.490 
can hear is the connecting rod in the
engine<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.690> nice<00:00:36.809> blower<00:00:37.170> looks

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
engine so it's a nice blower looks

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
engine so it's a nice blower looks
almost<00:00:37.770> new<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> couple<00:00:38.790> years<00:00:39.090> old

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
almost new it's just a couple years old

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
almost new it's just a couple years old
it's<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.629> shame<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.079> blown<00:00:40.469> already<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.700> what

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
it's a shame it's blown already but what

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's a shame it's blown already but what
I<00:00:41.850> believe<00:00:42.149> happened<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.110> throttle<00:00:43.620> was

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
I believe happened is the throttle was

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
I believe happened is the throttle was
stuck<00:00:44.250> open<00:00:44.670> inside<00:00:45.329> behind<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> cover<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
stuck open inside behind the cover and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
stuck open inside behind the cover and
I'll<00:00:46.590> show<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> take<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> apart<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I'll show you when I take it apart the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'll show you when I take it apart the
motor<00:00:48.629> over<00:00:48.870> revved<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> blew<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
motor over revved and blew the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.240

over<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.229> pulley<00:01:39.649> like<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:42.250> sometimes<00:01:43.250> you

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
over the pulley like that sometimes you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.419 
over the pulley like that sometimes you
can<00:01:43.610> turn<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.030> engine<00:01:44.359> over<00:01:44.659> a<00:01:44.689> bit<00:01:44.929> and<00:01:45.590> it's

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
can turn the engine over a bit and it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.249 
can turn the engine over a bit and it's
gonna<00:01:46.579> help<00:01:46.789> it<00:01:47.030> move<00:01:47.209> along<00:01:49.659> if<00:01:50.659> your<00:01:50.899> engines

need<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.700> remove<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.360> bottom<00:04:57.050> wire<00:04:57.350> here

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
need to remove is the bottom wire here

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.830 
need to remove is the bottom wire here
on<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.610> terminal<00:04:59.230> so<00:05:00.230> let's<00:05:00.350> grab<00:05:00.620> tires<00:05:00.980> and

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
on the terminal so let's grab tires and

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.650 
on the terminal so let's grab tires and
pry<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:02.870> down<00:05:03.400> just<00:05:04.400> like<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:08.630> now

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
pry it down just like that and now

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.850 
pry it down just like that and now
you've<00:05:08.930> got<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.200> cover<00:05:09.350> off

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
you've got to cover off

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.860 
you've got to cover off
now<00:05:10.820> here's<00:05:11.060> what<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.270> was<00:05:11.420> telling<00:05:11.750> you

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
now here's what I was telling you

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.900 
now here's what I was telling you
earlier<00:05:12.020> that<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.890> throttle<00:05:13.310> was<00:05:13.430> jammed<00:05:13.730> in

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
earlier that the throttle was jammed in

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.120 
earlier that the throttle was jammed in
the<00:05:14.060> open<00:05:14.390> position<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:15.170> throttle<00:05:15.620> is<00:05:15.680> really

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
the open position the throttle is really

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.790 
the open position the throttle is really
stiff<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:17.450> hard<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.840> move<00:05:17.960> up<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.290> down<00:05:18.470> and

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
stiff it's hard to move up and down and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.130 
stiff it's hard to move up and down and
when<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.880> blower<00:05:20.120> was<00:05:20.390> brought<00:05:20.660> here

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
when the blower was brought here

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.470 
when the blower was brought here
it<00:05:21.890> was<00:05:22.070> stuck<00:05:22.340> up<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.790> even<00:05:23.090> when<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.270> moved

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
it was stuck up and even when I moved

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.390 
it was stuck up and even when I moved
the<00:05:23.660> throttle<00:05:24.080> down<00:05:24.260> this<00:05:24.770> here<00:05:25.040> didn't<00:05:25.310> even

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
the throttle down this here didn't even

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.390 
the throttle down this here didn't even
move<00:05:25.610> back<00:05:26.020> as<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.260> can<00:05:27.410> see<00:05:27.680> there<00:05:27.920> now<00:05:28.220> it's

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
move back as you can see there now it's

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.530 
move back as you can see there now it's
moving<00:05:30.190> so<00:05:31.190> by<00:05:31.340> having<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.670> throttle<00:05:32.030> wide<00:05:32.210> open

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
moving so by having a throttle wide open

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.900 
moving so by having a throttle wide open
like<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:33.470> butterfly<00:05:34.010> on<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:34.400> carb<00:05:34.670> here

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
like that the butterfly on the carb here

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.480 
like that the butterfly on the carb here
was<00:05:35.210> stuck<00:05:35.420> wide<00:05:35.660> open<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.230> probably<00:05:37.100> didn't

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
was stuck wide open and probably didn't

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.700 
was stuck wide open and probably didn't
come<00:05:37.670> back<00:05:37.820> at<00:05:38.090> all<00:05:38.210> if<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.810> lever<00:05:38.990> was<00:05:39.320> put

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
come back at all if the lever was put

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.740 
come back at all if the lever was put
back<00:05:39.860> down<00:05:40.130> so<00:05:40.820> what<00:05:41.000> happened<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.420> the<00:05:41.570> rod

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
back down so what happened is the rod

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.470 
back down so what happened is the rod
broke<00:05:42.220> so<00:05:43.220> again<00:05:43.460> it's<00:05:43.640> really<00:05:43.880> important

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
broke so again it's really important

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.970 
broke so again it's really important
that<00:05:44.570> you<00:05:44.750> don't<00:05:44.870> rev<00:05:45.110> your<00:05:45.290> engine<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.740> full

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
that you don't rev your engine to full

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.000 
that you don't rev your engine to full
throttle<00:05:46.280> with<00:05:46.730> no<00:05:47.270> load<00:05:47.510> on<00:05:47.540> it<00:05:47.900> in<00:05:48.440> this<00:05:48.710> case

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
throttle with no load on it in this case

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.890 
throttle with no load on it in this case
it<00:05:49.340> doesn't<00:05:49.670> appear<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:50.090> it<00:05:50.240> was<00:05:50.360> anybody's

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
it doesn't appear that it was anybody's

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.520 
it doesn't appear that it was anybody's
fault

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
fault

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.650 
fault
but<00:05:52.010> when<00:05:52.130> any<00:05:52.400> engine<00:05:52.820> over<00:05:53.090> adds<00:05:53.240> like<00:05:53.480> that

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
but when any engine over adds like that

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.290 
but when any engine over adds like that
something's<00:05:54.380> going<00:05:54.590> to<00:05:54.650> break<00:05:54.880> now<00:05:55.880> I<00:05:55.910> checked

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
something's going to break now I checked

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.000 
something's going to break now I checked
on<00:05:56.450> the<00:05:56.480> crank<00:05:56.780> case<00:05:56.930> of<00:05:57.170> the<00:05:57.290> engine<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:57.770> I<00:05:57.950> do

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
on the crank case of the engine and I do

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.700 
on the crank case of the engine and I do
not<00:05:58.340> see<00:05:58.640> any<00:05:58.850> cracks<00:05:59.270> or<00:05:59.510> holes<00:05:59.600> so<00:06:00.200> usually

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
not see any cracks or holes so usually

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.560 
not see any cracks or holes so usually
when<00:06:00.890> the<00:06:00.980> rod<00:06:01.160> breaks<00:06:01.460> it'll<00:06:01.910> shoot<00:06:02.240> a<00:06:02.300> hole

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
when the rod breaks it'll shoot a hole

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.990 
when the rod breaks it'll shoot a hole
right<00:06:02.810> through<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:03.650> crank<00:06:03.980> case<00:06:04.070> there's<00:06:04.820> no

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
right through the crank case there's no

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.700 
right through the crank case there's no
hole<00:06:05.210> on<00:06:05.390> this<00:06:05.540> side<00:06:05.600> either<00:06:05.990> but<00:06:06.380> there<00:06:06.530> could

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
hole on this side either but there could

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.890 
hole on this side either but there could
be<00:06:06.740> one<00:06:07.010> under<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.520> starter<00:06:07.940> even<00:06:08.270> a<00:06:08.360> crack<00:06:08.600> so

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
be one under the starter even a crack so

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.900 
be one under the starter even a crack so
I'm<00:06:08.960> going<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.170> remove<00:06:09.530> that<00:06:09.590> to<00:06:10.160> start<00:06:10.430> with

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.190 

now<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:16.940> both<00:06:17.270> screws<00:06:17.630> are<00:06:17.780> removed<00:06:17.870> the

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
now that both screws are removed the

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.170 
now that both screws are removed the
starter<00:06:18.620> is<00:06:18.680> just<00:06:18.860> going<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.130> slide<00:06:19.340> down<00:06:19.370> pull

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
starter is just going to slide down pull

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.480 
starter is just going to slide down pull
it<00:06:20.210> out
