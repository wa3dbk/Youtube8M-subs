00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
has all these beautiful like like

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.959 
has all these beautiful like like
foliage<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.829> everything<00:01:48.159> everywhere<00:01:48.579> but

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
place here is the pool this is the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.020 
place here is the pool this is the
selling<00:02:16.010> point<00:02:16.220> here<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.430> think<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.940> think

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
selling point here I think is I think

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.980 
selling point here I think is I think
there's<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.240> lot<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.480> play<00:02:17.569> sections<00:02:17.900> have

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
there's a lot of play sections have

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.199 
there's a lot of play sections have
pools<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.380> Bangkok<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.580> nicer<00:02:19.910> buildings

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
but I think that icon the top roof or at

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.980 
but I think that icon the top roof or at
this<00:02:22.610> place<00:02:22.819> it's<00:02:23.090> like<00:02:23.150> way<00:02:23.420> more<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:23.959> a
