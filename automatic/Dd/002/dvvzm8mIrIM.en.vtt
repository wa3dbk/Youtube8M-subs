00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello creative friends today a project 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.310
 easy fast for lepis I created it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 in fact this wifey for hair and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 above I made a cupcake at the beginning 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.070
 I wanted them to be really gods 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.410
 hairpins and definitely it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 But soon become even more 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.829
 spring still has to come this way 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.899
 I decided that these will become the door 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.399
 points in this period therefore all 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.590
 times that I see something that is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.629
 magazines that maybe the cropping of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.670
 recipes or even simply the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.850
 school notes to keep you a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 a little more tidy on the desk 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.520
 I will use this as if they were pincers 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.850
 for sheets so if you like the project 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 follow him a kiss to everyone e 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.129
 thanks again for the comments at home 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.840
 leaving aside the need for 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.080
 this project 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.729
 below is the small plate 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 that you find in the seven of the Ikea ma va 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:18.299
 well any rectangle plate 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:21.990
 square then glue a sheet of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.799
 baking paper is a fantastic if 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.659
 will eventually serve the posts and pisa dei 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.579
 colors you prefer and small springs 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.799
 I bought these are one 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.799
 fifty and cost one euro 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.579
 let's start by placing our own 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.829
 beads is a very simple job 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.049
 we put in the center of the base and 3 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.750
 beads of the color we prefer 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.960
 I will make chocolate sponge cake e 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.880
 so I choose between brown sedans 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:02.119
 one two and three 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.450
 then I go to the next row e 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.710
 start putting some of my fan 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.319
 still alternating with my sponge cake 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.450
 so I'll put a chosen white one for 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.200
 the cream but you can choose the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.300
 color you want 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.280
 for example the pink icing again a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:26.319
 chocolate sponge cake then brown 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:31.819
 cream then again I'll put mine 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:34.640
 brown and then again the cream is finished 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.860
 also the second row so the father 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.280
 in the third row the third row will be 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:53.180
 totally of bread will be five and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:55.700
 beads aligned to the other 5 2 4 and 5 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.860
 now to climb we go to the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.819
 next row we put this time 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.900
 a cream in the center but white in the center 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.910
 and then one from this side and another for 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.880
 lina on this side 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.130
 what's missing the icing on the cake 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.950
 in this case I will use a ball 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.630
 red but you can choose one 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.690
 dress her a strawberry and then change 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.090
 color is already done now let's move on to 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.400
 We are hoping for a good ironing phase 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.889
 now our reaction by putting the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.510
 sheet of baking paper over 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.760
 gently 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.690
 we take our our our yes 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.670
 oven 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.299
 put the cake in the oven we take the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:43.670
 our iron and gently 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:48.430
 let's move on to dissolve the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.430
 plastic that will become one 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:05.530
 the scam even a little and school now that 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:09.360
 came from this part of the tour I explain 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.630
 and also warms the part of the surface 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:22.389
 opposite because it must be really well 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:23.860
 sealed and voila look like yes 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.350
 cool a sniper 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:33.750
 and then go and smash it because it remains 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.600
 always a little tina attacks here it does 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.850
 here is our chocolate cream cupcake 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.220
 icing ready and don't bother let's go 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.919
 to apply to ours to ours 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.600
 ferretti in our hair clips this 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:57.040
 passage is very easy we need one 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.700
 hairpin or some glue e 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.550
 I will do our little thing 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.940
 not from the most pixelated part but I like it 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.020
 more the part that is more loose 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.610
 so I'll use it this way then 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.940
 I want you to see the 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.190
 I will use from that is to say in hill rho therefore this 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.820
 part for the wife 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.520
 since mollettina must be put so must 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:33.460
 finish glued on this side e 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:37.419
 so I turn it upside down we take it 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.630
 the glue we put a goccino of glue 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:45.870
 you can do it even with the glue that a 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:49.030
 hot between the third and first second 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.950
 sedan so you also have measures 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:58.210
 then a drop is filled with glue 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:06:00.720
 of glue in these parts so see if 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.669
 third second and first 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.180
 then take your hairpin e 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.199
 you immerse it 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.550
 in the glue so that it is straight 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:16.100
 it will stay straight because it remains 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:19.180
 practically standing thanks to his 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.590
 shape and wait for at least an hour 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.440
 so that the glue dries if instead 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.210
 you are using a few hot glue 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.139
 seconds and you will already have yours 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.139
 ready mollette
