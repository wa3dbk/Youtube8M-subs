00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
dryer run with the door open it's very

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
dryer run with the door open it's very
very<00:00:29.670> important<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.480> make<00:00:30.779> sure<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
very important that you make sure that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.250 
very important that you make sure that
the<00:00:31.500> heat<00:00:31.800> does<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.369> come<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.640> because<00:00:33.270> some

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the heat does not come on because some

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.160 
the heat does not come on because some
people<00:00:34.559> don't<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:36.690> actual

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
people don't know this but the actual

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.830 
people don't know this but the actual
fan<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> dryer<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> exhaust

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
fan for the dryer it's in the exhaust

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.049 
fan for the dryer it's in the exhaust
duct<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> intake<00:00:41.550> duct<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
duct it is not in the intake duct and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.900 
duct it is not in the intake duct and
basically<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.070> door<00:00:44.309> open

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
basically when you have the door open

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.740 
basically when you have the door open
it<00:00:45.200> sucks<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.739> air<00:00:47.010> through<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> door<00:00:47.940> than

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it sucks more air through the door than

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
it sucks more air through the door than
it<00:00:48.899> does<00:00:49.110> through<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.620> intake<00:00:49.920> duct<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it does through the intake duct so as a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.819 
it does through the intake duct so as a
result<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.600> heat<00:00:51.780> source<00:00:52.079> won't<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.680> any

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
result the heat source won't have any

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
result the heat source won't have any
air<00:00:53.309> passing<00:00:53.940> through<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.079> just

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
air passing through it so it's just

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.600 
air passing through it so it's just
going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> keep<00:00:55.590> heating<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.160> heating<00:00:56.370> up

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
going to keep heating up heating up

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.189 
going to keep heating up heating up
again<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> again<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.719> probably

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
again and again and get probably

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
again and again and get probably
overheated<00:00:58.800> granted<00:00:59.550> there<00:00:59.730> are<00:00:59.760> over<00:01:00.239> heat

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
overheated granted there are over heat

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.970 
overheated granted there are over heat
set<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> sensors<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.440> shut<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> dryer

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
set of sensors that you shut the dryer

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.130 
set of sensors that you shut the dryer
off<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.539> good<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.930> better

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
off but you know it's good it's better

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.560 
off but you know it's good it's better
to<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.379> safe<00:01:04.589> than<00:01:04.799> sorry

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
to be safe than sorry

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.830 
to be safe than sorry

there<00:01:11.670> again<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.180> did<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
there again like I did with the with the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
there again like I did with the with the
washing<00:01:14.040> machine<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:16.040> over<00:01:17.040> here<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.610> going

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
washing machine and over here I'm going

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
washing machine and over here I'm going
to<00:01:18.470> turn<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> dial<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.070> fluff<00:01:20.790> air<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.570> in

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to turn the dial to fluff air because in

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.390 
to turn the dial to fluff air because in
that<00:01:22.799> setting<00:01:23.450> that's<00:01:24.450> where<00:01:24.960> um<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.159> heat

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that setting that's where um the heat

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
that setting that's where um the heat
will<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.090> come<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.479> it'll<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.990> be

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
will not will not come on it'll just be

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
will not will not come on it'll just be
just<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> air<00:01:28.890> by<00:01:29.130> itself<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> burner

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
just the air by itself so the burner

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.270 
just the air by itself so the burner
won't<00:01:30.600> ignite<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> shot<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
won't ignite and get a shot of this and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:47.610 
won't ignite and get a shot of this and
here<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.369> go

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.940 

you<00:01:48.620> can<00:01:48.770> see<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.040> tumbles<00:01:49.400> very<00:01:49.700> very<00:01:49.970> well

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.370 

everything's<00:01:54.950> staying<00:01:55.190> in<00:01:55.340> sight<00:01:55.670> mostly<00:01:56.600> so

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
everything's staying in sight mostly so

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.240 
everything's staying in sight mostly so
that's<00:01:57.530> pretty<00:01:57.740> good

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
that's pretty good

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.500 
that's pretty good
a<00:02:00.310> couple<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.369> small<00:02:01.520> towels<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.180> there<00:02:02.270> too

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
a couple of small towels in there too

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.510 
a couple of small towels in there too
but<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:03.170> guess<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:03.860> can't<00:02:04.040> really<00:02:04.190> see<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.490> from

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
but I guess you can't really see it from

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.080 
but I guess you can't really see it from
here

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
here

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.210 
here
and<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:06.410> one's<00:02:06.590> how<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.860> looks<00:02:07.010> like<00:02:07.100> it

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
and that one's how it looks like it

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.570 
and that one's how it looks like it
