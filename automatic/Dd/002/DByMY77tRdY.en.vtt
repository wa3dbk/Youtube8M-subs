00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.450
 nuclear bomb 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.480
 daniel you are going to see you are going to see and I 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.780

 I think there is already I say what was my mistake 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.700
 so this is done with all these with 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.200
 all do not move anything because how do you move 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:31.229
 something all bursts itself 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:31.229

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.909

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.340
 at the same time 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.140

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.769
 to take so far 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.510
 good that you have to see 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.700
 how do I know that the server we just 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.880
 get the server to respond to 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.730
 it seems we have appeared elsewhere 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.100
 where we had done tests not so 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.190
 exaggerated but good 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.350
 we do not know where the explosion was not 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.990
 we know even if the 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.640
 explosion 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.640
