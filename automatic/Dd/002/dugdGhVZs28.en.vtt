 immortals in general toy 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.880
 copy of eternity warriors 3 from the same 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.550
 developer from glu mobile ubiquitous 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 But the character I play as a mage 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.630
 since you drown various meet too 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.760
 played in deputy year in principle there for everything 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.240
 classes played video on this game you 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.140
 can watch on the channel here 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.739
 everything is done just like 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.899
 above game 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.510
 same awards same 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:46.739
 offerings also realized improvement 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.200
 hello bits and generally a complete copy 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.190
 copy of the game apparently the developers decided 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.430
 get some money from your ideas and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.859
 created a clone of eternity warriors 3 like this 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.170
 like that so let's go to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.809
 fight to consider all this 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.330
 thing so go on a mission where else 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.030
 did not play click start this game 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.760
 noteworthy you ask why play and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.970
 copy it on pc if you have eternity 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 values ​​to the fact that there are locations 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.040
 peculiar something made as it were 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.680
 differently other characters other magic 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 and everything is quite spectacular and beautiful 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.290
 let's take a look at bohiku like 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.560
 This is all happening at me here 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.630
 what are the types of enemies here and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:47.310
 can our magician actually destroy 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.710
 and all these opponents from the forest are so 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.780
 Here is interesting magic Itachi bodice then 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.890
 explosion then our character can 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.990
 teleport behind the backs of the enemies then 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 There are blue blink in principle the same 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.759
 as in the wars unscrew the magician was there but 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.620
 It is made a little differently looks 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.570
 respectively 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:11.150
 the animation itself of this teleport itself 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.400
 girlfriend say a lot like this optician to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.460
 throw off or torn and drench 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.060
 their enemies also the magician has not yet 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.490
 ability that strikes around you 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.190
 all opponents that is and left 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:30.200
 attacks and now she’s just me 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.120
 I think useful 33 opponents 4 volatile 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.440
 a bunch of mice let's type it more 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.420
 and use super bob magic game 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 lay me watch all enemies 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.340
 died well of the fight here there are some 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.200
 sighting now we destroy the volatile 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.540
 mouse as well as rubbed the thread wars also stuns 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.390
 probably developers such a thing that 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:00.140
 bats can stun itself 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.930
 when you attack so at the end of the mission 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.080
 there are bosses here too 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.080
 win and pass accordingly 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.170
 Generally the mission is the boss golem 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.170
 very scary and big I don't know I can 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:20.780
 Do I win and since here the pancake is difficult 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:24.310
 all of these destroyed the golem for some reason not 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.140
 especially attacks some kind of passive inspect 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:34.940
 let's throw it still use here 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.340
 so its magic so oh oh oh we take 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.430
 squid 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.430
 daddy i'm here vomit turned on 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.790
 after this blow apparently need 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.610
 attack just here still a chest i think 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:59.030
 that accordingly open and pick up 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:03.550
 all that is there is a woman Colem defeated and 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.830
 we win this mission wonderful 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.230
 as you can see the game is quite spectacular 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.060
 boevka implemented very well but 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:19.970
 the downside of the game is that it 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.709
 just a clone of the already released game doom that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.290
 the developers could not think of what 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.250
 then new i don't even know maybe from 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.710
 for the fact that even hunter 5 came out and they 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.000
 decided to do the same some kind of regulates 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:39.680
 so that people say so pay attention 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.430
 on their projects, too, a bunch of new assignments 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.640
 let's make gifts to the gods like this 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.310
 here but that is the same as 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.420
 mentioned game so here it is us and new 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.860
 helmet appeared and still new boots 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.950
 great now we can go 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.560
 in our inventory to equip it all 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.380
 let's deal with our character 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:09.680
 look so the helmet for some reason I can not 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:12.350
 we can put on level 9 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.740
 and as you can see the look and character changes 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.080
 when you put on it some 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.080
 equipment is simple 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.310
 great in general in all lpg games 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.550
 so it should be so let's improve our 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.150
 the staff is obtained by merging a 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.960
 unnecessary things and so need to say 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:40.979
 We are waiting and ready to unite here such 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.419
 influence as we do, respectively 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:48.139
 the staff rises well and everything is all everything 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.569
 unnecessary things of course we are here 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.910
 quick quick 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:56.639
 phrase them so that they do not clog up with us 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.849
 our inventory and also as you see for 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.039
 to make things boost to new 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.199
 level i mean this development you need 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.729
 Ingredients Ie collect 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.470
 ingredients and can develop 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.740
 a certain thing when she staff me 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.900
 will be 10 and 10 then I can improve it on 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:19.349
 new level it will be two stars already 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:20.389
 the staff that is much cooler here and so 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.099
 and 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.680
 There are a lot of things in this game as well as 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.979
 Internet varius I think this game 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.039
 will find its consumer I 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.259
 I also recommend that you familiarize yourself with it . 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.800
 I think she should like you if 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:40.740
 honestly the guys and this technology varius 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.039
 I like the game much more than 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.130
 even must hunter I do not know here for some reason 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.259
 I got the impression 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.780
 I think so though there is not much 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.400
 such a plot and plot twists but 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.159
 something like that 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.409
 to each his own as they say numbers robot 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:00.180
 gamers liked the game swing it 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.419
