right<00:01:14.530> around<00:01:14.740> there<00:01:15.009> I<00:01:15.880> built<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:16.810> bait

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
right around there I built this bait

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.469 
right around there I built this bait
basically<00:01:17.590> for<00:01:17.799> V<00:01:17.979> waken<00:01:18.399> man<00:01:18.729> those<00:01:19.119> hard<00:01:19.390> to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.950 
using and i think it's going to be a big
big<00:01:39.340> factor<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.060> guys<00:01:40.180> figuring<00:01:40.630> out<00:01:40.750> how

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
big factor in you guys figuring out how

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.200 
big factor in you guys figuring out how
to<00:01:40.990> use<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.409> bait<00:01:41.590> if<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:42.310> see<00:01:42.490> busting<00:01:42.909> fish

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
to use the bait if you see busting fish

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.240 
to use the bait if you see busting fish
it's<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:44.079> no-brainer<00:01:44.289> you<00:01:44.710> want<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.950> throw<00:01:45.130> over

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
it's a no-brainer you want to throw over

this technique in deeper water this year

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.370 
this technique in deeper water this year
it<00:02:39.190> should<00:02:39.580> change<00:02:40.180> once<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.630> water<00:02:40.870> warms<00:02:41.170> up

it should change once the water warms up
the<00:02:41.410> bait<00:02:41.710> fish<00:02:41.920> comes<00:02:42.160> up<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.460> surface<00:02:42.850> but
