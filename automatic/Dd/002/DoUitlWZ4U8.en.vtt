I meditate for about half an hour I feel
that<00:03:20.190> kind<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.819> brings<00:03:21.090> me<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.390> place<00:03:21.690> where

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
that kind of brings me to a place where

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.660 
that kind of brings me to a place where
I<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.170> really<00:03:22.379> focus<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:22.950> exactly<00:03:23.280> what<00:03:23.580> I'm

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
I can really focus on exactly what I'm

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.160 
I can really focus on exactly what I'm
doing

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
doing

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.420 
doing
yeah<00:03:25.170> days<00:03:25.440> here<00:03:25.680> have<00:03:25.860> been<00:03:25.950> long<00:03:26.159> so<00:03:26.310> it's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
yeah days here have been long so it's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.009 
yeah days here have been long so it's
very<00:03:26.519> easy<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:27.060> lose<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.360> focus<00:03:27.510> especially

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
very easy to lose that focus especially

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.360 
very easy to lose that focus especially
when<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.290> 5:00<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.829> morning<00:03:28.890> and

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
your eyes are just like anchors

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.220

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
was like a crazy emotional roller

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.180 
was like a crazy emotional roller
coaster<00:07:24.690> writing<00:07:25.200> the<00:07:25.260> stuff<00:07:25.470> but<00:07:25.650> some<00:07:26.040> days

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.190 
coaster writing the stuff but some days

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.970 
coaster writing the stuff but some days
I<00:07:26.280> hated<00:07:26.490> it<00:07:26.700> some<00:07:26.850> days<00:07:26.970> I<00:07:27.090> loved<00:07:27.330> it<00:07:27.480> you<00:07:27.660> know

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
I hated it some days I loved it you know

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.950 
I hated it some days I loved it you know
but<00:07:28.980> listening<00:07:29.820> back<00:07:30.030> to<00:07:30.210> it<00:07:30.330> now<00:07:30.630> that<00:07:30.840> it's

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
but listening back to it now that it's

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.400 
but listening back to it now that it's
done<00:07:31.550> it's<00:07:32.550> probably<00:07:33.540> one<00:07:33.900> of<00:07:33.930> the<00:07:34.080> best

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.410 
done it's probably one of the best

00:07:34.410 --> 00:08:01.180 
done it's probably one of the best
things<00:07:34.650> I<00:07:34.740> think<00:07:34.800> I've<00:07:35.010> ever<00:07:35.070> done

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.190 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.170 

so<00:08:02.690> that's<00:08:03.690> what<00:08:03.870> stopped
