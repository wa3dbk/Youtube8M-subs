00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.900
 hi guys, I hope you are very well 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.450
 I bring you a new video in which you 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.059
 I will teach to install the gta san andrÃ©s in 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.469
 our android device is a method 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.299
 pretty simple and I hope that you 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.670
 work since it has worked for me 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.580
 pretty well in the rash I was telling him that 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.449
 my device was compatible but not what 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.759
 It is the truth 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.150
 so if you tell them the appstore that is 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.820
 incompatible prevent fear all ok 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.960
 first thing we're going to do is download 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.579
 the archives 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.950
 from the page that I will leave in 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.719
 the description and you can download the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.560
 It sins from the data seen from the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.220
 server that you do not want 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.020
 we can download them from there 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.630
 servers 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.030
 of mega descriptions of any 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.860
 server that is to our liking ok 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.090
 once we have downloaded the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.830
 records 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.830
 we go with the installation 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.760
 to install the game we need to 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:08.260
 minus a device with 512 mb of ram 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.900
 straight up this single core this in 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.420
 forward then having a 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.020
 device with android 2.3 towards signing 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.880
 with 500 leave us and with single core 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.140
 we can cook the game there is not a little 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 reading but we can take it 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.990
 and has downloaded the files we're going to 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.079
 put the android folder 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.530
 data folder and there it must be stuck 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.549
 the files to the can folder 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.950
 and we installed the application once 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.100
 already installed we can be playing the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.860
 very important game is to open the offline 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.350
 without any internet connection because 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.300
 so it does not show us the license or anything 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.830
 although good guys this is all about me 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.479
 part I hope you liked it 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.270
 forget to subscribe I like the 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.720
