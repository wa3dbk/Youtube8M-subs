00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.689
 hello and welcome to the chocolate 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.380
 academy cacao barry with martin us 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.849
 Let's demonstrate 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.129
 four possibilities to give volume 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.989
 to all of your desserts in one 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.510
 first time we will see the little 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.519
 cake then entremet us 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.129
 finish with a verrine and a 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.570
 dessert on the plate with martha us 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.220
 let's see the first application so 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.019
 we filed in the pearl 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.899
 counts other containers and if I 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.019
 just apply a little bit of powder 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.970
 creative 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.989
 but we see a change that will 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.430
 actually allow it simply 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.850
 to have undo the colors 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.129
 then we take a horn we go 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.500
 train on the beaded directly the 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.479
 tempered milk chocolate in fact we're going 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.970
 ending up with a little stick 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.179
 chocolate that will be completely audhuy of 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.369
 pearl gold color and on the other side one 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.619
 will be milk chocolate color we have 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.670
 prepared four small pastries and 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.679
 ice cream is completely and we will add 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.159
 on each cupcake a little 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.610
 bar 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.860
 so we will finish directly with a 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.940
 gold leaf that can be applied 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.319
 directly on the frosting the second 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.000
 application to give volumes to 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.390
 your desserts so a very application 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.190
 simple 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.610
 here is the white chocolate and made your 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.700
 father and I will directly drop him 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.770
 on my plate with the guitar sheet and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.259
 using an elbow paddle and I'm going 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.569
 so thinly spread my white chocolate 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.849
 and proud we will file 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.129
 white vermicelli and then we go 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:56.110
 add silver leaf and all 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:57.580
 this must be done of course before the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.789
 complete crystallization of chocolate 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.660
 so here is the chocolate now 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.580
 crystallized it's been three four minutes 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.020
 we've got them 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.800
 vermicelli and so with the help of a 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:15.459
 rule I'm going to cut out chocolate like 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:17.200
 that and then we'll get this 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.000
 kind of little squares and so we're going to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.920
 dispose of 7 among them but with fruits 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.920
 red which was previously iced and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.650
 I put some red fruits 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.989
 and we can why not add 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.879
 some small silver flakes 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.870
 also evola for our second 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.459
 third app application 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.930
 so here we are going to work with 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.780
 pencil that we simply go 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.120
 cover with alcohol in which we have 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.829
 added powder here are some 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.150
 small glasses to decorate so in these 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.340
 verrines we have a foam at 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.260
 praline almond marc ona we have 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.480
 also an almond biscuit and a 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.489
 passion fruit mousse so here we 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.959
 have the black pencil was taking good 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.359
 pencil the preparation so alcohol is 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.180
 to say 90 grams of alcohol 10 g of 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:12.329
 lightning will allow us to induce very 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.680
 lightly the pencil like this then 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.389
 you let them dry for about 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.769
 3 to 4 minutes 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.480
 so this process will allow us to 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.150
 let the alcohol completely evaporate 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.700
 and therefore may become stuck powder 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.720
 creative on the pen if it's directly 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.840
 so we'll just add 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.060
 pencil to give volume to your 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.699
 verrines and we can well perceive so 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.010
 the off side that will really allow a 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.359
 customizing your life rinne on 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.150
 chocolate 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.889
 and then you're going to have to apply 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.169
 directly the lid of the verrine 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.310
 on the pen so what will allow to see 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.470
 what is inside is at 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.709
 say the red fruits a little bit of bread 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.709
 spices 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.810
 4th application how to bring volume 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.490
 to your desserts with the chocolate grill 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.160
 that to find in the range of 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.380
 sets we will give a lot of volume 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.130
 thanks to our chocolate grill for this 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.600
 dessert on the plate 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.160
 so what we are going to do is that 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.050
 we will help him cut directly to 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.670
 using a cookie cutter when one 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.500
 heat a little cookie cutter I 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.120
 do not press on the fence to avoid 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.220
 to break it 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.290
 and like these using the cutter does 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.459
 take out the form to cut out 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.109
 rectangles we will use a 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.019
 turn knife and the knife is fine 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.930
 hot and there I come to apply it on the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.460
 toasting without forcing again 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.740
 it is better to repeat the operation 2 3 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.370
 time to push at the risk of breaking 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.900
 roasting 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.640
 here is now using the gun 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.710
 we will spray the powder mixture 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.200
 creative off and alcohol so as to 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.420
 embellish our decorations directly 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.010
 just enjoy that alcohol is not 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.770
 still not evaporated to be able to 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.530
 deposit our silver and gold flakes 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.390
 we see well appear so the decor 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.730
 now with the powder to the creative 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.380
 strong and the flakes with philippe he is 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.330
 now time to go up so our 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.050
 yarrow and so we will garnish 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.270
 directly the small foam domes 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.630
 vanilla if it's a vanilla mousse and 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.360
 now we will alternate with 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.490
 our wire that was sprayed and 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.710
 in finishing small fruit pastes 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.510
 raspberry with chocolate stems 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.070
 I will give volume and our 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.800
 toasting circle we're going to 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.840
 drop directly on the sphere with 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.790
 martin we showed you four 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.840
 applications how to give volume to 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.250
 all of your creations 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.110
