next<00:02:14.590> question<00:02:15.540> was<00:02:16.540> from<00:02:16.870> zombies<00:02:17.640> omnomnom

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
next question was from zombies omnomnom

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.690 
next question was from zombies omnomnom
and<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.629> was<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.900> my<00:02:20.230> page<00:02:20.680> says<00:02:21.310> could<00:02:21.610> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and it was on my page says could you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.729 
and it was on my page says could you
possibly<00:02:22.060> make<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.239> video<00:02:22.480> or<00:02:22.840> discuss<00:02:23.590> an

efficient balanced leveling spec my

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.819 
efficient balanced leveling spec my
Mencken<00:02:27.220> was<00:02:27.430> my<00:02:27.579> very<00:02:27.819> first<00:02:28.239> tune<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.079> as

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
Mencken was my very first tune and so as

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.160 
Mencken was my very first tune and so as
I<00:02:30.130> was<00:02:30.160> leveling<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.910> was<00:02:31.269> just<00:02:31.480> putting<00:02:31.750> points

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
I was leveling I was just putting points

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.140 
I was leveling I was just putting points
into<00:02:32.380> things<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:33.010> looked<00:02:33.190> good<00:02:33.489> which

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
into things that looked good which

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.319 
into things that looked good which
wasn't<00:02:35.019> probably<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.829> best<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.280> was<00:02:36.579> questing

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
wasn't probably the best I was questing

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.330 
wasn't probably the best I was questing
with<00:02:37.480> bracket<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.079> so<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:39.040> didn't<00:02:39.310> really

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
with bracket and so it didn't really

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.190 
with bracket and so it didn't really
matter<00:02:39.819> all<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.239> much<00:02:40.599> because<00:02:40.810> things

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
matter all that much because things

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.380 
matter all that much because things
weren't<00:02:41.410> hitting<00:02:41.739> me<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.730> was<00:02:42.910> getting<00:02:43.209> his

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
weren't hitting me and I was getting his

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.800 
weren't hitting me and I was getting his
innervate<00:02:43.840> once<00:02:44.049> we<00:02:44.230> got<00:02:44.379> that<00:02:44.650> talent<00:02:45.579> so<00:02:46.060> I

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
innervate once we got that talent so I

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.990 
innervate once we got that talent so I
would<00:02:47.440> suggest<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.099> go<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.250> resto<00:02:48.760> Ken

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
would suggest that you go to resto Ken

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.390

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.020 
my page a video about stat priority and
gear<00:03:40.810> would<00:03:40.989> be<00:03:41.139> good<00:03:41.349> I'm<00:03:42.250> something<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.940> keep

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
gear would be good I'm something to keep

really<00:03:45.669> and<00:03:45.819> well<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.299> that<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:47.019> way<00:03:47.169> that<00:03:47.380> you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
really and well is that the way that you

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.120 
really and well is that the way that you
gear<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:48.299> dependent<00:03:49.299> on<00:03:49.419> on<00:03:49.900> how<00:03:50.889> you're

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
already geared so what's really

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.210 
already geared so what's really
important<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.620> your

just need to go by stance your first at

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.190 
just need to go by stance your first at
is<00:04:03.160> hit<00:04:03.730> if<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.270> can't<00:04:04.480> hit<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.780> boss<00:04:04.930> it

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
is hit if you can't hit the boss it

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.050 
is hit if you can't hit the boss it
doesn't<00:04:05.470> matter<00:04:05.620> how<00:04:05.980> much<00:04:06.190> dps<00:04:06.520> you<00:04:06.760> can<00:04:06.940> do

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
doesn't matter how much dps you can do

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.450 
doesn't matter how much dps you can do
because<00:04:07.360> if<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.750> can't<00:04:07.930> hit<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.260> with<00:04:08.500> zero<00:04:08.800> so

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
because if you can't hit it with zero so

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.670 
because if you can't hit it with zero so
you<00:04:10.390> want<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:10.660> get<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.930> your<00:04:10.990> hit<00:04:11.230> cap<00:04:11.440> which<00:04:11.650> is

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
you want to get to your hit cap which is

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.670 
you want to get to your hit cap which is
