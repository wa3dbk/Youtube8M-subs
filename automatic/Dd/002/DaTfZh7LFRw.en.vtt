00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
analog stick it's still managed to have

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
analog stick it's still managed to have
less<00:00:22.680> stability<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.449> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
less stability and as you can see that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.080 
less stability and as you can see that
it's<00:00:24.930> got<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.560> little<00:00:25.800> dot<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.970> your

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
onto vehicles once you get it in the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.080 
onto vehicles once you get it in the
right<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.070> quite<00:00:47.370> hard<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.879> used

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
right but it is quite hard to get used

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
right but it is quite hard to get used
to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> stability<00:00:48.629> which<00:00:49.620> Apple<00:00:50.010> they're

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to the stability which Apple they're

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.360 
to the stability which Apple they're
like<00:00:50.280> try<00:00:50.640> showing<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> demonstration<00:00:52.370> if
