00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
were trying to trample steam to it there

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.110 
were trying to trample steam to it there
was<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.080> no<00:02:20.319> way<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.709> getting<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.280> started

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
so many videos and if you think about it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.330 
so many videos and if you think about it
guys<00:02:25.420> there's<00:02:25.810> no<00:02:25.870> reason<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.010> knew<00:02:27.190> this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
guys there's no reason like I knew this

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.710 
guys there's no reason like I knew this
would<00:02:27.520> have<00:02:27.670> been<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.790> real<00:02:28.030> gameplay<00:02:28.300> there's

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
no reason the treyarch or whatever would

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.610 
no reason the treyarch or whatever would
