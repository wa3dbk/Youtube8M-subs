00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
of little diver vehicles this one I

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.049 
of little diver vehicles this one I
think<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> pretty<00:00:58.230> cool<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.550> kind<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
think is pretty cool and you can kind of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.139 
think is pretty cool and you can kind of
adjust<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> little<00:01:01.289> bit<00:01:01.789> kind<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.850> adjust

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
adjust this a little bit kind of adjust

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.329 
adjust this a little bit kind of adjust
the<00:01:03.300> sides<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.500> don't<00:01:05.220> really

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the sides a little bit I don't really

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
the sides a little bit I don't really
know<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.549> you're<00:01:05.820> supposed<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> necessarily

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
know if you're supposed to necessarily

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.100 
know if you're supposed to necessarily
but<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:09.150> there's<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but they do and then there's where the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.469 
but they do and then there's where the
driver<00:01:10.350> would<00:01:10.619> attach<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:12.119> drive<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
driver would attach to to to drive it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.350 
driver would attach to to to drive it
around<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.020> ocean<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.670> here's<00:01:15.150> another

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
around the ocean and then here's another

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.920 
around the ocean and then here's another
little<00:01:15.689> diver<00:01:16.259> vehicle<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.930> fold

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
little diver vehicle and you can fold

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.520 
little diver vehicle and you can fold
that<00:01:19.140> down<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:20.130> lift<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:22.140> put<00:01:22.409> your

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that down or lift that up to put your

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
that down or lift that up to put your
minifigure<00:01:23.070> inside<00:01:23.220> there<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.540> he<00:01:24.810> can

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
minifigure inside there so he can

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.280 
minifigure inside there so he can
explore<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.340> ocean<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.659> adjustable

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
explore the ocean and the adjustable

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
explore the ocean and the adjustable
claws<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.119> adjust

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
claws here that you can you know adjust

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
claws here that you can you know adjust
around<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.280> pick<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.670> up

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
around so that they can pick things up

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.530 
around so that they can pick things up
and<00:01:34.490> then<00:01:35.490> here's<00:01:35.759> another<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.390> one

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
and then here's another little one

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
and then here's another little one
that's<00:01:36.780> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> unique<00:01:37.740> looking<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that's kind of unique looking and I

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.819 
that's kind of unique looking and I
don't<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.990> how<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> figure<00:01:40.619> would

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
don't really see how a figure would

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
don't really see how a figure would
attach<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> unless<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.150> maybe<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
attach to it unless you know maybe you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.149 
attach to it unless you know maybe you
fold<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> down<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.680> attach<00:01:43.950> right

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
fold that down and they attach right

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.670 
fold that down and they attach right
there<00:01:44.399> maybe<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.110> looks<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.320> one

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
there maybe this kind of looks like one

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.370 
there maybe this kind of looks like one
that<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.070> goes<00:01:47.250> by<00:01:47.549> itself<00:01:47.970> maybe<00:01:48.390> along<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that just goes by itself maybe along the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.219 
that just goes by itself maybe along the
ocean<00:01:49.860> floor<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.640> looks<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> camera<00:01:51.420> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
ocean floor this looks like a camera so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
ocean floor this looks like a camera so
I<00:01:52.530> mean<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.759> cool<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
I mean I think it's kind of cool and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
I mean I think it's kind of cool and
then<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.869> also<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.649> little<00:01:55.890> buoy<00:01:56.430> that's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
then we also have a little buoy that's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
then we also have a little buoy that's
so<00:01:57.360> opposed<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.110> floating<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.560> top<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so opposed to be floating on top of the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.480 
so opposed to be floating on top of the
ocean<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> course<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.979> know

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
ocean of course and then here I know

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.459 
ocean of course and then here I know
they<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.380> know

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
they like to have like this is you know

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.069 
they like to have like this is you know
above<00:02:04.920> water<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.610> below<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> me<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
above water and this is below to me it

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
above water and this is below to me it
almost<00:02:07.290> looks<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.580> know<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> before

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
almost looks like you know like a before

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.639 
almost looks like you know like a before
and<00:02:09.539> after<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:10.020> Hut

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and after this Hut

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.650 
and after this Hut
before<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> crash<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.270> after

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
before the crash and after

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.260 
before the crash and after
anyway<00:02:14.130> let's<00:02:15.130> look<00:02:15.310> at<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> boat<00:02:15.790> first

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
anyway let's look at the boat first

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.930 
anyway let's look at the boat first
which<00:02:17.110> i<00:02:17.290> think<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.860> pretty<00:02:18.160> cool<00:02:18.520> looking

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
which i think is a pretty cool looking

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.700 
which i think is a pretty cool looking
boat<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.650> according<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.900> box<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.500> this

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
boat and according to the box on this

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.030 
boat and according to the box on this
set<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.520> boat<00:02:24.910> does<00:02:25.420> float<00:02:25.960> which<00:02:26.830> i<00:02:26.980> think

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
set this boat does float which i think

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.070 
set this boat does float which i think
is<00:02:27.250> pretty<00:02:27.370> cool<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.880> have<00:02:28.240> not<00:02:28.480> tested<00:02:28.810> that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
is pretty cool I have not tested that

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.460 
is pretty cool I have not tested that
out<00:02:29.250> actually<00:02:30.250> but<00:02:30.850> according<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.900> box<00:02:32.140> it

out actually but according to the box it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.250 
out actually but according to the box it
says<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.860> floats<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:34.000> also<00:02:34.240> have<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.930> little

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
really cool and there's a little piece

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.050 
really cool and there's a little piece
that<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.060> turn<00:04:01.360> right<00:04:01.630> there<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.830> raise<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
of this I can get a hold of it in the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.120 
of this I can get a hold of it in the
right<00:04:11.650> spot

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
right spot

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.340 
right spot
there<00:04:12.610> we<00:04:12.700> go<00:04:12.850> you<00:04:13.240> can<00:04:13.450> lift<00:04:13.630> this<00:04:13.810> whole<00:04:14.020> top

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
there we go you can lift this whole top

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.240 
there we go you can lift this whole top
part<00:04:14.740> off<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:16.750> can<00:04:16.989> look<00:04:17.560> inside<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
part off and you can look inside the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.099 
part off and you can look inside the
cabin<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.880> that's<00:04:19.000> how<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.810> can<00:04:19.959> also

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
cabin and that's how you you can also

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.520 
cabin and that's how you you can also
put<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.620> captain<00:04:21.370> inside<00:04:21.790> there<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:23.350> that's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.570 
printed pieces
you<00:04:27.380> know<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.710> they<00:04:28.040> can<00:04:28.250> monitor<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:30.580> go

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
you know that they can monitor and go

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.860 
you know that they can monitor and go
ahead<00:04:31.730> and<00:04:31.880> put<00:04:32.030> this<00:04:32.150> back<00:04:32.360> together<00:04:32.540> and

more<00:04:42.830> minifigures<00:04:43.639> with<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.090> because<00:04:44.900> we

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
more minifigures with this because we

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.190 
more minifigures with this because we
have<00:04:45.290> quite<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.590> few<00:04:45.680> divers<00:04:46.340> we<00:04:47.180> have<00:04:47.389> one

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
have quite a few divers we have one

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.230 
have quite a few divers we have one
right<00:04:48.350> here<00:04:48.740> it's<00:04:48.919> got<00:04:49.190> kind<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.880> looks<00:04:50.060> like<00:04:50.120> a

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
right here it's got kind of looks like a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.960 
right here it's got kind of looks like a
little<00:04:50.540> radio<00:04:50.900> maybe<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.830> he's<00:04:52.639> got<00:04:52.850> his

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
little radio maybe and he's got his

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.510 
little radio maybe and he's got his
little<00:04:53.060> mask<00:04:53.450> there<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:55.540> I<00:04:56.540> think<00:04:57.340> most<00:04:58.340> of

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
little mask there and I think most of

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.690 
little mask there and I think most of
them<00:04:58.669> have<00:04:58.910> pretty<00:04:59.240> much<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.750> same<00:05:00.460> torso<00:05:01.460> and

them have pretty much the same torso and
legs<00:05:02.710> mostly<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.860> difference<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.940> face

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
legs mostly the difference is the face

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.320 
legs mostly the difference is the face
like<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.320> is<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:07.250> female<00:05:07.639> diver<00:05:07.910> that<00:05:08.210> we
