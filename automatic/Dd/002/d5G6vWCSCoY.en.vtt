00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.250 
scratching so why this is important it's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.650 
come off so I mean it's good to have the
dye<00:03:23.370> underneath<00:03:23.819> because<00:03:24.090> when<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
dye underneath because when you have to

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.050 
dye underneath because when you have to
die<00:03:24.780> underneath<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.590> will<00:03:25.829> be<00:03:26.069> still<00:03:26.849> like<00:03:27.030> a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
die underneath it will be still like a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.610 
die underneath it will be still like a
full<00:03:27.419> black<00:03:27.690> color<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:31.049> yeah<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.290> mean<00:03:31.500> if

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
because I did at one time and I got it

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.610 
because I did at one time and I got it
all<00:04:05.760> over<00:04:05.790> my<00:04:06.090> carpet<00:04:06.330> parents<00:04:07.260> were<00:04:07.320> kind<00:04:07.500> of

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
all over my carpet parents were kind of

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.750 
all over my carpet parents were kind of
mad<00:04:07.740> about<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:10.370> have<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.400> be<00:04:11.580> very

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
mad about that so you have to be very

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.740 
mad about that so you have to be very
very<00:04:12.000> careful<00:04:12.240> when<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.630> do<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:14.570> it's<00:04:15.570> kind

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
very careful when you do this it's kind

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.360 
very careful when you do this it's kind
of<00:04:15.780> like<00:04:15.960> it's<00:04:16.320> kind<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.530> like<00:04:16.680> painting<00:04:17.070> but

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
of like it's kind of like painting but

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.400 
of like it's kind of like painting but
to<00:04:17.850> get<00:04:18.000> up<00:04:18.150> really<00:04:18.420> close<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.930> icy<00:04:19.230> soil

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
to get up really close to the icy soil

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.039 
to get up really close to the icy soil
you<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.799> want<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.070> get<00:04:20.489> like<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:21.000> edge<00:04:21.810> of

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
you just want to get like the edge of

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.070 
you just want to get like the edge of
the<00:04:22.140> brush<00:04:22.380> like<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.130> push<00:04:23.370> down

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
the brush like this and just push down

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.610 
the brush like this and just push down
like<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.690> like<00:04:27.900> saying<00:04:28.200> if<00:04:28.410> this

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
like this so this is like saying if this

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.920 
like this so this is like saying if this
sole<00:04:28.860> was<00:04:29.040> on<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.490> course<00:04:29.520> it's<00:04:29.940> off<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.840> I'm

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
sole was on of course it's off that I'm

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.640 
sole was on of course it's off that I'm
just<00:04:31.110> showing<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.410> guys<00:04:31.500> how<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.740> get<00:04:32.010> like<00:04:32.400> it

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
just showing you guys how to get like it

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.450 
just showing you guys how to get like it
closer

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.770 

closer<00:04:38.970> detail<00:04:39.479> into<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:42.330> corners<00:04:42.750> so

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
closer detail into the corners so

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.240 
closer detail into the corners so
something<00:04:43.530> like<00:04:43.560> this

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.200 

that's<00:04:48.250> how<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.430> prevent<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.940> from<00:04:48.970> getting

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
that's how you prevent it from getting

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.130 
that's how you prevent it from getting
on<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.600> icy<00:04:49.960> soles<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:52.360> might<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.990> mean

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
on the icy soles and this might I mean

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.140 
on the icy soles and this might I mean
if<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.350> don't<00:04:53.500> get<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.740> full<00:04:53.950> black<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.820> first

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
if you don't get it full black the first

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.210 
if you don't get it full black the first
layer<00:04:55.420> you<00:04:55.450> could<00:04:55.780> do<00:04:55.930> two<00:04:56.170> layers<00:04:56.350> of<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.740> dye

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
layer you could do two layers of the dye

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.490 
layer you could do two layers of the dye
and<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:58.210> dye<00:04:58.240> usually<00:05:00.360> dries<00:05:01.360> up<00:05:01.630> in<00:05:01.780> about<00:05:02.020> 10

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
and the dye usually dries up in about 10

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.710 
and the dye usually dries up in about 10
minutes<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:02.920> let's<00:05:03.580> say<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:04.180> want<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.420> do<00:05:04.540> two

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
minutes so let's say you want to do two

another coat on and then you could get

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.760 
another coat on and then you could get

I'll paint it the dye is now dries the
last<00:05:19.870> thing<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.200> do<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.380> guess<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.890> start

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
last thing to do I guess and start

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.860 
last thing to do I guess and start
painting<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.940> don't<00:05:22.120> need<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.300> really<00:05:22.540> thick

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
painting you don't need a really thick

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.510 
painting you don't need a really thick
layer<00:05:23.140> of<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.440> paint<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.890> would<00:05:24.010> definitely

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
layer of the paint I would definitely

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.870 
layer of the paint I would definitely
recommend<00:05:24.640> to<00:05:25.060> keep<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:25.600> minimum<00:05:26.880> the

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
recommend to keep it to a minimum the

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.050 
recommend to keep it to a minimum the
less<00:05:28.060> paint<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.420> use<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.780> less<00:05:28.930> likely<00:05:29.350> it

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
less paint you use the less likely it

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.450 
less paint you use the less likely it
will<00:05:31.060> crack<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.440> I<00:05:32.470> mean<00:05:32.740> like<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.010> said<00:05:33.040> just

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
will crack so I mean like I said just

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.190 
will crack so I mean like I said just
keep<00:05:33.640> everything<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.270> minimum<00:05:34.720> as<00:05:34.900> far<00:05:35.080> as

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
keep everything to a minimum as far as

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.130 
keep everything to a minimum as far as
paint<00:05:35.440> goes<00:05:35.650> you<00:05:35.830> could<00:05:35.950> go<00:05:36.070> heavy<00:05:36.310> on<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.580> dye

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
paint goes you could go heavy on the dye

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.080 
paint goes you could go heavy on the dye
but<00:05:38.140> paint<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:39.070> don't<00:05:39.100> want<00:05:39.370> too<00:05:39.580> much<00:05:39.760> of<00:05:39.940> it

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
but paint you don't want too much of it

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.690 
but paint you don't want too much of it
so<00:05:40.360> just<00:05:40.930> use<00:05:41.140> a<00:05:41.170> light<00:05:41.470> coat<00:05:41.770> I<00:05:42.010> think<00:05:42.400> one

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
so just use a light coat I think one

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.620 
so just use a light coat I think one
will<00:05:42.880> do<00:05:43.560> if<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:45.130> guys<00:05:45.280> have<00:05:45.670> to<00:05:46.000> do<00:05:46.120> two<00:05:46.360> then

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
will do if you guys have to do two then

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.390 
will do if you guys have to do two then
you<00:05:46.810> could<00:05:46.960> go<00:05:47.140> for<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:47.560> but<00:05:47.740> like<00:05:48.070> I<00:05:48.160> said<00:05:48.220> I

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
you could go for it but like I said I

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.930 
you could go for it but like I said I
really<00:05:48.790> recommend<00:05:49.300> just<00:05:49.420> using<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:51.700> least

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
really recommend just using the least

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.520 
really recommend just using the least
amount<00:05:52.180> of<00:05:52.330> paint<00:05:52.570> as<00:05:52.780> possible

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
amount of paint as possible

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.350 
amount of paint as possible

paint it real quick like this and you

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.150 
paint it real quick like this and you
let<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:00.520> dry<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:00.820> you<00:06:01.120> have<00:06:01.210> some<00:06:01.450> dirty<00:06:01.630> bread

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160
