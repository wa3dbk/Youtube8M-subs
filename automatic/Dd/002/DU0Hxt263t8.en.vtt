00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
go with something that is easy to digest

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.639 
go with something that is easy to digest
and<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.820> only<00:00:36.120> gets<00:00:36.300> its<00:00:36.510> energy<00:00:36.600> from<00:00:36.870> carbs

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and that only gets its energy from carbs

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.340 
and that only gets its energy from carbs
so<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.460> options<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.520 
which is kind of a newer product the
only<00:01:03.270> carbs<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.170> meant<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
only carbs in there are meant to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980 
only carbs in there are meant to
optimize<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.400> hydration<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.600> also

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
optimize that hydration now you also

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.649 
optimize that hydration now you also
have<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.950> options<00:01:08.159> besides<00:01:08.760> sports<00:01:09.240> drinks
