00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.520
 A) Yes 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.709
 welcome to another delivery of matÃ­as today 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.299
 I want to thank all of that 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.799
 beautiful people from the interior who have 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.470
 sent messages and they follow us to 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.060
 through social media today as 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.560
 I told them in a last installment we're going to 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.749
 be working with projects of 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.999
 goldsmithing as such we will make a ring 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.339
 very nice where we can start 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.900
 weld and it depends on the creativity of 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.179
 each one the pieces that they can achieve 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.739
 for this I invite you to join me 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 to the workshop to start working 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.480
 A) Yes 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.379
 and since in the workshop we are going to start 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.629
 the project today they 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.250
 I want to remember send us the photos of 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.390
 the projects they are doing at home 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.820
 it is very interesting that we can 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.590
 share with all the audience all 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.409
 the beautiful and wonderful projects that 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.560
 are doing at home now we start 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.240
 today we are going to work with a ring is 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.440
 soldering a ring this is going to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.440
 allow you can do 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.549
 infinities of projects in a delivery 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.380
 of future we will make a ring with an arito 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.330
 where you can be twisted 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.940
 beads can give you a pendant is 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.450
 well well versatile now that we're going 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.210
 to do there is a table where it tells us 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.000
 the length of the material that we should 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.610
 have to achieve a measure of ring 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.289
 first we have to know the extent if 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.259
 we 're going to do it for a person 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.509
 We measure the finger with a nanny that is 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.399
 a tool that is used both in 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.649
 the jewelers as in the jewelery houses 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.569
 to know the measure and simply 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.000
 having that measure in this case to 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.209
 we are going to work with a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.700
 measure number 8 then in the table 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.800
 appears the thickness with which we can 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.030
 work well be 2 millimeters a 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.590
 millimeter or 1.6 1.3 and so on 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.479
 we are going down the thickness of the sheet 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.720
 we go then to the number and there 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.850
 we get a measure I promise you 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.380
 as soon as the program comes out 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.510
 information will be published in 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.150
 our facebook page mad program 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.730
 ideas and workshops was the subject in this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.600
 case we are going to work with a ribbon 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.070
 950 silver because it is not 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.620
 completely pure is between 950 and 999 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.410
 let's work with a mean number 8 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.740
 then that gives us approximately with 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.230
 the thickness of the sheet that we have 6.3 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.780
 centimeters most measures 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.020
 that we are going to use in 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.270
 goldsmithing comes in millimeters if 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.390
 you see that one measure is 50 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.850
 millimeters or 63 millimeters simply 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.010
 we know that one centimeter is 10 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.410
 mm then that means 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.140
 let's divide the number in millimeters 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.420
 between 10 to give us the measure in 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.690
 centimeters then we take our 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.220
 bernier 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.690
 and here I am working a little 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.360
 uncomfortable with the press because we are going to 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.300
 need the hour then I will come 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.940
 with the view to see sh sh is measured 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.340
 the 0 not with this end of the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.900
 tool but with the 0 then 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.870
 we put the 0 in 63 that would be 6 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.780
 centimeters and 3 sticks that would be 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.430
 millimeters here we close the bernier and 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.490
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.720
 on our silver strip we put the 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.860
 tool and we mark 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.700
 ok here we have a little hairline 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.770
 now we take our segmented arch 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.390
 that we have it here already mounted in 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.480
 previous deliveries and you should 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.900
 know at this point how the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.540
 arc of segueta the hair sz goes towards 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.879
 us and the teeth down 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.340
 we take a little bit of the candle 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:11.150
 the hair and we're just going to cut 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.150
 our beach strip 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.970
 and we try to make a cut as 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.970
 straight possible 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.620
 and then we have this bit here and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.030
 we already have the exact measurement of the piece 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.730
 that we are going to make the ring 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.890
 number 8 here what we are going to do 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.560
 Now there are many people to do 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.150
 rings there are many ways to do it 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.160
 none is incorrect all is valid 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.170
 as long as the result of 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.530
 work be the same 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:57.210
 we take here with our flat clamp 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:05:00.150
 we take the metal and bring the two 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.210
 look, I'll bring the two 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.790
 ends of the silver or ribbon that 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.370
 we have here 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.570
 I'm flattening if you can not do it with 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.610
 hand 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.750
 you just come take a 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.750
 steel 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:22.160
 We take the hoop and give it a few 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.160
 taps to bring the two pieces together 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.240
 we will be able to do well and notice that the most 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.200
 important when we are doing a 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.420
 ring I want you to do here is that the 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.610
 where slot or the line where 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.380
 communicates one piece with the other should not 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.990
 have light and have to be 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.370
 completely parallel ie 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.950
 remember that in other deliveries 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.960
 previous of more ideas we have 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.120
 to remind them to give them demos of English 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.730
 we have already said sorry that the welding 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.500
 do not fill eggs we have to have the 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.930
 pieces then well aligned so that 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.200
 they can correctly join a 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.210
 way to make a rectification of the 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.270
 Union of the ring is as follows 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.370
 we take our hoop we go to the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.070
 press 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.700
 we open the press and simply 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.930
 we put the hoop 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.930
 well united 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.200
 ok and what we are going to do is take the 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:28.150
 segueta arch and we will pass it as 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.150
 to clean this opening 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.419
 and that we will therefore result 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.419
 a perfect and impeccable union 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.889
 I'm going to take it off let's remove these 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.580
 pieces that really do not help us with 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.580
 this work 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.799
 we leave the press as it comes 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:03.289
 that's some pieces that are put to the 

00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:05.439
 press so that he does not mistreat the work 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.819
 that come as foami or foam rubber 

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:10.930
 so here, just mind right now 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:13.270
 if we do not move our hoop 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:16.000
 and this procedure is going to do 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.100
 so many times it is necessary to remember that 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.199
 when they are working with silver as 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.509
 the material is so expensive any 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.100
 piece or any piece that is on them 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.930
 keep saving what we are going to do 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.240
 a program where we are going to teach you 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.840
 how to recover that material 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.470
 then look here we press very well 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:38.270
 and we have yet to make another 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.670
 there are people you can also 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.070
 do they take the two extremes and you 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.600
 we pass a file on the plane and if you read it 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.550
 rather they unite and they are left 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.710
 perfectly good union 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.100
 then remember let's do it again 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.140
 this procedure and while I'm 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.430
 here 

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.230
 rectifying the union between the two 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.730
 two sheets we're going to a commercial cut and 

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.570
 we're back with more of our 

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.570
 today's project 

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.660
 A) Yes
