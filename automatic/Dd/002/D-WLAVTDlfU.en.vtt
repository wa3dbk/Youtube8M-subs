fact that it does keep the system lubed
up<00:04:07.290> we<00:04:07.560> aren't<00:04:07.769> having<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.130> change<00:04:08.340> antifreeze

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
up we aren't having to change antifreeze

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.800 
up we aren't having to change antifreeze
as<00:04:09.090> much<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:10.790> that's<00:04:11.790> another<00:04:12.060> big<00:04:12.299> advantage

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
as much and that's another big advantage

and a large capacity coin system

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.860 
and a large capacity coin system
it<00:04:21.130> gets<00:04:21.340> very<00:04:21.430> expensive<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.420> change<00:04:22.690> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
antifreeze on a regular basis so with

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
pointing that it all we have to do is do

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.470 
pointing that it all we have to do is do
a<00:04:32.080> pH<00:04:32.380> test<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.580> if<00:04:34.000> we<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.330> add<00:04:34.450> a

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
a pH test on it and if we have to add a

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.950 
a pH test on it and if we have to add a

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
little bit of the product we do and it's

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.140 
little bit of the product we do and it's
