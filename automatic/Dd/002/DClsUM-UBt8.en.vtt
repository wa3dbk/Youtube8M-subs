00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the good side is talking and managing the subway 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.680
 approval of the information 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.740
 I'm here today with isis moreira in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.639
 right dubois how are you 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.560
 It's okay if you introduced who 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.560
 and you, what do you do? 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 I love acting in social media in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.420
 internet and I really enjoy studying 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.290
 role of food for human health 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 the goal as what is the study to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.559
 fantastic intelligence concentration and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.870
 I gave this interview to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.010
 people to talk a little bit more about 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.989
 studies and competition with the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.149
 importance of feeding to study 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.320
 mainly for competition of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.600
 questions on our channel to know about 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 this type of food questioning 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 and the first question that some 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 of the most interesting among them was the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.380
 next what is the type of food that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.810
 Do not sleep after a lot of people thought 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.259
 The boy is sleepy and how is it? 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.270
 in relation to food and do not 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.259
 Sleep, I'm going to leave two regrets here. 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.570
 basic 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.670
 the first is not as much during the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.920
 Breakfast right because if you eat a lot 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 during lunch you will direct the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 blood flow in your stomach it does not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.770
 it will stay in his brain that he is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.290
 right then it's not like another cafe in 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.180
 I will not eat lunch at lunch. 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.990
 starving and wants to eat everything from 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 once 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 avoid passion fruit that we know it gives 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.070
 more sleep and especially one thing that 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.360
 people get beaten is the easy 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.120
 lettuce has some substances that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.190
 induce 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.530
 That's why so many people stay with 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.810
 sleep after lunch avoid overeating 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.950
 carbohydrates really not much mass 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.180
 rice noodles good to avoid this 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.570
 in another question I always found 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.380
 very interesting people generally 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.590
 How much help do you tend to eat more? 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.030
 helping with hunger is bad is bad you 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.070
 does not concentrate can not get a good 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.250
 performance and this sometimes has a 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:27.310
 side and people who are 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.940
 this difficulty is we think of 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.280
 feed our brain glucose and 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.900
 in fact it's not only that 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.420
 of antioxidant vitamins and minerals 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.030
 all this is interesting so we 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.820
 eating sensational 23 16 hours 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.820
 avoidance is avoiding prolonged periods 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.520
 without eating because this is coconut stress and 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.230
 only affect our income and make 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.280
 always balanced meals in 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.020
 carbohydrates 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.730
 we have something called index 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.890
 glycemic index than the rate at which 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.739
 glucose gets into our blood and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.120
 too much glucose at once 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:14.290
 this will make it available then look 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.989
 fruits with nuts for heating 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.820
 of the commission's memory add fibers 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.610
 suddenly a banana with seed 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.250
 Flaxseed Flaxseed Put the 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.440
 egg in breakfast protein and 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.420
 really balanced both in 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.230
 quantity and variety in terms of 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.590
 quality of what you eat very good 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.780
 Now you have a question of mine that I think 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.209
 What a surprise this time. 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.709
 for a long time it was believed that the 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.220
 only way you can get bigger 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.820
 concentration 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.640
 and more performance in your memory 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.700
 would be taking some medicines that 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.310
 are recommended for this is recommended 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.590
 that you use your gift and specific to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.570
 certain diseases but the staff walks 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.460
 making this type of misuse 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.740
 will there be in formula feed 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.470
 magic something that comes close 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.030
 than a similar performance 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.660
 without the person having to use these 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.700
 month 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.650
 there is, because nature 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:32.920
 simply gives us all that people 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:32.920
 You need to improve your focus and concentration 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.270
 they can practically 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.590
 anywhere 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.580
 this opportunity is a mixture of 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.140
 some wells 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.970
 I'll pass the prescription to you now. 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.970
 explain why each ingredient 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.160
 a spoonful of soup and a pinch of 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.240
 Black pepper 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.450
 mixing it all up will not make a 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:19.790
 large amount to use multiple times 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:22.190
 to day a spoon is very small of a 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:30.100
 two tablespoons of one twice a day 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:38.720
 where there are people who put the same 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:42.860
 because it's because quickly but it does not have 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.900
 problem no effort to get this 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.300
 result then but no problem 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.880
 because they can be liked do not like 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.360
 cinnamon is what prevails is more for more 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.580
 strange as it may seem 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.409
 and our antioxidant boundary called 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.050
 concubine that prevents parkinson 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.229
 alzheimer's disease and it works specifically 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.590
 memory and cognition then it helps 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:07.860
 much in the turbine to the person's brain 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.319
 energy shin fight stress 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.120
 on the fifth of the very long time contest 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.939
 stress is at the high level of stress in the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.889
 cinnamon breaks that and energy help 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:19.650
 also ginger he is the last 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.360
 report and energy too much 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.340
 interesting because it helps the person stay 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.789
 sitting the entire day begins the pain in the 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.680
 column and ginger it acts both the pain 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.960
 as much or more success as in the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.789
 energy and black pepper and 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.189
 black t-shirt powdered 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.409
 we will use it only to increase and 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.699
 improve bioavailability absorption 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.279
 of the concubine 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.199
 so you mix it up and use few 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:46.259
 quantities per day actually 4 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.689
 benefit greatly from this mixture 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:52.020
