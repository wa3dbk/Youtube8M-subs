00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
also know is because you're probably

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
also know is because you're probably
going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.649> using<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> program<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
going to be using the program with a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.020 
going to be using the program with a
mouse<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.840> some<00:00:55.230> occasions<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> pen

mouse on some occasions and with a pen

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
mouse on some occasions and with a pen
on<00:00:57.239> other<00:00:57.570> occasions<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.280> using<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
on other occasions as if you're using a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.869 
on other occasions as if you're using a
Wacom<00:01:00.270> tablet<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.219> with<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> pen<00:01:02.550> device

Wacom tablet with a with a pen device

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
Wacom tablet with a with a pen device
then<00:01:03.600> you're<00:01:03.750> probably<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> get

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
then you're probably not going to get

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.890 
then you're probably not going to get
the<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.920> online<00:01:05.460> help<00:01:05.700> popping<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the the online help popping up when you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.840 
the the online help popping up when you
using<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> pen<00:01:07.770> cuz<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> can't<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.640> sort<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
using the pen cuz you can't just sort of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
using the pen cuz you can't just sort of
like<00:01:09.000> position-dependent<00:01:09.600> leave<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> alone

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
like position-dependent leave it alone

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.730 
like position-dependent leave it alone
because<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:10.799> depend<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.250> fall<00:01:11.520> over<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> if

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
because then depend will fall over so if

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.020 
because then depend will fall over so if
you're<00:01:13.920> having<00:01:14.070> trouble<00:01:14.159> trying<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.880> this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you're having trouble trying to get this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
you're having trouble trying to get this
to<00:01:15.210> work<00:01:15.240> basically<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.500> probably<00:01:17.159> need<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to work basically you probably need to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.450 
to work basically you probably need to
swap<00:01:17.610> back<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.680> free<00:01:19.680> button<00:01:19.890> mouse<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
swap back to a free button mouse and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
swap back to a free button mouse and
just<00:01:20.909> position<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.420> cursor<00:01:21.450> over<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.080> let

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
just position your cursor over that let

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
just position your cursor over that let
go<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.400> nice<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> still<00:01:24.180> standing

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
go so it's like nice and still standing

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
go so it's like nice and still standing
still<00:01:24.900> doing<00:01:25.320> nothing<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.009> you're<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.460> line

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
still doing nothing then you're in line

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.660 
still doing nothing then you're in line
how<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.240> pop<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.829> that's<00:01:29.430> enough<00:01:29.640> for

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
how it will pop up and that's enough for

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.090 
how it will pop up and that's enough for
that<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.119> okay<00:01:30.479> um<00:01:30.720> we're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> skip

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
that I think okay um we're going to skip

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.310 
that I think okay um we're going to skip
on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.180> about<00:01:33.360> window<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.170> really

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
on the the about window it's just really

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.980 
on the the about window it's just really
just<00:01:35.189> tell<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.520> who<00:01:36.000> who<00:01:36.479> creates<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
just tell you who who creates the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
just tell you who who creates the
program<00:01:37.380> which<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.590> easy<00:01:37.770> excellent<00:01:38.460> people

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
program which is easy excellent people

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
program which is easy excellent people
down<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.150> front

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
down in front

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.610 
down in front
now<00:01:41.570> let's<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.780> quitting<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.230> program

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
now let's look at quitting the program

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.920 
now let's look at quitting the program
or<00:01:43.920> even<00:01:44.100> though<00:01:44.160> we<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.490> started<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.120> so

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
or even though we just started it and so

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
or even though we just started it and so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
quickly go back to projects I think we

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.580 
quickly go back to projects I think we
really<00:02:06.540> need<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:06.720> cover<00:02:06.870> that<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.320> haven't

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
really need to cover that and we haven't

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.080 
really need to cover that and we haven't
done<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.130> one<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.820> add<00:02:09.060> a
