actual device with a obviously a USB

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260 
actual device with a obviously a USB
port<00:01:34.259> I'd<00:01:34.350> imagine<00:01:35.000> then<00:01:36.000> you've<00:01:36.150> got<00:01:36.240> your

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.569 
port I'd imagine then you've got your
base<00:01:36.509> ports<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.710> either<00:01:37.860> side<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.280> think

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
base ports on the either side I think

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
base ports on the either side I think
you've<00:01:38.670> got<00:01:38.759> some<00:01:38.939> base<00:01:39.210> ports<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:39.810> well<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you've got some base ports as well and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.080 
you've got some base ports as well and
then<00:01:40.860> accessories<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> carrying

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
then accessories you get the carrying

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 
then accessories you get the carrying
case<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> USB<00:01:42.810> power<00:01:43.110> adapter<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> on

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
case a USB power adapter as well and on

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
case a USB power adapter as well and on
the<00:01:45.270> other<00:01:45.360> side<00:01:45.659> there's<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.259> much<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.740> what

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the other side there's not much but what

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.469 
the other side there's not much but what
we<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.360> have

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
we can do is just going to think we have

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240 
we can do is just going to think we have
to<00:01:48.630> actually<00:01:48.780> are<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.799> it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to actually are there we go it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.560 
to actually are there we go it's
basically<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> magnet<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> bottom<00:01:51.450> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
basically a magnet on the bottom so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
basically a magnet on the bottom so
we're<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:51.990> pop<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> open<00:01:52.880> so

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
put the box over there to one side so it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.809 
put the box over there to one side so it
looks<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.840> get<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.019> UK<00:03:07.530> adapter<00:03:08.069> aiu

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
looks like you get a UK adapter aiu

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.550 
looks like you get a UK adapter aiu
adapter<00:03:09.830> there<00:03:10.830> we<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.069> yep<00:03:12.200> just<00:03:13.200> put<00:03:13.380> over

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
adapter there we go yep just put over

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.039 
adapter there we go yep just put over
there<00:03:13.860> then<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.250> get<00:03:14.400> your<00:03:14.430> wall<00:03:15.269> adapter<00:03:15.959> to

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
there then you get your wall adapter to

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.210 
there then you get your wall adapter to
obviously<00:03:16.290> connect<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.860> one<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.099> these

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
obviously connect to the one of these

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.390 
obviously connect to the one of these
sockets<00:03:18.170> then<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.380> your<00:03:19.410> charging<00:03:19.980> cable

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
sockets then you get your charging cable

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.120 
sockets then you get your charging cable
so<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.579> looks<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.209> micro<00:03:22.170> USB<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.950> n

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
so it looks like it's a micro USB to n

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.729 
so it looks like it's a micro USB to n
normal<00:03:23.459> USB<00:03:24.440> then<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.560> get<00:03:25.709> your

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
normal USB then you get your

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.620 
normal USB then you get your
documentation<00:03:26.579> obviously<00:03:27.180> your<00:03:27.269> warranty

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
a charging indicator as well and also

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.690 
a charging indicator as well and also
this<00:04:46.500> works<00:04:47.010> for<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.340> Bluetooth

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
this works for the Bluetooth

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.880 
this works for the Bluetooth
connectivity<00:04:48.210> side<00:04:48.660> of<00:04:48.810> things<00:04:48.900> as<00:04:49.110> well<00:04:49.320> you

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
connectivity side of things as well you

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.770 
connectivity side of things as well you
have<00:04:50.010> your<00:04:50.100> plus<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.670> minus<00:04:51.030> for<00:04:51.210> volume<00:04:51.600> on

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
have your plus and minus for volume on

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.100 
have your plus and minus for volume on
the<00:04:52.470> back<00:04:53.150> doesn't<00:04:54.150> look<00:04:54.210> like<00:04:54.420> comes<00:04:54.720> apart

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
the back doesn't look like comes apart

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.170 
the back doesn't look like comes apart
but<00:04:55.410> underneath<00:04:55.800> this<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.430> think<00:04:56.790> it's<00:04:56.880> just<00:04:56.940> a

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
but underneath this I think it's just a

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.270 
but underneath this I think it's just a
bit<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.080> nice<00:04:58.230> matte<00:04:58.530> finish<00:04:58.890> to<00:04:58.920> give<00:04:59.220> her

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
bit of a nice matte finish to give her
