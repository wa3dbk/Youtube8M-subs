phosphating<00:00:13.740> minutes<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.190> were<00:00:14.370> were

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
phosphating minutes we were were

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.939 
phosphating minutes we were were
probably<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.360> bit<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.599> Tim<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.350> wonder<00:00:16.740> goal

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
probably a bit of Tim and I wonder goal

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.220 
probably a bit of Tim and I wonder goal
really<00:00:17.880> puts<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.480> nil<00:00:18.660> up<00:00:18.810> against<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
really puts the one nil up against the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.840 
really puts the one nil up against the
run<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.410> play<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.830> then<00:00:19.980> from<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> adhan<00:00:20.550> we

a bit of my throat really hotting them
that<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.460> only<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.059> don't<00:00:51.329> want<00:00:51.449> any

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
that was only that I don't want any
player<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.079> never<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.469> created

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
player but we never really created

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
player but we never really created
anything<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.969> were<00:00:54.090> still<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> game

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
anything but we were still in the game

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
anything but we were still in the game
and<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> great<00:00:55.199> free<00:00:55.379> kick<00:00:55.680> from<00:00:55.890> tom<00:00:56.309> n<00:00:56.489> sleep

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and a great free kick from tom n sleep

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.150 
and a great free kick from tom n sleep
put<00:00:57.210> them<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.510> no<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:58.980> there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
put them one no up and then from there

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
put them one no up and then from there
on<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.940> let<00:01:00.329> ourselves<00:01:00.359> doing

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
on I think we just let ourselves doing

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.110 
on I think we just let ourselves doing
and<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.289> should<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.530> done<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> lot<00:01:01.859> beer<00:01:02.120> inc

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and we should have done a lot beer inc

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
and we should have done a lot beer inc
either<00:01:03.300> side<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> half-time<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.470> well

either side of half-time as well

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.050 
either side of half-time as well
obviously<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.400> were<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> two<00:01:05.790> late<00:01:06.030> goals

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
obviously there were the two late goals

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420 
obviously there were the two late goals
at<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> end<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> first<00:01:07.110> half<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.130> to
