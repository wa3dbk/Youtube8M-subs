kept what we thought was the the gold
standard<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.050> front/rear<00:00:19.439> shifting<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.100> then

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
standard in front/rear shifting and then

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.179 
standard in front/rear shifting and then
we<00:00:20.760> added<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.330> ability<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:22.070> upgrade<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
we added this ability to upgrade the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.370 
we added this ability to upgrade the
system<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.880> customize<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> system<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
system to customize the system to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.990 
system to customize the system to
program<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> system<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> really<00:00:26.460> expand<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
program the system to really expand the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.700 
program the system to really expand the
system<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.390> well<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> that's<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> get

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
system as well and that's what you get

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.310 
system as well and that's what you get
with<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> new<00:00:29.099> 9070<00:00:30.060> ytube<00:00:30.599> gives<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
with the new 9070 ytube gives you the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.970 
with the new 9070 ytube gives you the
ability<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.850> customize<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:33.719> shifting<00:00:34.230> setup

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ability to customize your shifting setup

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
ability to customize your shifting setup
you<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:36.030> any<00:00:36.600> number<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:36.989> shifters<00:00:37.530> then

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you can have any number of shifters then

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.979 
you can have any number of shifters then
you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.579> tell<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> system<00:00:39.360> how<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you can actually tell the system how the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.840 
you can actually tell the system how the
shifters<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> work<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.460> function

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
shifters are going to work what function

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.430 
shifters are going to work what function
they're<00:00:42.000> gonna<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.660> then<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.260> add

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
they're gonna have and then we add

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 
they're gonna have and then we add
features<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.610> multi<00:00:45.360> shift<00:00:45.570> where

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
features in there like multi shift where

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
features in there like multi shift where
you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.289> tell<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> system<00:00:47.010> how<00:00:47.670> many<00:00:47.700> gears

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you can tell the system how many gears

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.040 
you can tell the system how many gears
it's<00:00:48.120> gonna<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.420> every<00:00:48.660> time<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.870> hold<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's gonna get every time you hold the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
it's gonna get every time you hold the
button<00:00:49.260> down<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
button down that was really one of the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.670 
button down that was really one of the
big<00:00:51.000> changes<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> comes<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
big changes and when it comes to the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220 
big changes and when it comes to the
hardware<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.270> focused<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.719> when

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
hardware what we really focused on when

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
hardware what we really focused on when
it<00:00:55.320> come<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> derailers<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:57.030> try<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it come to the derailers is we try to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
it come to the derailers is we try to
lose<00:00:57.840> some<00:00:57.870> weight<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.820> reduce<00:00:59.820> some<00:00:59.940> size

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
lose some weight and reduce some size

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
lose some weight and reduce some size
and<00:01:00.660> we've<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.109> been<00:01:01.230> able<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.829> we

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
Tour Poland when we first tested

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.020 
Tour Poland when we first tested
prototypes<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:06.570> SkyTeam<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:08.030> immediately

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
prototypes with SkyTeam they immediately

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.760 
prototypes with SkyTeam they immediately
said<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.660> wanted<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> fastest<00:02:10.379> setting

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
said they all wanted the fastest setting

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
said they all wanted the fastest setting
put<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.430> very<00:02:11.580> fast

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
put it on very fast

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.479 
put it on very fast
and<00:02:12.540> after<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> first<00:02:13.230> stage<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.860> couple<00:02:14.340> of

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
and after the first stage a couple of

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.830 
and after the first stage a couple of
guys<00:02:14.610> came<00:02:14.640> back<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.180> said<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.660> what

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
guys came back and said you know what

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.619 
guys came back and said you know what
maybe<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.920> should<00:02:17.310> pull<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.120> back<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.360> a

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
maybe I should pull it back just a

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.320 
maybe I should pull it back just a
little<00:02:18.660> too<00:02:18.930> fast<00:02:19.170> because<00:02:20.099> it<00:02:20.910> gives<00:02:21.090> me<00:02:21.209> more

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
little too fast because it gives me more

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.449 
little too fast because it gives me more
control<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:22.349> think<00:02:22.860> was<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.040> younger<00:02:23.310> guys

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
control I think was the younger guys

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.960 
control I think was the younger guys
that<00:02:23.489> referred<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> very<00:02:24.390> fast<00:02:25.849> from<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that referred the very fast from the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.479 
that referred the very fast from the
consumer<00:02:27.300> interface<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> battery

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
consumer interface there is a battery

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.610 
consumer interface there is a battery
charger<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.209> if<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.140> an<00:02:31.260> internal

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
charger that if you have an internal

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.440 
charger that if you have an internal
battery<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:32.700> only<00:02:32.940> does<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.090> charge<00:02:33.269> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
battery not only does it charge the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.640 
battery not only does it charge the
battery<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.989> also<00:02:34.110> gives<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
battery but it also gives you the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.699 
battery but it also gives you the
ability<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.430> talk<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.480> software<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.080> we

function the multi ship that we talked

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.190 
function the multi ship that we talked
about<00:02:50.069> earlier<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.690> actually<00:02:51.720> do<00:02:52.019> some

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
about earlier you can actually do some

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.770 
about earlier you can actually do some
derailleur<00:02:52.560> adjustments<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.220> there<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.489> well

weight system and for the new 9070 we

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.970 
weight system and for the new 9070 we
actually<00:03:09.329> were<00:03:09.959> able<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.290> achieve<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.680> lighter

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
actually were able to achieve a lighter

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.229 
actually were able to achieve a lighter
weight<00:03:11.720> for<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.140> electronic<00:03:14.130> system<00:03:14.730> with<00:03:15.120> an

about<00:03:19.560> twenty<00:03:20.370> four<00:03:20.609> grams<00:03:21.389> lighter<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.739> you

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
about twenty four grams lighter if you

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.020 
about twenty four grams lighter if you
go<00:03:22.980> with<00:03:23.100> an<00:03:23.190> internal<00:03:23.519> battery<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.940> the
