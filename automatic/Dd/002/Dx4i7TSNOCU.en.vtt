00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
before but this is pretty much the gist

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.219 
before but this is pretty much the gist
of<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.650> Max<00:00:40.949> Kellerman<00:00:41.250> said<00:00:41.930> shining<00:00:42.930> light

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
on a situation that needs to be brought

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.329 
on a situation that needs to be brought
up<00:00:46.860> more<00:00:47.280> often<00:00:48.150> in<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:49.049> sport<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.830> we

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
up more often in this sport because we

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.670 
up more often in this sport because we
need<00:00:50.519> to<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.790> something<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.360> fighters<00:00:52.290> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
need to do something about fighters that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.549 
need to do something about fighters that
have<00:00:52.739> possibly<00:00:53.339> used<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> peds

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
have possibly used in peds

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.079 
have possibly used in peds
now<00:00:55.559> even<00:00:55.769> though<00:00:56.010> Max<00:00:56.280> Kellerman<00:00:56.519> has<00:00:56.879> been

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
now even though Max Kellerman has been

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.049 
now even though Max Kellerman has been
somewhat<00:00:57.629> hypnotized<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.890> corrupted<00:00:59.879> by

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
somewhat hypnotized and corrupted by

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.689 
somewhat hypnotized and corrupted by
commentators<00:01:00.689> like<00:01:01.049> Jim<00:01:01.350> Lampley<00:01:01.650> and<00:01:02.129> Larry

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
commentators like Jim Lampley and Larry

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.390 
commentators like Jim Lampley and Larry
Merchant<00:01:03.030> every<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.379> he<00:01:04.949> does<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
Merchant every now and then he does the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.550 
Merchant every now and then he does the
right<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:05.850> or<00:01:06.060> he<00:01:06.540> says<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> right<00:01:07.260> thing

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
right thing or he says the right thing

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
right thing or he says the right thing
so<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.430> definitely<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.000> step<00:01:09.270> towards<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
so it's definitely a step towards the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.209 
so it's definitely a step towards the
right<00:01:09.810> direction<00:01:10.020> when<00:01:10.469> you<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.740> someone

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
right direction when you have someone

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.370 
right direction when you have someone
with<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> type<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.820> exposure<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.079> Max

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
with the type of exposure that a Max

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.429 
with the type of exposure that a Max
Kellerman<00:01:13.679> has<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.939> speak<00:01:15.329> on<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> subject<00:01:15.780> like

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
Kellerman has to speak on a subject like

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.830 
Kellerman has to speak on a subject like
this<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> only<00:01:17.579> bad<00:01:17.969> thing<00:01:18.299> about<00:01:18.329> it<00:01:18.719> is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
this not the only bad thing about it is

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
this not the only bad thing about it is
he<00:01:19.320> didn't<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:19.679> on<00:01:19.979> air<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.329> have

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
he didn't do it on air which would have

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.899 
he didn't do it on air which would have
brought<00:01:21.899> even<00:01:22.350> more<00:01:22.649> light<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.729> situation

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

brought even more light to the situation
you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.899> fact<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.259> he<00:01:25.409> did<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.619> after
