me<00:02:09.600> this<00:02:10.320> paper<00:02:10.830> cutter<00:02:11.930> instead<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.020> using<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
me this paper cutter instead of using a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.290 
me this paper cutter instead of using a
an<00:02:13.650> expensive<00:02:14.340> wood<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.730> paper<00:02:14.880> cutter<00:02:15.210> I

an expensive wood and paper cutter I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.120 
an expensive wood and paper cutter I
just<00:02:15.570> used<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.050> inexpensive<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.100> I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
just used this inexpensive one that I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.070 
just used this inexpensive one that I
got<00:02:17.340> at<00:02:17.520> office<00:02:17.880> depot<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.930> like

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
pointing at it a lot I used it for

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.170

cutting straight edges of course on
paper<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.900> used<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.320> use<00:02:25.410> scissors<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:26.040> that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
paper I used to use scissors for that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.370 
paper I used to use scissors for that
but<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.240> has<00:02:27.480> saved<00:02:27.690> me<00:02:27.870> quite<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.140> bit<00:02:28.200> of
