town of 10 guy who made a maze bathe and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.019 
town of 10 guy who made a maze bathe and
it<00:00:27.810> looked<00:00:27.990> awesome<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.670> worked<00:00:29.849> really

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it looked awesome and it worked really

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
it looked awesome and it worked really
well<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.539> I'm<00:00:30.660> actually<00:00:30.810> thinking<00:00:31.289> about

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
well and I'm actually thinking about

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.220 
well and I'm actually thinking about
doing<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:32.969> something<00:00:33.570> because

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
doing one like it or something because

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.549 
doing one like it or something because
it<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.739> looks<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.219> looks<00:00:35.340> amazing<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> I'm

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it just looks it looks amazing so I'm

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.940 
it just looks it looks amazing so I'm
going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> try<00:00:38.010> attempting<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> make<00:00:38.820> one<00:00:39.950> not

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
going to try attempting to make one not

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.369 
going to try attempting to make one not
sure<00:00:41.129> how<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> turn<00:00:41.610> out<00:00:42.379> but

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
sure how it's going to turn out but

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
sure how it's going to turn out but
anyways<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.840> it's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
anyways it's going to be in a way it's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.299 
anyways it's going to be in a way it's
like<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> trophy<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:48.950> farming<00:00:49.950> base<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
like a trophy and a farming base it's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.920 
like a trophy and a farming base it's
probably<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.030> farming<00:00:51.420> base<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
probably more of a farming base but it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
probably more of a farming base but it
could<00:00:52.050> probably<00:00:52.260> still<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.460> work<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
could probably still kind of work as a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.990 
could probably still kind of work as a
trophy<00:00:54.840> base<00:00:55.110> um<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.460> could<00:00:56.640> always<00:00:56.760> move

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
trophy base um and you could always move

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.849 
trophy base um and you could always move
stuff<00:00:57.270> around<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.750> make<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.260> trophy<00:00:58.680> base

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
stuff around to make it a trophy base

00:00:58.859 --> 00:04:01.220 
stuff around to make it a trophy base
but<00:00:59.730> anyways<00:01:00.090> let's<00:01:00.449> start

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.320 
level 9 king level 7 archer queen and
yeah<00:05:27.940> so<00:05:28.270> he's<00:05:28.630> pretty<00:05:28.990> good<00:05:30.000> he<00:05:31.000> has<00:05:31.150> high

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
yeah so he's pretty good he has high

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.180 
yeah so he's pretty good he has high
troops<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:31.960> he<00:05:32.110> only<00:05:32.290> gets<00:05:32.500> fifty<00:05:32.860> percent

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
troops and he only gets fifty percent

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.610 
troops and he only gets fifty percent
yet<00:05:33.520> he<00:05:34.180> still<00:05:34.240> had<00:05:34.630> about<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.870> minute<00:05:35.260> left<00:05:35.440> to

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
yet he still had about a minute left to

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.560 
yet he still had about a minute left to
do<00:05:35.800> more<00:05:36.010> but<00:05:36.280> it's<00:05:36.550> almost<00:05:36.790> as<00:05:37.000> if<00:05:37.030> he<00:05:37.210> stopped

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
do more but it's almost as if he stopped

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.320 
do more but it's almost as if he stopped
I<00:05:37.870> don't<00:05:38.169> know<00:05:38.260> if<00:05:38.350> he<00:05:38.500> wanted<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:38.830> or<00:05:39.250> I<00:05:39.730> don't

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
I don't know if he wanted to or I don't

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
I don't know if he wanted to or I don't
know<00:05:40.390> what<00:05:40.510> happened<00:05:40.840> but<00:05:40.870> I'm<00:05:41.020> pretty<00:05:41.169> sure

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
know what happened but I'm pretty sure

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.290 
know what happened but I'm pretty sure
he<00:05:41.500> could<00:05:41.650> have<00:05:41.770> gotten<00:05:41.919> more<00:05:42.160> he<00:05:42.970> got<00:05:43.120> exactly

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
he could have gotten more he got exactly

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.950 
he could have gotten more he got exactly
fifty<00:05:44.169> percent<00:05:44.500> but<00:05:44.860> i<00:05:44.980> think<00:05:45.430> that<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.669> win

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
fifty percent but i think that the win

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.960 
fifty percent but i think that the win
only<00:05:46.960> six<00:05:47.260> cups<00:05:47.530> that's<00:05:47.919> that's<00:05:48.310> nothing<00:05:48.790> i

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
only six cups that's that's nothing i

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.140 
only six cups that's that's nothing i
really<00:05:49.300> don't<00:05:49.450> care<00:05:49.570> about<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:49.810> um<00:05:51.030> so<00:05:52.030> yeah

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
really don't care about that um so yeah

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.940 
really don't care about that um so yeah
that's<00:05:52.300> basically<00:05:52.510> it<00:05:52.840> i<00:05:53.230> miss<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.800> only

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
that's basically it i miss the only

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.530 
that's basically it i miss the only
replays<00:05:54.250> i<00:05:54.400> got<00:05:54.580> um<00:05:55.080> now<00:05:56.080> off-screen<00:05:57.300> know<00:05:58.300> I

the war base that I that I made

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
the war base that I that I made
off-screen<00:06:48.780> so<00:06:50.430> that's<00:06:51.430> basically<00:06:51.550> gonna<00:06:51.880> be

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
off-screen so that's basically gonna be

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.220 
off-screen so that's basically gonna be
it<00:06:52.090> for<00:06:52.180> this<00:06:52.270> video<00:06:52.450> I<00:06:52.630> hope<00:06:52.930> you<00:06:53.020> guys
