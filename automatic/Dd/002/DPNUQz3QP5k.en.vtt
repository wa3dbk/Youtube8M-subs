00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 Hello, I want to show you a recipe 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:10.370
 let's say guests came to you 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.320
 how to feed them quickly 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.970
 Here is an offer to take the usual 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.769
 champignon checks for their freeze 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.529
 5-10 minutes marinade is ready and there 15 minutes 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.279
 they will stand and you can already fry them 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.399
 grilling and so for a start we take it easy and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.640
 my barrels we clean them and then in half 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.850
 we cut we all cut roaring now 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.789
 add here 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.559
 seasoning take paprika 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.719
 take a black series camera total 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.770
 little by little everything is going on 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.359
 say that adds so and so to ours 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.229
 mushrooms i added sesame black pepper 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.380
 paprika turmeric is now left to add 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.150
 salt and be sure to 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.409
 sunflower oil and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.420
 it all mix well so 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.450
 back again to our mushrooms and so 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.930
 take sprinkle take salt we salt all 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.930
 this case 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:33.270
 Now I take a little oil and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.460
 pour oil without oil 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 fried mushrooms do not semi fry mushrooms 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:50.640
 It will not work and then it is possible and if 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.620
 large mushrooms can be fried on right on 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.450
 skewers if small like me 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:06.690
 then I probably will fry all the same on 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:10.319
 15 minutes 15 20 minutes passed on the grid 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.920
 and to our pickled and 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.950
 we put on coals and fry from two sides on 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.630
 the grid 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 he got the mushrooms on one side toasted 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.860
 and turned them over the other side now not 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.220
 not much fry they will rebel on 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.780
 urgent here so they look our 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.780
