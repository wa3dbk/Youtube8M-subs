Bioshock<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.460> my<00:01:26.700> guess<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
Bioshock that's my guess because the the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.440 
Bioshock that's my guess because the the
game<00:01:28.439> company<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.040> shuddered<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:30.150> closed

the whole company that made Bioshock and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
the whole company that made Bioshock and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
working there anymore so whether or not

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.380

they're<00:01:41.220> gonna<00:01:41.340> make<00:01:41.520> another<00:01:41.729> Bioshock<00:01:42.240> it

doesn't<00:01:42.659> look<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> way

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
doesn't look that way

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.030 
doesn't look that way
so<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> game<00:01:44.220> itself<00:01:44.880> seems<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.689> dead<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so the game itself seems to be dead so I

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.410 
so the game itself seems to be dead so I
don't<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.369> they're<00:01:47.460> gonna<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.090> if

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
don't know if they're gonna you know if

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
don't know if they're gonna you know if
they're<00:01:48.540> gonna<00:01:48.659> make<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> movie<00:01:49.049> read<00:01:49.710> read

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
they're gonna make a movie read read

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
they're gonna make a movie read read
read<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.119> know<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> whole<00:01:52.020> game<00:01:52.229> back

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
read you know get the whole game back

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.170 
read you know get the whole game back
together<00:01:52.829> or<00:01:53.189> something<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.610> company<00:01:54.000> back

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
together or something the company back

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.789 
together or something the company back
together<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.110> far<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.380> movie<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> think

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
together but as far as a movie I think

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.160 
together but as far as a movie I think
it'll<00:01:56.610> probably<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> low<00:01:57.240> way<00:01:57.479> lower<00:01:57.750> budget

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it'll probably be a low way lower budget

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.450 
it'll probably be a low way lower budget
version<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.740> are<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
version if they are going to do it this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.370 
version if they are going to do it this
I'll<00:02:00.270> buy<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.079> they'll<00:02:01.200> eventually

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I'll buy it I think they'll eventually

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.469 
I'll buy it I think they'll eventually
make<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.060> lower<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
make it I do think they will lower the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.459 
make it I do think they will lower the
budget<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.259> they're<00:02:04.350> gonna

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
budget but I don't think they're gonna

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.469 
budget but I don't think they're gonna
go<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.860> low<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.280> may<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.700> sixty<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.329> eighty

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
go that low it may be a sixty to eighty

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.960 
go that low it may be a sixty to eighty
million<00:02:06.840> dollar<00:02:07.140> film<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
million dollar film and I think it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.479 
million dollar film and I think it
depends<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.479> we've<00:02:09.810> always<00:02:09.989> been<00:02:10.200> saying

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
depends on we've always been saying

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.600 
depends on we've always been saying

visuals<00:02:17.750> an<00:02:18.020> interesting<00:02:18.710> narrative<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.400> I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
visuals an interesting narrative so I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.120 
visuals an interesting narrative so I
think<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:20.060> think<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.780> they<00:02:21.410> want<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:21.920> one

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
think I think it they want to do one

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.290 
think I think it they want to do one
they're<00:02:22.340> probably<00:02:22.490> just<00:02:22.640> gonna<00:02:22.790> wait<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.180> see

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
they're probably just gonna wait and see

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.060 
they're probably just gonna wait and see
yeah<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.900> mean<00:02:24.050> I've<00:02:24.200> said<00:02:24.410> for<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.650> long<00:02:24.830> time

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
yeah I mean I've said for a long time

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.770 
yeah I mean I've said for a long time
that<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.550> video<00:02:25.790> game<00:02:25.940> movies<00:02:26.240> suck<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
that all video game movies suck but the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.480 
that all video game movies suck but the
one<00:02:26.990> for<00:02:27.560> very<00:02:27.710> long<00:02:27.860> time<00:02:28.040> before<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.370> knew

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
one for very long time before we knew

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.070 
one for very long time before we knew
Warcraft<00:02:28.910> was<00:02:29.030> gonna<00:02:29.150> be<00:02:29.300> coming<00:02:29.540> out<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:29.810> we

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
Warcraft was gonna be coming out we we

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.900 
Warcraft was gonna be coming out we we
always<00:02:30.350> said<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.560> Bioshock<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.490> one<00:02:31.670> that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
always said that Bioshock is one that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.030 
always said that Bioshock is one that
really<00:02:32.420> does<00:02:32.660> have<00:02:32.900> very<00:02:33.260> rich<00:02:33.680> narrative

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
really does have very rich narrative

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.840 
really does have very rich narrative
possibilities<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.330> way<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:35.810> set<00:02:35.960> up<00:02:36.140> I

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
possibilities the way that it's set up I

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.770 
possibilities the way that it's set up I
disagree<00:02:37.850> with<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.060> about<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.330> fact<00:02:38.570> that

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
disagree with you about the fact that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.900 
disagree with you about the fact that
it'll<00:02:39.050> they'd<00:02:39.350> go<00:02:39.830> down<00:02:39.860> as<00:02:40.190> low<00:02:40.340> as<00:02:40.370> 30<00:02:40.700> I'm

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
it'll they'd go down as low as 30 I'm

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.190 
it'll they'd go down as low as 30 I'm
thinking<00:02:41.240> probably<00:02:41.450> closer<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.870> one<00:02:41.990> hundred

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
thinking probably closer to one hundred

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.420 
thinking probably closer to one hundred
million<00:02:42.350> dollars<00:02:42.710> now<00:02:42.860> they<00:02:43.040> won't<00:02:43.220> do<00:02:43.310> one

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
million dollars now they won't do one

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.460 
million dollars now they won't do one
hundred<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.700> sixty<00:02:44.210> million<00:02:44.390> dollars<00:02:44.870> but<00:02:45.440> I

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
hundred and sixty million dollars but I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.570 
hundred and sixty million dollars but I
believe<00:02:45.770> they<00:02:45.860> could<00:02:46.010> go<00:02:46.070> something<00:02:46.280> for<00:02:46.490> one

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
believe they could go something for one

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.980 
believe they could go something for one
hundred<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.240> do<00:02:47.300> believe<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.810> will

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
hundred and I do believe this will

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.540 
hundred and I do believe this will
eventually<00:02:48.470> happen<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.890> gotta<00:02:49.250> buy<00:02:49.490> the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
eventually happen I gotta buy the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.670 
eventually happen I gotta buy the
concept<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.300> will<00:02:50.480> happen<00:02:50.690> how<00:02:51.050> soon<00:02:51.380> I

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
concept that it will happen how soon I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.710 
concept that it will happen how soon I
think<00:02:52.010> dennis<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.580> absolutely<00:02:53.090> right<00:02:53.240> I<00:02:53.480> think
