00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.200
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.900
 It is Suga of Kashimura Radio. 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.280
 How is it today! Jean! The display of the not for sale VAIO Z Canvas has come 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.080
 Then open the outside box you want to open immediately 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.410
 The finger is coming in. Are you happy? nothing 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.109
 It's in the bag, it's out! Jean! box 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.740
 It is a box with a porch mat tone 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.859
 You can open it now! 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.870
 Hooray. It was done! Good luck 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.969
 It is a good weight, there is a sense of luxury 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.889
 At first I put the main body a little and it is the same as before 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.220
 Hole for finger 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.760
 Sock lick on cockroach hoi hoi 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 Become like a dropper 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.109
 When I open the lid, it is this keyboard 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.089
 When the bottom is opened again, it takes in a stylus and others. 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.159
 When you open the front 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.660
 Stylus holder AC adapter 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890
 AC power stylus grip 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.100
 It was already empty, let's go a little diagonally here 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.680
 It has become 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.580
 The stylus also contains a refill 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.060
 Battery is included, too 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.040
 AAAA type with 4 A 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.960
 It's a thin battery, so it doesn't sell well 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.890
 You should buy it for spare 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.560
 The plus is below and it is turning 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.100
 Logo is VAIO Oops keyboard 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.939
 It's thin but it's stiff and tough 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.679
 Yes, then finally VAIO Z Canvas 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.220
 Porridge 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.100
 Oh yeah 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.040
 It is good, isn't it? 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.140
 A little bit I now have a nice texture that the eyelids stood 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.940
 You can see if you have it 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.080
 It is not a thin computer just like the main unit 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.970
 Because performance is important this time 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.560
 How about a computer thinner than this 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.650
 It is not a story 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.780
 In this topic of this hinge (free style stand) 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.120
 Let's do it for a moment 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.800
 This is strange but it is quite hard 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400
 I will not fall over even if I touch it with a pen 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.819
 If you beat it a little harder 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.700
 I'm going to stop, I'm going to wake up 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.659
 The stand will be left properly 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.450
 I'm stopping when I press it to go up when I raise it 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.640
 Great cam and oil damper 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.150
 It seems that we are devising, but it is the last to say 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.879
 The end comes in with the ston, like a car door 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.930
 I don't think it's a snap, but it takes a lot of tension 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.689
 Enter with stoning so that the end does not go 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.209
 It seems that I was stuck here with the keyboard 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.720
 It's like this because it is attached with a magnet 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.750
 If you get used to it, I will do it. 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.659
 It's amazing, I guess this part is wireless 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.519
 As one of the very lively usage 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.689
 While doing keyboard shortcuts with your left hand 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.379
 The right hand is like a pen and tablet 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.079
 I will go there 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.299
 I'm stuck perfectly 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.280
 It's too late if you stick petatsu like this 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.239
 When carrying it stuck 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.790
 I'm not going to bring 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.779
 VAIO Z Canvas at Sony Shop Kashimura Radio 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.179
 Dondon is on display 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.120
 I want
