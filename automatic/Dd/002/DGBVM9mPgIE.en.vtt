00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.430
 It's from Ikea and it cost me ten euros 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.570
 a lot of time behind this mirror and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.160
 The truth is that I love it because 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.710
 self that as well as more feminine in the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.629
 room and then also and it remains me 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 I bought a bedside table that also 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.320
 I really wanted to she is leaving 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.710
 forty-nine euros and then neither that I 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.260
 I bought candles from here that are from 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.780

 communicate with you so that you are 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.919

 so I'm going to keep doing them but 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.229
 There are not many that you tell me 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.400
 because otherwise it would never end and that 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.020
 remember that you can follow me in all 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.919
