varnish chips or paint chips and your

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.680 
varnish chips or paint chips and your
food<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.989> unfinished<00:00:33.989> wood<00:00:34.350> equals<00:00:35.690> bacteria

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
food so unfinished wood equals bacteria

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and mold and things like that can grow

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
and mold and things like that can grow
in<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.390> especially<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:40.140> raw<00:00:40.379> meat<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
in it especially from raw meat and

in it especially from raw meat and
things<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:43.200> much<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.840> use

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
things like that so as much as I use

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.869
