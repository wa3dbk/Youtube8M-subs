00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
the passenger diesel and now in my

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.440 
the passenger diesel and now in my
opinion<00:03:18.709> well<00:03:19.709> okay<00:03:20.070> maybe<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.430> see<00:03:20.670> my<00:03:20.880> part

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
of my opinion but my opinion is this

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.280 
of my opinion but my opinion is this
Daisy<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> big<00:03:26.370> jerk<00:03:27.440> time<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:30.290> not

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
Daisy is just the big jerk time and not

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.360 
Daisy is just the big jerk time and not
only<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.650> she<00:03:32.690> only<00:03:33.690> cares<00:03:34.470> about<00:03:34.620> herself

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
only that she only cares about herself

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.020 
only that she only cares about herself
and<00:03:35.720> in<00:03:36.720> whatever<00:03:37.380> what<00:03:37.950> did<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.490> slap<00:03:38.820> some

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
and in whatever what did you slap some

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.080 
and in whatever what did you slap some
sense<00:03:39.300> into<00:03:39.510> Daisy<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:40.170> full<00:03:41.160> main<00:03:41.430> champion

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
sense into Daisy a full main champion

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.300 
sense into Daisy a full main champion
and<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.930> think<00:03:43.170> Toby's<00:03:43.590> better<00:03:43.860> than<00:03:44.070> Daisy

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
and I think Toby's better than Daisy

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.240 
and I think Toby's better than Daisy
really<00:03:45.230> someone<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:46.470> slaps<00:03:46.830> me<00:03:46.950> some<00:03:47.130> dinner
