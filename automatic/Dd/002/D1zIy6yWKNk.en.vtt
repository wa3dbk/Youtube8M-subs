00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
watch that up there and I was really

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.820

happy<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.690> month<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.199> then

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
happy with it for about a month and then

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.070 
happy with it for about a month and then
it<00:00:19.949> broke<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.460> then<00:00:21.029> jawbone<00:00:21.539> gave<00:00:21.720> me<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it broke and then jawbone gave me a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.160 
it broke and then jawbone gave me a
replacement<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.980> then<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.670> one<00:00:23.910> broke<00:00:24.240> i'd

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
replacement and then that one broke i'd

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.300 
replacement and then that one broke i'd
wait<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> week<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> half<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.160> i

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
wait like a week and a half because i

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.500 
wait like a week and a half because i
think<00:00:26.369> they<00:00:26.519> were<00:00:26.580> trying<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.910> repair<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> one

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that didn't work and then so that i got

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.659 
that didn't work and then so that i got
a<00:00:30.179> third<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.189> this

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a third one which is this one and this

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.120 
a third one which is this one and this
one<00:00:32.730> didn't<00:00:33.329> work<00:00:33.480> when<00:00:33.719> they<00:00:33.840> sent<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
one didn't work when they sent it and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
one didn't work when they sent it and
that<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.610> within<00:00:35.790> about<00:00:35.969> three<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.510> four

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that was all within about three or four

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
that was all within about three or four
months<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.290> i<00:00:37.320> gave<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.010> they're<00:00:38.730> right

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
months so i gave up and they're right

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.610 
months so i gave up and they're right
about<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.210> time<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> fitbit<00:00:39.930> flex<00:00:40.079> came<00:00:40.440> out

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
about that time the fitbit flex came out

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.150 
about that time the fitbit flex came out
showed<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> mail<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.260> honestly<00:00:43.260> way

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
showed up in the mail and honestly way

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.209 
showed up in the mail and honestly way
better<00:00:44.460> than<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> jawbone<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.129> some<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
better than the jawbone up and some of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.410 
better than the jawbone up and some of
the<00:00:47.340> problems<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.789> i<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> jaw

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the problems that i have with the jaw

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
the problems that i have with the jaw
bone<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> didn't<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
bone up that I didn't like it's just the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.270 
bone up that I didn't like it's just the
way<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.280> fit<00:00:50.640> you'll<00:00:51.629> notice<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
way that it fit you'll notice that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.709 
way that it fit you'll notice that
obviously<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.610> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> molded<00:00:54.390> fit

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
obviously it's just kind of a molded fit

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.709 
obviously it's just kind of a molded fit
maybe<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.800> size<00:00:56.039> fits<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.600> know

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
maybe a one size fits all and you know

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.240 
maybe a one size fits all and you know
it<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.960> doesn't<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.440> fit<00:00:58.859> very<00:00:59.160> well

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it just doesn't really fit very well

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
it just doesn't really fit very well
i'll<00:00:59.879> show<00:01:00.059> some<00:01:00.090> close-ups<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.050> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
i'll show some close-ups but I just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.200 
i'll show some close-ups but I just
don't<00:01:01.680> love<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.219> fact<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> jawbone<00:01:03.090> up

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
don't love the fact that the jawbone up

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.630 
don't love the fact that the jawbone up
kind<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> sticks<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.199> bit<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
kind of sticks out a little bit it the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
kind of sticks out a little bit it the
squared<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.479> ends<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.260> pretty

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
squared off ends are pretty

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
squared off ends are pretty
uncomfortable<00:01:07.860> especially<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.790> hit

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
uncomfortable especially if you like hit

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
uncomfortable especially if you like hit

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
like running or playing a sport and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.850 
like running or playing a sport and
someone<00:01:17.130> hits<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.210> molded<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.740> know

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
someone hits it this molded you know

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
someone hits it this molded you know
design<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.670> falls<00:01:20.970> off<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.360> wrist<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
design just falls off your wrist and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
design just falls off your wrist and
when<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.200> play<00:01:22.380> basketball<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.979> had<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> tie<00:01:23.490> this

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
when I play basketball I had to tie this

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.789 
when I play basketball I had to tie this
through<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.119> shoes<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.409> still<00:01:25.590> wear<00:01:25.740> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
through my shoes so I can still wear it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.649 
through my shoes so I can still wear it
because<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.759> many<00:01:26.850> times<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> would<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.420> fly

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
because so many times it would just fly

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
because so many times it would just fly
off<00:01:27.689> my<00:01:27.990> risk<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> fits<00:01:28.920> tight<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.460> if

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
off my risk and it fits tight but if

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
off my risk and it fits tight but if
someone<00:01:29.729> hits<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.360> comes<00:01:30.600> off<00:01:30.890> unlike<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
someone hits it it comes off unlike the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.069 
someone hits it it comes off unlike the
Fitbit<00:01:32.460> flex<00:01:32.579> which<00:01:33.270> has<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.689> awesome

design feature but it

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.680 
design feature but it
really<00:02:14.640> stinks<00:02:14.940> having<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.270> take<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.570> off

trying to sync it up the Fitbit you
don't<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.180> anything<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.050> leave

don't have to do anything you just leave
it<00:02:22.380> on<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.310> bust<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:23.640> your<00:02:23.730> iPhone<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.840> open

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
it on you bust out your iPhone you open

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.010 
it on you bust out your iPhone you open
up<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> Fitbit<00:02:26.010> app<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.030> sinks<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.870> like

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
up the Fitbit app and it sinks just like

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.770 
up the Fitbit app and it sinks just like
that<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.470> sinks<00:02:28.770> right<00:02:28.800> over<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.820> bluetooth<00:02:30.480> or

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that it sinks right over a bluetooth or

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.690 
that it sinks right over a bluetooth or
whatever<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> technology<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.890> I'm<00:02:32.340> guessing

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
whatever the technology is I'm guessing

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.940 
whatever the technology is I'm guessing
it's<00:02:32.850> Bluetooth<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:34.140> it'll<00:02:34.380> sink<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:34.830> of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it's Bluetooth and it'll sink all of

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.290 
it's Bluetooth and it'll sink all of
your<00:02:35.040> progress<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.700> look<00:02:35.850> at<00:02:35.970> my<00:02:36.060> progress

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.400 
tell you that out of my 10,000 steps
which<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> same<00:02:42.570> goal<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> had<00:02:43.170> with<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
which is the same goal I had with the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.220 
which is the same goal I had with the
jawbone<00:02:44.120> we're<00:02:45.120> updating<00:02:45.300> here<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:46.140> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
jawbone we're updating here because I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.330 
jawbone we're updating here because I
haven't<00:02:46.380> updated<00:02:46.740> actually<00:02:47.070> since<00:02:47.250> I

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
haven't updated actually since I

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.680 
haven't updated actually since I
traveled<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.760> past<00:02:48.000> couple<00:02:48.210> days<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
traveled in the past couple days so it's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.230 
traveled in the past couple days so it's
probably<00:02:49.040> we've<00:02:50.040> got<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.370> five<00:02:50.670> days<00:02:51.000> of

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
probably we've got like five days of

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.650 
probably we've got like five days of
data<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.280> will<00:02:53.910> say<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> UI<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
data but the I will say the UI on the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.590 
data but the I will say the UI on the
app<00:02:54.810> while<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.170> loads<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.970> as<00:02:57.210> good<00:02:57.420> as

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
app while it loads is just as good as

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.330 
app while it loads is just as good as
the<00:02:57.720> job<00:02:57.930> but<00:02:58.080> i<00:02:58.170> think<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.410> jawbone<00:02:58.860> may<00:02:59.100> have

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the job but i think the jawbone may have

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.100 
the job but i think the jawbone may have
the<00:02:59.490> upper<00:02:59.520> hand<00:02:59.790> as<00:03:00.240> far<00:03:00.420> as<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.690> i<00:03:00.720> goes

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
the upper hand as far as you i goes

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.280 
the upper hand as far as you i goes
compared<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.770> flex<00:03:02.040> or<00:03:02.730> four<00:03:02.940> Fitbit<00:03:03.330> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
compared to the flex or four Fitbit it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.710 
compared to the flex or four Fitbit it
not<00:03:04.590> necessarily<00:03:05.370> extremely<00:03:06.030> different<00:03:06.240> just

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
not necessarily extremely different just

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.810 
not necessarily extremely different just
different<00:03:07.320> looking<00:03:07.590> some<00:03:08.310> people<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
different looking some people like the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820 
different looking some people like the
jaw<00:03:08.970> bone<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.330> people<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.540> Fitbit<00:03:09.840> i<00:03:10.170> would

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
jaw bone so people like Fitbit i would

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.770 
jaw bone so people like Fitbit i would
probably<00:03:11.220> prefer<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.610> UI<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.330> jawbone

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
probably prefer the UI of the jawbone

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.950 
probably prefer the UI of the jawbone
app<00:03:13.520> but<00:03:14.520> for<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.880> sake<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.540> one<00:03:15.750> still

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
app but for the sake of this one still

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.810 
app but for the sake of this one still
looks<00:03:16.170> great<00:03:16.320> i<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:17.010> still<00:03:17.160> update<00:03:17.310> my<00:03:17.580> goals

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820

really quickly I can still see my

really quickly I can still see my
distance<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.220> I've<00:03:20.310> gone<00:03:20.430> calories<00:03:21.030> I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
distance that I've gone calories I

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.360 
distance that I've gone calories I
burned<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:22.050> input<00:03:22.260> different<00:03:22.830> workouts<00:03:23.160> if

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
burned I can input different workouts if

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.370 
burned I can input different workouts if
it<00:03:23.490> doesn't<00:03:23.820> necessarily<00:03:24.450> pick<00:03:25.050> up<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
it doesn't necessarily pick up on the

it doesn't necessarily pick up on the
workout<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.890> did<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.340> fighting<00:03:26.580> a

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
workout that I did like fighting a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.610 
workout that I did like fighting a
weight<00:03:26.790> training<00:03:26.970> workout<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:28.380> not<00:03:28.500> going

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
weight training workout it's not going

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.350 
weight training workout it's not going
to<00:03:28.710> count<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.190> know<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.760> normal<00:03:30.030> amount<00:03:30.150> of

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
to count you know the normal amount of

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.910 
to count you know the normal amount of
steps<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.840> would<00:03:31.050> do<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:31.350> now<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.740> did

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
steps that you would do but now I did

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.350 
steps that you would do but now I did
that<00:03:32.040> neither<00:03:32.310> did<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.610> jawbone<00:03:33.030> they're

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
that neither did the jawbone they're

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.750 
that neither did the jawbone they're
very<00:03:33.690> much<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.860> same<00:03:35.100> when<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.430> comes<00:03:35.610> to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
very much the same when it comes to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.270 
very much the same when it comes to
calculating<00:03:36.210> steps<00:03:36.570> I've<00:03:36.930> noticed<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.590> when

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
calculating steps I've noticed that when

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.710 
calculating steps I've noticed that when
I<00:03:38.310> would<00:03:38.490> do<00:03:38.610> like<00:03:38.880> my<00:03:39.030> incline<00:03:39.420> treadmill

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I would do like my incline treadmill

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.440 
I would do like my incline treadmill
workout<00:03:40.320> it's<00:03:40.950> pretty<00:03:41.310> much<00:03:41.490> tracking<00:03:42.030> almost

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
workout it's pretty much tracking almost

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.050 
workout it's pretty much tracking almost
the<00:03:42.630> exact<00:03:43.080> same<00:03:43.200> amount<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.740> steps<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.550> no

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the exact same amount of steps so no

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.450 
the exact same amount of steps so no
real<00:03:45.240> difference<00:03:45.420> is<00:03:45.750> there<00:03:45.900> which<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.110> nice

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
real difference is there which is nice

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.040 
real difference is there which is nice
and<00:03:47.460> this<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.790> still<00:03:47.970> syncing<00:03:48.210> but<00:03:48.510> anyway

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
and this is still syncing but anyway

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.120 
and this is still syncing but anyway
I'll<00:03:49.140> show<00:03:49.320> some<00:03:49.500> pictures<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:49.890> while

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
I'll show some pictures of that while

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.260 
I'll show some pictures of that while

I've been talking and you can see what
it<00:03:51.390> looks<00:03:51.420> like<00:03:51.720> but<00:03:52.290> i<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:52.740> say<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:52.950> just

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
it looks like but i will say that just

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.730 
it looks like but i will say that just
overall<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.570> biggest<00:03:54.990> thing<00:03:55.170> for<00:03:55.200> me<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.650> the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
overall the biggest thing for me is the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.860 
overall the biggest thing for me is the
Fitbit<00:03:56.190> flex<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.700> don't<00:03:57.240> feel<00:03:57.510> like<00:03:57.690> I'm

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
Fitbit flex I don't feel like I'm

wearing<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.410> which<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> big<00:03:59.610> plus<00:03:59.760> for<00:03:59.850> me

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
wearing it which is a big plus for me

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.400 
wearing it which is a big plus for me
you<00:04:00.270> know<00:04:00.300> when<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.540> was<00:04:00.600> wearing<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.020> jawbone

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.720 
I always knew that it was on my wrist I
could<00:04:04.110> always<00:04:04.290> feel<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.710> it<00:04:05.250> would<00:04:05.370> bother<00:04:05.490> me

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
could always feel it it would bother me

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.040 
could always feel it it would bother me
I'd<00:04:05.910> have<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.150> move<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.450> around<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.750> little<00:04:06.780> bit

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
I'd have to move it around a little bit

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.720 
I'd have to move it around a little bit
it's<00:04:07.440> well<00:04:07.710> constructed<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.370> mean<00:04:08.490> it<00:04:08.580> feels

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
it's well constructed I mean it feels

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.940 
it's well constructed I mean it feels
like<00:04:09.030> very<00:04:09.420> similar<00:04:09.900> plastic<00:04:10.500> on<00:04:10.680> both<00:04:10.920> of

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
submerge it in water that you probably

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.230 
submerge it in water that you probably
shouldn't<00:06:05.220> do<00:06:05.310> that<00:06:05.460> but<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.880> way<00:06:05.970> that<00:06:06.060> it's

designed<00:06:06.599> it<00:06:06.780> doesn't<00:06:07.289> mess<00:06:07.409> with<00:06:07.440> it<00:06:07.650> didn't

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
designed it doesn't mess with it didn't

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.620

hurt<00:06:08.099> it<00:06:08.190> at<00:06:08.340> all<00:06:08.460> I'm<00:06:08.699> pretty<00:06:09.300> sure<00:06:09.479> the

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
think they tell you not to do that so

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.589 
think they tell you not to do that so
