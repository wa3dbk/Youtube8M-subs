southeast coast though the Avalon
Peninsula<00:00:15.990> pretty<00:00:16.990> fantastic<00:00:17.260> place<00:00:17.830> for

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
Peninsula pretty fantastic place for

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.590 
Peninsula pretty fantastic place for
fossils<00:00:18.550> so<00:00:18.730> we're<00:00:18.850> just<00:00:18.880> gonna<00:00:19.150> take<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.449> look

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
fossils so we're just gonna take a look

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.370 
fossils so we're just gonna take a look
around<00:00:21.360> not<00:00:22.360> only<00:00:22.390> across<00:00:22.869> the<00:00:22.990> country<00:00:23.140> but

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.540 

and<00:00:27.380> there's<00:00:27.590> no<00:00:27.949> way<00:00:28.070> out<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:29.890> is<00:00:30.890> mistaken

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
and there's no way out this is mistaken

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.510 
and there's no way out this is mistaken
point<00:00:36.670> better<00:00:37.670> wind<00:00:37.970> and<00:00:38.150> rain<00:00:38.329> focus<00:00:38.720> on

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
point better wind and rain focus on

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.890 
point better wind and rain focus on
walking<00:00:40.520> out<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.670> mistake<00:00:41.090> point<00:00:41.510> because<00:00:41.750> it

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
walking out a mistake point because it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:55.810 
walking out a mistake point because it
is<00:00:43.000> cool<00:00:44.000> here<00:00:44.420> today

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820

sort of lay on the on the surface of the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.200 
sort of lay on the on the surface of the
sediment<00:01:02.960> they<00:01:03.080> think<00:01:03.410> with<00:01:03.710> with<00:01:04.040> little

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
sediment they think with with little

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.400 
sediment they think with with little
branches<00:01:05.210> coming<00:01:05.510> up<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:05.930> again<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.260> have

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
branches coming up and again you have

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.130 
branches coming up and again you have
these<00:01:06.590> little<00:01:07.390> like<00:01:08.390> elements<00:01:08.990> that

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
these little like elements that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.330 
these little like elements that
presumably<00:01:09.740> were<00:01:09.950> absorbing<00:01:10.520> nutrients<00:01:11.060> so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
presumably were absorbing nutrients so

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.160 
presumably were absorbing nutrients so

booties<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:16.400> said<00:01:16.670> if<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.910> were<00:01:17.030> in

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
booties we said if you were in

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.180 
booties we said if you were in
versailles<00:01:18.140> you'd<00:01:18.380> had<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.650> wear<00:01:18.830> these<00:01:18.979> on

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
versailles you'd had to wear these on

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.080 
versailles you'd had to wear these on
your<00:01:19.310> feet<00:01:19.550> to<00:01:19.700> go<00:01:19.820> into<00:01:20.060> certain<00:01:20.620> rooms<00:01:22.090> those

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
your feet to go into certain rooms those

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.580 
your feet to go into certain rooms those
ones<00:01:23.330> are<00:01:23.479> not<00:01:23.570> 560<00:01:24.500> million<00:01:24.710> years<00:01:24.950> old<00:01:25.160> 560

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
ones are not 560 million years old 560

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.800 
ones are not 560 million years old 560
565<00:01:27.610> 565<00:01:28.610> five<00:01:29.420> million<00:01:29.690> more

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.040 

so<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.530> is<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.710> d<00:01:33.950> surface<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.820> it's<00:01:35.630> not<00:01:35.900> as

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
so this is a d surface and it's not as

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.680 
so this is a d surface and it's not as
well<00:01:36.229> preserved<00:01:36.740> as<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.700> e<00:01:37.729> surface<00:01:38.330> because

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
well preserved as the e surface because

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.469 
well preserved as the e surface because
the<00:01:39.320> volcanic<00:01:39.740> ash<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.759> originally<00:01:41.180> killed

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
the volcanic ash that originally killed

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.710 
the volcanic ash that originally killed
them<00:01:41.660> kazoo

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
them kazoo

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.100 
them kazoo
awesome

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.110 

but<00:01:46.650> on<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> east<00:01:47.070> surface<00:01:47.550> we'll<00:01:47.760> see<00:01:47.940> that

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
but on the east surface we'll see that

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.360 
but on the east surface we'll see that
some<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> volcanic<00:01:49.140> ash<00:01:49.440> still<00:01:49.980> remains

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
some of the volcanic ash still remains

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:06.600 
some of the volcanic ash still remains
and<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.910> preservation<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.660> there<00:01:51.870> is

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.300 

yeah<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:08.200> remarkable<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.130> say

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
yeah it's remarkable like you say

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.640 
yeah it's remarkable like you say
they're<00:02:09.490> like<00:02:09.910> practical<00:02:10.450> husband

a<00:02:15.250> repetition<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.270> three<00:02:16.750> or<00:02:16.840> four<00:02:17.020> times<00:02:17.230> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
a repetition of a three or four times of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.210 
a repetition of a three or four times of
one

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:32.640 

element

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.039 

Oh<00:02:33.840> volcanic<00:02:34.980> panic<00:02:35.980> accidents<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.900> is

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
Oh volcanic panic accidents so this is

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.009 
Oh volcanic panic accidents so this is
this<00:02:38.409> is<00:02:38.470> Newfoundlands<00:02:39.099> Pompeii<00:02:39.579> yeah<00:02:40.569> EDI

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
this is Newfoundlands Pompeii yeah EDI

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.500 
this is Newfoundlands Pompeii yeah EDI
from<00:02:41.379> Pompeii<00:02:41.829> Ediacaran<00:02:42.579> Pompeii<00:02:43.120> there<00:02:43.420> you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
from Pompeii Ediacaran Pompeii there you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:56.420 
from Pompeii Ediacaran Pompeii there you
go

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.570

go back to pieces and if you get down

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.059 
go back to pieces and if you get down
there<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.100> see<00:03:03.340> that

there you can see that

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:13.240 
there you can see that
the<00:03:04.489> details<00:03:04.909> of<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.269> structure

is<00:03:40.800> at<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.040> right<00:03:41.280> angle<00:03:41.760> it's<00:03:42.480> astonishing

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
is at the right angle it's astonishing

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.140 
is at the right angle it's astonishing
on<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.530> surface<00:03:43.950> they<00:03:44.100> just<00:03:44.340> pop<00:03:44.670> out<00:03:44.880> at<00:03:45.030> you

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
on the surface they just pop out at you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.240 
on the surface they just pop out at you
and<00:03:45.270> if<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.480> look<00:03:45.660> back<00:03:45.840> up<00:03:46.110> now<00:03:46.380> you'll<00:03:47.010> see

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
and if you look back up now you'll see

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.120 
and if you look back up now you'll see
tons<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.450> tons<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.810> things<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.380> sort
