00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
still protects your allies but we

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
still protects your allies but we
already<00:01:21.810> had<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> cool<00:01:22.500> art<00:01:22.890> link<00:01:23.280> between

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
already had a cool art link between

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.700 
already had a cool art link between
between<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> ally<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> were<00:01:25.350> connected

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
between the ally that you were connected

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.080 
between the ally that you were connected
with<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.130> thought<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.610> cool<00:01:26.820> if

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
with so we thought it would be cool if

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.520 
with so we thought it would be cool if
we<00:01:27.360> could<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.600> something<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.930> fire<00:01:28.229> chains

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
we could do something like fire chains

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.670 
we could do something like fire chains
so<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.479> he<00:01:30.900> links<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.350> ether

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
so see we see here he links with ether

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
so see we see here he links with ether
and<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.640> run<00:01:32.939> between<00:01:33.210> all

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and now they can just run between all

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.390 
and now they can just run between all
the<00:01:33.780> minions<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.380> melt<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.250> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the minions has just melt them and this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.190 
the minions has just melt them and this
creates<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> lot<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.240> good<00:01:36.270> positional

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
creates a lot of good positional

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.350 
creates a lot of good positional
gameplay<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.799> both<00:01:37.950> cheerio<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.729> ether<00:01:39.030> but
