00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 the cheapest computer soon 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.340
 may be sold at a price of 9 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.780
 dollars on the resource kickstart 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.000
 American engineers successfully assembled 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 funds on the computer which will 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 cost only 9 dollar it will be 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.270
 the cheapest of these devices 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.480
 just imagine $ 9 for 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830
 computer for the system unit so to speak 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.189
 Californian inventors have called their 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.279
 brainchild chip four letters in abbreviation 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 hi ey ah pi despite very small 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.149
 the price of the device will have wide 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.680
 capabilities such a computer can 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.870
 useful for example for creating 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550
 text documents or search 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 necessary information on the Internet 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.010
 In addition, with the help of new items it will be possible 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 play some simple 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.910
 the chip will receive a processor power 1 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.219
 gigahertz 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.390
 512 megabytes of a memory is also hard 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.510
 40 gigabyte drive 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.969
 I remember my first computer 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 almost the same was for 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.850
 performing certain tasks and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.409
 computers can be attached 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.750
 wireless mouse keyboard or screen 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.549
 special gadget package than can 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.920
 turn the novelty into a pocket computer 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.229
 the case is already equipped with a battery 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.060
 which will allow you to work continuously 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.000
 for 5 hours 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 this idea was known before but 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.409
 it is now clear that she can get 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 a start in your life to create 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.880
 computer developers need to find 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.290
 fifty thousand dollars while doing so 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.369
 as of May 25, 2015 they succeeded 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.860
 collect more than 1 of 7 million dollars 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.740
 It should be noted that the direct is similar 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.689
 developers will cost 35-40 dollars 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.119
 plan to release their offspring 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:51.020
 one year from May 2016
