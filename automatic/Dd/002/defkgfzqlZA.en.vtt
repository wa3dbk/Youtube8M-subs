00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
will break and turn into string so you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.249

they're in their water for it will just

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.700 
they're in their water for it will just
disappear<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.720> can<00:01:56.930> use<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.229> string<00:01:57.470> for

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710

careful when you're chasing people if
you<00:02:09.709> hit<00:02:09.860> them<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.130> head<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.580> snowball

you hit them in the head with a snowball
the<00:02:11.180> snowbowl<00:02:11.540> will<00:02:12.110> just<00:02:12.290> turn<00:02:12.380> into<00:02:12.590> a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the snowbowl will just turn into a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.199 
the snowbowl will just turn into a
cobweb<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.220> midair<00:02:13.400> rather<00:02:13.760> than<00:02:13.940> hit<00:02:14.120> the

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
cobweb in midair rather than hit the

cobweb in midair rather than hit the
ground<00:02:14.360> at<00:02:14.510> trap<00:02:14.750> them<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.560> also<00:02:15.680> track

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
ground at trap them you can also track

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.060 
ground at trap them you can also track
yourself<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.700> careful<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:18.070> really

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
but anyways if you do make this trap and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.550 
but anyways if you do make this trap and
somebody's<00:03:22.780> chasing<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.140> down<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.530> they're

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
without super whatever they get trapped

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.830 
without super whatever they get trapped
and<00:03:27.880> then<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.120> can<00:03:28.240> get<00:03:28.360> your<00:03:28.480> friends<00:03:28.750> to

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.940 
and then you can get your friends to
surround<00:03:29.170> them<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.380> they're<00:03:29.530> kind<00:03:29.890> of

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
surround them and they're kind of

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.160 
surround them and they're kind of
screwed<00:03:30.220> especially<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.090> way<00:03:31.300> here<00:03:32.020> I'm

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
screwed especially in that way here I'm

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.690 
screwed especially in that way here I'm
not<00:03:32.320> really<00:03:32.560> using<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:32.860> kid<00:03:33.070> at<00:03:33.190> all<00:03:33.310> which<00:03:33.580> I

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
not really using the kid at all which I

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.040 
not really using the kid at all which I
feel<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:33.940> kind<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.390> reason<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.660> won<00:03:34.900> this

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
feel is kind of the reason I won this

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.590 
feel is kind of the reason I won this
fight<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:36.100> an<00:03:36.160> easy<00:03:36.400> fight<00:03:36.730> but<00:03:36.970> spidermen

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
fight it's an easy fight but spidermen

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.210 
fight it's an easy fight but spidermen
seems<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.020> mess<00:03:38.200> me<00:03:38.410> up<00:03:38.440> instead<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:38.980> using<00:03:39.100> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
seems to mess me up instead of using the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.670 
seems to mess me up instead of using the
ability<00:03:39.870> instead<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.900> using<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.290> ability<00:03:41.590> I'm

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
ability instead of using the ability I'm

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560 
ability instead of using the ability I'm
more<00:03:41.830> worried<00:03:42.010> about<00:03:42.070> getting<00:03:42.550> soup<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.450> I'll

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
more worried about getting soup so I'll

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.450 
more worried about getting soup so I'll
give<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.840> five<00:03:44.020> star<00:03:44.260> rating<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.770> really

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
give it a five star rating I really

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.730 
give it a five star rating I really
didn't<00:03:45.670> feel<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:45.910> was<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.210> good<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.170> five

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
didn't feel it was that good so a five

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.010 
didn't feel it was that good so a five
star<00:03:47.950> rating<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.310> not<00:03:48.460> at<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.640> 55<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.660> because

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
star rating is not at a 55 in because

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.410 
star rating is not at a 55 in because
kids<00:03:50.350> really<00:03:50.710> bad

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
kids really bad

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.059 
kids really bad
other<00:03:53.420> people<00:03:53.750> might<00:03:53.870> have<00:03:54.110> better<00:03:54.769> results

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
other people might have better results

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.550 
other people might have better results
with<00:03:55.400> his<00:03:55.579> kid<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.030> really<00:03:56.420> didn't<00:03:56.989> there's

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
did have success with this kit I I guess

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.580 
did have success with this kit I I guess
tell<00:04:02.359> me<00:04:02.510> why<00:04:02.689> in<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.930> comments<00:04:03.109> because<00:04:03.409> I

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
tell me why in the comments because I

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.780 
tell me why in the comments because I
really<00:04:03.829> want<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.010> see<00:04:04.069> if<00:04:04.219> anybody's<00:04:04.609> good

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
really want to see if anybody's good

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.849 
really want to see if anybody's good
with<00:04:04.969> this<00:04:05.120> kit<00:04:05.359> if<00:04:05.569> you<00:04:06.230> want<00:04:06.379> to<00:04:06.439> slow<00:04:06.530> people

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
with this kit if you want to slow people

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.800 
with this kit if you want to slow people
down<00:04:06.890> i<00:04:07.189> prefer<00:04:07.670> Campbell<00:04:08.209> or<00:04:08.390> if<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.629> were<00:04:08.750> to

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
down i prefer Campbell or if you were to

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.380 
down i prefer Campbell or if you were to
run<00:04:08.989> away<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.230> before<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> cannibal<00:04:10.040> or<00:04:10.069> Viper

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
run away it before a cannibal or Viper

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.729 
run away it before a cannibal or Viper
so<00:04:11.390> it's<00:04:11.569> not<00:04:11.689> really<00:04:11.750> my<00:04:12.049> style<00:04:12.260> of<00:04:12.439> a<00:04:12.500> kit

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
so it's not really my style of a kit

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.819 
so it's not really my style of a kit
which<00:04:12.920> is<00:04:13.040> why<00:04:13.189> i<00:04:13.220> rated<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.700> kind<00:04:13.939> of<00:04:13.970> badly

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
which is why i rated it kind of badly

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.800 
which is why i rated it kind of badly
I'm<00:04:15.829> trapping<00:04:16.280> him<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:16.509> what's<00:04:17.509> it<00:04:17.630> called
