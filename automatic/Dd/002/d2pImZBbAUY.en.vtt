your images for the gallery in this
demonstration<00:00:21.800> I'll<00:00:22.430> be<00:00:22.550> creating<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:23.060> travel

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
demonstration I'll be creating a travel

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.200 
demonstration I'll be creating a travel
gallery<00:00:23.780> and<00:00:24.130> so<00:00:25.130> I've<00:00:25.190> got<00:00:25.340> some<00:00:25.580> folders

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
gallery and so I've got some folders

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.880 
gallery and so I've got some folders
here<00:00:26.240> which<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.080> want<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.289> create<00:00:27.380> individual

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
here which I want to create individual

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.580 
here which I want to create individual
galleries<00:00:28.310> for<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.610> website<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:30.410> each<00:00:30.560> one

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
galleries for the website so each one

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.930 
galleries for the website so each one
will<00:00:31.250> have<00:00:31.280> its<00:00:31.580> own<00:00:31.730> page<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.190> start<00:00:34.700> with

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
will have its own page so to start with

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.760 
will have its own page so to start with
I<00:00:35.180> need<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.510> create<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:36.020> collection<00:00:36.680> set<00:00:37.430> and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
I need to create a collection set and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.130 
I need to create a collection set and
label<00:00:39.770> that<00:00:39.890> travel<00:00:40.420> so<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:41.570> will<00:00:41.750> hold<00:00:41.899> all

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
label that travel so this will hold all

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.560 
label that travel so this will hold all
those<00:00:42.290> galleries<00:00:44.739> then<00:00:45.739> each<00:00:46.610> gallery<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:47.510> I

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
those galleries then each gallery that I

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.420 
those galleries then each gallery that I
want<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.840> do<00:00:48.050> need<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.770> select<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.040> photos

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
collection to go inside that travel

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.229 
collection to go inside that travel
folder<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:04.009> you're<00:01:04.640> going<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.850> use<00:01:05.030> these

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
folder if you're going to use these

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.029 
folder if you're going to use these
photos<00:01:05.719> and<00:01:05.749> other<00:01:06.079> galleries<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.829> may<00:01:06.979> be

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
photos and other galleries it may be

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.599 
photos and other galleries it may be
useful<00:01:07.219> to<00:01:07.490> make<00:01:07.609> virtual<00:01:07.969> copies<00:01:08.389> and<00:01:08.569> as

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
useful to make virtual copies and as

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.489 
useful to make virtual copies and as
there<00:01:10.609> might<00:01:10.789> be<00:01:10.819> issues<00:01:11.030> rising<00:01:11.899> with<00:01:12.289> its

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
there might be issues rising with its

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.770 
there might be issues rising with its
sorting<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:13.909> demonstration<00:01:13.969> we

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
sorting but for this demonstration we

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.160 
sorting but for this demonstration we
should<00:01:14.959> use<00:01:15.139> this<00:01:15.289> folder<00:01:15.920> once<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.299> this

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
should use this folder once and this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.910 
should use this folder once and this
gallery<00:01:21.459> so<00:01:22.459> I'll<00:01:22.700> repeat<00:01:23.029> this<00:01:23.479> again<00:01:24.139> for

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
gallery so I'll repeat this again for

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:36.330 
gallery so I'll repeat this again for
all<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.749> continuing<00:01:26.749> galleries

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.830 

okay<00:01:37.340> I've<00:01:37.490> created<00:01:37.700> all<00:01:38.030> those<00:01:38.210> folders<00:01:38.660> to

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
okay I've created all those folders to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.590 
okay I've created all those folders to
go<00:01:38.990> within<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.560> travel<00:01:39.920> folder<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.480> so<00:01:41.480> in

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
go within the travel folder and so in

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.790 
go within the travel folder and so in
nearly<00:01:41.810> ready<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.140> go<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.500> web<00:01:42.620> gallery

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
nearly ready to go to the web gallery

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.640 
nearly ready to go to the web gallery
but<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.640> thing<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:44.000> need<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.270> check<00:01:44.480> next<00:01:44.870> is

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
but the thing you need to check next is

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.110 
but the thing you need to check next is
that<00:01:45.920> when<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.130> go<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.550> trouble<00:01:46.790> and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
that when you go to the trouble and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.960 
that when you go to the trouble and
select<00:01:47.660> that<00:01:47.780> folder<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:49.340> when<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.820> view

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
select that folder that when you view

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.020 
select that folder that when you view
the<00:01:50.120> images<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:50.870> they<00:01:51.740> should<00:01:52.040> they<00:01:52.730> need<00:01:52.910> to

the images here they should they need to
appear<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.480> order<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.960> want<00:01:54.140> them

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470

to<00:01:54.530> appear<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.160> gallery<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.020> I've<00:01:57.020> got

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
to appear in the gallery so I've got

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.660 
to appear in the gallery so I've got
some<00:01:57.410> images<00:01:57.800> here<00:01:58.010> with<00:01:58.160> yorkshire<00:01:58.520> dales

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
and all mixed up because the capture

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.440 
and all mixed up because the capture
times<00:02:03.610> aren't<00:02:04.610> citing<00:02:05.060> them<00:02:05.150> in<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.330> correct

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
times aren't citing them in the correct

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.290 
times aren't citing them in the correct
order<00:02:06.430> if<00:02:07.430> they<00:02:07.640> are<00:02:07.760> in<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> right<00:02:08.090> order

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
order if they are in the right order

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.820 
order if they are in the right order
then<00:02:08.570> you<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.929> straight<00:02:09.320> away<00:02:09.440> into<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
then you can go straight away into the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.170 
then you can go straight away into the
web<00:02:10.040> gallery<00:02:10.250> but<00:02:10.640> if<00:02:10.700> you're<00:02:10.820> finding<00:02:11.000> it

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
web gallery but if you're finding it

difficult<00:02:11.360> getting<00:02:11.720> them<00:02:11.960> in<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.110> right

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
difficult getting them in the right

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.310 
difficult getting them in the right
order<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:13.270> use<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.450> method<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.930> correct

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
order and use this method to correct

within the gallery and have the road to

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.849 
within the gallery and have the road to
change<00:03:47.209> for<00:03:47.840> instance<00:03:48.230> having<00:03:48.439> this<00:03:48.650> one

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
change for instance having this one

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.399 
change for instance having this one
first<00:03:49.189> then<00:03:49.579> this<00:03:50.540> can<00:03:50.659> be<00:03:50.780> accomplished<00:03:51.260> by

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
first then this can be accomplished by

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.020 
first then this can be accomplished by
doing<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.709> following<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.790> I'm<00:03:52.849> going<00:03:52.909> to

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
doing the following so I'm going to

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.229 
doing the following so I'm going to
select<00:03:53.180> all<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.569> images<00:03:53.750> again<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:56.150> they

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
select all the images again so they

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.569 
select all the images again so they
already<00:03:56.359> are<00:03:56.799> then<00:03:57.799> this<00:03:58.159> time<00:03:58.400> put<00:03:58.519> into<00:03:58.579> play

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
already are then this time put into play

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.659 
already are then this time put into play
then<00:04:01.579> each<00:04:01.760> other<00:04:02.000> again<00:04:02.389> so<00:04:02.930> fight<00:04:03.230> all<00:04:04.870> then

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
then each other again so fight all then

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.119 
then each other again so fight all then
selecting<00:04:07.669> norm<00:04:07.939> and<00:04:08.530> just<00:04:09.530> let<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.829> image

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
selecting norm and just let that image

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.309 
selecting norm and just let that image
and<00:04:10.599> i'll<00:04:11.599> put<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:11.989> just<00:04:12.349> to<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:14.319> then

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
and i'll put that just to a and then

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.870 
and i'll put that just to a and then
i'll<00:04:15.439> solve<00:04:15.620> those<00:04:15.739> alphabetically<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.699> that

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
i'll solve those alphabetically so that

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.849 
i'll solve those alphabetically so that
can<00:04:17.030> be<00:04:17.120> accomplished<00:04:17.509> that<00:04:17.660> way<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:21.169> now

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
can be accomplished that way and so now

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.480 
can be accomplished that way and so now
i'm<00:04:22.160> happy<00:04:22.580> with<00:04:22.669> all<00:04:22.849> the<00:04:23.000> images<00:04:24.280> here<00:04:25.280> and

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
i'm happy with all the images here and

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.589 
i'm happy with all the images here and
the<00:04:25.849> order<00:04:26.240> or<00:04:26.659> in<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.900> trouble<00:04:27.169> bit<00:04:28.599> we'll

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
the order or in the trouble bit we'll

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:37.089 
the order or in the trouble bit we'll
move<00:04:29.750> over<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.260> web<00:04:30.409> gallery<00:04:35.949> ok<00:04:36.949> the

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
move over to the web gallery ok the

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.159 
move over to the web gallery ok the
first<00:04:37.250> place<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.580> want<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.150> start<00:04:38.449> with<00:04:38.539> with

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
first place you want to start with with

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.529 
first place you want to start with with
the<00:04:39.349> gallery<00:04:39.800> settings<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.940> garvey

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
the gallery settings is the garvey

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.719 
the gallery settings is the garvey
number<00:04:41.810> page<00:04:42.020> breaks<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.680> these<00:04:43.250> will<00:04:43.430> divide

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
number page breaks and these will divide

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.260 
number page breaks and these will divide
the<00:04:44.770> images<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.340> select<00:04:46.669> a<00:04:46.789> deal<00:04:46.970> on<00:04:47.000> the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
the images that you select a deal on the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.670 
the images that you select a deal on the
bottom<00:04:47.830> into<00:04:48.830> their<00:04:49.039> unique<00:04:49.909> galleries<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:51.620> if

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
bottom into their unique galleries so if

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.430 
bottom into their unique galleries so if
we<00:04:51.830> start<00:04:52.460> with<00:04:52.820> we<00:04:53.060> need<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.360> enter<00:04:53.810> 51

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
we start with we need to enter 51

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.170 
we start with we need to enter 51
because<00:04:54.740> that's<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.430> value<00:04:55.699> of<00:04:55.759> our<00:04:55.880> first

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
because that's a the value of our first

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.129 
because that's a the value of our first
gallery<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:57.250> then<00:04:58.250> we<00:04:58.430> need<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.610> continue

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
gallery and then we need to continue

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.469 
gallery and then we need to continue
adding<00:05:00.139> them<00:05:00.590> consecutively<00:05:01.070> so<00:05:02.060> we<00:05:02.240> need<00:05:02.389> to

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
adding them consecutively so we need to

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.700 
adding them consecutively so we need to
do<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.720> 51<00:05:03.199> plus<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.650> 17<00:05:04.159> giving<00:05:04.699> the<00:05:04.789> 68<00:05:05.360> and

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
do the 51 plus the 17 giving the 68 and

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.110 
do the 51 plus the 17 giving the 68 and

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
we'll do that next so each gallery title

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.140 
we'll do that next so each gallery title
it<00:05:55.970> needs<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.270> be<00:05:56.389> in<00:05:56.860> speech<00:05:57.860> marks<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.490> comma
