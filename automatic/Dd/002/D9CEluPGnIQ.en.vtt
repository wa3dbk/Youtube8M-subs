this stuff it's it's kind of dusty so I
make<00:03:44.310> sure<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.459> do<00:03:44.669> it<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.689> well-ventilated

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
make sure to do it in a well-ventilated

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.280 
make sure to do it in a well-ventilated
area<00:03:46.769> or<00:03:47.069> wear<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> respirator<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.959> let's<00:03:49.109> mix

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
area or wear a respirator so let's mix

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.729 
area or wear a respirator so let's mix
it<00:03:49.470> up<00:03:49.939> and<00:03:50.939> there<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.479> all<00:03:51.629> mixed<00:03:51.840> up<00:03:52.079> and

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
it up and there it is all mixed up and

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.559 
it up and there it is all mixed up and
it's<00:03:53.280> definitely<00:03:53.549> lighter<00:03:53.939> than<00:03:54.239> straight-up

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
it's definitely lighter than straight-up

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.499 
it's definitely lighter than straight-up
compost<00:03:55.169> so<00:03:55.470> if<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.919> can<00:03:56.159> do<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.120> bagging

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
compost so if you can do this bagging

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.710 
compost so if you can do this bagging
the<00:03:57.569> moss<00:03:57.840> if<00:03:58.169> you<00:03:58.560> can<00:03:58.799> afford<00:03:59.699> it<00:03:59.879> do<00:04:00.599> the

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
the moss if you can afford it do the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.869 
the moss if you can afford it do the
vermiculite<00:04:01.169> as<00:04:01.470> well<00:04:01.650> we're<00:04:02.519> gonna<00:04:02.609> start

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
vermiculite as well we're gonna start

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.119 
vermiculite as well we're gonna start
filling<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.299> thing<00:04:03.359> up<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.470> should<00:04:04.739> in

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
filling this thing up and it should in

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.330 
filling this thing up and it should in
theory<00:04:05.400> take<00:04:05.729> about<00:04:05.970> total<00:04:06.479> of<00:04:06.569> seven<00:04:06.959> cubic

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
theory take about total of seven cubic

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.039 
theory take about total of seven cubic
feet<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:09.349> soil<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.680> believe<00:04:10.979> so<00:04:12.049> the

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
feet of soil I believe so the

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.249 
feet of soil I believe so the
proportions<00:04:13.859> of<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.479> two<00:04:15.479> cubic<00:04:15.870> feet<00:04:16.079> of

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
proportions of the two cubic feet of

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.969 
proportions of the two cubic feet of
vermiculite<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.430> three<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.989> Spagna<00:04:19.409> moss

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
vermiculite and three of the Spagna moss

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.590 
vermiculite and three of the Spagna moss
should<00:04:20.159> be<00:04:20.280> about<00:04:20.400> right

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
should be about right

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.790 
should be about right
all<00:04:23.600> right<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:23.870> we<00:04:23.990> have<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.260> whole<00:04:24.440> barrel

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
all right so we have the whole barrel

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.330 
all right so we have the whole barrel
filled<00:04:25.100> up<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.030> went<00:04:26.240> ahead<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:27.340> stuffed

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
filled up and I went ahead and I stuffed

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.650 
filled up and I went ahead and I stuffed
handfuls<00:04:28.990> into<00:04:29.990> each<00:04:30.139> one<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.440> these<00:04:30.560> on<00:04:31.660> these

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
handfuls into each one of these on these

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.850 
handfuls into each one of these on these
little<00:04:32.840> pockets<00:04:33.350> here<00:04:33.500> because<00:04:33.680> you<00:04:33.770> could

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
little pockets here because you could

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.230 
little pockets here because you could
see<00:04:34.040> they<00:04:34.160> kind<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.400> get<00:04:34.550> compressed<00:04:34.970> this

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
see they kind of get compressed this

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.090 
see they kind of get compressed this
soil<00:04:35.510> is<00:04:35.720> really<00:04:35.930> amazing<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.500> mean<00:04:36.530> look<00:04:36.860> at<00:04:36.950> it

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
soil is really amazing I mean look at it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.270 
soil is really amazing I mean look at it
it<00:04:37.220> just<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:38.150> compresses<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:39.050> much<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.560> and

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
it just it compresses so much and and

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.400 
it just it compresses so much and and
then<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.639> expands<00:04:41.180> outwards<00:04:41.600> is<00:04:41.840> gonna<00:04:42.169> hold

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
then it expands outwards is gonna hold

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.280 
then it expands outwards is gonna hold
so<00:04:42.800> much<00:04:42.980> water<00:04:43.660> I'm<00:04:44.660> very<00:04:44.870> excited<00:04:45.230> about

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
so much water I'm very excited about

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.820 
so much water I'm very excited about
that<00:04:45.620> because<00:04:45.830> this<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.900> know<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.290> garden

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
that because this you know this garden

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.730 
that because this you know this garden
barrel<00:04:49.160> is<00:04:49.250> gonna<00:04:49.870> suffer<00:04:50.870> from<00:04:51.139> you<00:04:51.620> know

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
barrel is gonna suffer from you know

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.980 
barrel is gonna suffer from you know
evaporation<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.730> being<00:04:53.419> in<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.600> full<00:04:53.780> Sun

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
evaporation and being in the full Sun

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.420 
evaporation and being in the full Sun
here<00:04:54.320> and<00:04:54.800> we<00:04:54.889> have<00:04:54.979> a<00:04:55.010> little<00:04:55.160> bit<00:04:55.280> of<00:04:55.340> a

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
here and we have a little bit of a

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.879 
here and we have a little bit of a
shadow<00:04:55.610> with<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.940> fence<00:04:56.150> but<00:04:56.770> during<00:04:57.770> the

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
shadow with the fence but during the

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.440 
shadow with the fence but during the
peak<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.490> day<00:04:58.639> this<00:04:58.940> thing<00:04:59.120> is<00:04:59.240> going<00:04:59.389> to

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
peak of the day this thing is going to

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.750 
peak of the day this thing is going to
get<00:04:59.570> full<00:04:59.720> Sun<00:04:59.900> all<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.110> way<00:05:00.260> around<00:05:00.530> so

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
get full Sun all the way around so

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.310 
get full Sun all the way around so
anything<00:05:01.760> that<00:05:01.790> I<00:05:01.910> can<00:05:02.180> do<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.360> hold<00:05:03.050> moisture

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
anything that I can do to hold moisture

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.580 
anything that I can do to hold moisture
into<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:05.570> garden<00:05:05.870> barrel<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.229> gonna<00:05:06.350> work

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
into the the garden barrel is gonna work

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.620 
into the the garden barrel is gonna work
out<00:05:06.770> well<00:05:06.979> and<00:05:07.580> as<00:05:07.850> you<00:05:07.970> can<00:05:08.060> see<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.330> got<00:05:08.600> some

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
out well and as you can see I got some

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.290 
out well and as you can see I got some
moisture<00:05:09.169> leaking<00:05:09.770> out<00:05:09.889> here<00:05:10.190> from<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.000> little

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
moisture leaking out here from a little

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.540 
moisture leaking out here from a little
bit<00:05:11.389> of<00:05:11.479> compost<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.169> what<00:05:12.830> was<00:05:12.950> inside<00:05:13.310> the

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
bit of compost and what was inside the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.420 
bit of compost and what was inside the
other<00:05:13.790> vermiculture<00:05:14.210> tube<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:15.560> put<00:05:16.400> that

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
other vermiculture tube and I put that

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.219 
other vermiculture tube and I put that
that<00:05:17.030> bucket<00:05:17.389> underneath<00:05:17.750> there<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.169> then

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
that bucket underneath there and then

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.690 
that bucket underneath there and then
you<00:05:18.530> know<00:05:18.560> at<00:05:18.770> least<00:05:18.860> once<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.220> day<00:05:19.250> I'll<00:05:19.550> come

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
you know at least once a day I'll come

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.840 
you know at least once a day I'll come
out<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.750> will<00:05:21.040> empty<00:05:22.040> that<00:05:22.220> back<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.669> there

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
out and I will empty that back in there

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.760 
out and I will empty that back in there
that<00:05:23.000> way<00:05:23.090> I'm<00:05:23.180> not<00:05:23.419> losing<00:05:23.630> any<00:05:24.080> nutrients

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
that way I'm not losing any nutrients

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.730 
that way I'm not losing any nutrients
and<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.850> water<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.750> retained<00:05:27.200> in<00:05:27.530> the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
and the the water is retained in the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.260 
and the the water is retained in the
system<00:05:28.100> so<00:05:28.400> it's<00:05:28.640> going<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:28.970> be<00:05:29.060> really

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
system so it's going to be really

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.860 
system so it's going to be really
awesome<00:05:29.750> and<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:31.160> next<00:05:31.400> thing<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.700> do<00:05:31.850> is<00:05:32.060> to

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
awesome and the next thing to do is to

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.950 
awesome and the next thing to do is to
plant<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.590> seeds<00:05:33.860> in<00:05:34.160> it<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.630> also<00:05:35.630> get<00:05:35.840> the

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
plant the seeds in it and also get the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.430 
plant the seeds in it and also get the
worms

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
worms

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.920 
worms
so<00:05:37.010> we'll<00:05:37.580> just<00:05:37.820> waiting<00:05:38.090> on<00:05:38.150> that<00:05:38.180> last<00:05:38.510> frost
