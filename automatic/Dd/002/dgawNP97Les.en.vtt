those conversations and build some
valuable<00:04:03.709> relations<00:04:04.160> put<00:04:04.370> relationships

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
valuable relations put relationships

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.510 
valuable relations put relationships
with<00:04:05.450> students<00:04:05.810> early<00:04:06.140> on<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.070> that<00:04:07.250> you

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
with students early on in so that you

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.650 
with students early on in so that you
know<00:04:07.640> they<00:04:07.820> are<00:04:08.090> aware<00:04:08.300> of<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.540> opportunities

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
know they are aware of the opportunities

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.860 
know they are aware of the opportunities
that<00:04:09.200> are<00:04:09.920> out<00:04:10.220> there<00:04:10.280> for<00:04:10.790> them<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.209> mean<00:04:11.780> I

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
that are out there for them I mean I

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.240 
that are out there for them I mean I
think<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:12.170> it's<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.350> little<00:04:12.380> bit<00:04:12.590> daunting<00:04:13.130> at

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
think that it's a little bit daunting at

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.770 
think that it's a little bit daunting at
first<00:04:13.280> when<00:04:13.610> you<00:04:13.700> come<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.970> university<00:04:14.540> and

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
first when you come to university and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.509 
first when you come to university and
people<00:04:15.590> are<00:04:15.680> talking<00:04:15.709> about<00:04:15.980> their<00:04:16.220> careers

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
people are talking about their careers

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.640 
people are talking about their careers
and<00:04:16.820> you're<00:04:16.910> not<00:04:17.000> sure<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.660> suppose<00:04:17.900> where<00:04:18.560> you

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
and you're not sure I suppose where you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.030 
and you're not sure I suppose where you
fish<00:04:19.239> so<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.510> think<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.989> for<00:04:21.530> students<00:04:21.950> is

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
fish so I think that for students is

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.530 
fish so I think that for students is
important<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.580> come<00:04:22.730> up<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.000> engage<00:04:23.300> what

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
important to come up and engage what

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.450 
important to come up and engage what
