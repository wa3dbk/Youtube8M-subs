00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.880
 we have four main natural 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.130
 mezhventsovy heaters 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.039
 intended for insulation of seams and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.449
 joints between logs timber wooden 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.019
 houses wooden house everything is fine and everything 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.400
 very good solely the most 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.320
 big problem is purge and and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.090
 insulation of inter-event joints between 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.610
 logs and beam 1 heater can 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.430
 look like that he 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.070
 is a tow 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.340
 minimized folder can be 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.390
 lay out because of it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.520
 ropes and run wooden houses 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.850
 mostly primarily such 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.210
 material used for walls and chopped 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.500
 houses 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 chopped by hand and subsequent caulker 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.650
 seams and joints 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.180
 after shrinking deformations here are more 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.130
 progressive more progressive 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.189
 the material is more often called jute tape 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 this is such a roll 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.000
 it is intended for warming wooden 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.360
 houses are also mostly felled 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.710
 logs 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.150
 because he is pretty fat 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 thick thickness 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.790
 insulation itself well, here it is high quality 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.680
 easily laid out well warms 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.899
 log houses 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.759
 next we see the material also under 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.159
 jute tape but thinner 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.149
 the structure of the jute tape itself 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.700
 used more often for wooden houses from 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.430
 glued timber wooden houses from 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.770
 planed timber and wooden houses from 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.899
 round logs 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.060
 well, in last place the material under 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830
 by name 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.100
 the cuckoo could 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.130
 it's like all kinds of natural 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.360
 natural insulation the most natural 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.230
 and natural material 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.360
 he is also now very often 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.060
 used are used for laying 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.420
 new 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.420
 wooden log houses
