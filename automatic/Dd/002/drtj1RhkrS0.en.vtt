00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.670 
just take the extra step and soak and
cook<00:02:14.459> some<00:02:14.760> black<00:02:15.360> beans<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:16.530> going<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
cook some black beans and we're going to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.150 
cook some black beans and we're going to
add<00:02:16.890> those<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:18.510> our<00:02:18.540> food<00:02:18.810> processor<00:02:19.160> and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
add those to our food processor and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.430 
add those to our food processor and
we're<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:20.819> going<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> use<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.780> sweetener

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
we're also going to use a sweetener

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.520 
we're also going to use a sweetener
called<00:02:22.680> sucker

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
called sucker

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.980 
called sucker
which<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.920> basically<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.850> bloke<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.510> least

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
which is basically the bloke the least

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.559 
which is basically the bloke the least
minimally<00:02:26.590> processed<00:02:26.910> sugar<00:02:27.910> from<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.300> sure

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
minimally processed sugar from the sure

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.330 
minimally processed sugar from the sure
cane<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.110> all<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.380> nutrients<00:02:29.890> are<00:02:29.950> still<00:02:30.010> in

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
cane so all the nutrients are still in

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.130 
cane so all the nutrients are still in
there<00:02:30.490> kinda<00:02:30.790> tastes<00:02:30.970> like<00:02:31.060> brown<00:02:31.630> sugar<00:02:31.660> a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
there kinda tastes like brown sugar a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.960 
there kinda tastes like brown sugar a
little<00:02:32.500> bit<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.190> we're<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.550> add<00:02:33.700> some

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
little bit so we're going to add some

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.840 
little bit so we're going to add some
suckin<00:02:34.330> app<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.230> food<00:02:35.500> processor<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
suckin app to the food processor and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.809 
suckin app to the food processor and
using<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> double<00:02:38.080> boiler<00:02:38.650> method<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:39.610> have
