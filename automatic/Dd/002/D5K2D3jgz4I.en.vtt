new year is that I go through my closet
and<00:00:14.820> kind<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.090> clean<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.449> all<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.779> excess<00:00:16.170> and

and kind of clean out all the excess and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.680 
and kind of clean out all the excess and
what<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.310> noticed<00:00:17.340> year<00:00:17.880> after<00:00:18.180> year<00:00:18.449> is

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
what I've noticed year after year is

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.630 
what I've noticed year after year is
that<00:00:18.900> there<00:00:19.170> are<00:00:19.260> pieces<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> always<00:00:20.160> keep

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
that there are pieces that I always keep

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.150 
that there are pieces that I always keep
and<00:00:21.030> so<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.780> thought<00:00:22.200> it<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.500> helpful<00:00:22.800> to

and so I thought it would be helpful to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800 
and so I thought it would be helpful to
kind<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> video<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.030> show<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.450> guys
