00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
each of the holes go then I line this up

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.659 
each of the holes go then I line this up
over<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:33.349> make<00:03:34.349> sure<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.590> fits<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.220> drill<00:03:35.519> out

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.899 
sure they line up number two
I'll<00:04:58.229> need<00:04:58.439> ear<00:04:58.710> tracks<00:04:59.009> sometimes<00:04:59.339> they're

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
I'll need ear tracks sometimes they're

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:00.890 
I'll need ear tracks sometimes they're
just<00:04:59.939> a<00:05:00.389> touch

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
just a touch

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.369 
just a touch
tight<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:03.360> screw<00:05:03.719> is<00:05:03.870> going<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.110> catch

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
tight and I that screw is going to catch

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.159 
tight and I that screw is going to catch
in<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:05.219> groove<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:07.009> what<00:05:08.009> I<00:05:09.050> figured<00:05:10.050> out

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
in that groove and so what I figured out

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.290 
in that groove and so what I figured out
this<00:05:11.159> is<00:05:11.219> the<00:05:11.460> third<00:05:11.669> one<00:05:11.849> I've<00:05:11.939> laid<00:05:12.150> the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
this is the third one I've laid the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.029 
this is the third one I've laid the
first<00:05:12.569> one<00:05:12.779> was<00:05:13.139> kind<00:05:13.379> of<00:05:13.409> tight<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:13.830> had<00:05:13.949> to

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
first one was kind of tight and I had to

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.860 
first one was kind of tight and I had to
kind<00:05:14.219> of<00:05:14.249> push<00:05:14.490> him<00:05:14.639> through<00:05:14.669> I<00:05:15.150> would<00:05:15.719> not

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
kind of push him through I would not

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.499 
kind of push him through I would not
have<00:05:15.960> been<00:05:16.080> able<00:05:16.199> to<00:05:16.349> do<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.740> really<00:05:16.919> well<00:05:17.509> if

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
have been able to do that really well if

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.079 
have been able to do that really well if
they<00:05:18.659> had<00:05:18.749> already<00:05:18.930> been<00:05:19.319> in<00:05:19.759> and<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:20.879> holes

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.089 
they had already been in and the holes

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.570 
they had already been in and the holes
would<00:05:21.479> not<00:05:21.629> have<00:05:21.749> lined<00:05:21.960> up<00:05:22.169> so<00:05:22.529> what<00:05:23.189> I<00:05:23.219> do<00:05:23.430> is

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
would not have lined up so what I do is

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.629 
would not have lined up so what I do is
I<00:05:23.699> go<00:05:23.849> ahead<00:05:24.029> and<00:05:24.449> put<00:05:24.960> them<00:05:25.110> all<00:05:25.229> in<00:05:25.439> and<00:05:25.710> then

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
I go ahead and put them all in and then

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.309 
I go ahead and put them all in and then
we'll<00:05:26.879> line<00:05:27.240> them<00:05:27.270> up<00:05:27.539> with<00:05:27.599> hole<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:30.319> make

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
we'll line them up with hole and make

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.489 
we'll line them up with hole and make
sure<00:05:31.499> they<00:05:31.680> all<00:05:31.860> fit<00:05:32.520> in<00:05:32.669> there<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:34.169> then

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:34.499 
sure they all fit in there and then

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:41.019 
sure they all fit in there and then
we'll<00:05:34.800> tighten<00:05:35.309> them<00:05:35.490> up<00:05:35.580> there<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:40.680> we<00:05:40.889> are

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
we'll tighten them up there so we are

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.579 
we'll tighten them up there so we are
good<00:05:42.029> all<00:05:42.509> of<00:05:42.659> our<00:05:42.779> holes<00:05:42.930> lined<00:05:43.080> up<00:05:43.409> the

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:43.589 
good all of our holes lined up the

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.649 
good all of our holes lined up the
stencil<00:05:43.979> we're<00:05:44.129> good<00:05:44.339> now<00:05:45.120> we're<00:05:45.300> just<00:05:45.419> going

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
stencil we're good now we're just going

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.139 
stencil we're good now we're just going

it a Rudolph nose this is a t-bolt that
screws<00:06:28.529> into<00:06:29.509> those<00:06:31.999> and<00:06:32.999> this<00:06:33.539> is<00:06:33.959> going<00:06:34.319> to

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
screws into those and this is going to

attach to a dog bone connector here and

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.939 
attach to a dog bone connector here and
then<00:06:38.789> we're<00:06:39.479> going<00:06:39.629> to<00:06:39.779> connect<00:06:40.229> that<00:06:40.409> to<00:06:40.649> this

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
then we're going to connect that to this

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:42.690 
then we're going to connect that to this

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
and the nose of the boat so just one

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.330 
and the nose of the boat so just one
more<00:06:48.700> way<00:06:48.910> to<00:06:49.170> fertile<00:06:50.170> utilize<00:06:50.500> stuff<00:06:51.040> and

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
more way to fertile utilize stuff and

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
more way to fertile utilize stuff and
not<00:06:52.090> have<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.830> necessarily<00:06:53.830> have<00:06:54.460> a<00:06:54.520> commander

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
not have to necessarily have a commander

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.640 
not have to necessarily have a commander
or<00:06:55.390> a<00:06:56.790> ultimate<00:06:57.790> to<00:06:57.940> be<00:06:57.970> able<00:06:58.120> to<00:06:58.330> utilize<00:06:59.110> this

or a ultimate to be able to utilize this
cool<00:07:00.370> tool<00:07:00.580> and<00:07:00.850> so<00:07:01.300> there<00:07:01.630> is<00:07:01.900> the<00:07:02.820> mountain

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
cool tool and so there is the mountain

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.730 
cool tool and so there is the mountain
hammock<00:07:04.330> if<00:07:04.960> I<00:07:05.080> straighten<00:07:05.470> it<00:07:05.560> out<00:07:05.650> yet<00:07:05.920> but
