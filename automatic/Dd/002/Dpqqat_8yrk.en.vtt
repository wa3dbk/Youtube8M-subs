but I've had this couple times and this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
but I've had this couple times and this
bottle<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.480> I've<00:00:43.110> had<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> since<00:00:43.469> January

bottle is what I've had it since January

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920 
bottle is what I've had it since January
so<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.489> still<00:00:44.879> should<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.120> pretty<00:00:45.420> fresh<00:00:45.690> it's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930

look<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.320> darker<00:00:49.829> than

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
look at it it's a bit darker than

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.330 
look at it it's a bit darker than
average<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.879> looks<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.890> an<00:00:52.890> IPA
