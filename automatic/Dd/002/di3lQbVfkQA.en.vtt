face it expands 1,700 times to one and
that's<00:01:55.500> enough<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.280> set<00:01:56.550> off<00:01:56.580> this

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.780 

look<00:02:06.020> closely<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.740> you<00:02:06.860> can<00:02:06.890> actually<00:02:07.280> see

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
look closely and you can actually see

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.370 
look closely and you can actually see
the<00:02:07.970> steam<00:02:08.560> expanding<00:02:09.560> into<00:02:09.830> flames

the steam expanding into flames

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.400

once<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.160> temperature<00:02:12.640> reaches<00:02:13.060> 212<00:02:13.990> degrees

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
once the temperature reaches 212 degrees

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.980 
once the temperature reaches 212 degrees
it's<00:02:15.250> only<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.640> matter<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:16.000> time<00:02:16.120> before<00:02:16.690> the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
it's only a matter of time before the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:25.309 
it's only a matter of time before the
steam<00:02:17.260> ignites<00:02:17.740> an<00:02:18.010> explosion

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.509 

obviously<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.440> need<00:02:26.590> water<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.040> put<00:02:27.370> out<00:02:27.489> a

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
obviously you need water to put out a

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.920 
obviously you need water to put out a
fire<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.290> how<00:02:29.500> could<00:02:29.769> this<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.159> been<00:02:30.190> avoided

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
fire so how could this have been avoided
