gonna<00:03:47.080> kill<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.410> magma<00:03:47.680> zone<00:03:47.940> but<00:03:48.940> there

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
gonna kill the magma zone but there

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.490 
gonna kill the magma zone but there
isn't<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:49.750> too<00:03:50.050> much<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.350> problem

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
isn't really too much of a problem

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.120 
isn't really too much of a problem
because<00:03:51.210> it's<00:03:52.210> balloon<00:03:52.510> popped<00:03:52.810> out<00:03:53.020> no<00:03:53.860> idea

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
because it's balloon popped out no idea

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.160 
because it's balloon popped out no idea
why<00:03:54.190> go<00:03:54.400> forth<00:03:54.580> on<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.880> board<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.270> guess<00:03:55.960> you

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
why go forth on the board I guess you

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.870 
why go forth on the board I guess you
guys<00:03:56.320> have<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.560> substitute<00:03:57.310> which<00:03:57.460> is<00:03:57.610> good<00:03:57.850> for

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
guys have a substitute which is good for

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.080 
guys have a substitute which is good for
me<00:03:58.000> then<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.050> can<00:03:59.200> go<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.380> my<00:03:59.560> Garchomp
