talk to you about how long does it take
to<00:00:15.750> get<00:00:15.929> into<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.379> state<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.859> ketosis<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.730> I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
to get into a state of ketosis and I

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000 
to get into a state of ketosis and I
don't<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.330> mention<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.529> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
don't really mention that because I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.040 
don't really mention that because I
always<00:00:20.310> think<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> everybody<00:00:21.330> knows<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
always think that everybody knows the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.310 
always think that everybody knows the
answer<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.800> or<00:00:23.670> they<00:00:24.080> researched<00:00:25.080> other

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
answer and or they researched other

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.720 
answer and or they researched other
people<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:25.980> gotten<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> answer<00:00:26.400> but

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
people and have gotten the answer but

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
people and have gotten the answer but
they're<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.119> getting<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> answer<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.050> I'm

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
they're not getting the answer so I'm

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.990 
they're not getting the answer so I'm
gonna<00:00:28.349> try<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.560> give<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.010> answer<00:00:29.189> how

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
gonna try to give you that answer how

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.870 
gonna try to give you that answer how
long<00:00:30.330> does<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.599> take<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> become<00:00:31.880> into

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
long does it take for you to become into

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.010 
long does it take for you to become into
a<00:00:33.530> highly<00:00:34.530> adaptive<00:00:35.280> state<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.730> ketosis<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.570> as

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
a highly adaptive state of ketosis or as

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.940 
a highly adaptive state of ketosis or as
they<00:00:37.170> say<00:00:37.520> nutritional<00:00:38.520> ketosis<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:42.950> that's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
they say nutritional ketosis and that's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.779 
they say nutritional ketosis and that's
a<00:00:44.100> sticky<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.360> real<00:00:45.600> sticky<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
a sticky one that's a real sticky one so

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.729 
a sticky one that's a real sticky one so
I've<00:00:47.789> been<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.780> state<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.200> nutritional

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I've been in a state of nutritional

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.729 
I've been in a state of nutritional
ketosis<00:00:50.149> cramping<00:00:51.149> keto<00:00:51.449> adapted<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.379> four

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
ketosis cramping keto adapted for four

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.470 
ketosis cramping keto adapted for four
years<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:54.020> counting<00:00:55.020> yes<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.550> what's<00:00:57.329> so

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
years and counting yes and what's so

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080 
years and counting yes and what's so
amazing<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> older<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.550> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
amazing is is that the older I get the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.200 
amazing is is that the older I get the
healthier<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> younger<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.739> become<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.699> 46

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
healthier and the younger I become at 46

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.760 
healthier and the younger I become at 46
and<00:01:03.690> that's<00:01:04.680> what's<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.159> amazing<00:01:05.549> about<00:01:06.770> being

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and that's what's so amazing about being

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.719 
and that's what's so amazing about being
in<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.920> state<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> ketosis

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in a state of ketosis

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.480 
in a state of ketosis

feeling<00:02:21.370> even<00:02:21.970> though<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.090> didn't<00:02:22.390> understand

at<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:22.900> time<00:02:23.050> four<00:02:23.440> years<00:02:23.470> ago<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.550> you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
at that time four years ago that you

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.970 
at that time four years ago that you
need<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.360> add<00:02:25.510> more<00:02:25.690> sodium<00:02:26.050> minerals<00:02:26.860> into

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
need to add more sodium minerals into

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.780 
need to add more sodium minerals into
your<00:02:27.069> diet<00:02:27.340> more<00:02:27.790> potassium<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.519> don't

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
your diet more potassium so you don't

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.729 
your diet more potassium so you don't
feel<00:02:30.910> light-headed<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.450> feel<00:02:32.110> nauseous<00:02:32.350> and

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
feel light-headed and feel nauseous and

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.250 
feel light-headed and feel nauseous and
these<00:02:32.860> things<00:02:33.130> as<00:02:33.280> your<00:02:33.700> body<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.260> dragging

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
these things as your body is dragging

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.690 
these things as your body is dragging
out<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.620> glycogen<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.100> have<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.280> deplete<00:02:36.580> it

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
out the glycogen you have to deplete it

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.430 
out the glycogen you have to deplete it
y'all<00:02:36.910> yeah<00:02:37.330> get<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.810> out<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.110> muscle<00:02:38.350> and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
y'all yeah get it out of the muscle and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.410 
y'all yeah get it out of the muscle and
get<00:02:38.590> out<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> liver<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.640> your<00:02:39.760> body<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.030> start

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
get out a liver so your body can start

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.560 
get out a liver so your body can start
to<00:02:41.220> break<00:02:42.220> down<00:02:42.250> units<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.820> fat<00:02:42.970> called<00:02:43.209> ketone

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
to break down units of fat called ketone

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.350 
to break down units of fat called ketone
bodies<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.050> convert<00:02:44.440> them<00:02:44.650> into<00:02:45.040> energy<00:02:45.360> so

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
bodies and convert them into energy so

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.940 
bodies and convert them into energy so
that's<00:02:46.660> what's<00:02:47.110> being<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.709> state<00:02:47.920> of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
that's what's being in a state of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.729 
that's what's being in a state of
ketosis<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.660> instead<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.720> using<00:02:49.989> carps<00:02:50.500> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
ketosis is instead of using carps to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.600 
ketosis is instead of using carps to
fuel<00:02:51.220> your<00:02:51.670> brain<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.890> give<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.980> energy<00:02:54.130> to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
fuel your brain and give you energy to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.290 
fuel your brain and give you energy to
the<00:02:55.360> body<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> muscles<00:02:56.590> your<00:02:57.280> body<00:02:57.459> uses

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
the body to the muscles your body uses

ketones<00:02:58.959> oh<00:02:59.320> yeah<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.489> got<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.670> do<00:03:00.790> another

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
ketones oh yeah I got to do another

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
in those range ranges depending on if

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.500 
in those range ranges depending on if

number are the grams of proteins that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.840 
number are the grams of proteins that
you<00:03:48.640> would<00:03:48.760> consume<00:03:49.120> are<00:03:49.739> indicative<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:50.920> how

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
you would consume are indicative of how

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.610 
you would consume are indicative of how
much<00:03:52.000> activity<00:03:52.329> you're<00:03:52.600> doing<00:03:52.630> with<00:03:53.410> weight

much activity you're doing with weight

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.330 
much activity you're doing with weight
training<00:03:54.030> alright<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.660> would<00:03:56.380> say<00:03:56.650> between

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
training alright so I would say between

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.960 
training alright so I would say between
one<00:03:57.970> week<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.959> six<00:03:59.890> to<00:04:00.070> seven<00:04:00.400> weeks<00:04:00.459> it'll

one week to six to seven weeks it'll

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.300 
one week to six to seven weeks it'll
take<00:04:01.239> for<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.600> adapt<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.650> cannot<00:04:03.010> cheat
