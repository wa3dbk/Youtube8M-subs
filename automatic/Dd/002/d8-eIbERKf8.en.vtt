00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.669
 hey i am sanne in this video we go 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.910
 watch the hp elitepad 900 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.540
 this is a windows 8 pro tablet and like 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.460
 that much 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.589
 windows 8 tablets and also products from 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.460
 hp this is a tablet focused on the 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.020
 business market 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.720
 it does not make me the most ideal 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.220
 tester and although the glass art's matters 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.250
 i'm not a business 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.660
 users as ht intended by rifle 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.250
 old way of course of course this one 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.140
 tablet and view and also my 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.980
 experiences with things with you too 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.329
 share 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.339
 it is a perfectly beautiful tablet to 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.839
 he feels super solid and that 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.789
 is mainly due to the choices for construction 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.839
 materials and the way in which each other 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.820
 is set 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.890
 aluminum on the back and a 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.410
 moral glass 2 point 0 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.839
 front foot just super sturdy 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.339
 is a plastic element to ensure that 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.359
 signals of course just right 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.800
 get through 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.159
 It is an element that we are becoming 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.719
 more tablet they are seeing his wife 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.370
 or are and never and through the edit 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.359
 have between plastic elementum make sure that 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.069
 that through NFC 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.159
 all those kinds of things just all right 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:05.300
 works are a few striking things 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.400
 to this tablet where we will be right away 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.750
 actually come in the review on 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.280
 but first let's get the back 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.560
 and then we see it anyway 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.660
 just little connection to this tablet 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.730
 is just the suspicious little 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.220
 connections even see the 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.750
 volume button and that makes sense 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.610
 now maybe an 8 megapixel camera with 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.950
 and I fish at the back and then sit 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.660
 at the back a kind of flap 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.790
 what looks like a sim price if you like that 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.800
 knows for example from an ipad that has to 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.260
 then you open with a pin 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.010
 under this cover there is room for one 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.740
 place the door and micro sd cards 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.440
 a simple if you give in three if you 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.270
 the 64 gigabyte version comes with 4 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.760
 gigabyte and a 3d function 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.670
 the 32 gigabyte version comes without 3g 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.530
 function and I can actually do that 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.820
 stop about the connection to the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.130
 bottom is still there of course 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.350
 two speakers and a dock connector 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.960
 the top an on-off button and now and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.180
 how to let screen rotation switch and one 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.090
 place to put your headphones but none 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.780
 usb no hdmi and that is anyway 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.359
 striking for sure for a tablet that 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.219
 is business oriented there has hp smart 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.780
 jackets for 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.069
 bit like a front cover 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.560
 slide in and that kind of 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.410
 add functionality or a 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.819
 village or and a smart I check with a 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.860
 keyboard 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.450
 which has driven you going hp unfortunately 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.920
 included so I can not already 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.270
 say too much about it 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.959
 if just involve it on the tablet 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.760
 so miss those connections 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.550
 Another striking thing about the HP 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.319
 elitepad 900 is the screen resolution 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.150
 10.1 inch screen has a resolution of 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.030
 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.739
 And that's just not enough to split 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.610
 screen function of windows 8 too 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.650
 use 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.810
 it is called windows fast function according to 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 me and that I now have two apps side by side 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610
 can run on the screen but there comes 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.989
 a horizontal resolution too short and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.610
 is therefore not supported 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.720
 aap deliberately chose it because 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.910
 he is business tablet and the software 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.900
 developed for many companies 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.970
 the one here 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.400
 yes is not soon or update a dragon 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.260
 all of course within that 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.940
 windows 8 desktop interface 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.730
 This tablet running because you 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.650
 an intel atom processor runs and has 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.180
 so just access their texas 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.430
 software just say he who I can 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.519
 by installing this resolution 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.440
 no strange scaling is required 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.780
 have format adjustment 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.030
 some of those from the high and hardware 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.769
 which comes with a hi-res resolution or one 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.140
 high resolution screen 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.820
 therefore see software in the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.670
 desktop interface and often very weird 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.019
 from a very, very small, mainly because 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.060
 windows 8 just right now 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.390
 falls short when it comes to scaling of 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.480
 apps 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.040
 it is possible to put on 150 at 200% 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.680
 but then we often get advice 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.450
 effects software so right here 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.220
 consciously opted for a standard 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.650
 revolution that we know of a lot 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.660
 computer screen at work and a lot 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.640
 hold laptops from work 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.010
 so that software that is made for 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.700
 A business user simply works on it 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.530
 this tablet 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.390
 fortunately that is not very powerful 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.850
 Software often are often a kind 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.859
 spreadsheet-like applications and that 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.450
 turn it all very well on one 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.640
 atom processor 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.829
 powerful application is often difficult 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.239
 an atom-processor web involved ten 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.610
 talked about 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.990
 photo show video editing in that kind 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.060
 you just don't have to do anything 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.889
 want with a tablet that is on one 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.259
 atom-processor the drives 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.509
 just how it has windows 8 pro also 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.590
 some extra functionalities when going on 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.990
 software area 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.729
 to support that there is an encrypt 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.039
 hard drive income and things like that 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.310
 that's all nice that it is windows 8 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.469
 pro is the modern can of windows 8 pro 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.990
 it looks the same as windows rt 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.150
 and normal windows 8 versions or other 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.340
 windows 8 version because know so 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.629
 of course in the meantime it is 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.580
 just good to still subscribe kit 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.439
 you can do that within that modern interface 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.840
 download apps from the app store 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.870
 but the standard application standard 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.699
 application that gets care of in 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.319
 Basically all function that you put on one 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.930
 simple tablet would like to do so there is 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.819
 A browser is a way to email you 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.979
 photos weather reports the newest carica 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.120
 and all that sit functionality 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.129
 of course just all in that 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.289
 tiles interface that you just click on 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:21.949
 update more information behind that 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.349
 tiles are the windows 8 store 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.969
 it's coming more and more apps is 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.560
 to recognize growth but is not 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.650
 explosive so we are still 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.360
 still don't like too many apps too 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.270
 get in the windows store but it 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.589
 starts the starts growing and all in all 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.449
 that actually the most interesting thing you 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:40.069
 can say about which tablet is striking 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.169
 so the screen is actually not enough 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.419
 comes to resolution to all functions of 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.669
 support windows 8 but it is 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.689
 good that hb thought about that for a moment 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.270
 says dude 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.889
 Listen this way we can do the 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.120
 applications simply exist better 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.649
 view 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.389
 the screen itself has by the way 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.879
 fine angles get good color rendering 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.830
 and I think it's a great screen 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.500
 to look at and has a quality 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.509
 which I often describe as calm and yes 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.009
 I always appreciate that in one in one 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.099
 tablet so there I have in principle 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.120
 little to complain about 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.300
 again that build quality just slept 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.449
 is just mustache that really should be one 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.409
 super solid device and those karmas 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.060
 and things like that are all 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.409
 usable but nothing to go home about 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.990
 to write the same applies of course 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.699
 swimming is the same for the speaker 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.349
 we the smart jackets 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.479
 and not the village and things like that 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.219
 have been able to test and that makes 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.029
 probably also the total package one 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.639
 much more interesting 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:36.080
 may be more expensive the compelling gigabyte 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.629
 version of this tablet already costs 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.240
 730 euros and you soon have two hands 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:44.360
 euro also think every 64 gigabytes 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.310
 with 3g functionality 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.599
 then certainly come in 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.250
 combination with then a few of those 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:51.410
 accessories that you then purchase 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.080
 anyway soon wherever you get one 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.419
 very handsome ultrabook form or buy one 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.160
 can buy an ultrabook and a tablet for 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.229
 so for normal consumers I don't see 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.360
 really why this tablet is recommended 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:05.030
 then I think you know about watching 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.289
 hp envy x2 that when have the review 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:10.580
 for a business use or an idea 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.410
 manager who is a lot of close 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.630
 bribe clearly and on different 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.979
 flex spaces dox of taking care of that 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.900
 are connected to keyboards and 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.310
 screens and things like that is best 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.680
 an interesting device to visit 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.509
 look for again just normal 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.310
 consumer light price I just think too 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:27.560
 high and although those construction qualities 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.330
 as never is I do not really see why 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.699

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.370
 yes you should consider that well 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:38.270
 is my view on the hp envy or no 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.220
 hp elitepad almost 900 hp envy x2 so 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.169
 more interesting for normal consumers 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.550
