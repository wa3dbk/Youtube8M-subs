00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.910
 it does not look anything like what I wanted 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 to do is a mess is more than a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 art attack looks like an attack on art 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.240
 this is art attack and look I think with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 a little help we can improve it 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.090
 what do you think a little blue I like 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090
 I like it 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.890
 It covers all over the entire surface 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.550
 perfect 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.470
 perfect, I think it's much better in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.070
 say that if an artist I think there's 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.070
 a lot of potential 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.780
 good guys we have a new friend your 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.600
 name is emi and he is really an artist 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.120
 how are you here very well and santi I am 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.740
 very happy for being here and not 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.510
 We can lose this new 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 season of art attack and they should not 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.860
 miss nothing because this season is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.470
 incredible there are very large objects others 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.380
 very small and it's very fun 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 the giant art with the artist alexis 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.020
 that he hides some things while 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.050
 is working and you have to be very 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.729
 attentive to be able to see them how is this going 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.540
 to finish you attack with materials 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.360
 recycled 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.150
 It's very simple and it's very funny if 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.500
 you care about the environment and 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.560
 you really care about taking care of the planet 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.800
 you must not vote neither bottles nor cartons 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 because you can reuse it in art 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.130
 attacks that we are going to do in this 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.720
 give us a tip for the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.440
 moment of creation for me the most 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.119
 important is to let the imagination fly 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.590
 and that any time can be a 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.100
 good time for a this case 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.100
 artistic 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.120
 perfect but really you think that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.270
 I have an artist inside of me 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.850
 Of course, holy yes, you should only let go 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.160
 imagination and let yourself be carried away by one 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.500
 artistic case then I'm in the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.240
 indicated place and you friends do not know 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.670
 miss the new season of art tag 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.170
 I keep improving my drawing with the help 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.170
 from emi and see you in the next 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.670
 Let's see
