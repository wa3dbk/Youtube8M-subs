 the first of all tv was occurring 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.400
 because that was when a child in the Brazilian 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.880

 Three things I tell the most 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:18.370

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:25.239

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:29.049
 opinion and laziness if your life is one 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:34.860

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.390
 la vida is and carnival is life 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.140
 a carnival 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.709

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.560
 the worst gift you ever had 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:08.040
 I would have given away as a present 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.040
 such a list what you have given away 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.860
 that's probably how bad it is 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.150
 again displaced with whom would you 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.010
 because like to drink a coffee 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:25.450

 I regret 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.680
 who is your biggest role model as 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.780
 swayed fluctuates between strong 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.120
 I admire women because they are 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.400
 assertive because they were against 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.780
 the stream are swum and then 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.180
 sometimes very close as well 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 example, my mother 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.500
 what is the best way to get down 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.440
 the best way to get down is 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.440
 just chill what are you afraid of 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.360

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.880

 What can you not there 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.610
 many things I can 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.020
 but I try everything 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:27.250
 if you had a superpower which 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.030
 would be there fly what is that 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.880
 strangest german word exists also 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.650
 many strange words what would you do 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.620
 between for example could if 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.810
 one arrives in Germany and his 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.030
 Papers legalized here as foreigners 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.600
 and then you have to read that word and 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.710
 temporary residence permit 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.830
 ok, if you did that 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.790
 Do you deserve it ? Who do you have? 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.170
 Last time a message was written 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.350
 to do the message today 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.350

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.830
 who is that some former 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.480
 band colleague first lovesick 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.630

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.770

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.550
 Three things that you take from your mother 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.550
 have learned 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:35.960
 respect the others respect the 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.500
 other because my mother has me like that 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.620
 Human values ​​were very important to her 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.220
 respectful cohesion has always said 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.530
 only with love can you build up 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:53.600
 that's nice what a typical woman is 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:56.690
 you do not know that but I think so 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.570
 I conclude the opposite of what 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.890
