crazy here Ellen looks like we got

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.919 
crazy here Ellen looks like we got
normal<00:01:50.799> thing<00:01:51.009> these<00:01:51.670> were<00:01:51.880> starting<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.299> have

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
normal thing these were starting to have

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.570 
normal thing these were starting to have
a<00:01:53.170> lot<00:01:53.469> less<00:01:53.740> extras

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
a lot less extras

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.260 
a lot less extras
sometimes<00:01:56.450> when<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:56.780> find

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
sometimes when we find

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.599 
sometimes when we find
a<00:01:57.329> little<00:01:57.719> extra<00:01:58.140> thing<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.100> even<00:01:59.310> get

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
a little extra thing we don't even get

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.240 
a little extra thing we don't even get
an<00:01:59.759> extra<00:02:00.299> which<00:02:00.679> doesn't<00:02:01.679> make<00:02:01.799> much<00:02:02.009> sense

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.330 

but<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:05.880> guess<00:02:05.970> that's<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.230> but<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
but I guess that's what they do but I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.390 
but I guess that's what they do but I
personally<00:02:08.789> believe<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.190> have

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
personally believe like when you have

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
personally believe like when you have
plus<00:02:11.820> extras<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.540> personally<00:02:13.020> believe

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
plus extras but I personally believe

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.530 
plus extras but I personally believe
sorry<00:02:13.890> that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
sorry that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.289 
sorry that
II<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:17.110> started<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.579> should<00:02:18.909> always

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
II that started that they should always

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.050 
II that started that they should always
have<00:02:19.450> extras<00:02:19.959> until<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.439> get<00:02:20.709> all<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.129> extras

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
have extras until you get all the extras

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.360 
have extras until you get all the extras
power<00:02:23.540> whatever<00:02:24.080> maybe<00:02:24.620> they<00:02:24.800> just<00:02:24.830> remove

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
power whatever maybe they just remove

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.059 
power whatever maybe they just remove
all<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> extra<00:02:26.030> things

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069
