00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
systems cords in through this side and

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.400 
systems cords in through this side and
then<00:03:34.450> your<00:03:34.870> video<00:03:35.560> camera<00:03:35.799> AV<00:03:36.420> AV<00:03:37.420> cords

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
then your video camera AV AV cords

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.160 
then your video camera AV AV cords
through<00:03:38.709> here<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.160> should<00:03:39.970> play<00:03:40.209> through

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
through here and should play through

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.000 
through here and should play through
this<00:03:41.380> from<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.280> system<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.620> then<00:03:44.620> from

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
this from a system to this then from

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.699 
this from a system to this then from
this<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.580> your<00:03:45.730> camera<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.329> then<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.500> would

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
this to your camera and then you would

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.800 
this to your camera and then you would
just<00:03:47.739> capture<00:03:48.340> from<00:03:48.610> whatever<00:03:49.150> program<00:03:49.690> you

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
just capture from whatever program you

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.610 
just capture from whatever program you
use<00:03:50.079> and<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:52.269> would<00:03:52.720> be<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:55.180> you

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
use and that would be it and if you

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.080 
use and that would be it and if you
wouldn't<00:03:56.620> have<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.769> firewire<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.820> would<00:03:57.940> be<00:03:58.060> a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
wouldn't have a firewire that would be a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.699 
wouldn't have a firewire that would be a
problem<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:59.530> get<00:03:59.680> your<00:03:59.950> video<00:04:00.700> camera

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
problem to get your video camera

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.979 
problem to get your video camera
actually<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.820> might<00:04:04.180> be<00:04:04.390> able<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.600> get<00:04:04.810> your

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
actually you might be able to get your

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.110 
actually you might be able to get your
video<00:04:05.470> through<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.250> USB<00:04:08.430> but<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.579> depends<00:04:09.880> on

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
video through on USB but it depends on

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.610
