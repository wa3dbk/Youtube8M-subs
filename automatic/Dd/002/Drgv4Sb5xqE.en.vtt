00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.009 
now it's gonna be up to you vote wise
but<00:03:40.989> I'm<00:03:41.139> actually<00:03:41.319> thinking<00:03:41.889> about

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
but I'm actually thinking about

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.420 
but I'm actually thinking about
potentially<00:03:44.019> adding<00:03:44.260> in<00:03:44.739> oh<00:03:47.190> where<00:03:48.190> was<00:03:48.370> that

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
potentially adding in oh where was that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.589 
potentially adding in oh where was that
one<00:03:48.849> it<00:03:48.970> was<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.049> would<00:03:50.229> be<00:03:51.599> behind

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
one it was there so it would be behind

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.890 
one it was there so it would be behind
the<00:03:52.780> last<00:03:53.079> one<00:03:53.409> here<00:03:54.159> so<00:03:54.879> we'd<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.449> extend

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
the last one here so we'd have to extend

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.129 
the last one here so we'd have to extend
the<00:03:56.079> wall<00:03:56.349> out<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:57.129> little<00:03:57.879> bit<00:03:58.180> but

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
the wall out a little bit but

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.960 
the wall out a little bit but
essentially<00:03:59.889> adding<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.220> third<00:04:00.489> monitor<00:04:00.729> to

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
essentially adding a third monitor to

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.719 
essentially adding a third monitor to
kind<00:04:01.209> of<00:04:01.269> give<00:04:01.449> it<00:04:01.479> some<00:04:01.750> height<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.639> don't<00:04:03.639> know

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:03.729 
kind of give it some height I don't know

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.960 
kind of give it some height I don't know
how<00:04:03.849> this<00:04:04.030> would<00:04:04.209> look<00:04:04.269> let's<00:04:04.720> take<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.900> look

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970

it on this side too so you guys can make
a<00:05:08.430> guesstimate<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.610> peg<00:05:09.850> up<00:05:10.150> an<00:05:10.440> opinion<00:05:11.440> I

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
a guesstimate it a peg up an opinion I

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.490 
a guesstimate it a peg up an opinion I
guess<00:05:12.540> so<00:05:13.540> we'll<00:05:13.660> go<00:05:13.750> ahead<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.020> take<00:05:14.350> this

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
guess so we'll go ahead and take this

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.670 
guess so we'll go ahead and take this
one<00:05:14.710> out<00:05:15.780> 3.high<00:05:17.760> put<00:05:18.760> in<00:05:18.880> three<00:05:19.240> there<00:05:19.680> think

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
one out 3.high put in three there think

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.280 
one out 3.high put in three there think
we<00:05:20.800> have<00:05:20.920> it<00:05:21.070> going<00:05:21.280> three<00:05:21.580> right<00:05:22.890> like<00:05:23.890> so<00:05:25.290> put
