00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the lightest color that it comes in so I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.029 
the lightest color that it comes in so I
have<00:00:24.330> pretty<00:00:24.930> white<00:00:25.170> skin<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.859> see

a top with holes I don't know if you can
see<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.950> um<00:01:14.299> that<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
see that or not and that um that kind of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
see that or not and that um that kind of
like<00:01:15.900> sips<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.439> through<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.159> don't

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
like sips it through so that you don't

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.010 
like sips it through so that you don't
get<00:01:17.460> too<00:01:17.759> much<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:20.659> but<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
get too much out at that one time but I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.260 
get too much out at that one time but I
don't<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:23.040> why<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.369> did<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:23.970> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
don't see why they did that because you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
don't see why they did that because you
can<00:01:24.420> still<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> lot<00:01:25.259> way<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.100> than<00:01:26.159> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
can still get a lot way more than you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.450 
can still get a lot way more than you
need<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:27.030> face<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
need for face way more and what I do is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330 
need for face way more and what I do is
I<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.240> brush<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.009> then<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.130> always

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
I just get my brush in and then I always

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.080 
I just get my brush in and then I always
take<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.329> tap<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.799> limb<00:01:35.090> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
take it off or tap it up on the limb and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
take it off or tap it up on the limb and
then<00:01:36.540> apply<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.100> need<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
then apply it and then you just need a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
then apply it and then you just need a
very<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:39.119> bit<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.450> know<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.720> does<00:01:39.869> not

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
very little bit you know it does not

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
very little bit you know it does not
take<00:01:40.380> much<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:42.180> go<00:01:42.329> back<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.720> do

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
take much and then to go back I just do

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
take much and then to go back I just do
a<00:01:43.049> little<00:01:43.320> tap<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> already<00:01:44.640> did<00:01:44.939> on

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
a little tap and what I already did on

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.700 
a little tap and what I already did on
here<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.960> helps<00:01:46.290> save<00:01:46.530> them<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.970> then

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
here and that helps save them and then

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.350 
here and that helps save them and then
lined<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.130> put<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> lid<00:01:50.820> back<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

when you put the lid on there's going to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.399 
when you put the lid on there's going to
be<00:01:53.549> powder<00:01:54.060> falling<00:01:54.630> around<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.229> make<00:01:55.380> sure
