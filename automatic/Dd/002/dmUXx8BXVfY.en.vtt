00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
also on the other singer is the same

finger but the other fingers are like

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.289 
finger but the other fingers are like
still<00:00:55.329> really<00:00:55.749> really<00:00:55.989> good<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.969> i<00:00:57.999> actually

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
still really really good so i actually

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.509 
still really really good so i actually
think<00:00:58.839> that<00:00:58.960> this<00:00:59.170> might<00:00:59.440> even<00:00:59.710> last<00:01:00.159> like

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
think that this might even last like

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.410 
think that this might even last like
five<00:01:00.850> five<00:01:01.600> or<00:01:01.809> maybe<00:01:01.929> even<00:01:02.079> 60s<00:01:02.769> if<00:01:03.039> you<00:01:03.729> make

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
five five or maybe even 60s if you make

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.330 
five five or maybe even 60s if you make
sure<00:01:04.660> your<00:01:04.840> nails<00:01:05.080> are<00:01:05.410> really<00:01:05.770> buff<00:01:05.980> to<00:01:06.250> have
