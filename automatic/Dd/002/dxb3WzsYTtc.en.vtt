I really don't mind the downstate PV I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
I really don't mind the downstate PV I
think<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.009> cool<00:01:38.220> mechanic<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
think it's a really cool mechanic and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
think it's a really cool mechanic and
you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> calculate<00:01:40.320> your

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you know like you have to calculate your

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
you know like you have to calculate your
head<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> worth<00:01:41.189> picking<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.579> guy<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
head is it worth picking this guy up and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.960 
head is it worth picking this guy up and
risking<00:01:43.380> myself<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> thing

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
risking myself because that's the thing

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.950 
risking myself because that's the thing
you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.180> obviously<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.659> you're<00:01:45.720> picking

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you know obviously when you're picking

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560 
you know obviously when you're picking
somebody<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.579> hit<00:01:47.790> by<00:01:47.970> boss

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
somebody up you can get hit by boss

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.569 
somebody up you can get hit by boss

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.960 
really enjoy the PVE in this game is
pretty<00:01:52.140> fun<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:53.040> thing<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
pretty fun one thing I don't like is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.560 
pretty fun one thing I don't like is
that<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.720> PvE<00:01:55.110> tokens<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.820> get<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> gear<00:01:57.360> are

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that the PvE tokens to get the gear are

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
that the PvE tokens to get the gear are
based<00:01:58.380> off<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> dungeons<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.759> that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
based off the dungeons so what that

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.270 
based off the dungeons so what that
means<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.280> specific

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
means is if you want to get a specific

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.920 
means is if you want to get a specific
set<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> gear<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.030> means<00:02:03.630> they're<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
set of gear that means they're going to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.319 
set of gear that means they're going to
be<00:02:04.020> spamming<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.590> same<00:02:04.950> dungeon<00:02:05.490> over<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
be spamming that same dungeon over and

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.910 
be spamming that same dungeon over and
over<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> over<00:02:06.990> again<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.380> think<00:02:07.530> they<00:02:07.740> should

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
over and over again I think they should

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.219 
over and over again I think they should
just<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.520> set<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.940> tokens<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.959> every

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
just have one set of tokens for every

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.690 
just have one set of tokens for every
dungeon<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.039> experience<00:02:11.400> all

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
boss but the ads keep spawning and that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.070 
boss but the ads keep spawning and that
you<00:02:50.370> can't<00:02:50.640> kill<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.060> boss<00:02:51.239> unless<00:02:51.780> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
you can't kill the boss unless you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.039 
you can't kill the boss unless you
physically<00:02:52.560> glitch<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.190> fight<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.640> use<00:02:54.049> what

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
physically glitch the fight and use what

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.570 
physically glitch the fight and use what
some<00:02:55.260> would<00:02:55.410> say<00:02:55.530> an<00:02:55.650> exploit<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.400> it's

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
some would say an exploit but it's

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.059 
some would say an exploit but it's
really<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.970> only<00:02:57.000> way<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.739> kill<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
really the only way you can kill the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.750 
really the only way you can kill the
boss<00:02:59.299> because<00:03:00.769> it<00:03:01.769> keeps<00:03:01.920> spawning<00:03:02.400> these<00:03:02.519> ads

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
boss because it keeps spawning these ads

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.280 
boss because it keeps spawning these ads
they're<00:03:03.030> not<00:03:03.150> supposed<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.599> keep<00:03:03.720> spawning<00:03:03.989> so

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
they're not supposed to keep spawning so

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.839 
they're not supposed to keep spawning so
the<00:03:04.410> fight<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.739> impossible<00:03:05.400> unless<00:03:05.549> you

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
the fight is impossible unless you

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.430 
the fight is impossible unless you
exploit<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.599> fights<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.200> use<00:03:07.410> a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
exploit the fights you have to use a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.970 
exploit the fights you have to use a
glitch<00:03:07.890> because<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.150> glitch<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:10.680> doesn't

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
glitch because of a glitch it doesn't

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.770 
glitch because of a glitch it doesn't
make<00:03:11.040> any<00:03:11.099> sense<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> boss<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.330> lynched

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
make any sense so the boss is lynched

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.690 
make any sense so the boss is lynched
you<00:03:13.080> can't<00:03:13.380> kill<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.799> unless<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.160> physically

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
you can't kill it unless you physically

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.430 
you can't kill it unless you physically
use<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> glitch<00:03:15.420> which<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.840> kind<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.230> little

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
use a glitch which is kind of a little

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.900 
use a glitch which is kind of a little
bit<00:03:16.560> cheap<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> only<00:03:17.489> way<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.730> can

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
bit cheap but it's the only way you can

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.060 
bit cheap but it's the only way you can
do<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.390> here's<00:03:18.989> what<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.500> pretty<00:03:19.920> much

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
do it so here's what that is pretty much

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.620 
do it so here's what that is pretty much
what<00:03:20.130> we<00:03:20.280> had<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.519> do<00:03:20.609> is<00:03:20.820> run<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:21.150> these<00:03:21.329> stairs

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
what we had to do is run up these stairs

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.050 
what we had to do is run up these stairs
run<00:03:22.049> all<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.500> way<00:03:22.530> around<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:23.100> outside<00:03:23.730> and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
run all the way around this outside and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.440 
run all the way around this outside and
that<00:03:24.810> would<00:03:25.019> make<00:03:25.140> us<00:03:25.350> lose<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.769> ads<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.760> then

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
that would make us lose the ads and then

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.690 
that would make us lose the ads and then
from<00:03:27.690> right<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.200> we<00:03:28.829> could<00:03:29.010> shoot<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.400> boss

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
from right here we could shoot this boss

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.729 
from right here we could shoot this boss
if<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.299> got<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.109> right<00:03:31.260> spot<00:03:31.560> we

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
if we got just in the right spot we

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.039 
if we got just in the right spot we
could<00:03:31.890> shoot<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.220> boss<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.930> pretty<00:03:33.930> much

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
could shoot this boss and pretty much

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.930 
could shoot this boss and pretty much
just<00:03:34.260> not<00:03:34.530> take<00:03:34.829> any<00:03:35.040> damage<00:03:35.190> non<00:03:35.579> there<00:03:35.819> I

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
just not take any damage non there I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.550 
just not take any damage non there I
mean<00:03:36.209> honestly<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.959> not<00:03:37.109> really<00:03:37.319> an<00:03:37.410> egg

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
mean honestly it's not really an egg

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.319 
mean honestly it's not really an egg
it's<00:03:37.980> kind<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.400> an<00:03:38.519> exploit<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.910> don't<00:03:39.150> think

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
it's kind of an exploit I don't think

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.190 
it's kind of an exploit I don't think
it's<00:03:39.450> intended<00:03:39.840> uh<00:03:40.819> but<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:42.630> can't<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:43.079> it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
it's intended uh but you can't do it

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.629 
it's intended uh but you can't do it
because<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.530> ads<00:03:43.680> keep<00:03:44.010> spawning<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.579> you

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
because the ads keep spawning and you

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.400 
because the ads keep spawning and you
see<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.910> ads<00:03:45.030> right<00:03:45.239> there<00:03:45.480> they<00:03:45.750> get<00:03:45.900> lost<00:03:46.109> on

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
see the ads right there they get lost on

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.319 
see the ads right there they get lost on
the<00:03:46.500> stairs<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.010> kind<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.549> bug<00:03:47.850> out<00:03:48.030> and

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
the stairs and kind of like bug out and

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.120 
the stairs and kind of like bug out and
here<00:03:48.810> we<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:49.049> shoot<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.350> boss<00:03:49.500> now<00:03:49.769> this

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
here we just shoot the boss now this

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.789 
here we just shoot the boss now this
would<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.730> really<00:03:51.420> easy<00:03:51.810> fight<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.650> ads

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
would be a really easy fight if the ads

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.990 
would be a really easy fight if the ads
didn't<00:03:53.130> keep<00:03:53.250> spawning<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.850> did<00:03:53.970> it

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
didn't keep spawning and you did it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.550 
didn't keep spawning and you did it
normally<00:03:54.359> you're<00:03:54.480> on<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.750> thing<00:03:55.049> you're<00:03:55.530> on
