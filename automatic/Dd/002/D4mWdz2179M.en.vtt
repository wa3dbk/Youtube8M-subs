imagine<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.919> one<00:00:08.160> morning<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.120> day<00:00:09.330> started

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
imagine that one morning the day started

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.020 
imagine that one morning the day started
like<00:00:09.870> any<00:00:10.230> other<00:00:10.429> but<00:00:11.429> with<00:00:11.610> one<00:00:11.790> big

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
like any other but with one big

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.700 
like any other but with one big
difference<00:00:12.799> all<00:00:13.799> humans<00:00:14.340> had<00:00:14.910> vanished<00:00:15.710> what

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
difference all humans had vanished what

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.420 
difference all humans had vanished what
would<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> earth<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.220> like<00:00:17.490> without<00:00:18.359> people

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
would the earth be like without people

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.700 
would the earth be like without people
obviously<00:00:20.430> much<00:00:20.609> quieter<00:00:21.380> but<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.560> would

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
obviously much quieter but what would

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.189 
obviously much quieter but what would
actually<00:00:22.859> happen<00:00:23.359> could<00:00:24.359> nature<00:00:24.750> wipe<00:00:24.960> out

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
actually happen could nature wipe out

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.550 
actually happen could nature wipe out
all<00:00:25.590> traces<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.310> our<00:00:26.609> existence<00:00:27.260> some<00:00:28.260> things

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
all traces of our existence some things

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
all traces of our existence some things
would<00:00:28.890> change<00:00:28.949> very<00:00:29.460> quickly<00:00:32.780> first<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
would change very quickly first the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
would change very quickly first the
power<00:00:34.440> utilities<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.640> start<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> shut<00:00:36.329> down

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
power utilities would start to shut down

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.860 
power utilities would start to shut down
in<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.649> city<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.129> New<00:00:38.340> York<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.329> pumps<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
subways would switch off and the water

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.130 
subways would switch off and the water
would<00:00:42.270> pour<00:00:42.540> in

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140

the<00:00:46.890> streets<00:00:47.190> above<00:00:47.490> would<00:00:48.030> erode<00:00:48.300> quickly

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the streets above would erode quickly

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.490 
the streets above would erode quickly
collapse<00:00:49.850> within<00:00:50.850> days<00:00:51.210> nature<00:00:52.020> would<00:00:52.170> begin
