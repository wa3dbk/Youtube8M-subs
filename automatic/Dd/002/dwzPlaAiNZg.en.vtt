it's like a black and purple but um it's

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.150 
it's like a black and purple but um it's
a<00:03:43.420> great<00:03:43.630> eyeliner<00:03:44.110> because<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.799> can<00:03:44.950> really

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
a great eyeliner because you can really

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.670 
a great eyeliner because you can really
smudge<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.760> as<00:03:45.910> well<00:03:46.120> build<00:03:46.570> up<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.930> color<00:03:47.110> so

smudge it as well build up the color so
it's<00:03:47.829> really<00:03:48.040> dark<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:49.720> quite<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.959> nice

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
it's really dark so it's quite a nice

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.569 
it's really dark so it's quite a nice
one<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.620> mean<00:03:50.799> it's<00:03:50.950> probably<00:03:51.280> not<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.549> best

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
one I mean it's probably not the best

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.850 
one I mean it's probably not the best
eyeliner<00:03:52.329> there<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.870> out<00:03:53.079> there<00:03:53.110> but<00:03:53.590> knowing

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
eyeliner there is out there but knowing

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.380 
eyeliner there is out there but knowing
that<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.100> organic<00:03:54.610> for<00:03:55.120> an<00:03:55.180> organic

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
that it's organic for an organic

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.970 
that it's organic for an organic
eyeliner<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:56.019> think<00:03:56.290> it's<00:03:56.440> really<00:03:56.680> really<00:03:56.950> good

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
bit watery you can put it on and it's

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.910 
bit watery you can put it on and it's
hard<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.690> takes<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:02.079> long<00:04:02.260> time<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.560> work

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.740 
sometimes I found I have to warm up with
a<00:04:06.130> hairdryer<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.329> one<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.630> actually

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
a hairdryer but this one is actually

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.360 
a hairdryer but this one is actually
really<00:04:08.170> creamy<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:10.829> 1175<00:04:11.829> for<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.220> full

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.270 
sample and but i think that a perfume
sample<00:06:13.930> that<00:06:14.380> I<00:06:14.440> probably<00:06:14.680> wouldn't<00:06:15.130> have

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
sample that I probably wouldn't have

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.430 
sample that I probably wouldn't have
tried<00:06:15.490> anywhere<00:06:15.910> else<00:06:16.090> is<00:06:16.360> quite<00:06:16.780> nice<00:06:16.960> so<00:06:17.410> I

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
tried anywhere else is quite nice so I

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.050 
tried anywhere else is quite nice so I
have<00:06:17.710> discovered<00:06:18.010> new<00:06:18.250> perfumes<00:06:18.700> from<00:06:18.820> being

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
have discovered new perfumes from being

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.310 
have discovered new perfumes from being
sent<00:06:19.270> samples<00:06:19.510> and<00:06:20.130> this<00:06:21.130> is<00:06:21.400> actually<00:06:21.970> an<00:06:22.320> oil

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
sent samples and this is actually an oil

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.890 
sent samples and this is actually an oil
and<00:06:23.670> when<00:06:24.670> I<00:06:24.700> first<00:06:24.940> saw<00:06:25.120> this<00:06:25.300> I<00:06:25.450> thought<00:06:25.480> okay

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
and when I first saw this I thought okay

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.140 
and when I first saw this I thought okay
this<00:06:25.930> is<00:06:26.230> a<00:06:26.260> pretty<00:06:26.620> small<00:06:27.100> amount<00:06:27.580> of<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.000> oil

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
this is a pretty small amount of the oil

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.840 
this is a pretty small amount of the oil
to<00:06:28.420> give<00:06:28.540> someone<00:06:28.960> but<00:06:29.710> when<00:06:30.220> I<00:06:30.250> looked<00:06:30.580> add

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
to give someone but when I looked add

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.280 
to give someone but when I looked add
the<00:06:31.060> little<00:06:31.210> hand<00:06:31.510> out<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.870> says<00:06:32.020> that<00:06:32.050> the

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
the little hand out it says that the

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.860 
the little hand out it says that the
full<00:06:32.530> size<00:06:32.770> which<00:06:33.070> is<00:06:33.220> three<00:06:33.460> point<00:06:33.940> the<00:06:34.630> full

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
full size which is three point the full

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.300 
full size which is three point the full
size<00:06:35.080> of<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:35.320> three<00:06:35.530> point<00:06:35.740> six<00:06:35.950> milliliters

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
size of the three point six milliliters

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.760 
size of the three point six milliliters
is<00:06:36.820> actually<00:06:37.720> 41<00:06:38.140> pounds

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
is actually 41 pounds

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.809 
is actually 41 pounds
so<00:06:39.340> a<00:06:39.780> pretty<00:06:40.780> expensive<00:06:41.139> so<00:06:41.560> even<00:06:42.520> getting

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
so a pretty expensive so even getting

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.119 
so a pretty expensive so even getting
this<00:06:42.970> size<00:06:43.240> which<00:06:43.509> I<00:06:43.750> expect<00:06:44.229> is<00:06:44.590> probably

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
this size which I expect is probably

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.210 
this size which I expect is probably
about<00:06:45.280> a<00:06:45.400> milliliter<00:06:45.990> and<00:06:46.990> maybe<00:06:47.710> more<00:06:47.949> I

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
about a milliliter and maybe more I

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.850 
about a milliliter and maybe more I
don't<00:06:48.400> know<00:06:48.550> and<00:06:48.789> is<00:06:49.449> actually<00:06:49.960> generous

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
don't know and is actually generous

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.010 
don't know and is actually generous
amount<00:06:51.340> given<00:06:51.789> the<00:06:52.180> price<00:06:52.360> if<00:06:52.690> you<00:06:52.720> said<00:06:52.930> I

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
amount given the price if you said I

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.629 
amount given the price if you said I
mean<00:06:53.169> I<00:06:53.289> mean<00:06:53.440> overall<00:06:53.740> obviously<00:06:54.250> it's<00:06:54.490> not<00:06:54.550> a

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
mean I mean overall obviously it's not a

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.580 
mean I mean overall obviously it's not a
huge<00:06:54.819> amount<00:06:54.970> but<00:06:55.300> a<00:06:55.599> little<00:06:56.080> does<00:06:56.259> go<00:06:56.500> a<00:06:56.530> long

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
huge amount but a little does go a long

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.369 
huge amount but a little does go a long
way<00:06:56.919> it's<00:06:57.220> quite<00:06:57.460> potent<00:06:57.970> so<00:06:58.690> you<00:06:59.199> could

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379 
way it's quite potent so you could

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:00.659 
way it's quite potent so you could
probably<00:06:59.590> just<00:06:59.830> use<00:06:59.919> whatever's<00:07:00.460> on<00:07:00.550> the

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
probably just use whatever's on the

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.339 
probably just use whatever's on the
little<00:07:00.879> stick<00:07:01.180> put<00:07:01.690> that<00:07:01.810> on<00:07:01.870> your<00:07:02.050> pulse

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
little stick put that on your pulse

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.670 
little stick put that on your pulse
points<00:07:02.470> and<00:07:02.979> it<00:07:03.490> smells<00:07:03.840> really<00:07:04.840> quite

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
points and it smells really quite

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.469 
points and it smells really quite
strongly<00:07:06.129> for<00:07:06.610> the<00:07:06.729> amount<00:07:06.879> of<00:07:07.030> product<00:07:07.360> that

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 
strongly for the amount of product that

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.600 
strongly for the amount of product that
you've<00:07:07.629> put<00:07:07.810> on<00:07:07.870> and<00:07:08.409> also<00:07:08.680> being<00:07:09.009> an<00:07:09.129> oil<00:07:09.310> it

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
you've put on and also being an oil it

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.159 
you've put on and also being an oil it
kind<00:07:09.789> of<00:07:09.819> absorbs<00:07:10.270> into<00:07:10.419> your<00:07:10.569> skin<00:07:10.780> and<00:07:10.840> last

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:11.169 
kind of absorbs into your skin and last

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:12.600 
kind of absorbs into your skin and last
much<00:07:11.409> better<00:07:11.650> than<00:07:11.800> a<00:07:11.860> perfume<00:07:12.310> so<00:07:12.520> you

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
much better than a perfume so you

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.070 
much better than a perfume so you
probably<00:07:12.789> wouldn't<00:07:13.120> have<00:07:13.270> to<00:07:13.419> really<00:07:13.690> reapply

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
probably wouldn't have to really reapply

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.680 
probably wouldn't have to really reapply
it<00:07:14.139> that<00:07:14.409> often<00:07:14.560> and<00:07:15.360> it's<00:07:16.360> quite<00:07:16.659> a

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
it that often and it's quite a

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.659 
it that often and it's quite a
springtime<00:07:17.500> fragrance<00:07:18.310> it's<00:07:18.490> quite

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669
