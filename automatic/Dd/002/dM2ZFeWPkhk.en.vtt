not<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.940> zero<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.510> next<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
not just a zero and next to that is the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.060 
not just a zero and next to that is the
letters<00:01:02.399> neww<00:01:03.120> spells<00:01:03.660> new<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
letters neww spells new so when you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.910 
letters neww spells new so when you
first<00:01:05.250> load<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.350> number<00:01:07.619> 0

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

next<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.030> word<00:01:09.180> new<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:10.350> assuming

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
next to the word new and I'm assuming

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620 
next to the word new and I'm assuming
it's<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> zero<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.790> flashing<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's a zero but it is flashing so it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
it's a zero but it is flashing so it
could<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> cursor<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> maybe<00:01:14.369> just

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
could be like a cursor like a maybe just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
could be like a cursor like a maybe just
a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:14.700> selection<00:01:15.150> cursor<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.439> the
