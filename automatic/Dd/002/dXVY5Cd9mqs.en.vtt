00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.850 
on there yes that's right you pop them
up<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.990> think<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.260> might<00:01:44.410> not<00:01:44.530> get<00:01:44.680> that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
up you think you might not get that

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.260 
up you think you might not get that
bounce<00:01:45.010> yeah<00:01:45.640> probably

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
bounce yeah probably

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.570 
bounce yeah probably
okay<00:01:46.660> but<00:01:47.350> I'm<00:01:47.470> not<00:01:47.500> an<00:01:47.740> expert<00:01:47.980> think<00:01:48.340> about

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
okay but I'm not an expert think about

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.060 
okay but I'm not an expert think about
you<00:01:49.150> know<00:01:49.240> cuz<00:01:49.630> there's<00:01:49.810> just<00:01:50.710> just

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
you know cuz there's just just

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.710 
you know cuz there's just just
somethings<00:01:51.310> they<00:01:51.340> come<00:01:51.550> on<00:01:51.700> but<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.150> think<00:01:52.450> that

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
somethings they come on but I think that

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.760 
somethings they come on but I think that
might<00:01:52.900> because<00:01:53.200> you're<00:01:53.350> hitting<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.590> water

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
might because you're hitting the water

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.530 
might because you're hitting the water
and<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.100> says<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.400> want<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.640> pop<00:01:54.790> back<00:01:55.000> up<00:01:55.060> and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
and it says I want to pop back up and

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.360 
and it says I want to pop back up and
then<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.350> flaps<00:01:56.590> say<00:01:56.770> okay

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.650
