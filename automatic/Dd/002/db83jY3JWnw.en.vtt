anchor trawling

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.410 
anchor trawling
my<00:00:47.399> name<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.670> probably<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> best<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.329> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
my name is probably the best one that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.220 
my name is probably the best one that
I've<00:00:48.539> seen<00:00:48.780> yet<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:50.160> has<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.420> couple<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> systems

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I've seen yet it has a couple of systems

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.069 
I've seen yet it has a couple of systems
out<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.739> which<00:00:52.969> which<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> pulley

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
out here which which is the pulley

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.770 
out here which which is the pulley
system<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> back<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.780> anchor

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
system off the back and I use anchor

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.789 
system off the back and I use anchor
traction<00:00:58.289> model<00:00:59.750> which<00:01:03.110> in<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> little

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
traction model which in here a little

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
traction model which in here a little
bit<00:01:09.049> there's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.430> anchor<00:01:11.430> tracks<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> slide

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
bit there's a anchor tracks or the slide

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.179 
bit there's a anchor tracks or the slide
tracks<00:01:12.869> bar<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
tracks bar that's on there that I

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
tracks bar that's on there that I
modified<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> existing<00:01:15.600> holes

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
modified into one of the existing holes

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.289 
modified into one of the existing holes
it<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.460> put<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> pulley<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it was there and then put a pulley I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.230 
it was there and then put a pulley I
think<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> best<00:01:19.170> thing<00:01:19.380> I've<00:01:19.560> seen<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.400> his

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
think the best thing I've seen about his

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.140 
think the best thing I've seen about his
videos<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.810> each<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> his<00:01:25.409> lines

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
videos is that the each one of his lines

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.640 
videos is that the each one of his lines
it's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.450> clean<00:01:27.689> idea<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.380> he<00:01:28.470> takes

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it's a really clean idea but he takes

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
it's a really clean idea but he takes
each<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.130> his<00:01:29.220> lines<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.850> sews<00:01:30.600> them

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
each one of his lines and sews them

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.319 
each one of his lines and sews them
together<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:32.220> puts<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.579> heat<00:01:32.850> shrink<00:01:33.030> on

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
together and then puts a heat shrink on

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.109 
together and then puts a heat shrink on
there<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.720> keeps<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.170> quiet<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
there and it really keeps it quiet and

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.780 
there and it really keeps it quiet and
nice<00:01:36.119> nice<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.049> clean<00:01:37.350> look<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.460> ran

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
nice nice and clean look and so I ran

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.010 
nice nice and clean look and so I ran
that<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> way<00:01:39.329> down<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> other<00:01:39.930> end

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that all the way down to the other end

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.280 
that all the way down to the other end
and<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:41.430> got<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.649> got<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> system<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.220> where<00:01:45.290> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and then got a got a system here where I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.380 
and then got a got a system here where I
did<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.579> bar<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> front<00:01:49.079> mounted<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
did the I bar at the front mounted that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.789 
did the I bar at the front mounted that
did<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> same<00:01:51.689> thing<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> pulley<00:01:52.380> heat

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
did the same thing with the pulley heat

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.850 
did the same thing with the pulley heat
ranked<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.310> sewed<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.119> together<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.649> put

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
ranked it sewed it together and then put

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
ranked it sewed it together and then put
the<00:01:55.950> nylon<00:01:56.310> ring<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> thing

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the nylon ring on there so this thing

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.270 
the nylon ring on there so this thing
actually<00:01:58.229> works<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.520> well<00:01:59.930> just<00:02:01.280> moving

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
actually works pretty well just moving

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.609 
actually works pretty well just moving
it<00:02:02.369> back<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.610> forth<00:02:04.009> very<00:02:05.009> nice<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.610> clean

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.920 

so<00:02:10.619> yeah<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.160> kind<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:12.390> out<00:02:12.569> moves

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so yeah you can kind of see out moves

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.750 
so yeah you can kind of see out moves
back<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.410> forth<00:02:13.500> really<00:02:14.040> nice<00:02:14.310> knees<00:02:14.580> he

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
back and forth really nice knees he

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.509 
back and forth really nice knees he
doesn't<00:02:15.060> make<00:02:15.150> any<00:02:15.300> noise<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.830> wasn't<00:02:17.190> able

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
doesn't make any noise and I wasn't able

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.070 
doesn't make any noise and I wasn't able
to<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.500> silent<00:02:19.500> traction<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.670> mine

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
to get the silent traction on mine

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.350 
to get the silent traction on mine
just<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.920> wasn't<00:02:23.069> locally<00:02:23.670> here

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
just because it wasn't locally here

vest<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.819> really<00:03:27.329> think<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.750> was

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
vest and I really think that was

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.150 
vest and I really think that was
probably<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.170> best<00:03:28.380> one<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.680> market<00:03:28.739> on

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
probably the best one on the market on

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.590 
probably the best one on the market on
Forks<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:29.730> pretty<00:03:29.880> hard<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.209> come<00:03:30.420> by

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
Forks and it's pretty hard to come by

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.059 
Forks and it's pretty hard to come by
the<00:03:30.660> large-sized<00:03:31.350> they've<00:03:31.680> got<00:03:31.829> in<00:03:31.980> a

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.599 
the large-sized they've got in a

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
small/medium but I picked that up the

big I'm not sure they're going to work
too<00:04:24.110> well<00:04:24.259> in<00:04:24.379> the<00:04:24.470> sand<00:04:24.800> but<00:04:25.099> it<00:04:25.639> worked<00:04:25.849> for

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
too well in the sand but it worked for

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.460 
too well in the sand but it worked for
pretty<00:04:26.240> much<00:04:26.419> everything<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.810> know<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.169> hard

pretty much everything you know the hard
surfaces<00:04:28.039> and<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:30.129> that's<00:04:31.129> pretty

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
surfaces and and so on that's pretty

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.839 
surfaces and and so on that's pretty
much<00:04:31.610> my<00:04:31.849> setup<00:04:32.470> as<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.680> can<00:04:33.860> see<00:04:34.580> I'm<00:04:34.729> going

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
much my setup as you can see I'm going

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:40.649 
much my setup as you can see I'm going
to<00:04:34.909> set<00:04:35.150> this<00:04:35.300> down<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.599> little<00:04:35.720> bit<00:04:36.669> here<00:04:38.080> back

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
to set this down a little bit here back

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:47.010 
to set this down a little bit here back
this<00:04:41.889> works<00:04:42.889> pretty<00:04:43.129> easy<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:43.940> been<00:04:44.300> well<00:04:44.840> on
