00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 for commands how to configure well from 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.520
 boy again to my channel in the video 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.170
 previous and sure a boxing of a whistle 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.360
 for bicycle the most interesting thing that 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.130
 I bought down in the description is the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.650
 link can not buy it only 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.320
 It's worth 15 dollars about 35 thousand pesos 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.289
 Colombians and we go in this video 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.810
 then to show them how to install in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.539
 the idea that this is going to go here like this the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.109
 sound has to go to the front and the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 idea that this vote that the easiest and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.239
 accessible to the user in this case 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.059
 It's me, as I told them, I practice 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.280
 cyclomontaÃ±ismo and is a very Galician 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.710
 interesting then you can talk it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 so you can see how it's done 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.910
 first obviously we have to put him 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.289
 the batteries so we use the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.289
 tool with which it comes 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.879
 already having put the batteries right now 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.740
 but we have to adapt or put him in this 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.040
 course that is what will grab you or 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.320
 hook the whistle over there that this 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.360
 can remove the pollen every time we 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.759
 ride on the bike although we 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.830
 let's go down from it and not go down 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.630
 the peter has soon installed and that 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 come suddenly one of the friends of the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 alien and take it 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.860
 look is almost ready here over dance 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 the whistle I think that this we have left 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.150
 here we can cut it later for 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.150
 that not the ones that like getting in the way 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.850
 I 'm going to give you a little test to 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.270
 that you hear a sound that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270
 produces 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.320
 it's a sound of 100 decibels in a very 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.320
 high 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.040
 a ready, our 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.450
 bicycle is ready with pitu I'm going to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.720
 approaching for you to see how 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720
 was left 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.129
 we have the whistle and the whistle driver 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.129
 here 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.640
 which can be activated here 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 directly I simply put my finger 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.930
 here and ready 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.840
 easy from stock to very street 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.329
 interesting which I wanted to share with 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.969
 you and as I told you then it's very 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.310
 economic and it's for our security 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.439
 so down in the detail is the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.450
 link where can you buy it what 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.549
 I bought in a page of the china which 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.470
 it's very safe it takes a while to get there 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.150
 the articles but keep mind that was 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.159

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.629
