don't want to give the test pairs back

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.429 
don't want to give the test pairs back
to<00:00:23.910> us<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.510> pretty<00:00:24.630> good<00:00:24.750> sign<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to us so that's a pretty good sign the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.960 
to us so that's a pretty good sign the
main<00:00:25.650> difference<00:00:26.279> here<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.730> see<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
main difference here that you see is

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.970 
main difference here that you see is
what<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.630> call<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.109> v-shape<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> have

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
what we call the v-shape so you have

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.189 
what we call the v-shape so you have
your<00:00:29.099> over<00:00:29.369> oversized<00:00:30.210> tip<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.929> gets<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
your over oversized tip here that gets a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.080 
your over oversized tip here that gets a
narrow<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.619> move<00:00:31.949> down<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.850> meant

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
narrow as you move down and it's meant

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
narrow as you move down and it's meant
to<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.300> able<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> tackle<00:00:33.750> anything<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
to be able to tackle anything on the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
to be able to tackle anything on the
mountain<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.040> an<00:00:35.160> unbalanced<00:00:35.610> flex<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
mountain it's an unbalanced flex so the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
mountain it's an unbalanced flex so the
shovels<00:00:36.450> got<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> little<00:00:36.930> bit<00:00:37.020> softer<00:00:37.410> flex<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
shovels got a little bit softer flex to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.200 
shovels got a little bit softer flex to
it<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.129> roll<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.520> over<00:00:38.820> things<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it so it will roll up over things and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
it so it will roll up over things and
get<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> know<00:00:39.750> give<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.170> lift<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.620> deep

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
get you know give you good lift and deep

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
get you know give you good lift and deep
snow<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:42.000> gives<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> more<00:00:42.480> stability<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
snow it gives you more stability that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
snow it gives you more stability that
way<00:00:43.290> too<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.680> ski<00:00:43.890> gets<00:00:44.010> narrower<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
way too as this ski gets narrower it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
way too as this ski gets narrower it
also<00:00:45.660> gets<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> bit<00:00:46.170> stiffer<00:00:46.530> too<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.829> you've

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
also gets a bit stiffer too so you've

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
also gets a bit stiffer too so you've
got<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> advantage<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:48.059> flotation<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> grip

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
got the advantage of flotation and grip

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.130 
got the advantage of flotation and grip
in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> same<00:00:49.890> ski<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.120> designed<00:00:51.600> by
