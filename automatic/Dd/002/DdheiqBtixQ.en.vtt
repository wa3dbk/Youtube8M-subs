00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 holo all with you eagle two weeks kazgu 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.620
 It was without updates and here the developers 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.300
 we planted custard muck besides 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.730
 fact that has nothing much 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 corrects so he on the contrary only spoils 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.650
 game for those who have left hand 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.109
 Now with the Kyle command on right 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 hand arms turned inside out 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.490
 far from good of good except 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 inscription verbs about what steam 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.900
 shakes cards no longer blinks a hundred 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 but this trifle is also a trifle from 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.439
 all the little things that could be 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.719
 fixed as pleased that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.969
 update added commands for carrying 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.530
 overtime allowing you to turn on 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.140
 with a score of 15-15 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.540
 setting the number of rounds in overtime 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.149
 amount of money as well as setting pause 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.250
 between overtime miles with paws also in 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.160
 than evil geez pleasant little things observed 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 fix team early final warm up 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.809
 and also change of commands works now 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.510
 once during warm up a from others 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 You can mark the following old maps 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 now deleted if the developer itself 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.629
 card renames it and added 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.210
 command allowing automatically 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.210
 vote for the next card 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.400
 honestly would do it in cc years 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.950
 so five six ago when i was driving 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.369
 publicly then I would be glad of it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.009
 so otherwise it fixes work 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.409
 servers backups of rounds and other 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.320
 like the next day from 8 to 9 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.390
 developed released another much truth 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.369
 this time fixed bugs that were 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.770
 so much so that on the above system 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.200
 card vote at the end of the round in 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 In general, we will not update, but we will be disappointed 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.189
 hope that next week 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.979
 developed to be reformed and presented to us on 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.689
