00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
there as well and I've been playing this

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.810 
there as well and I've been playing this
was<00:01:31.450> basically<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:32.200> set<00:01:32.619> up<00:01:32.799> similar<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.729> the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
was basically a set up similar to the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.350 
was basically a set up similar to the
one<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.830> Bateson<00:01:35.830> used<00:01:36.040> against<00:01:36.369> que<00:01:36.520> si<00:01:36.820> he

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
one that Bateson used against que si he

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.910 
one that Bateson used against que si he
swapped<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.689> few<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:37.990> plays<00:01:38.200> up<00:01:38.470> I<00:01:38.619> think<00:01:38.799> he

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
swapped a few of the plays up I think he

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.840 
swapped a few of the plays up I think he
had<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:40.150> TI<00:01:41.140> i<00:01:41.350> think<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.220> left<00:01:42.400> mid

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
had a TI i think it is on the left mid

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.420 
had a TI i think it is on the left mid

finish to boot and he doesn't
necessarily<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.440> score<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.830> greatest

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
necessarily have to score the greatest

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.680 
necessarily have to score the greatest
goals<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.640> for<00:05:00.790> early<00:05:01.090> goal<00:05:01.270> was<00:05:01.420> really

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
goals that for early goal was really

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.580 
goals that for early goal was really
good<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:02.350> he<00:05:03.190> just<00:05:03.550> scores<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.660> scores<00:05:05.140> and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
good but he just scores and scores and

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.680 
good but he just scores and scores and
scores<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:06.220> think<00:05:06.730> he<00:05:06.850> was<00:05:06.970> averaging<00:05:07.120> by<00:05:07.630> the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
scores I think he was averaging by the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.910 
scores I think he was averaging by the
time<00:05:07.930> I'd<00:05:08.050> finished<00:05:08.350> playing<00:05:08.530> with<00:05:08.800> him
