from the mouse to there's no need for a
mountain<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.570> have<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> device<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:45.959> this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
mountain you have a device like this

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.560 
mountain you have a device like this
until<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.040> click<00:02:47.220> on<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.730> screen<00:02:48.000> where<00:02:48.390> you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
is in fact going to happen i think the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.290 
is in fact going to happen i think the
idea<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.750> tablet<00:02:58.230> pc<00:02:58.650> enter<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.700> macintosh

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
idea of a tablet pc enter the macintosh

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.240 
idea of a tablet pc enter the macintosh
way<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.660> doing<00:03:00.900> things<00:03:01.080> fit<00:03:01.920> very<00:03:02.190> well

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
way of doing things fit very well

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.820 
way of doing things fit very well
together<00:03:02.550> like<00:03:03.390> when<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:04.050> these<00:03:04.590> are

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
together like when I see these are

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.710 
together like when I see these are
tablet<00:03:05.370> PCs<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> think<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.420> they're<00:03:06.570> well

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
tablet PCs I think that they're well

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.240 
tablet PCs I think that they're well
it's<00:03:06.870> more<00:03:07.050> mac<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.440> than<00:03:07.620> any<00:03:07.739> OPC<00:03:08.160> I've

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it's more mac like than any OPC I've

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.190 
it's more mac like than any OPC I've
seen<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.030> especially<00:03:09.360> now<00:03:09.570> with<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> iphone

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
out having the multi-touch interface I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.390 
out having the multi-touch interface I
feel<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.900> well<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.500> really<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.250> great

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400

day boy you can create a cool new device
the<00:03:17.250> only<00:03:17.459> problem<00:03:17.820> with<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.690> that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
the only problem with it is is that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.350 
the only problem with it is is that
tablet<00:03:19.890> PCs<00:03:20.220> they<00:03:20.579> should<00:03:20.850> do<00:03:21.060> well<00:03:21.209> they

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
tablet PCs they should do well they

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.630 
tablet PCs they should do well they
should<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:21.750> lots<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.140> people<00:03:22.950> with<00:03:23.220> them<00:03:23.400> but

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
should have lots of people with them but

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.509 
should have lots of people with them but
but<00:03:24.140> nobody's<00:03:25.140> buying<00:03:25.170> memories<00:03:26.160> bought<00:03:26.370> them

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
but nobody's buying memories bought them

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.610 
but nobody's buying memories bought them
in<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.640> past<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.450> an<00:03:27.840> apple<00:03:28.170> doesn't<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.500> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
in the past so an apple doesn't like to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.080 
in the past so an apple doesn't like to
do<00:03:28.739> things<00:03:28.920> like<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.549> your<00:03:29.670> little<00:03:29.850> niche

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
do things like that in your little niche

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.310 
do things like that in your little niche
markets<00:03:30.540> where<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:30.750> don't<00:03:30.900> think<00:03:31.079> there's<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
markets where they don't think there's a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.470

that<00:04:38.130> Google<00:04:39.130> definitely<00:04:39.730> everybody<00:04:40.270> cares

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
that Google definitely everybody cares

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.760 
that Google definitely everybody cares
so<00:04:40.720> much<00:04:40.780> they<00:04:41.140> keep<00:04:41.320> blowing<00:04:41.620> out<00:04:41.740> of

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
so much they keep blowing out of

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.530 
so much they keep blowing out of
proportion<00:04:41.860> no<00:04:42.700> they<00:04:42.940> try<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.150> make<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.330> little

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
proportion no they try to make a little

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.880 
proportion no they try to make a little
cell<00:04:43.960> phone<00:04:44.140> operating<00:04:44.470> system<00:04:44.770> and

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
cell phone operating system and

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.960 
cell phone operating system and
everybody<00:04:45.130> thinks<00:04:45.340> are<00:04:45.490> actually

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
everybody thinks are actually

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.430 
everybody thinks are actually
manufacturing<00:04:46.600> millions<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:47.020> cell<00:04:47.230> phones

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
manufacturing millions of cell phones

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.320 
manufacturing millions of cell phones
yeah<00:04:47.890> so<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.400> think<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.730> big<00:04:48.910> company<00:04:49.240> it's

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.630 
yeah so I think the big company it's
just<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.690> bigger<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.080> company<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:51.460> more

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
just the bigger the company is the more

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.870 
just the bigger the company is the more

companies<00:04:55.390> or<00:04:55.690> ones<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.080> aren't<00:04:56.320> doing<00:04:56.410> as

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
companies or ones that aren't doing as

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.200 
companies or ones that aren't doing as
much<00:04:56.650> like<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.370> know<00:04:57.490> Dobby<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.030> Yahoo

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
much like you know Dobby and Yahoo

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.640 
much like you know Dobby and Yahoo
people<00:04:58.690> are<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.810> little<00:04:58.990> too<00:04:59.140> curious<00:04:59.320> about

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
people are a little too curious about

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.770 
people are a little too curious about
but<00:04:59.770> not<00:04:59.920> as<00:05:00.010> much<00:05:00.130> yeah<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.480> that<00:05:01.570> makes

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
but not as much yeah so so that makes

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.000 
but not as much yeah so so that makes
sense<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.110> get<00:05:02.320> that's<00:05:02.470> it<00:05:02.650> would<00:05:02.890> be

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
sense you get that's it would be

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.380
