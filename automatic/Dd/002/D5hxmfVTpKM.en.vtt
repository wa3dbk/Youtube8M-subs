here you can remove all drop pins and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.740 
here you can remove all drop pins and
hide<00:02:18.540> all<00:02:18.870> distance<00:02:19.590> use<00:02:20.460> I'm<00:02:20.970> not<00:02:21.300> sure<00:02:21.540> what

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
hide all distance use I'm not sure what

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.600 
hide all distance use I'm not sure what
remove<00:02:22.080> all<00:02:22.230> drop<00:02:22.530> pins<00:02:22.800> does<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:23.310> let's<00:02:23.490> go

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
remove all drop pins does but let's go

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.920 
remove all drop pins does but let's go
ahead<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.820> do<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.210> haven't<00:02:24.480> done<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.750> I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
ahead and do it I haven't done it I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.870 
ahead and do it I haven't done it I
guess<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.040> drop<00:02:26.310> pins<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:26.820> I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
guess that's if you drop pins but I

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.650 
guess that's if you drop pins but I
don't<00:02:27.570> use<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.970> go<00:02:29.970> back<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.300> home<00:02:30.480> right

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
