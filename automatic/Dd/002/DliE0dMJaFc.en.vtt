with<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.550> handrail<00:00:12.030> fire-making<00:00:12.630> it's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
with the handrail fire-making it's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.550 
with the handrail fire-making it's
important<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.710> apply<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> good<00:00:15.450> firm<00:00:16.049> downward

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
important to apply it good firm downward

pressure<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> hearth<00:00:17.369> board<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.940> can

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
pressure on the hearth board and I can

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.390 
pressure on the hearth board and I can
do<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.750> kneeling<00:00:18.900> position<00:00:19.050> by<00:00:19.710> by

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
do that in a kneeling position by by

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.099 
do that in a kneeling position by by
leaning<00:00:20.789> forward<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.420> bringing<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:21.900> upper

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
leaning forward and bringing my upper

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.960

body weight to bear down on the spindle

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.599 
body weight to bear down on the spindle
it's<00:00:24.630> also<00:00:24.779> important<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.619> reposition<00:00:26.310> your

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
it's also important to reposition your

hands is quickly as possible after each

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.849 
hands is quickly as possible after each

the<00:00:32.040> dust<00:00:32.520> pile<00:00:33.079> here<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.350> with<00:00:34.559> fire<00:00:35.190> by

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the dust pile here we go with fire by

00:00:35.370 --> 00:01:21.980 
the dust pile here we go with fire by
hand<00:00:35.610> drill<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> nice<00:01:10.229> call

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.720 

with<00:01:22.990> fire<00:01:23.260> by<00:01:23.470> friction<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:24.130> always<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> good

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
with fire by friction it's always a good

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:35.730 
with fire by friction it's always a good
idea<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:26.430> ignite<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.460> backup<00:01:28.390> call<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:33.760> way<00:01:34.740> if

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
idea to ignite a backup call that way if

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.050 
idea to ignite a backup call that way if
the<00:01:36.010> initial<00:01:36.190> fire<00:01:36.640> making<00:01:36.880> effort<00:01:37.330> fails<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
the initial fire making effort fails you

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.320 
the initial fire making effort fails you
don't<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.540> go<00:01:40.660> through<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.970> effort<00:01:42.970> of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
don't have to go through the effort of

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.240 
don't have to go through the effort of
making<00:01:43.510> another<00:01:43.870> call<00:01:46.620> there's<00:01:47.620> my<00:01:47.800> backup

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
making another call there's my backup

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:18.820 
making another call there's my backup
colt

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.280 

so<00:02:19.400> there<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.610> fire<00:02:19.940> by<00:02:20.150> friction<00:02:20.180> by<00:02:20.990> hand

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
so there is fire by friction by hand

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.500 
so there is fire by friction by hand
