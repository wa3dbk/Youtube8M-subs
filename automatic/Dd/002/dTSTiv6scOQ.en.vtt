of rhythm yeah if you look at the game
against<00:01:12.510> colombia<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:14.939> half

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
against colombia I think the first half

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.679 
against colombia I think the first half
wasn't<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.970> had<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.270> hoped<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.290> more<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
wasn't I had I hoped for more but the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.999 
wasn't I had I hoped for more but the
second<00:01:22.080> half<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.320> put<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> little

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
second half we put it to get a little

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
second half we put it to get a little
bit<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> especially<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> sentiment<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
bit and especially with the sentiment to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710 
bit and especially with the sentiment to
find<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.799> rhythm<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
find that rhythm and if we can do that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960 
find that rhythm and if we can do that
against<00:01:28.290> North<00:01:28.500> Korea<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.549> go<00:01:29.759> in

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
against North Korea I think we can go in

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.390 
against North Korea I think we can go in
to<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.560> quarter-final<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> good<00:01:31.950> feeling

to the quarter-final with a good feeling

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
to the quarter-final with a good feeling
that<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.710> create<00:01:35.280> chances<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:36.930> stay

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that we will create chances we will stay
