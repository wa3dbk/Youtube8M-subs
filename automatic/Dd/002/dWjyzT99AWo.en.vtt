the<00:00:20.250> room<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:21.140> one<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.350> when<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.619> walk<00:00:22.859> into

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
the room is one that when you walk into

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
the room is one that when you walk into
you<00:00:24.359> realize<00:00:24.720> something<00:00:25.230> different<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.949> going

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
you realize something different is going

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:43.800 
you realize something different is going
to<00:00:26.189> happen<00:00:26.519> here

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.680 

when<00:00:44.810> we<00:00:44.930> have<00:00:45.140> classes<00:00:45.770> in<00:00:45.800> an<00:00:46.070> interactive

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
when we have classes in an interactive

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.960 
when we have classes in an interactive
learning<00:00:47.690> space<00:00:47.990> like<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:49.460> tends<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.850> be

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
learning space like this it tends to be

00:00:49.970 --> 00:01:01.799 
learning space like this it tends to be
noisier<00:00:50.540> than<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:51.920> typical<00:00:52.550> lecture<00:00:52.700> hall

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.329 

walking<00:01:02.809> in<00:01:03.020> I<00:01:03.230> think<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.890> thing<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:04.100> you

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
walking in I think the thing that you

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.760 
walking in I think the thing that you
see<00:01:04.659> right<00:01:05.659> off<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.840> bat<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.290> strikes<00:01:06.590> you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
see right off the bat that strikes you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.300 
see right off the bat that strikes you
is<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.310> lot<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.700> big<00:01:07.940> round<00:01:08.300> tables<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.740> seat

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
is a lot of big round tables that seat

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.609 
is a lot of big round tables that seat
nine<00:01:10.520> people<00:01:10.909> each<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.780> tables<00:01:12.110> has<00:01:12.380> their

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
nine people each of the tables has their

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.160 
nine people each of the tables has their
own<00:01:12.770> link<00:01:13.280> ups<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.760> flat-screen<00:01:14.030> TV<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.810> we

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
own link ups to a flat-screen TV and we

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.290 
own link ups to a flat-screen TV and we
have<00:01:15.380> mics<00:01:15.680> at<00:01:15.890> our<00:01:16.010> tables<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:16.580> at<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.119> same

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
have mics at our tables and at the same

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.090 
have mics at our tables and at the same
time<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:17.750> have<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.320> PowerPoint<00:01:18.619> of<00:01:19.009> the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
time you have the PowerPoint of the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.890 
time you have the PowerPoint of the
slides<00:01:19.369> on<00:01:19.580> every<00:01:19.820> computer<00:01:20.270> all<00:01:20.450> around<00:01:20.780> the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
slides on every computer all around the

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.249 
slides on every computer all around the
room

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
room

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.530 
room
so<00:01:21.710> it's<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:22.580> great<00:01:22.909> space<00:01:23.210> where<00:01:23.509> like

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
so it's this great space where like

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.560 
so it's this great space where like
technology<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.009> people<00:01:25.250> interact<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:26.360> just

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
technology and people interact to just

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.180 
technology and people interact to just
create<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.990> completely<00:01:27.590> unique<00:01:27.860> learning

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
create a completely unique learning

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.300 
create a completely unique learning
experience<00:01:29.170> instead<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.229> being<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:31.040> rows

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
experience instead of being in rows

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.710 
experience instead of being in rows
where<00:01:32.060> students<00:01:32.780> are<00:01:32.869> facing<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.470> podium

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
where students are facing a podium

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.420 
where students are facing a podium
students<00:01:35.720> are<00:01:35.780> facing<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.229> another<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.860> so

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
students are facing one another and so

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.880 
students are facing one another and so
it<00:01:37.820> forms<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.300> community<00:01:38.990> as<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.140> come<00:01:39.740> into

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
it forms a community as you come into

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.300 
it forms a community as you come into
this<00:01:40.130> room<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:42.229> facilitates

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
this room and it facilitates

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.029 
this room and it facilitates
both<00:01:44.060> for<00:01:44.600> students<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.229> for<00:01:45.410> professors

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
both for students and for professors

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.800 
both for students and for professors
doing<00:01:46.429> something<00:01:46.910> different<00:01:47.420> than<00:01:47.690> what

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
doing something different than what

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.499 
doing something different than what
they've<00:01:48.050> done<00:01:48.470> before<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.820> whole<00:01:50.090> day<00:01:50.330> is

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
they've done before the whole day is

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.169 
they've done before the whole day is
planned<00:01:50.869> around<00:01:51.340> what<00:01:52.340> are<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.729> students

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
planned around what are the students

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.260 
planned around what are the students
going<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.450> do<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.679> that<00:01:54.860> they<00:01:55.070> can<00:01:55.369> learn<00:01:55.670> what

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
going to do so that they can learn what

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.580 
going to do so that they can learn what
I<00:01:56.300> think<00:01:56.630> they<00:01:56.780> need<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.080> know<00:01:57.229> about<00:01:57.350> this

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
I think they need to know about this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.580 
I think they need to know about this
topic<00:01:58.060> but<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.149> do<00:01:59.210> want<00:01:59.509> you<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.720> now<00:02:00.020> move<00:02:00.350> into

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
topic but I do want you to now move into

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.340 
topic but I do want you to now move into

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
inquiry three it's basically doing the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.170 
inquiry three it's basically doing the
same<00:02:03.380> thing<00:02:03.860> except<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.430> have<00:02:04.610> more<00:02:04.909> than<00:02:05.000> two

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
same thing except you have more than two

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.139 
same thing except you have more than two
sequences<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.900> look<00:02:06.079> at<00:02:06.259> we'll<00:02:06.829> spend<00:02:07.159> 10

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
sequences to look at we'll spend 10

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.699 
sequences to look at we'll spend 10
minutes<00:02:08.619> working<00:02:09.619> together<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:10.040> a<00:02:10.070> team

knowledge it's really about practicing

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.030 
knowledge it's really about practicing
it's<00:02:25.750> about<00:02:25.959> being<00:02:26.530> able<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.769> demonstrate

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's about being able to demonstrate

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's about being able to demonstrate
this<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.989> for<00:02:28.989> students<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.439> demonstrate<00:02:29.590> to

team a lot over the course of the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.959 
team a lot over the course of the
semester<00:02:35.620> because<00:02:36.489> you're<00:02:36.609> sitting<00:02:36.730> at<00:02:36.939> your

outside of class we met up outside of
class<00:02:41.590> we<00:02:41.859> we<00:02:42.250> really<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.579> we're<00:02:42.849> friends<00:02:43.209> by

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
class we we really just we're friends by

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.490 
class we we really just we're friends by
the<00:02:43.359> end<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.659> semester<00:02:43.859> in<00:02:44.859> this<00:02:45.549> class

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the end of the semester in this class

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.649 
the end of the semester in this class
your<00:02:47.500> grade<00:02:47.889> is<00:02:48.159> going<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.430> be<00:02:48.549> better<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:49.239> your

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
your grade is going to be better if your

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.960 
your grade is going to be better if your
whole<00:02:49.870> group<00:02:50.139> does<00:02:50.560> better<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.069> so<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.609> have

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
whole group does better and so you have

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.940 
whole group does better and so you have
a<00:02:52.000> responsibility<00:02:52.989> just<00:02:53.169> like<00:02:53.349> we<00:02:53.500> do<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:53.769> real

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
a responsibility just like we do in real

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.740 
a responsibility just like we do in real
life<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.549> like<00:02:54.669> we<00:02:54.819> do<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.359> research

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
life and just like we do in research

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.959 
life and just like we do in research
laboratories<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.859> clinical<00:02:57.310> situations

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
laboratories and clinical situations

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.030 
laboratories and clinical situations
it's<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:58.930> an<00:02:59.260> individual<00:02:59.799> that's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
it's not an individual that's

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.539 
it's not an individual that's
responsible<00:03:00.669> for<00:03:00.760> everything<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.480> team

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
responsible for everything it's the team

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.390 
responsible for everything it's the team
once<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.700> get<00:03:03.939> to<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:05.370> research<00:03:06.370> university

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
once you get to a research university

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.110 
once you get to a research university
like<00:03:07.329> this<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:09.010> want<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.370> transition<00:03:09.939> this

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
like this we want to transition this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.390 
like this we want to transition this
from<00:03:10.540> science<00:03:11.469> courses<00:03:11.769> being<00:03:12.099> about

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
from science courses being about

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.390 
from science courses being about
memorization<00:03:13.299> of<00:03:13.389> facts<00:03:13.689> and<00:03:14.139> really<00:03:15.129> about

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
memorization of facts and really about

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.020 
memorization of facts and really about
learning<00:03:15.879> how<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.209> think

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
learning how to think

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.090 
learning how to think
go<00:03:18.540> ahead<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.020> align<00:03:19.260> all<00:03:19.590> these<00:03:19.800> sequences

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
go ahead and align all these sequences

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.010 
go ahead and align all these sequences
and<00:03:20.700> look<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:21.180> what<00:03:21.390> kind<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.600> mutations

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
and look to see what kind of mutations

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.990 
and look to see what kind of mutations
ever<00:03:22.230> risen<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.830> what<00:03:22.980> I'm<00:03:23.070> looking<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.670> is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
ever risen so what I'm looking for is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.510 
ever risen so what I'm looking for is
where<00:03:24.540> are<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.110> describing<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:26.100> final

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
where are you describing this final

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.480 
where are you describing this final
molecule<00:03:27.140> when<00:03:28.140> we<00:03:28.290> refer<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.800> as<00:03:29.040> coding

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
molecule when we refer to that as coding

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.440 
molecule when we refer to that as coding
DNA<00:03:29.670> what<00:03:30.120> does<00:03:30.210> that<00:03:30.240> mean<00:03:30.570> it's<00:03:31.290> not<00:03:32.450> okay

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
DNA what does that mean it's not okay

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.480 
DNA what does that mean it's not okay
but<00:03:33.930> we're<00:03:34.290> would<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.800> correspond<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.340> the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
but we're would it correspond to the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.260 
but we're would it correspond to the
entire<00:03:35.880> messenger<00:03:36.570> RNA<00:03:36.840> sequence<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:39.090> what's

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
entire messenger RNA sequence so what's

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.960 
entire messenger RNA sequence so what's
missing

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.870 

it<00:03:42.970> never<00:03:43.120> felt<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:43.480> instruction<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:44.350> was

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
it never felt like instruction it was

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.530 
it never felt like instruction it was
more<00:03:45.880> discussion

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
more discussion

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.760 
more discussion
they've<00:03:46.900> give<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.080> little<00:03:47.230> bit<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.500> instruction

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
they've give a little bit of instruction

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.750 
they've give a little bit of instruction
behind<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.220> but<00:03:48.340> then<00:03:48.430> they<00:03:48.520> would<00:03:48.640> ask

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
behind it but then they would ask

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.460 
behind it but then they would ask
questions<00:03:48.880> what<00:03:49.300> would<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.600> do<00:03:49.810> now<00:03:50.110> what<00:03:50.410> do

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
questions what would you do now what do

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.010 
questions what would you do now what do
you<00:03:50.500> think<00:03:50.590> would<00:03:51.130> be<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.280> next<00:03:51.640> step<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.600> made

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
you think would be the next step it made

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.120 
you think would be the next step it made
you<00:03:53.140> have<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.320> lot<00:03:53.470> more<00:03:53.590> interaction<00:03:53.950> with

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
you have a lot more interaction with

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.080 
you have a lot more interaction with
your<00:03:54.220> professors<00:03:54.670> than<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:54.910> might<00:03:55.060> have

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
your professors than you might have

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.070 
your professors than you might have
otherwise<00:03:55.270> and<00:03:55.840> they're<00:03:55.930> really

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
otherwise and they're really

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.450 
otherwise and they're really
approachable<00:03:56.680> they're<00:03:57.070> kind<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.370> just

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
approachable they're kind of just

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.250 
approachable they're kind of just
helping<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.300> your<00:03:58.330> activities<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.230> a

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
helping you with your activities and a

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
helping you with your activities and a
lot<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.440> times<00:03:59.590> they're<00:03:59.770> walking<00:04:00.010> around<00:04:00.190> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
lot of times they're walking around the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.130 
lot of times they're walking around the
rooms<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:00.880> you're<00:04:01.420> asking<00:04:01.660> them<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.870> lot<00:04:02.020> of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
rooms and you're asking them a lot of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.690 
rooms and you're asking them a lot of
questions<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:02.740> that<00:04:02.890> was<00:04:03.040> really<00:04:03.280> nice<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.670> be

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
questions so that was really nice to be

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.130 
questions so that was really nice to be
able<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.970> just<00:04:04.150> talk<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.420> your<00:04:04.510> professors<00:04:04.930> but

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
able to just talk to your professors but

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.020 
able to just talk to your professors but
also<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> kind<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.940> different

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
also have a kind of a different

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.310 
also have a kind of a different
relationship<00:04:07.570> with<00:04:07.720> them<00:04:07.930> because<00:04:08.080> they're

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
relationship with them because they're

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.710 
relationship with them because they're
not<00:04:08.440> lecturing<00:04:08.740> you<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.880> was<00:04:10.090> them<00:04:10.390> allowing

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
not lecturing you it was them allowing

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.660 
not lecturing you it was them allowing
us<00:04:11.020> to<00:04:11.050> figure<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.530> out<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:11.680> ourselves<00:04:11.890> but<00:04:12.550> at

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
us to figure it out for ourselves but at

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.280 
us to figure it out for ourselves but at
the<00:04:12.760> same<00:04:12.880> time<00:04:13.090> being<00:04:13.450> there<00:04:13.780> when<00:04:13.990> we<00:04:14.110> needed

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
the same time being there when we needed

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.210 
the same time being there when we needed
help<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.770> guide<00:04:14.920> us<00:04:15.100> they<00:04:15.700> really<00:04:17.040> were<00:04:18.040> more

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
help to guide us they really were more

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.490 
help to guide us they really were more
like<00:04:18.400> colleagues<00:04:18.670> in<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.090> sense<00:04:19.500> just

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
like colleagues in a sense just

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.990 
like colleagues in a sense just
colleagues<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.010> knew<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.519> heck<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.730> a<00:04:21.850> lot

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
colleagues that knew a heck of a lot

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.950 
colleagues that knew a heck of a lot
more<00:04:22.030> than<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.630> did

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
more than you did

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.080 
more than you did
one<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.860> major<00:04:24.250> assignments<00:04:25.000> that

one of the major assignments that

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.670 
one of the major assignments that
students<00:04:25.510> work<00:04:25.660> on<00:04:25.810> during<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.260> whole<00:04:26.410> entire

semester is a project that starts with a
proposal<00:04:29.890> so<00:04:30.460> we<00:04:30.490> ask<00:04:30.730> them<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.120> identify<00:04:31.720> a

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
proposal so we ask them to identify a

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.240 
proposal so we ask them to identify a
problem<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:33.100> social<00:04:33.940> value<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.950> solve

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
problem of social value and to solve

increase<00:05:01.210> drought<00:05:01.540> resistance<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:02.770> they

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
increase drought resistance and they

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.210 
increase drought resistance and they
ultimately<00:05:03.340> come<00:05:03.700> to<00:05:03.810> very<00:05:04.810> interesting<00:05:05.220> very

sophisticated very important problems
and<00:05:10.919> viable<00:05:11.919> solutions<00:05:12.910> for<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:14.530> was<00:05:14.620> one

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
and viable solutions for it it was one

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.200 
and viable solutions for it it was one
of<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.980> key<00:05:15.220> things<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.730> I<00:05:15.760> liked<00:05:16.060> about

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
of the key things that I liked about

of the key things that I liked about
this<00:05:16.510> class<00:05:16.840> as<00:05:17.740> you<00:05:17.860> were<00:05:17.950> learning<00:05:18.130> without

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
this class as you were learning without

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.790 
this class as you were learning without
really<00:05:18.610> knowing<00:05:19.000> that<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.360> were<00:05:19.450> learning

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
really knowing that you were learning

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.110 
really knowing that you were learning
students<00:05:20.800> he<00:05:20.950> said<00:05:21.160> you<00:05:21.280> know<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.430> learned<00:05:21.700> how

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
students he said you know I learned how

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.840 
students he said you know I learned how
to<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.650> learned<00:05:23.650> how<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.919> ask<00:05:24.040> questions<00:05:24.250> and

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
to I learned how to ask questions and

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.659 
to I learned how to ask questions and
learn<00:05:24.970> on<00:05:25.210> my<00:05:25.240> own<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.720> think<00:05:25.930> about<00:05:26.169> things

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
learn on my own and think about things

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.540 
learn on my own and think about things
and<00:05:27.669> that's<00:05:27.820> what<00:05:27.970> we<00:05:28.090> really<00:05:28.120> are<00:05:28.630> aiming<00:05:29.320> for

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
and that's what we really are aiming for

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.860 
and that's what we really are aiming for
that's<00:05:30.550> what<00:05:30.700> makes<00:05:30.880> teaching<00:05:31.120> fun<00:05:31.540> and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
that's what makes teaching fun and

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.559 
that's what makes teaching fun and
exceeding<00:05:32.320> this<00:05:32.500> kind<00:05:32.710> of<00:05:32.740> space<00:05:32.980> really<00:05:33.250> fun

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
exceeding this kind of space really fun

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.829 
exceeding this kind of space really fun
I<00:05:34.740> am<00:05:35.740> actually<00:05:36.399> doing<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:36.939> kind<00:05:37.330> of<00:05:37.479> teaching

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:37.839 
I am actually doing the kind of teaching

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:39.450 
I am actually doing the kind of teaching
that<00:05:37.869> I<00:05:38.110> have<00:05:38.229> always<00:05:38.409> wanted<00:05:38.710> to<00:05:38.979> do<00:05:39.099> where

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
that I have always wanted to do where

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.929 
that I have always wanted to do where
I'm<00:05:40.379> really<00:05:41.379> getting<00:05:41.679> to<00:05:41.770> see<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:42.039> really

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:42.939 
I'm really getting to see the really

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:44.309 
I'm really getting to see the really
pure<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.360> simple<00:05:43.599> I<00:05:43.659> get<00:05:43.809> to<00:05:43.899> see<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.169> light

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
pure and simple I get to see the light

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.769 
pure and simple I get to see the light
bulbs<00:05:44.679> go<00:05:44.740> on<00:05:44.860> for<00:05:45.639> students<00:05:45.999> at<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.419> end<00:05:46.599> of

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
bulbs go on for students at the end of

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.469 
bulbs go on for students at the end of
it<00:05:46.959> I<00:05:47.110> had<00:05:47.469> learned<00:05:47.709> so<00:05:48.039> much<00:05:48.219> about<00:05:48.520> biology

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
it I had learned so much about biology

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.169 
it I had learned so much about biology
about<00:05:50.439> what<00:05:50.770> it<00:05:50.889> was<00:05:51.039> to<00:05:51.219> be<00:05:51.369> a<00:05:51.399> scientist<00:05:51.969> and

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:52.179 
about what it was to be a scientist and

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:55.109 
about what it was to be a scientist and
about<00:05:52.599> I<00:05:52.929> guess<00:05:53.199> myself<00:05:53.649> in<00:05:53.949> a<00:05:54.039> way<00:05:54.159> of<00:05:54.399> you

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:55.119 
about I guess myself in a way of you

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.579 
about I guess myself in a way of you
know<00:05:55.149> the<00:05:55.330> things<00:05:55.539> that<00:05:55.689> I<00:05:55.809> can<00:05:55.990> achieve<00:05:56.110> that

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:56.589 
know the things that I can achieve that

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.159 
know the things that I can achieve that
I<00:05:56.619> never<00:05:56.919> thought<00:05:57.129> that<00:05:57.309> I<00:05:57.369> could<00:05:57.990> you<00:05:58.990> just

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
I never thought that I could you just

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.169 
I never thought that I could you just
think<00:05:59.349> at<00:05:59.469> the<00:05:59.559> end<00:05:59.589> of<00:05:59.740> semester<00:05:59.939> wow<00:06:00.939> I've

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:01.179 
think at the end of semester wow I've

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.959 
think at the end of semester wow I've
heard<00:06:01.419> so<00:06:01.689> much
