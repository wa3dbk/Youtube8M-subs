00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 today with you again vladimir and today 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.350
 it will be a modification of the mugen of sky 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.990
 &amp; the mortal kombat 9 myself am 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 the owner of their xbox 360 so for me 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.920
 availability of new versions of the mortal battalion or 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.140
 Any problem fighting not 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.700
 is another thing that harmful 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.219
 developers don't want to release their 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.860
 products sent by computer and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.989
 It motivates and what is this here 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.899
 really serious so i thought 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 She really fights on computer 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.210
 can not be lodged 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.370
 really possible because gamepads 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.200
 very firmly entered our lives but 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.649
 for some reason mortal kombat again stayed behind 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.260
 overboard 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.660
 that's why I decided to review 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 here is this modification as it was 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.059
 very many positive comments in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.579
 her address 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.350
 a lot of downloads and such times 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 Build a deal means users want 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.570
 see on personal computers here 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.150
 boots like mortal kombat here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 I will say right away it is made on the mugen engine and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.860
 with all the consequences that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.610
 there are the same products on the fps engine 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.310
 creator either lpg maker is an amateur 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.189
 toys and then it turns out 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.689
 amateur mortal kombat is the only 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 what can I say that move all 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.520
 there are a lot of characters here including 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.189
 and Freddy Kruger and Kratos that is like 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.320
 here it is a collector's edition from 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 playstation 3 but i don't know how it is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.829
 things are more plastic anyway here 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.229
 I show that I have two gamepads 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.810
 Lerman homeland then I'm gamepad 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.470
 maintained without any problems i 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.250
 I'm sitting on logitech rumble for 2 2 for me 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.140
 gamepad it is in my sexy young I for sure 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.420
 I do not even remember because it is very rare 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.969
 I 'm playing with someone lately for me 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 not at all to play a few words before 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.049
 how do i start to show gaming 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.170
 process i'm actually a big fan 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.500
 brain they can for 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.119
 I'll throw more requests from the river so how 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.209
 nor strange i liked tracks on 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.310
 game boy advance 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.470
 but that's mortal kombat plays with me 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.840
 companies with friends noisy couch and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.270
 very successfully finish off my friends because 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.500
 so that I'm alone in mortal 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.800
 kombat game here is the announcement 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.300
 although in a really cool toy but 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.500
 everyone chooses their own fighting and again 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.380
 case it is tagged so there is 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.319
 training survival mode 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:42.400
 cooperative combat teams 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:46.299
 how to say against each other that is 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.760
 team leader is a passage roughly speaking 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.319
 here's the alleged storyline like this 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.959
 such classic columns in mortal 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.110
 kombat 3 only against computer 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.930
 opponents and you play in pairs with another 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.700
 then taking a look you can lose 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.980
 against each other, this is my 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.390
 favorite mode though again too 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.630
 unsuccessfully trying to reach it 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.069
 some heights that's just using 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.959
 by chance let's see here with us 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.890
 2 player icon you can choose 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.150
 but again I say right now 1 so 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.780
 joint battles will not show but they are nothing 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.390
 different from what you see in my 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.000
 jump with the computer opponent all 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.739
 they are drawn very nicely menu sounds 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.530
 it's all very cool 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.600
 another thing I say it again mugen co 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.799
 all the ensuing consequences here even 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.359
 there is somewhere card with fredy kruger 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.940
 I don't know more than half of the character 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.890
 because I do not follow the news 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.850
 Mortal Kombat I liked very much 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.489
 gossip series 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.170
 so I decided to search Google for something 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.190
 theme mortal kombat and came across this 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.760
 modification so here's my form on 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.000
 beautiful 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.950
 sounds no complaints no backdrops 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.780
 backgrounds they dynamically can 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.480
 water dripping something going on they too 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.220
 very beautiful the other thing is that the characters 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.350
 that's it dynamic characters 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.000
 which you play which move on 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.740
 these locations 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.450
 this mugen and he has such 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.460
 the disadvantage is that they are very low 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.970
 polygonal in fact it's just what 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.530
 beautiful pixels that is right away 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.840
 there comes such a feeling yes live like this 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.240
 when did you play dandy on 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.040
 TV on super nintendo here 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.560
 same textures one to one 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.510
 Only there big resolution but this 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.110
 this is by the standards of what is pixel 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.600
 picture so let's run the mode 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.830
 Survival to be with me as soon as possible 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.790
 finish off i'll choose kenga because as in 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.560
 principle always try to play for him 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.260
 because he did not climb the film 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.390
 more so here is not the best 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:05:01.810
 The location is much more beautiful, but I'll show you 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:05:03.520
 but it seems like I play a crease I don’t know yet 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.880
 because I play it for only two days and 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.450
 play like say so just launched 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.450
 play around 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.190
 but note that he had 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.220
 traced very well the only thing 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:39.260
 censures cause models but you know yourself 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.260
 but looks very nice 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.090
 why i like this can just 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.640
 I will say the stone here is killed only because 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.230
 that there fights look a little bit they do n’t even 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.480
 a bit compared to Mortal Kombat 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.780
 very realistic therefore probably 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:02.310
 I like these blood splatters 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.440
 fatalities there brutality just i'm not in them 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.540
 I understand how I will catch the buzz 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.990
 although I understand what it looks like 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.930
 very nice and so well let's put 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.170
 still versus mod let's not put the team 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.510
 leader and try it here fry 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.370
 slowed down in principle the game works 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:25.770
 without lags this is due to the fact that apparently 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:29.100
 rights moved to the second file record king 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.960
 and who else would take such remember from 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.980
 the movie 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.350
 johnny cage let's johnny cage and 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.660
 let's try pair awake 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.140
 Here is this location to kindergarten over our 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.140
 actually 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.230
 what the devil 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:07:02.220
 I somehow John Cage respects though often 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:07:04.770
 probably a snapshot ooh yeah yeah very 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.389
 quickly even somehow offensively let's 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.389
 try to play in the second round 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:41.180
 and all see what I do not leak 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:42.760
 gave johnny i'm a friend with you 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.320
 so this is all happening 

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.710
 You will see a link to this mod in the description. 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.320
 to video something account about him talking 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.570
 I don't know, but if we really have you 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.220
 there is only computer yes why not 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.680
 try maybe you will like those 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.870
 more talking again paired up with someone this 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.820
 very cool if you're a mortal fan 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.310
 Combat you probably all will be very 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.990
 interesting here well here that everyone else 

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.120
 If possible, try 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.440
 mortal kombat on the box or billeting 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.110
 not with you was vladimir 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.800
 subscribe to the blog imitate play 

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.800
 good game
