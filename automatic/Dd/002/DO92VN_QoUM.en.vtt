00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
hello this off video on how to get a map

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.000 
hello this off video on how to get a map
seed<00:00:05.850> that<00:00:06.089> taught<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.410> easy<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.830> find

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
seed that taught you is easy to find

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.240 
seed that taught you is easy to find
monster<00:00:08.730> spawners<00:00:09.110> they'll<00:00:10.110> get<00:00:10.320> saddles<00:00:10.740> and

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
monster spawners they'll get saddles and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.110 
monster spawners they'll get saddles and
other<00:00:11.849> cool<00:00:12.269> things<00:00:12.570> about<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.849> first<00:00:14.849> you

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
other cool things about that first you

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.859 
other cool things about that first you
go<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.660> create<00:00:15.870> your<00:00:15.900> world<00:00:16.139> play<00:00:16.619> game<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
go on to create your world play game and

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.260 
go on to create your world play game and
the<00:00:18.869> anyway<00:00:19.170> generate<00:00:19.740> seed<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.910> go<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.119> that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the anyway generate seed you go on that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.960 
the anyway generate seed you go on that
and<00:00:21.510> type<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.990> work<00:00:22.380> seed<00:00:22.740> ever<00:00:23.010> or<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.789> lower

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and type in work seed ever or in lower

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.720 
and type in work seed ever or in lower
case<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.800> those<00:00:25.800> spaces<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.670> then<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.810> boom

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
case and those spaces and then you boom

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.630 
case and those spaces and then you boom
and<00:00:29.750> we<00:00:30.750> aren't<00:00:30.960> actually<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.800> use<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and we aren't actually going to use it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
and we aren't actually going to use it
within<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:34.050> world<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.559> I've<00:00:34.649> already

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
within it use my world that I've already

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
within it use my world that I've already
got<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:36.059> literally<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.510> can't<00:00:36.870> be

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

it sort of looks like half a hand and if

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660 
it sort of looks like half a hand and if
thought<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> wrist<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.549> in

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
thought the wrist and you can see in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.330 
thought the wrist and you can see in
this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> finger<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.570> point<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.340> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
this is like a finger here point in so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.020 
this is like a finger here point in so
if<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> dig<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.570> left<00:01:54.750> side<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.290> wrist

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
if you dig on the left side of the wrist

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.749 
if you dig on the left side of the wrist
down<00:01:57.439> little<00:01:58.439> stairs<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:59.070> down<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
down little stairs going down that's the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.090 
down little stairs going down that's the
best<00:01:59.909> way<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.829> find<00:02:01.829> another

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
best way to do it i think find another

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.310 
best way to do it i think find another
settlement<00:02:02.430> room<00:02:02.719> we<00:02:03.719> haven't<00:02:04.170> taken

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
settlement room we haven't taken

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.929 
settlement room we haven't taken
anything<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> chest<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.790> is
