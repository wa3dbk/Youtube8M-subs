00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
do that and it actually worked out

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.420 
do that and it actually worked out
because<00:05:48.900> if<00:05:49.199> I<00:05:49.319> had<00:05:49.440> drawn<00:05:49.650> AG<00:05:49.800> listener<00:05:50.190> if<00:05:50.279> I

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
because if I had drawn AG listener if I

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.550 
because if I had drawn AG listener if I
could<00:05:50.580> have<00:05:50.669> played<00:05:50.759> that<00:05:51.319> obviously<00:05:52.319> bank

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
could have played that obviously bank

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.850 
could have played that obviously bank
moth<00:05:52.860> was<00:05:53.159> another<00:05:53.490> excellent<00:05:54.089> draw<00:05:54.419> there<00:05:54.860> so

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
moth was another excellent draw there so

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.589 
moth was another excellent draw there so
he<00:05:56.099> gets<00:05:56.279> ghost<00:05:56.490> quarter<00:05:56.879> which<00:05:57.060> is<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.360> little

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
he gets ghost quarter which is a little

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.050 
he gets ghost quarter which is a little
bit<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.719> a<00:05:57.870> problem<00:05:58.050> for<00:05:58.379> the<00:05:58.469> deck<00:05:58.680> oh<00:05:58.909> sorry<00:05:59.909> i

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
bit of a problem for the deck oh sorry i

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.920 
bit of a problem for the deck oh sorry i
missed<00:06:00.389> the<00:06:00.539> hand<00:06:01.250> he<00:06:02.250> has<00:06:02.370> Gideon<00:06:02.870> Sphinx

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.559 

blade<00:06:06.930> which<00:06:07.680> is<00:06:07.889> doom<00:06:08.129> blade<00:06:08.339> and<00:06:08.849> sun<00:06:09.300> titan

buddy<00:06:10.020> has<00:06:10.199> no<00:06:10.229> Black<00:06:10.770> Manta<00:06:11.039> and<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:11.669> notated

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
buddy has no Black Manta and I notated

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.260 
buddy has no Black Manta and I notated
that<00:06:12.569> so<00:06:13.349> we<00:06:13.469> can<00:06:13.620> just<00:06:13.800> go<00:06:13.979> throw<00:06:14.250> this<00:06:14.400> out<00:06:14.639> he

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
that so we can just go throw this out he

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.179 
that so we can just go throw this out he
probably<00:06:15.449> won't<00:06:15.719> goes<00:06:15.900> quarter<00:06:16.349> obviously

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:17.189 
probably won't goes quarter obviously

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:18.679 
probably won't goes quarter obviously
because<00:06:17.430> i'll<00:06:17.639> just<00:06:17.819> be<00:06:17.909> low<00:06:18.060> on<00:06:18.089> mana<00:06:18.419> and

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
because i'll just be low on mana and

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:20.990 
because i'll just be low on mana and
he's<00:06:19.199> got<00:06:19.349> a<00:06:19.379> pretty<00:06:19.560> high-end<00:06:19.919> hand<00:06:20.699> and<00:06:20.939> he

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
he's got a pretty high-end hand and he

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.269 
he's got a pretty high-end hand and he
wants<00:06:21.300> to<00:06:21.419> reach<00:06:21.569> the<00:06:21.779> Gideon<00:06:24.169> and<00:06:25.279> Gideon's

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
wants to reach the Gideon and Gideon's

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.869 
wants to reach the Gideon and Gideon's
his<00:06:26.639> probably<00:06:27.240> his<00:06:27.360> main<00:06:27.539> plan<00:06:27.870> here<00:06:28.729> so<00:06:29.729> this

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:29.879 
his probably his main plan here so this

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.159 
his probably his main plan here so this
is<00:06:30.029> a<00:06:30.060> really<00:06:30.270> important<00:06:30.719> turn<00:06:30.839> because<00:06:31.050> he's

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
is a really important turn because he's

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.959 
is a really important turn because he's
at<00:06:31.319> four<00:06:31.560> and<00:06:31.710> I<00:06:31.830> know<00:06:31.889> he<00:06:32.129> has<00:06:32.219> another<00:06:32.490> island

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
at four and I know he has another island

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.550 
at four and I know he has another island
in<00:06:33.060> his<00:06:33.180> hand<00:06:33.419> so<00:06:33.599> he<00:06:33.719> does<00:06:33.900> have<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.169> mana<00:06:34.349> for

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
in his hand so he does have the mana for

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.610 
in his hand so he does have the mana for
Gideon<00:06:35.569> so<00:06:36.569> he's<00:06:36.839> going<00:06:36.990> to<00:06:37.050> ratchet<00:06:37.469> bomb

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
Gideon so he's going to ratchet bomb

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.159 
Gideon so he's going to ratchet bomb
here<00:06:37.919> and<00:06:38.219> he<00:06:38.310> won't<00:06:38.520> ghost<00:06:38.789> quarter<00:06:39.270> but<00:06:40.139> I

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
here and he won't ghost quarter but I

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.749 
here and he won't ghost quarter but I
made<00:06:40.379> a<00:06:40.409> mistake<00:06:40.620> of<00:06:41.039> activating<00:06:41.580> the<00:06:41.669> ink

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
made a mistake of activating the ink

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.149 
made a mistake of activating the ink
moth<00:06:42.000> because<00:06:42.719> we<00:06:43.139> don't<00:06:43.589> want<00:06:43.830> to<00:06:43.889> attack

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
moth because we don't want to attack

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.889 
moth because we don't want to attack
with<00:06:44.370> it<00:06:44.490> and<00:06:44.639> I<00:06:44.699> realized<00:06:44.940> that<00:06:45.270> too<00:06:45.659> late

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:45.899 
with it and I realized that too late

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:48.320 
with it and I realized that too late
because<00:06:46.409> he's<00:06:46.800> going<00:06:46.979> to<00:06:47.039> sac<00:06:47.339> that<00:06:47.370> but

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
because he's going to sac that but

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.960 
because he's going to sac that but
she<00:06:48.509> has<00:06:48.599> a<00:06:48.629> ghost<00:06:48.900> quarter<00:06:49.259> i<00:06:49.289> know<00:06:49.439> i<00:06:49.650> need

almost replay it and I realized oh shoot
he's<00:06:59.520> got<00:06:59.819> a<00:07:00.000> Gideon<00:07:00.419> so<00:07:00.750> we<00:07:02.000> we<00:07:03.000> sit<00:07:03.270> on<00:07:03.389> the

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
he's got a Gideon so we we sit on the

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.369 
he's got a Gideon so we we sit on the
negate<00:07:04.050> and<00:07:05.659> we're<00:07:06.659> in<00:07:06.780> really<00:07:06.990> good<00:07:07.199> position

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
negate and we're in really good position

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.770 
negate and we're in really good position
now<00:07:07.680> we<00:07:07.830> can<00:07:08.099> replay<00:07:08.430> the<00:07:08.550> blighted<00:07:08.909> agent<00:07:09.270> but

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
now we can replay the blighted agent but

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.649 
now we can replay the blighted agent but
luckily<00:07:10.020> we<00:07:10.319> actually<00:07:10.680> just<00:07:11.060> draw<00:07:12.060> titanic

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 
luckily we actually just draw titanic

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.649 
luckily we actually just draw titanic
growth<00:07:12.870> which<00:07:13.229> is<00:07:13.590> fantastic<00:07:14.250> it's<00:07:15.090> a<00:07:15.330> it's

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:15.659 
growth which is fantastic it's a it's

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:17.659 
growth which is fantastic it's a it's
half<00:07:15.900> their<00:07:16.169> life<00:07:16.349> in<00:07:16.590> this<00:07:16.740> deck<00:07:16.979> and<00:07:17.280> in<00:07:17.550> this

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669 
half their life in this deck and in this

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.300 
half their life in this deck and in this
case<00:07:17.909> it<00:07:18.240> just<00:07:18.300> one<00:07:18.750> shots<00:07:19.080> him<00:07:19.289> so<00:07:19.620> I<00:07:19.830> think

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
case it just one shots him so I think

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.249 
case it just one shots him so I think
this<00:07:20.550> deck<00:07:20.759> has<00:07:20.909> a<00:07:20.940> ton<00:07:21.270> of<00:07:21.300> potential<00:07:21.719> need<00:07:22.169> to
