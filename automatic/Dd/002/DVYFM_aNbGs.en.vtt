00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.000
 Hello 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:22.320
 make things possible that's 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.320
 attitude adore the gas endesa people 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.460
 the project and more intends to update 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.020
 the knowledge of rheumatologists 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.850
 with training courses in the new 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.739
 imaging techniques applied to the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.930
 spondyloarthritis that this year has 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.059
 celebrated its second edition in this 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.440
 sense ankylosing spondylitis is 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.690
 an inflammatory disease that affects 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.970
 mostly to males under 30 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.340
 years your diagnosis may be delayed 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.080
 up to 8 years indicating more damage 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.280
 structure due to the evolution of the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.140
 illness in general the problems 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.829
 derivatives of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.260
 of a late diagnosis are that the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.540
 injuries that we see by 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.760
 radiology doc as they said 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.070
 our previous aunts mates or 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.340
 structural injuries on these 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.590
 injuries we do not have any 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.000
 treatment capacity or modification 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.800
 the main problem in cases of 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.720
 late diagnosis is that the treatment 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.280
 with biological therapies you do not start 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.140
 until the inflammatory process is 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.060
 very advanced and could have caused 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.890
 structural deformity not only of the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.140
 spine but in joints 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.460
 peripherals like the hips is when 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.960
 the art that we have always had a great 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.960
 problem in what is the diagnosis 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.369
 early today I am emerging the concept 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.590
 just like they have arthritis 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.149
 rheumatoid period window then 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.149
 in certain aggressive ways 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.580
 may be indicated a treatment that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.380
 before we could not put in for not having 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.510
 confirmed the diagnosis now we can 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.880
 confirm the diagnosis and in those 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.160
 aggressive forms that were previously doubtful 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 what was happening can you try and 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.690
 that what is beginning to be seen is 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.010
 that is probably changing the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.900
 long- term prognosis of 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.610
 disease the magnetic resonance has 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.200
 proved more effective at the time 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.630
 of detecting inflammatory processes 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.760
 of the spondyloarthropathies versus the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.080
 conventional radiography since this 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.970
 last only shows the changes 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.310
 structural in the bones once 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.500
 produced the magnetic resonance is 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.660
 an imaging technique that what it does is 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 give the information at the moment in 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 that inflammation occurs and this 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.150
 makes it much more precocious to the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.800
 magnetic resonance than what there was 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.210
 so far that on the radiograph in the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.460
 X-ray shows only the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.630
 changes that have occurred and that's why 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.970
 it's so important in resonance 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.200
 magnetic because it shows us in the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.720
 moment when inflammation occurs 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.850
 we have in the early stages we can already 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.830
 see changes and this helps a lot the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.270
 early diagnosis during that second 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.160
 edition of the project and more has been put 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.050
 in progress the use of ipads for 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.700
 the training during the day 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.800
 so the assistants have been able to participate 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.240
 interactively responding to 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.430
 questions while learning to 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.140
 distinguish pathologies between resonance 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.140
 magnetic and conventional radiology
