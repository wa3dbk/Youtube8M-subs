scenes you can interact with move the
clouds<00:01:10.950> other<00:01:11.760> ones<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:13.200> more

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
clouds other ones are a little bit more

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830 
clouds other ones are a little bit more
limited<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> nice<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.299> look<00:01:15.630> when

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
limited but it's a nice little look when

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.100 
limited but it's a nice little look when
you're<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> 3d<00:01:16.590> view<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.110> hit

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you're in the 3d view you have to hit

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.870 
you're in the 3d view you have to hit
the<00:01:19.320> navigation<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> bottom<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> move

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the navigation at the bottom to move

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.870 
the navigation at the bottom to move
along<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.070> then<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.520> through<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
along and then you can go through the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.899 
along and then you can go through the
story<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.840> each<00:01:25.500> time<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
story in that way each time you get a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.399 
story in that way each time you get a
different<00:01:27.180> scene<00:01:29.450> some<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> animations

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
different scene some of the animations

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.910 
different scene some of the animations
are<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> repetitive<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.740> generally<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
are kind of repetitive and generally the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340 
are kind of repetitive and generally the
things<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> sky<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.479> play

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

things in the sky you can actually play
with<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.909> alternate<00:01:39.360> between

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
with a little but you alternate between

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.010 
with a little but you alternate between
a<00:01:39.960> 3d<00:01:40.770> scene<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:42.060> page<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> couple<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
a 3d scene and a page or a couple of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
a 3d scene and a page or a couple of
pages<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.549> through<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.939> read

pages and you can go through and read
the<00:01:45.329> story<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.189> play<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> pieces

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
the story and play with the pieces

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.510 
the story and play with the pieces
sometimes<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.149> interact<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
sometimes you can interact with it and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.840 
sometimes you can interact with it and
sometimes<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.119> spin<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.630> around

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.520 

and<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.689> goes<00:02:01.810> through<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.140> story<00:02:02.380> of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.270 
look is really quite amazing the
production<00:02:12.850> values<00:02:13.150> are<00:02:13.270> really<00:02:13.600> high<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:15.160> in

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
production values are really high but in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.090 
production values are really high but in
terms<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.730> interactivity<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.780> 3d<00:02:17.440> pages

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
terms of the interactivity the 3d pages

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.350 
terms of the interactivity the 3d pages
seem<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.880> offer<00:02:19.060> more<00:02:19.660> than<00:02:21.030> anything<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.180> can

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
to go together it's kind of nice because

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.720 
to go together it's kind of nice because
parent<00:02:38.330> can<00:02:38.510> read<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> page<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:40.100> child<00:02:40.430> can
