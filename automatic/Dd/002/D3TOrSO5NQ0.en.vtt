00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
like to do is just run the run the line

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.340 
like to do is just run the run the line
through<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.180> bull<00:00:43.360> away<00:00:43.449> twice<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:44.260> way

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
through the bull away twice that way

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.689 
through the bull away twice that way
keeps<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.710> from<00:00:44.830> moving<00:00:45.010> around<00:00:45.220> too<00:00:45.519> much

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
keeps it from moving around too much

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.940 
keeps it from moving around too much
when<00:00:46.630> you're<00:00:46.720> casting<00:00:46.899> it<00:00:47.200> out<00:00:47.260> there<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:49.149> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
when you're casting it out there but the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.190 
when you're casting it out there but the
conventional<00:00:50.950> way<00:00:51.040> to<00:00:51.100> do<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.840> would<00:00:52.840> be<00:00:52.899> to

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
conventional way to do it would be to

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.170 
conventional way to do it would be to
just<00:00:56.200> have<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.710> once<00:00:56.920> like<00:00:57.130> that<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.610> it's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
just have it to once like that and it's

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.869 
just have it to once like that and it's
kind<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.629> free<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:59.050> move<00:00:59.559> around<00:00:59.739> as<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:00.670> cast

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
kind of free to move around as you cast

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.240 
kind of free to move around as you cast
it<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.559> what<00:01:02.710> you're<00:01:02.800> going<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.980> want<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.160> do

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
thread the worm up the needle and then

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.050 
thread the worm up the needle and then
pass<00:01:48.849> the<00:01:49.179> offset<00:01:49.599> part<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:49.990> hook

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.340 

just<00:01:53.750> like<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:55.540> its<00:01:56.540> pretty<00:01:56.869> important

here to have the lighter color of the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.260 
here to have the lighter color of the
Senko<00:02:00.439> on<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.310> bottom<00:02:01.700> part<00:02:01.939> of<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.060> hook

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
Senko on the bottom part of the hook

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.330 
Senko on the bottom part of the hook
where<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.570> hook<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.899> taken<00:02:03.320> out<00:02:03.470> when<00:02:04.250> you

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
where the hook is taken out when you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.210 
where the hook is taken out when you
have<00:02:04.549> Senkos<00:02:05.170> kind<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.380> color<00:02:06.649> it

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
have Senkos kind of this color it

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.040 
have Senkos kind of this color it
doesn't<00:02:07.549> really<00:02:07.640> matter<00:02:07.909> but<00:02:08.630> when<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:08.899> have

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
doesn't really matter but when you have

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.540 
doesn't really matter but when you have
the<00:02:09.170> two-tone<00:02:09.560> senkos<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.099> want<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> leg

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
the two-tone senkos you want the leg

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.910 
the two-tone senkos you want the leg
apart<00:02:10.880> at<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.090> bottom<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:12.019> so<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.230> mimics<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
apart at the bottom just so it mimics a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.170 
apart at the bottom just so it mimics a
more<00:02:13.190> natural<00:02:14.380> bait<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.940> next<00:02:19.940> you're<00:02:20.090> going

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
more natural bait so next you're going

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.479 
more natural bait so next you're going
to<00:02:20.239> line<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.450> up<00:02:20.599> like<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.739> then<00:02:22.280> you're

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
to line it up like that and then you're

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.850 
to line it up like that and then you're
going<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.900> right<00:02:23.900> through<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> egg<00:02:24.319> sack<00:02:24.590> here

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
going to right through the egg sack here

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.309 
going to right through the egg sack here
you're<00:02:25.010> going<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.220> put<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.209> second<00:02:27.080> part<00:02:27.260> of

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
you're going to put the second part of

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:37.470 
you're going to put the second part of
the<00:02:27.440> hook<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.140> looks<00:02:36.319> something<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.709> that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
the hook so it looks something like that

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
the hook so it looks something like that
most<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.690> time<00:02:38.870> you're<00:02:39.110> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.260> want<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
most of the time you're going to want to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.059 
most of the time you're going to want to
bury<00:02:40.180> Bay<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.239> tip<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.599> your<00:02:41.780> hook<00:02:41.959> into<00:02:42.260> the

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
bury Bay the tip of your hook into the

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.470 
bury Bay the tip of your hook into the
sinkhole<00:02:43.370> like<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.120> becomes<00:02:44.330> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
sinkhole like that so it becomes a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.809 
sinkhole like that so it becomes a
weedless<00:02:44.660> there's<00:02:45.319> nothing<00:02:45.620> catching<00:02:46.010> onto

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
weedless there's nothing catching onto

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.740 
weedless there's nothing catching onto
the<00:02:47.180> hook<00:02:47.330> there<00:02:47.569> until<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.349> fish<00:02:48.860> bites<00:02:49.130> down

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the hook there until the fish bites down

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.410 
the hook there until the fish bites down
then<00:02:50.750> you're<00:02:50.870> going<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.760> put<00:02:52.760> your<00:02:52.790> bullet<00:02:53.239> to

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
then you're going to put your bullet to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.589 
then you're going to put your bullet to
the<00:02:53.450> end<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.840> cinco<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.440> it'll<00:02:55.099> basically

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
the end of the cinco and it'll basically

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.030 
the end of the cinco and it'll basically
hop<00:02:56.599> along<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.959> floor<00:02:57.140> just<00:02:57.380> like<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.799> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
hop along the floor just like that and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.710 
hop along the floor just like that and
then<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.670> idea<00:02:58.970> here<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.239> when<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> fish

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
then the idea here is when the fish

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.599 
then the idea here is when the fish
takes<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> same<00:03:00.799> go<00:03:00.950> into<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.190> mouth<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
takes the same go into the mouth and

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.970 
takes the same go into the mouth and
bites<00:03:01.940> down<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:03.109> it<00:03:03.230> bites<00:03:03.440> down<00:03:03.650> just<00:03:03.890> like

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
bites down so it bites down just like

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.880 
bites down so it bites down just like
that<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:05.299> hook<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.720> exposed<00:03:06.140> exposed<00:03:06.709> and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
that the hook is exposed exposed and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.680 
that the hook is exposed exposed and
when<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.100> go<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.250> set<00:03:07.459> your<00:03:07.549> hook<00:03:07.730> it'll<00:03:08.540> set

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
when you go to set your hook it'll set

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.080 
when you go to set your hook it'll set
into<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.959> fish's<00:03:09.109> mouth<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.640> yeah<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:10.880> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
into the fish's mouth so yeah that's it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.970 
into the fish's mouth so yeah that's it
