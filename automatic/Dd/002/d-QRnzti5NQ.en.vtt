00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
though I think will be a very good card

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.890 
though I think will be a very good card
to<00:03:10.920> use<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.190> using<00:03:11.580> right<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.390> if<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.630> don't

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
to use if using right like if you don't

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.600 
to use if using right like if you don't
make<00:03:13.110> him<00:03:13.320> if<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:13.830> put<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.070> bit<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.250> pace<00:03:14.459> around
