line<00:04:49.070> as<00:04:50.070> noted<00:04:50.610> by<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.760> stills<00:04:51.210> which<00:04:51.390> i<00:04:51.540> will

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
line as noted by the stills which i will

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.060 
line as noted by the stills which i will
take<00:04:52.220> so<00:04:53.300> yeah<00:04:54.300> it's<00:04:54.720> only<00:04:54.840> 320<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.710> mean<00:04:56.010> I

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
take so yeah it's only 320 I mean I

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.000 
take so yeah it's only 320 I mean I
guess<00:04:56.100> there's<00:04:56.400> time<00:04:56.580> for<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.000> get<00:04:57.150> crazier

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
guess there's time for it to get crazier

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.930 
guess there's time for it to get crazier
but<00:04:59.010> I<00:05:00.710> thought<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.800> would<00:05:01.860> be<00:05:01.980> much<00:05:02.490> more

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
but I thought it would be much more

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.780 
but I thought it would be much more
insane<00:05:03.900> by<00:05:04.140> now
