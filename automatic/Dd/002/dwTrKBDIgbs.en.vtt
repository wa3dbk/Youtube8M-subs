00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.400
 no 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.400
 well it does not everyone know 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.440
 that it's just that you're fine 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.540
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.279
 new video so today I have 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.390
 decided to take my team back it's true 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 that I'm tired of playing a little bit 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.830
 in mono account so take my team 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 it's not really mine 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.930
 it's an assembly of all 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 the characters that as ready for example 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.860
 my brother and my cousin 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.190
 so my brother will lend me normally 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.680
 tonight the coronation is ni and oat mode 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 to what I could play and my cousin 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.540
 lent me so the iop that you see there 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.729
 zana rock out and i would have known i would have 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.890
 in addition zana bard the naked I am 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.409
 optimizing so I think 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.120
 change though by talking about d to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.440
 novara I think I'm going to change his 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.090
 melee you'll see this in the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.740
 next episode of mission optimization 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.750
 then end of the discussion for the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 nights now for the ignore my 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.860
 cousin has really optimized it is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.039
 really not bad he roxy pretty well even 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.430
 he is 12.5 so his staff is finished 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:31.710
 almost I do not think I'll change and 199 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.729
 with 18% of level 200 so he has good 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.210
 sure a green qte to add 160 in 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.149
 strength 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.520
 Professor capture at a janot prpm 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.810
 a carry sword in neutral damage 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.179
 since it was the kim a boot bruce 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.479
 of a belt bruce a ring hump 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.840
 so down there our brusquois yes then to his 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.710
 good wishes and the mussel and hoarse lite 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.149
 so also he wanted a little bit 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.909
 added as an ocher dofus when we 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.380
 added when combining both these 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 two trophies so who are the turbulent 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.300
 and the traveler will give a pea - pm 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.160
 we add the pm and suddenly we will have a 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.190
 pea for 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.670
 thirty-year-old trailing -30 on the run so 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.830
 that's what allows him to be 12 p at 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.510
 he also put a foolish incurable good 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.660
 air mines tile bond major which 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.780
 will have to fight by coughing 5 more force 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.460
 a major earth pest so it's not 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.710
 badly maybe we'll go see together 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.150
 with punch or rather putsch since there 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.040
 in full which do not call differently 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.110
 me in any case I call it punch but 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.730
 good you are used to 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.220
 pronunciations that says do a little 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.600
 little with me we'll wait maybe 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.890
 to have a bigger keira appear 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.210
 go we'll take that one punching 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.160
 ball 75 then we will try to get 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.870
 maximum booster there we will try to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.890
 the tacler I propose you to booster 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.030
 hit a hand-to-hand hit and after 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.240
 I will first change the coach coast 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.370
 go to the coconut field here and in 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.200
 more a little critical so I boost myself 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.390
 at maximum the 2nd round so I think that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.820
 I will pass 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.400
 that's it then I'm going to throw jar on him 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.930
 which will last two rounds so that's 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.930
 impeccable 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.400
 there we will come and we slap him a big 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.980
 sword stroke karim since she was playing the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.520
 peccary I live from you the of you 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.520
 present 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.200
 so at least 3300 two so that's when 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.060
 even acceptable for a melee 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.970
 who is angry despite its cost in pea 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.490
 who remain who remains for me really 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.380
 really huge 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.350
 I may not have launched coup d' etat for 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.700
 not to learn from damage then there 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.660
 coconut makes us coconut because of 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.560
 3441 in critical hit so that's 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.920
 really appreciable 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.170
 we will finish it in concentration mode 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.690
 so wait here, it's over 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.980
 in fact it was very quickly did not 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.080
 really could introduce you all 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.890
 spells I think we'll go back to 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.580
 turned for already thick diop and 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.300
 and the fate juggle his name impressions 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:15.380
 you will also see with the will of 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.820
 tolls or sounds with concentration 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.310
 you'll see that it's pretty much 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.320
 470 480 boost and it's not bad 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.850
 it's really appreciable a good having 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.590
 not dangerous I still congratulate my 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.260
 cousin for for what he did 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.760
 it's really good it's a good set 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.470
 up for tangier trith from us but that's 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.160
 stay between us he knows pretty much 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.140
 play so it's okay and I forgive you so 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.730
 that's it then you're seeing concentration 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:47.630
 who just did the 512 ep diop of 733 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:50.090
 and so you see that on a ride then 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.900
 wait if we cumulate a little bit all on one 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:59.960
 turn the iop typed so then round to 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.760
 1500 2000 was about 2900 so 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.740
 on something that at 0% for sure 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.419
 but it's really a lot so it's 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.150
 Well I like it for me 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:13.010
 well then we'll try as typed at the 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:18.590
 pressure then the pressure 414 4 165 years 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:21.200
 and that's 441 and that's it so I had 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.070
 to start mastering an option that's 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.750
 true that I do not have on the nubas 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.820
 I had to do it 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.290
 while I 'm taking care of what 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.479
 it's useless since he has 200 left 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.400
 maybe goes two students and parents you 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.050
 will see the videos that will arrive on 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.660
 the dungeons we'll try to chain to 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.120
 As the optimizations 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.850
 dungeons more and more difficult and 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.900
 then here I am hoping that 20 the 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.970
 The team's recovery makes you happy 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.680
 you will see new videos with 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.700
 the frigost dungeons three that I 'm going 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.140
 try to do 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.669
 and then maybe the bumps a little bit 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.110
 secret that come from the side quests 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.880
 why not it could be cool 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.680
 in any case me I make you poutous 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.289
 I tell you next time I think 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.690
 it will be another video tonight for 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.490
 optimizing the elected I think go 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.750
 I tell you tonight wear well 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.750
 because the post
