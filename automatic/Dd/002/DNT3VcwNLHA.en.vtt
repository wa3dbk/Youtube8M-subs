00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.240
Hi! This video is about my flight to Triglav Mountain. 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.180
Triglav is highest point of Slovenia and the Julian Alps. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080
I started from Kobala take off in Tolmin town

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.460
After main pass from Kobala there is Bohinj Lake. 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.120
The weather was very fine. 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.020
The cloud base was more than 2500 meters. 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.560
I did not plan the route to Triglav before the flight.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.400
I got the idea of flying to Triglav when I was already in the air. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.160
At the top of Triglav there were about a dozen tourists. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.560
Climbing the Triglav is not simple.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.740
Climbing with the descent can take two days. 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.700
I took my photo camera with me

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
 and shot nice series of pictures there. 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.820
On my way back thermals became weaker 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.720
And I had to fight for the height in Trenta valley and Bovec town

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.880
Working in the same thermal with two gliders. 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.080
More information about paragliding in Slovenia and my flight. 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.220
The most popular paragliding sites of Slovenia are on the north-west of the country.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.340
Here Slovenia borders with Italy from west and Austria from north. 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.820
Every year near Tolmin there are held about five to seven international paragliding competitions. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480
So this place is very popular.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.080
This is the track of my flight. 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.660
I started from Kobala take off near Tolmin

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.000
I passed through the ridge to get the Valley of Bohinj Lake. 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.320
After I flew to Triglav.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.260
 The height of Triglav is 2864 meters. 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.260
From the start to Triglav straightly is for about 24 km. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.280
Afternoon sun began to heat more western slopes

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.360
 and I went back by different way.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600
I flew through the Trenta valley and Bovec town,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.920
Krn Mountain 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
and landed at Camp Gabrje. 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.620
Flight lasted for about 6 hours. 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.240
The distance is 218 km. 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.080
The maximum thermal was 4 m/s.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.220
Video of Kobala take off and landings around Tolmin you can see by watching next video.
