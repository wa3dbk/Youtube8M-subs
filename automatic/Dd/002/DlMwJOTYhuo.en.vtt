you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.870 

so<00:01:08.350> this<00:01:08.470> footage<00:01:08.800> is<00:01:08.890> from<00:01:08.950> my<00:01:09.310> friend<00:01:09.490> Zoe

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
so this footage is from my friend Zoe

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.480 
so this footage is from my friend Zoe
and<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:10.840> flight<00:01:11.110> almost<00:01:11.590> resulted<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.370> her

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
and this flight almost resulted in her

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.730 
and this flight almost resulted in her
quitting<00:01:12.850> flying<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:13.960> let's<00:01:14.110> ride<00:01:14.290> along<00:01:14.560> I'm

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
quitting flying so let's ride along I'm

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.960 
quitting flying so let's ride along I'm
