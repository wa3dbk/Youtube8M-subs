found something that I've never this I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.319 
found something that I've never this I
know<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.960> sure<00:00:37.200> isn't<00:00:37.920> native<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.850> herbicide

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.260 
know for sure isn't native to herbicide
California<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.460> red<00:00:41.940> ear<00:00:42.239> slider

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
California and that is a red ear slider

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.100 
California and that is a red ear slider
a<00:00:43.250> big<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a big one at that so I'm just going to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.560 
a big one at that so I'm just going to
go<00:00:46.230> ahead<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.469> release<00:00:46.800> him<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:48.410> his<00:00:49.410> habitat

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
go ahead and release him but his habitat

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.400 
go ahead and release him but his habitat
check<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.809> out<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.260> I'm<00:00:52.440> assuming<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.219> uh

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
check that out so I'm assuming that uh

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
check that out so I'm assuming that uh
someone<00:00:55.410> released<00:00:55.860> him<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> cream

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
someone released him here in the cream

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
someone released him here in the cream
this<00:00:57.809> fish<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.530> obviously<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.460> he's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this fish is so obviously you know he's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.150 
this fish is so obviously you know he's
healthy<00:01:00.000> he's<00:01:00.149> done<00:01:00.329> well<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.989> other<00:01:01.949> little

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
healthy he's done well and other little

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
healthy he's done well and other little
bump<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> show<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.420> what

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
bump in the show I think that's what

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.210 
bump in the show I think that's what
happens<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> little<00:01:05.040> bit<00:01:05.129> too

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
happens when they get a little bit too

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.460 
happens when they get a little bit too
much<00:01:05.339> protein<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:07.950> crazy<00:01:09.470> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
much protein but this is just crazy to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
was standing here and I saw him like the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.710 
was standing here and I saw him like the
design<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.910> shell<00:02:21.150> which<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.420> thought<00:02:21.569> was

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
design of the shell which I thought was

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.690 
design of the shell which I thought was
strange<00:02:22.050> now<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.129> looks<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.489> turtle

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
strange now that looks like a turtle

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.430 
strange now that looks like a turtle
they<00:02:24.269> can't<00:02:24.599> be<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> turtle<00:02:25.140> another<00:02:25.349> in

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
they can't be a turtle another in

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.110 
they can't be a turtle another in
riverside<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.459> kind<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> stick<00:02:27.000> and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
riverside so I kind of got a stick and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.699 
riverside so I kind of got a stick and
poked<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.629> like<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:27.870> hard<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.379> shell

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
poked it was like it's hard like a shell

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.940 
poked it was like it's hard like a shell
and<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:31.019> slightly<00:02:31.620> moved

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
and then I kind of just slightly moved

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.699 
and then I kind of just slightly moved
it<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.400> ended<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.090> moving<00:02:33.299> so<00:02:34.290> that's<00:02:34.560> when<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
it and ended up moving so that's when I

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.140
