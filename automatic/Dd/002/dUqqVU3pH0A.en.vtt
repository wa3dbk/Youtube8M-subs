00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
mini which I don't really see that we

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.399 
mini which I don't really see that we
are<00:01:07.049> saying<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:08.119> like<00:01:09.119> quality<00:01:09.630> loss<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.650 

there's<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.580> good<00:02:10.729> reason<00:02:10.759> why<00:02:11.090> wouldn't<00:02:11.540> you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
there's a good reason why wouldn't you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.990 
there's a good reason why wouldn't you
have<00:02:11.780> fast<00:02:12.080> food<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.530> maybe<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.580> draws<00:02:13.760> power

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
have fast food on maybe it draws power

have fast food on maybe it draws power
in<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.300> background<00:02:14.690> something<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:17.000> go<00:02:17.270> in

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
in the background something you go in

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.950 
in the background something you go in
the<00:02:17.810> normal<00:02:18.140> mode<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:19.070> s4<00:02:20.060> mini<00:02:20.090> boots<00:02:20.720> up

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
the normal mode the s4 mini boots up

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.610 
the normal mode the s4 mini boots up
quicker<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:22.270> which<00:02:23.270> could<00:02:23.990> be<00:02:24.170> kind<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.560> fun

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
quicker here which could be kind of fun

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.350 
quicker here which could be kind of fun
and<00:02:25.660> interesting<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.900> know<00:02:27.820> but<00:02:28.820> that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
and interesting to know but that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.070 
and interesting to know but that
fastboot<00:02:30.200> mode<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.770> definitely<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.840> does

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
fastboot mode is definitely that does

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.290 
fastboot mode is definitely that does
