00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.250 
scraps right so here we go you have a
plastic<00:00:35.670> bin<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.420> know<00:00:36.540> hopefully<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.140> could

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
plastic bin you know hopefully we could

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.360 
plastic bin you know hopefully we could
actually<00:00:37.440> use<00:00:37.649> something<00:00:38.070> other<00:00:38.129> than<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
actually use something other than a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.270 
actually use something other than a
plastic<00:00:38.579> bit<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.030> PVC<00:00:39.360> these<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:39.899> pretty<00:00:40.280> you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
plastic bit in PVC these are pretty you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
plastic bit in PVC these are pretty you
know<00:00:41.370> ultimately<00:00:41.579> toxic<00:00:42.480> materials<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.410> look

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
know ultimately toxic materials but look

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.670 
know ultimately toxic materials but look
at<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.280> made<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:44.910> hole<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.680> red

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
at this made a little hole here red

everybody has one of these you just take
your<00:00:56.910> exacto<00:00:57.809> blade<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.500> make<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.489> X<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
your exacto blade here and make an X and

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.179 
your exacto blade here and make an X and
then<00:01:01.559> pull<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> tabs<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.769> cut<00:01:04.769> around<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
then pull up the tabs and cut around the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.510 
then pull up the tabs and cut around the
side<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.030> circle<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:10.520> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
side make your circle that way you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
side make your circle that way you
measure<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.939> pipe<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.020> give

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
measure your pipe here and you give

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.899 
measure your pipe here and you give
yourself<00:01:13.260> about<00:01:13.560> two<00:01:13.860> inches<00:01:14.220> sticking<00:01:14.760> out

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
yourself about two inches sticking out

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
yourself about two inches sticking out
here<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.600> drainage<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> cut

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
here and this is for drainage so you cut

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
here and this is for drainage so you cut
it<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> hacksaw<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.909> about<00:01:18.060> two

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it off with a hacksaw right about two

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.789 
it off with a hacksaw right about two
inches<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.200> we're<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.619> take

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
inches and then we're going to go take

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.899 
inches and then we're going to go take
the<00:01:19.950> drill<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.250> we're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> perforate

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the drill and we're going to perforate

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.719 
the drill and we're going to perforate
the<00:01:21.030> pipe<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.509> well<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.130> holes<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.549> for

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the pipe as well so these holes are for

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
the pipe as well so these holes are for
aeration<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> drill<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
aeration so you just want to drill a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
aeration so you just want to drill a
bunch<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.560> holes<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.950> PV<00:01:26.340> PVC<00:01:26.909> pipe<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
bunch of holes in this PV PVC pipe I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.609 
bunch of holes in this PV PVC pipe I
don't<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> exact

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
don't think you have to get to exact

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.770 
don't think you have to get to exact
about<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> 20<00:01:29.549> 25<00:01:29.850> holes<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> some<00:01:33.540> people

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
about it 20 25 holes so some people

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.719 
about it 20 25 holes so some people
drill<00:01:34.020> more<00:01:34.259> holes<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> bin<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.400> aeration

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
drill more holes in the bin for aeration

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
drill more holes in the bin for aeration
but<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> try<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
but we're just going to try it like this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.960 
but we're just going to try it like this
because<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.250> seems<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.759> should<00:01:38.880> be

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
because it seems like this should be

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.830 
because it seems like this should be
enough<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:40.530> tube<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:42.390> drainage

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
enough this tube here is for drainage

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.530 
enough this tube here is for drainage
and<00:01:42.960> aeration<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> have

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
and aeration so you're going to have

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.999 
and aeration so you're going to have
liquid<00:01:45.540> coming<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.409> putting<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.740> pan

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
liquid coming out there so putting a pan

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.380 
liquid coming out there so putting a pan
under<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.490> you're<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> capture<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
under there you're going to capture this

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.460 
under there you're going to capture this
you<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:48.960> worm<00:01:49.259> castings<00:01:50.009> t<00:01:50.720> basically<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you know worm castings t basically so

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.929 
you know worm castings t basically so
that's<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.100> good<00:01:53.250> fertilizer<00:01:53.670> as

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that's going to be good fertilizer as

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.780 
that's going to be good fertilizer as
well<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.290> simple<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:56.700> we're

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
well it's really simple so now we're

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.130 
well it's really simple so now we're
going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> cut<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> mesh<00:01:57.600> which<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
going to cut the mesh which is the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.390 
going to cut the mesh which is the
bottom<00:01:58.500> support<00:01:58.950> layer

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.030 

so<00:02:03.400> we<00:02:03.549> notice<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.619> bottom<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.860> lid

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
so we notice that the bottom of the lid
