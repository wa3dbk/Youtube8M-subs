00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
the icing smoother work it is a

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.330 
the icing smoother work it is a
double-sided<00:00:55.239> blade<00:00:55.840> with<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.770> comfort<00:00:57.310> grip

handle in the center and it is nine
inches<00:01:00.010> tall<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:00.400> it's<00:01:00.730> great<00:01:00.970> because<00:01:01.329> even

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
inches tall so it's great because even

swing<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.329> I'm<00:01:08.229> going<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.530> demonstrate<00:01:08.740> how

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
swing and I'm going to demonstrate how

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.000 
swing and I'm going to demonstrate how
easy<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.909> use<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:10.210> as<00:01:10.390> well<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:11.680> it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
easy it is to use this as well now it's

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.469 
easy it is to use this as well now it's
really<00:01:12.220> important<00:01:12.700> when<00:01:12.790> you're<00:01:12.940> icing<00:01:13.360> your

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
really important when you're icing your

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.950 
really important when you're icing your
cakes<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:14.260> use<00:01:15.250> icing<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.659> correct

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
cakes to use icing that is the correct

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.600 
cakes to use icing that is the correct
consistency<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.490> it's<00:01:18.670> not<00:01:18.880> too<00:01:19.330> stiff<00:01:19.810> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
consistency that it's not too stiff to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.280 
consistency that it's not too stiff to
spread<00:01:21.610> okay<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.299> it's<00:01:22.690> it's<00:01:22.900> going<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.140> be<00:01:23.229> a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
spread okay so it's it's going to be a

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.680 
spread okay so it's it's going to be a
little<00:01:23.620> bit<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:24.070> little<00:01:24.520> bit<00:01:24.640> looser<00:01:24.909> than<00:01:25.390> if

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
little bit a little bit looser than if

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.810 
little bit a little bit looser than if
you<00:01:25.840> were<00:01:25.960> say<00:01:26.170> doing<00:01:26.380> roses<00:01:26.860> or<00:01:27.100> borders<00:01:27.520> or

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
you were say doing roses or borders or

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.430 
you were say doing roses or borders or
something<00:01:28.150> like<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.299> really<00:01:28.930> important<00:01:29.350> to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
something like that really important to

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.289 
something like that really important to
start<00:01:29.680> with<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.010> because<00:01:30.250> if<00:01:30.670> your<00:01:30.790> icing<00:01:31.150> is

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
start with that because if your icing is

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.510 
start with that because if your icing is
too<00:01:31.600> stiff<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.409> start<00:01:32.680> with<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.070> going<00:01:33.430> to

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
too stiff to start with it's going to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.660 
too stiff to start with it's going to
give<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.820> lot<00:01:34.030> more<00:01:34.060> problems<00:01:35.130> okay<00:01:36.159> so

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
give you a lot more problems okay so

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.370 
give you a lot more problems okay so
I've<00:01:36.820> made<00:01:37.030> sure<00:01:37.240> my<00:01:37.390> icing<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.930> really<00:01:38.229> nice

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
I've made sure my icing is a really nice

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.530 
I've made sure my icing is a really nice
consistency<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.520> you're<00:01:40.119> just<00:01:40.270> going<00:01:40.450> to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
consistency and you're just going to

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.390 
consistency and you're just going to
start<00:01:40.780> by<00:01:40.869> icing<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.530> cake<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:41.979> would

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
start by icing the cake as you would

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.270 
start by icing the cake as you would
regularly<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.180> top<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.900> sides<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.650> as

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
regularly the top and the sides and as

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.520 
regularly the top and the sides and as
you<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.700> see<00:01:45.880> I'm<00:01:46.090> not<00:01:46.390> icing<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.049> perfectly

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
you can see I'm not icing it perfectly

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.870 
you can see I'm not icing it perfectly
by<00:01:47.830> any<00:01:48.070> means<00:01:48.400> but<00:01:49.330> it<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.570> also<00:01:49.810> not

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
by any means but it is also not

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.820 
by any means but it is also not
SuperDuper<00:01:51.880> wavy<00:01:52.869> or<00:01:53.110> anything<00:01:53.500> like<00:01:53.770> that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
SuperDuper wavy or anything like that

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.320 
SuperDuper wavy or anything like that
because<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.280> more<00:01:54.430> wavy<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.119> start

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
because the more wavy it is to start

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.310 
because the more wavy it is to start
with<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.570> more<00:01:55.720> times<00:01:55.930> we're<00:01:56.080> going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.229> have

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
with the more times we're going to have

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.700 
with the more times we're going to have
to<00:01:56.530> go<00:01:56.650> around<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.100> cake<00:01:57.310> with<00:01:57.909> our<00:01:58.119> smoother

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to go around the cake with our smoother

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.830 
to go around the cake with our smoother

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
tool you will be able to be a little bit

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.030 
tool you will be able to be a little bit
faster<00:03:06.220> with<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.519> as<00:03:06.760> well<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:11.920> few

faster with this as well and just a few

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.800 
faster with this as well and just a few
rotations<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.849> get<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> very<00:03:13.299> nice<00:03:13.510> very

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
rotations and you get a very nice very

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.710 
rotations and you get a very nice very
flat<00:03:14.230> finish<00:03:14.620> now<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.220> can<00:03:15.640> use<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.209> part<00:03:16.540> of

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
flat finish now you can use this part of

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.410 
flat finish now you can use this part of
the<00:03:17.049> tool<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.560> grip<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.220> just<00:03:18.390> scrape<00:03:19.390> the

going to do the same thing on the sides
and<00:03:25.569> this<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> 90<00:03:26.799> degree<00:03:27.100> angle<00:03:27.130> here<00:03:27.639> which

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
and this is a 90 degree angle here which

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.879 
and this is a 90 degree angle here which
is<00:03:28.030> good<00:03:28.239> because<00:03:28.389> we<00:03:28.840> are<00:03:28.870> going<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.170> rest<00:03:29.560> the
