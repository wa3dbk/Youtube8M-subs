00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.230
 so it's really a specialty 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.510
 north of our regions Moslem Vosges and as a rule of 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.700
 all the foothills 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.809
 of all mountainous properties 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.089
 it's a trout 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.509
 she was alive in the basin 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.929
 this is roughly a standard trout caliber sas is a brown trout 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.089
 world after two years of preparation 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.329
 so there the chili is hacked 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.439
 not the rule 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.899
 I prepared winger five more than I'm going 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.909
 simply in general as the displayed your fishmonger 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.329
 l avoid keeping it as long as possible 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.560
 in the lot 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.580
 because it's the only way to cook it so-called blues 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.500
 it's a cooking 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.620
 in another show going on 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.840
 highly salty what I'm going to do yet now since I do not have 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.860
 made 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.510
 good dirtyh behavior 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.940
 a bouquet garni if â€‹â€‹you have if you want just 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 small bay leaves 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.010
 then it's on the contrary 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.060
 here is the city 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
 we built his predecessor 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.350
 and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.240
 with for simple white vinegar 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.590
 wendigo belfort what you have at home 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.970
 actually try this is the place does the stop 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 who will give him the famous blue color 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.159
 the 605 ghana more and more years 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.740
 Fish 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.560
 if you have them 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.300
 the fish notebooks 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.219
 and being surrounded by a layer 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.219
 a little bit the level of this society 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.009
 the reaction 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.579
 with the acidity of vinegar or lemon besides art in celebration 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.820
 to give itself that color this blue coloring bouh the appellation 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.710
 trout blue hole 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.740
 because technically it's actually a poached fish 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.880
 so why 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.510
 the cooking 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.900
 of biblical simplicity 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.609
 you have another friend probably 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.340
 at the end of nantes 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.619
 recognition and how many degrees 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.450
 so after ten years 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.450
 between 60 and 80 degrees 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.709
 he adds if that wages 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.889
 for him it is necessary that this salon a bouquet garni to hear that a bay leaf 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.049
 so why saleh 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.509
 because they 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.509
 I will not go into too many technical details but 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.079
 physically speaking 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.279
 of 17 million that are contained in the flesh of the fish 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.879
 if you do not ally you leave the fish meat to migrate into 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.769
 the water 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.969
 osmosis principle fight the middle most concentrated to the least 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.620
 concentrated actually so focused heavily salty because it's going 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.799
 allow the fish 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.799
 to keep all the mineral salts that gives it 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.739
 auffret bixente 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.689
 so divers from the estrie six years 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.979
 in my trout cooking time and then 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.469
 cooking time 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.859
 it's a certain time 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.429
 for us the cooking time is in the eye 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:08.809
 in the sense that 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.359
 when I look 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.469
 the harvest 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.469
 yes and I still have a little bit of sense the lombard agree 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.229
 cooking that means 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.759
 all this part is perfectly white 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.349
 as the fish is always so alone his troop 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.380
 at one point we can see we'll see okay 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.879
 there we do like the fish that bring them back 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.150
 from mombassa he already has a good half hour 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.980
 so that the cooking time is going to be of the order of 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680
 5 to 6 minutes maximum 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.579
 license fees 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 never on leather a trout because it's a pity 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.259
 so we'll leave it quietly 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.589
 live your life finally 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.219
 Yes 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 yes, I'm going 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.969
 then the accompaniment 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.059
 trout 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.919
 it's a dish 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.269
 by himself 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.329
 so for so little melted butter 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.079
 clarified bert 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.859
 then clarify understand 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.319
 a clump of butter 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.949
 you melt it gently preferably in a bain-marie and you go 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.150
 have the fat that will separate from the whey 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.659
 you skim the whey 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.039
 and you have with their clarified well I do not think I have 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.020
 a little bit of lemon 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.259
 in europe we chose whey and potatoes 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.259
 who are actually 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.099
 potatoes from Brittany which has the advantage of being able to be written in the 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:34.539
 skin 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.949
 we did a lot of play and a firm flesh 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.529
 by floury 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.539
 since as it should be and then other marriage of fear this season but the 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.289
 marathon itself it turns out a little better 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.069
 Lemon preparation is 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.279
 so that's happening on the plate or 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.409
 replaced because after that ie they 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.419
 once you have lifted your skin 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.610
 more to say that actually allows to put a little scared trickle 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.909
 and a little trickle of lemon juice as soon as you have a fish that is 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.710
 perfectly balanced 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.059
 who is aesthetically worried 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:06.559
 except for the butter 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:09.559
 though 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.770
 see could not be simpler 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.229
 I'm worried what I see that it goes in all directions hand is 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.870
 normal then that's normal because he knows that this is the proof that 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.819
 it's a fish that was alive a few weeks ago 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.819
 okay a few minutes 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.860
 while it is traditional 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.969
 who wants that 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.189
 the fish always comes up 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.189
 4 left for three months so we simply go away 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.020
 traces the art 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.370
 I take off the skin 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.809
 Carefully 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.050
 and that you lift your foot with 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.050
 the greatest simplicity and see how trainees 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.370
 stops perfectly white more trace 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.319
 slightly pink flesh 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.680
 like kaka 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.229
 Want to join us 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.559
 but if legally 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:58.499
 our desire for theater 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.849
