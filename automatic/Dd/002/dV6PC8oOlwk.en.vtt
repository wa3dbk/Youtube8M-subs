after playing on several of these so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.610 
after playing on several of these so
this<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.149> where<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.510> base<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.719> located<00:00:37.440> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
this is where my base is located it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.729 
this is where my base is located it's
actually<00:00:37.920> underground<00:00:39.530> firstly<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> would

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
actually underground firstly I would

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.680 
actually underground firstly I would
like<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.070> suggest<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.059> should<00:00:42.480> not

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
like to suggest that you should not

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
like to suggest that you should not
build<00:00:43.020> within<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.710> thousand<00:00:44.190> blocks<00:00:44.370> from

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
build within a thousand blocks from

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.560 
build within a thousand blocks from
spawn<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.620> anywhere<00:00:46.620> from<00:00:46.829> 5,000<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> 10,000

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
spawn I'm anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.220 
spawn I'm anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000
blocks<00:00:48.780> from<00:00:48.930> spawn<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:50.780> usually<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> good<00:00:52.140> idea

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
blocks from spawn is usually a good idea

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.160 
blocks from spawn is usually a good idea
so<00:00:53.010> usually<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.520> server<00:00:53.789> has<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.270> 50

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so usually this server has about 50

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
so usually this server has about 50
people<00:00:55.379> online<00:00:55.969> it's<00:00:56.969> later<00:00:57.270> than<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
people online it's later than I in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.569 
people online it's later than I in
Australia<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> Americans

Australia right now so all the Americans
and<00:00:59.789> 10<00:01:00.030> who<00:01:00.180> are<00:01:00.270> usually<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.809> are

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and 10 who are usually on here are

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.369 
and 10 who are usually on here are
asleep<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> yeah<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.960> travel

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
everywhere so the chance of them finding

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.050

been inhabitant it's been inhabited yeah
see<00:01:37.619> there's<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.920> cacti<00:01:38.430> yourself<00:01:38.759> like

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
see there's like cacti yourself like

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.510 
see there's like cacti yourself like
that<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.810> your<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.340> could

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that so if your not going like you could

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
that so if your not going like you could
always<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.150> base<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> make<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
always have your base and make it so it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.990 
always have your base and make it so it
looks<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.619> no<00:01:43.799> one's<00:01:43.950> been<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.880> a

good way but if you like us and you want
trees<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.640> stuff<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> surface<00:01:48.540> reads

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
trees and stuff on the surface reads

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.499 
trees and stuff on the surface reads
cacti<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.820> always<00:01:50.939> build<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.329> on

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
cacti you can always build all this on

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.999 
cacti you can always build all this on
the<00:01:51.600> ground<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.049> decided<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.680> half

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the ground but we decided to have half

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.959 
the ground but we decided to have half
and<00:01:53.189> half<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> want<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.969> hide

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and half so what you want to do is hide

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.410 
and half so what you want to do is hide
the<00:01:57.119> entrance<00:01:57.630> hide<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.530> dirt<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
the entrance hide up with dirt and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.819 
the entrance hide up with dirt and
before<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> log<00:02:00.719> off<00:02:00.840> make<00:02:01.170> sure<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.619> dirt

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
before you log off make sure the dirt

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.859 
before you log off make sure the dirt
has<00:02:02.100> turned<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> grasp<00:02:02.759> well<00:02:03.479> there's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.750> guy

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
has turned to grasp well there's a guy

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
has turned to grasp well there's a guy
cool<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.290> pack<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.799> server<00:02:05.270> Wow<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.280> what

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
cool to pack on this server Wow and what

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.699 
cool to pack on this server Wow and what
I've<00:02:08.399> worked<00:02:08.849> out<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.209> usually<00:02:10.020> they<00:02:10.349> look<00:02:10.560> for

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I've worked out is usually they look for

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.229 
I've worked out is usually they look for
something<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.520> come<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.849> island

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
something if you come this island

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
something if you come this island
there's<00:02:12.450> no<00:02:12.540> Chester

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
there's no Chester

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.839 
there's no Chester
universe's<00:02:14.159> wishes<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:14.760> probably

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
universe's wishes so you're probably

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.119 
universe's wishes so you're probably
going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> dig<00:02:15.359> around<00:02:15.530> get<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.650> shovel<00:02:17.010> out

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
going to dig around get your shovel out

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.580 
going to dig around get your shovel out
but<00:02:17.909> what<00:02:18.060> we've<00:02:18.209> done<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.989> can<00:02:19.409> either

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
but what we've done is you can either

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.339 
but what we've done is you can either
build<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.189> house<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.640> top<00:02:20.900> we'll<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.079> chest

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
build a house on top we'll have a chest

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.440 
build a house on top we'll have a chest
and<00:02:22.769> since<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.459> got<00:02:23.640> loads<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.909> diamonds<00:02:24.329> we

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and since we got loads of diamonds we

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.599 
and since we got loads of diamonds we
thought<00:02:24.629> to<00:02:24.900> diamonds<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.650> loads<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.519> other

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
thought to diamonds and loads of other

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.000 
thought to diamonds and loads of other
new<00:02:26.909> be<00:02:27.060> soft<00:02:27.329> so<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:27.870> looks<00:02:28.409> like<00:02:28.469> someone's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
new be soft so it looks like someone's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.949 
new be soft so it looks like someone's
put<00:02:29.280> all<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.609> stuff<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.840> they

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
put all that stuff in here so they

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.080 
put all that stuff in here so they
likely<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.379> come<00:02:31.590> across<00:02:31.650> find<00:02:32.519> this<00:02:32.609> island

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
likely to come across find this island

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
likely to come across find this island
like<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.750> chance<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.109> them<00:02:34.230> finding<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> isn't

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
like the chance of them finding it isn't

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.429 
like the chance of them finding it isn't
that<00:02:35.219> high<00:02:35.689> but<00:02:36.689> if<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:36.900> find<00:02:37.139> it<00:02:37.260> they'll

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
that high but if they find it they'll

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.110 
that high but if they find it they'll
see<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.859> they'll<00:02:38.370> take<00:02:38.579> get<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:38.939> league

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
see this they'll take get in that league

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.179 
see this they'll take get in that league
if<00:02:39.689> they<00:02:39.840> don't<00:02:40.019> see<00:02:40.200> anything<00:02:40.620> they're<00:02:41.040> going

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
if they don't see anything they're going

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.470 
if they don't see anything they're going
to<00:02:41.250> get<00:02:41.400> curious<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.969> probably<00:02:42.269> start

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
to get curious and probably start

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.140 
to get curious and probably start
digging<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:42.870> your<00:02:42.900> Island<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.790> smash<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.819> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
digging up your Island and smash it to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.110 
digging up your Island and smash it to
bits<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> thought<00:02:47.069> having<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.669> chest<00:02:47.909> on<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
bits so I thought having a chest on the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.280 
bits so I thought having a chest on the
surface<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.629> always<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> good<00:02:49.079> idea<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:51.290> I'll

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
surface is always a good idea and I'll

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.440 
surface is always a good idea and I'll
just<00:02:52.590> show<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.799> are<00:02:53.220> another<00:02:53.939> way<00:02:54.060> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
just show you are another way that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.559 
just show you are another way that
people<00:02:54.569> enter<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.200> through<00:02:55.530> nether<00:02:55.769> portals

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
people enter is through nether portals

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.929 
people enter is through nether portals
so<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.810> our<00:02:57.959> base<00:02:58.139> we<00:02:58.409> have<00:02:58.650> another<00:02:59.430> portal

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
so in our base we have another portal

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.319 
so in our base we have another portal
and<00:03:01.579> usually<00:03:02.579> if<00:03:02.730> you're<00:03:02.879> walking<00:03:03.000> through

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
and usually if you're walking through

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.580 
and usually if you're walking through
the<00:03:03.419> nether<00:03:03.599> you'll<00:03:03.810> find<00:03:04.109> other<00:03:04.260> portals

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the nether you'll find other portals

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.440 
the nether you'll find other portals
every<00:03:04.799> now<00:03:04.919> and<00:03:05.010> then<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.519> like<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.269> can

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
every now and then and that like you can

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.580 
every now and then and that like you can
jump<00:03:06.659> in<00:03:06.840> them<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.079> they'll<00:03:07.230> lead<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.500> to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
jump in them and they'll lead you to

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.670 
jump in them and they'll lead you to
someone<00:03:07.829> else's<00:03:08.099> base<00:03:08.419> so<00:03:09.419> what<00:03:09.750> ah<00:03:09.959> we've

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
someone else's base so what ah we've

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.059 
someone else's base so what ah we've
done<00:03:10.889> it's<00:03:11.069> gonna<00:03:11.189> decoyed<00:03:11.790> ours<00:03:11.969> so<00:03:12.299> it's<00:03:13.069> a

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
done it's gonna decoyed ours so it's a

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.530 
done it's gonna decoyed ours so it's a
good<00:03:14.219> idea<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.790> room<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.510> a

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
good idea to have the room in with a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.149 
good idea to have the room in with a
portal<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.169> like<00:03:16.290> black<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
portal in it like black and have the

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.240 
portal in it like black and have the
floor<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.579> black<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.569> have<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> hole<00:03:19.250> so

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
floor like black and have a hole so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.430 
floor like black and have a hole so
they'll<00:03:20.699> see<00:03:20.909> it's<00:03:21.060> dark<00:03:21.239> step<00:03:21.720> out<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.109> they

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
they'll see it's dark step out and they

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.229 
they'll see it's dark step out and they
will<00:03:22.590> die<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.729> chance<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.090> them<00:03:24.209> getting

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
will die and the chance of them getting

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.259 
will die and the chance of them getting
back<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.930> pretty<00:03:25.169> low<00:03:25.909> so<00:03:26.909> yeah<00:03:27.120> we

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
back to it is pretty low so yeah we

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.089 
back to it is pretty low so yeah we
thought<00:03:27.449> that's<00:03:27.900> another<00:03:28.169> good<00:03:28.409> way<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.620> decoy

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
thought that's another good way to decoy

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.149 
thought that's another good way to decoy
your<00:03:29.310> base<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:30.079> also<00:03:31.079> if<00:03:31.470> your<00:03:31.620> house<00:03:31.829> does

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
your base and also if your house does

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.869 
your base and also if your house does
get<00:03:32.489> raided<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.109> always<00:03:34.349> like<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.519> good

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
get raided you can always like a good

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.089 
get raided you can always like a good
tip<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.299> log<00:03:36.659> out<00:03:36.810> with<00:03:37.109> all<00:03:37.409> your<00:03:37.620> valuable
