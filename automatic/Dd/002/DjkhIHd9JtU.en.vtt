00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.680
 hello, good morning today we are going to make a recipe say the other broadcasts institutes 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 to start with the recipe we will make a broth 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.030
 It's with an onion 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.940
 no daughter-in-law 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.500
 this option and leek 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.280
 but if you do not have this ingredient in each you can use 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.980
 that industrial broth 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.900
 or chicken broth or vegetable stock 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 You can only start with a little olive oil in the pan 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.460
 places others 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.479
 bad one 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.479
 golden kleber 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.140
 climbed into the bush 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.159
 after the melted butter you enter with the onion 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.010
 inside the onion it goes 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.680
 We're human and she's going to wilt. That's a good team. It's looking like 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 and now we go with the goiÃ¡s 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.420
 This is going to be bad 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.960
 The more you tweet a thing but it will take time 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.160
 enough 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.370
 stand out can still come with the wine white wine late 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.080
 after it was started to dry 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 we start 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.940
 How is a background game you can? 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.820
 a pulitzer with 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.610
 6 3 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.650
 we play the game 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.340
 we got blown 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160
 lost water 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 in fact losing 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.410
 to moisturize the bottom 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.109
 according to Mary and treated ne 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.779
 I speak as an actress 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.359
 a little olive oil 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:15.689
 just to give a 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.649
 the highest value 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.289
 a little salt 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.759
 already with the works of the project 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.229
 is almost at the point 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.709
 The people outside 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.459
 we put 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.239

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.649
 and the butter people put at the end 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.649
 let's go far 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.139
 each one asked for his death in the trash 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.499
