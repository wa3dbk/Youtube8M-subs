00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.640 

this<00:00:40.820> is<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:41.000> surprisingly<00:00:41.600> tricky<00:00:41.840> process<00:00:42.260> to

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
this is a surprisingly tricky process to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.370 
this is a surprisingly tricky process to
control<00:00:43.120> because<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.270> turbine<00:00:44.660> itself<00:00:44.780> has

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
control because the turbine itself has

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.500 
control because the turbine itself has
friction<00:00:46.310> that<00:00:46.340> comes<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:46.910> goes<00:00:46.940> we<00:00:47.360> have<00:00:47.450> a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
friction that comes and goes we have a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.780 
friction that comes and goes we have a
bearing<00:00:47.870> that's<00:00:48.170> going<00:00:48.500> bad<00:00:48.710> probably<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:49.700> a

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
bearing that's going bad probably in a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.240 
bearing that's going bad probably in a
tachogenerator<00:00:50.240> and<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.350> that<00:00:51.530> presents<00:00:51.950> an

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
tachogenerator and so that presents an

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.490 
tachogenerator and so that presents an
occasional<00:00:52.760> almost<00:00:53.120> random<00:00:53.570> load<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:54.380> our

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
occasional almost random load to our

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.800 
occasional almost random load to our
system<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.580> causes<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.120> speed<00:00:56.360> to<00:00:56.480> jump<00:00:56.720> up

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
system that causes the speed to jump up

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.840 
system that causes the speed to jump up
and<00:00:56.930> down<00:00:57.020> unpredictably<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.520> valve<00:00:58.700> of

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
and down unpredictably and the valve of

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.970 
and down unpredictably and the valve of
course<00:00:59.060> has<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.450> compensate<00:00:59.780> for<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.170> so

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
course has to compensate for that so

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.280 
course has to compensate for that so

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
will build processes like this something

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.370 
will build processes like this something
as<00:01:31.250> simple<00:01:31.280> as<00:01:31.670> an<00:01:31.790> air<00:01:31.940> turban<00:01:32.300> being<00:01:32.479> spun<00:01:32.810> or

or some other easy to control process

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060 
or some other easy to control process
and<00:01:38.090> then<00:01:38.509> what<00:01:38.660> they<00:01:38.780> will<00:01:38.930> do<00:01:39.080> is<00:01:39.110> practice<00:01:39.650> a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
and then what they will do is practice a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.340 
and then what they will do is practice a
PID<00:01:40.520> tuning<00:01:41.000> each<00:01:41.600> student<00:01:41.930> will<00:01:42.140> get<00:01:42.320> a

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
PID tuning each student will get a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.100 
PID tuning each student will get a
chance<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.710> choose<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.700> control<00:01:44.510> system<00:01:44.900> and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
chance to choose the control system and

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.800 
chance to choose the control system and
was<00:01:45.710> nice<00:01:45.860> enough<00:01:46.150> systems<00:01:47.150> like<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:47.510> it's

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
was nice enough systems like this it's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.870 
was nice enough systems like this it's
fairly<00:01:48.110> easy<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.650> adjust<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.310> operational

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
fairly easy to adjust the operational

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.970 
fairly easy to adjust the operational
parameters<00:01:50.060> in<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.450> system<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:51.050> example

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
parameters in the system for example

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.760 
parameters in the system for example
over<00:01:52.670> here<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:53.150> have<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.840> variable<00:01:54.170> air<00:01:54.470> pressure

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
over here I have a variable air pressure

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.730 
over here I have a variable air pressure
I<00:01:55.070> can<00:01:55.850> turn<00:01:56.000> up<00:01:56.180> a<00:01:56.300> turn<00:01:56.510> down<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.470> air

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
I can turn up a turn down and this air

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.680 
I can turn up a turn down and this air
pressure<00:01:58.010> is<00:01:58.190> my<00:01:58.310> supply<00:01:58.670> pressure<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.300> my

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
pressure is my supply pressure to my

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.840 
pressure is my supply pressure to my
turban<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.680> obviously<00:02:01.190> i<00:02:01.280> turn<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.730> air

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
turban so obviously i turn the air

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.270 
turban so obviously i turn the air
pressure<00:02:02.000> up<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:03.080> gives<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.380> higher<00:02:03.650> gain<00:02:04.070> to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
pressure up that gives a higher gain to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.190 
pressure up that gives a higher gain to
the<00:02:04.310> system<00:02:04.820> now<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.480> same<00:02:05.840> amount<00:02:05.960> of

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
the system now the same amount of

the system now the same amount of
control<00:02:06.440> valve<00:02:06.710> motion<00:02:07.100> will<00:02:07.190> have<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.370> greater

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
control valve motion will have a greater

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.669 
control valve motion will have a greater
influence<00:02:08.149> on<00:02:08.480> turbine<00:02:09.080> speed<00:02:09.290> than<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.590> did

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
influence on turbine speed than it did

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.199 
influence on turbine speed than it did
before<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.580> i<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:10.790> do<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:10.910> right<00:02:11.150> now

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
before so i can do that right now

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.620 
before so i can do that right now
turning<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.959> air<00:02:12.050> pressure<00:02:12.170> up<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:14.239> can<00:02:14.420> hear

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
turning the air pressure up you can hear

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.180 
turning the air pressure up you can hear
the<00:02:14.810> turban<00:02:15.140> increased<00:02:15.500> food<00:02:15.739> then<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
the turban increased food then the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.009 
the turban increased food then the
control<00:02:16.550> system<00:02:16.880> kicks<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.540> tries<00:02:17.989> to

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
control system kicks in and tries to

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.560 
control system kicks in and tries to
regulate<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.590> speed<00:02:18.709> at<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.010> set<00:02:19.280> point<00:02:19.570> but

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
regulate the speed at the set point but

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.390 
regulate the speed at the set point but
in<00:02:20.690> turning<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.080> air<00:02:21.200> pressure<00:02:21.440> up<00:02:21.680> I've<00:02:22.190> not

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
in turning that air pressure up I've not

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.979 
in turning that air pressure up I've not
changed<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.850> dynamic<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.450> system<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
changed the dynamic of the system the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.860 
changed the dynamic of the system the
system<00:02:24.440> now<00:02:24.890> has<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.100> higher<00:02:25.370> gain<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.390> overall

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
system now has a higher gain so overall

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.690 
system now has a higher gain so overall
have<00:02:27.260> more<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.560> tendency<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.980> oscillate<00:02:28.489> how

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
have more of a tendency to oscillate how

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.030 
have more of a tendency to oscillate how
did<00:02:28.880> before<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:30.230> fact<00:02:30.440> we'll<00:02:30.620> begin<00:02:30.860> to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
did before and in fact we'll begin to

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.890 
did before and in fact we'll begin to
see<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.280> little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.790> right<00:02:32.000> here<00:02:32.030> as<00:02:32.420> I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
see a little bit of that right here as I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.259 
see a little bit of that right here as I
turn<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.350> gain<00:02:33.500> up<00:02:33.530> we're<00:02:33.980> seeing<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.519> greater

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
turn the gain up we're seeing a greater

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.360 
turn the gain up we're seeing a greater
oscillation<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.680> down

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
oscillation up and down

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.879 
oscillation up and down
set<00:02:37.640> point
