so<00:00:50.579> many<00:00:50.789> different<00:00:51.210> ways<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.690> using<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so many different ways of using it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
so many different ways of using it

of course quantum touch and others the

of course quantum touch and others the
thing<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.980> energy<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> find<00:01:00.059> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
thing about the energy that I find so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.609 
thing about the energy that I find so
amazing<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.789> necessarily

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
amazing is that it doesn't necessarily

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.270 
amazing is that it doesn't necessarily
just<00:01:04.619> work<00:01:05.659> with<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> should

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
just work with what we think it should

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
just work with what we think it should
do<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.150> wanted<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.470> we

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
do and what we wanted to do and what we

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.000 
do and what we wanted to do and what we
expected<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.390> worked<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.979> I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
expected to do it worked with what I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
expected to do it worked with what I
like<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.000> body<00:01:15.270> intelligence<00:01:15.689> or

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
like to think of as body intelligence or

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.090 
like to think of as body intelligence or
perhaps<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:17.340> more<00:01:17.580> accurately<00:01:18.210> as

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
perhaps much more accurately as

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.380 
perhaps much more accurately as
spiritual<00:01:20.100> intelligence<00:01:20.430> that's<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
spiritual intelligence that's the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
spiritual intelligence that's the
intelligence<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> universe<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
intelligence of the universe so you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
intelligence of the universe so you
might<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.450> working<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.110> someone's<00:01:25.560> headache

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
might be working on someone's headache

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
might be working on someone's headache
running<00:01:26.310> energy<00:01:26.700> into<00:01:26.909> their<00:01:27.090> head<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> find

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
running energy into their head and find

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
running energy into their head and find
out<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:28.979> sinus<00:01:29.369> pain<00:01:29.579> went<00:01:29.850> away

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
out that their sinus pain went away

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
out that their sinus pain went away
that's<00:01:30.270> happened<00:01:30.720> hundreds<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.140> times<00:01:31.350> we've

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that's happened hundreds of times we've

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.580 
that's happened hundreds of times we've
even<00:01:32.250> seen<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> person<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.170> working<00:01:34.500> on

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
even seen I when a person is working on

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.069 
even seen I when a person is working on
the<00:01:34.770> head<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> eyesight<00:01:36.420> has<00:01:36.570> changed

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the head that the eyesight has changed

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
the head that the eyesight has changed
in<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.650> case<00:01:37.890> some<00:01:38.189> people<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.610> working<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
in one case some people are working a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.640 
in one case some people are working a
woman<00:01:39.540> who's<00:01:39.659> working<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:40.049> another<00:01:40.200> woman's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
woman who's working on another woman's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.550 
woman who's working on another woman's
neck<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.670> her<00:01:42.390> hearing<00:01:42.689> came<00:01:42.990> back<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> she

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
neck and her hearing came back and she

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
neck and her hearing came back and she
hadn't<00:01:43.890> been<00:01:43.920> able<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.250> hear<00:01:44.670> since<00:01:45.299> she<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hadn't been able to hear since she was a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080 
hadn't been able to hear since she was a
teenager<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> had<00:01:47.280> been<00:01:47.399> hit<00:01:47.579> by<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> drunk

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.560 
teenager and had been hit by a drunk
driver<00:01:48.470> now<00:01:49.790> one<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> most<00:01:51.149> interesting

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
driver now one of the most interesting

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.480 
driver now one of the most interesting
things<00:01:51.810> about<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.310> energy

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
things about this is that the energy

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.420 
things about this is that the energy
goes<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.689> needed<00:01:55.009> does<00:01:56.009> what's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
goes where it's needed does what's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.990 
goes where it's needed does what's
needed<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> isn't<00:01:58.020> based<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.770> our<00:01:59.549> beliefs

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
needed but it isn't based on our beliefs

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.990 
needed but it isn't based on our beliefs
or<00:02:00.210> expectations<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.290> other<00:02:01.469> words<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
or expectations in other words this is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.490

some<00:03:29.850> energy<00:03:30.239> healing<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:31.110> went<00:03:31.350> back<00:03:31.620> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
some energy healing we went back and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.640 
some energy healing we went back and
forth<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.430> she<00:03:33.090> finally<00:03:33.360> decided<00:03:33.840> she<00:03:34.500> would

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.920 
off and then I told him the story of
what<00:05:56.280> had<00:05:56.400> happened<00:05:56.430> with<00:05:57.090> my<00:05:57.330> friend<00:05:57.660> who<00:05:57.750> did

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
what had happened with my friend who did

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.469 
what had happened with my friend who did
the<00:05:58.050> editing<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:58.770> we<00:05:59.550> put<00:05:59.760> it<00:05:59.850> together<00:05:59.970> now

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
the editing and we put it together now

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.460 
the editing and we put it together now
consider<00:06:01.470> why<00:06:02.130> would<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.610> body<00:06:02.960> want<00:06:03.960> the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
consider why would the body want the

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.620 
consider why would the body want the
skin<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.800> come<00:06:05.190> off<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.550> bottom<00:06:05.729> of<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.180> feet

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
skin to come off the bottom of the feet

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.570 
skin to come off the bottom of the feet
well<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.290> feet<00:06:07.590> have<00:06:07.860> all<00:06:08.070> these<00:06:08.280> neuro

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
well the feet have all these neuro

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.140 
well the feet have all these neuro
receptors<00:06:09.890> where<00:06:10.890> you<00:06:11.310> get<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.610> stimulation

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
receptors where you get the stimulation

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.840 
receptors where you get the stimulation
like<00:06:12.479> from<00:06:13.220> reflexology<00:06:14.220> where<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.490> feet<00:06:14.700> get

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
like from reflexology where the feet get

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.390 
like from reflexology where the feet get
stimulated<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:15.960> it<00:06:16.800> would<00:06:16.919> make<00:06:17.070> a<00:06:17.100> great

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
stimulated and it would make a great

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.760 
stimulated and it would make a great
deal<00:06:17.550> of<00:06:17.760> sense<00:06:18.060> from<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.840> body's<00:06:19.290> point<00:06:19.620> of

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
deal of sense from the body's point of

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.500 
deal of sense from the body's point of
view<00:06:20.030> to<00:06:22.220> get<00:06:23.220> that<00:06:23.400> extra<00:06:23.640> skin<00:06:23.970> off<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.300> feet

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
view to get that extra skin off the feet

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.000 
view to get that extra skin off the feet
so<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:24.870> you<00:06:25.140> can<00:06:25.290> get<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.590> additional

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
so that you can get the additional

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.030 
so that you can get the additional
stimulation<00:06:26.550> when<00:06:26.910> you<00:06:27.030> walk<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.770> affect<00:06:28.770> the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
stimulation when you walk to affect the

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.310 
stimulation when you walk to affect the
life<00:06:29.220> force<00:06:29.550> energy<00:06:29.850> of<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:30.300> whole<00:06:30.510> body<00:06:30.810> in

of<00:06:34.650> the<00:06:34.860> system<00:06:35.400> does<00:06:36.120> the<00:06:36.360> healing<00:06:36.570> so<00:06:37.320> when

of the system does the healing so when

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
I like to call the where does it hurt

00:07:59.650 --> 00:07:59.660 
well quickly we hold the resonance

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.910 
well quickly we hold the resonance
through<00:07:59.900> the<00:08:00.020> breathing<00:08:00.230> and<00:08:00.560> body<00:08:00.740> awareness

through the breathing and body awareness

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.030 
through the breathing and body awareness
and<00:08:01.580> let<00:08:02.180> their<00:08:02.450> body<00:08:02.810> intelligence<00:08:03.260> direct

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.040 
and let their body intelligence direct

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.720 
and let their body intelligence direct
that<00:08:04.250> energy<00:08:04.690> for<00:08:05.690> its<00:08:05.870> highest<00:08:06.260> good<00:08:06.730> anyway

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:07.730 
that energy for its highest good anyway

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.660 
that energy for its highest good anyway
