and an ipad you get a son or ipad he's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.029 
and an ipad you get a son or ipad he's
going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.320> black<00:00:25.560> bands<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
going to have this black bands on the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.009 
going to have this black bands on the
back<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.970> LA<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> signal<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.539> pass<00:00:27.779> through

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
back to LA the signal to pass through

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.470 
back to LA the signal to pass through
the<00:00:28.289> plastic<00:00:28.500> rather<00:00:28.920> than<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> metal<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.390> we

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the plastic rather than the metal so we

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.630 
the plastic rather than the metal so we
have<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> verizon<00:00:30.900> 4g<00:00:31.380> LTE<00:00:31.800> model<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.460> we're

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
have a verizon 4g LTE model here we're

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.240 
have a verizon 4g LTE model here we're
in<00:00:32.820> seattle<00:00:33.450> which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.980> city<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
in seattle which is a city that is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.940 
in seattle which is a city that is
pretty<00:00:35.790> much<00:00:35.910> bathed<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.660> Verizon<00:00:37.440> 4G<00:00:37.649> LTE

3rd generation 4G LTE speed test alright

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.799 
3rd generation 4G LTE speed test alright
one<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.090> new<00:00:54.239> features<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> new

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
one of the other new features of a new

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.610 
one of the other new features of a new
ipad<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.910> 4G<00:00:56.910> LTE<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.289> thought<00:00:58.469> we'd<00:00:58.590> give

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
ipad is 4G LTE and we thought we'd give

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
ipad is 4G LTE and we thought we'd give
you<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.070> speed<00:00:59.370> test<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.879> i'm<00:00:59.969> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you a little speed test here i'm just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.580 
you a little speed test here i'm just
writing<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.390> speedtest.net<00:01:00.870> app<00:01:00.930> which<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
writing a speedtest.net app which is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380 
writing a speedtest.net app which is
actually<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:03.210> an<00:01:03.270> iphone

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
actually as you can see it's an iphone

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.350 
actually as you can see it's an iphone
app<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.369> blow<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
app so just blow it up here because it's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
app so just blow it up here because it's
probably<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> best<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.860> use<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.850> free

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
probably the best one to use it's free

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420 
probably the best one to use it's free
and<00:01:09.420> contextual<00:01:10.409> multiple<00:01:10.710> areas<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.159> first

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and contextual multiple areas so first

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.590 
and contextual multiple areas so first
we're<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.479> Wi-Fi<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:14.130> like

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
we're on Wi-Fi right now and see like

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.609 
we're on Wi-Fi right now and see like
yeah<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:16.590> on

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
yeah there you go so you see we're on

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
yeah there you go so you see we're on
Wi-Fi<00:01:17.040> we're<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> 4G<00:01:18.390> LTE<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
Wi-Fi we're not on a 4G LTE at the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
Wi-Fi we're not on a 4G LTE at the
moment<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.280> we'll<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> quick<00:01:20.670> speed<00:01:20.939> test

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
moment and we'll do a quick speed test

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.140 
moment and we'll do a quick speed test
on<00:01:21.330> Wi-Fi<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> benchmark<00:01:22.770> here

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.830 

so<00:01:28.810> there<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:28.960> go<00:01:29.080> that's<00:01:29.620> my<00:01:29.740> Wi-Fi<00:01:30.130> network

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
so there you go that's my Wi-Fi network

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.400 
so there you go that's my Wi-Fi network
we<00:01:31.840> just<00:01:31.990> got<00:01:32.110> about<00:01:32.230> twenty<00:01:32.650> one<00:01:32.800> down<00:01:34.170> 14<00:01:35.170> up

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
we just got about twenty one down 14 up

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.710 
we just got about twenty one down 14 up
and<00:01:35.950> actually<00:01:36.100> my<00:01:36.400> speeds<00:01:37.090> here<00:01:37.270> at<00:01:37.360> home<00:01:37.510> are

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
and actually my speeds here at home are

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.840 
and actually my speeds here at home are
actually<00:01:37.990> 35<00:01:38.410> 35<00:01:38.950> but<00:01:39.370> you<00:01:39.550> know<00:01:39.640> who<00:01:39.790> knows

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
actually 35 35 but you know who knows

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.010 
actually 35 35 but you know who knows
what<00:01:40.120> else<00:01:40.150> is<00:01:40.300> happening<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.720> my<00:01:40.840> network

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
what else is happening on my network

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.010 
what else is happening on my network
right<00:01:41.260> now<00:01:42.420> obviously<00:01:43.420> not<00:01:43.510> everything<00:01:43.810> is

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
right now obviously not everything is

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.890 
right now obviously not everything is
dedicated<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.860> ipad<00:01:45.130> now<00:01:45.940> what<00:01:46.720> I'm<00:01:46.810> going

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
dedicated to the ipad now what I'm going

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.680 
dedicated to the ipad now what I'm going
to<00:01:46.960> do<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.380> leave<00:01:48.100> Wi-Fi<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:49.060> go<00:01:49.150> into<00:01:49.360> settings

ahead<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.580> do<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.729> speed<00:02:04.030> test<00:02:04.270> on<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:06.510> fine

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
ahead and do a speed test on that fine

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.480 
ahead and do a speed test on that fine
our<00:02:07.690> server<00:02:07.960> begin<00:02:08.709> test

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.760 

now<00:02:17.180> as<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.510> see<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.340> compare<00:02:19.550> that<00:02:20.770> well

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
now as you can see and compare that well

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.670 
now as you can see and compare that well
let's<00:02:22.160> turn<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.430> back<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.760> there<00:02:23.680> compare

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
let's turn that back on there compare

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830 
let's turn that back on there compare

4G LTE test here 38 down 15 up so as you
can<00:03:07.040> see<00:03:07.250> very<00:03:07.820> speedy<00:03:08.210> obviously<00:03:09.110> have<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.260> be

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
can see very speedy obviously have to be

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.370 
can see very speedy obviously have to be

in a 4G LTE neighborhood covered area to
get<00:03:12.560> those<00:03:12.770> speeds<00:03:13.100> but<00:03:14.020> fantastic<00:03:15.020> speed<00:03:15.200> i'm

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
get those speeds but fantastic speed i'm

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.400 
get those speeds but fantastic speed i'm
out<00:03:15.410> here<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.770> suburbs<00:03:16.750> north<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.960> seattle

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
so i'm not even in jail proper and i'm

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.940 
so i'm not even in jail proper and i'm
getting<00:03:21.470> these<00:03:22.460> fantastic<00:03:23.470> 4G<00:03:24.470> speeds<00:03:24.620> here

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
getting these fantastic 4G speeds here

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.240 
getting these fantastic 4G speeds here
and<00:03:25.940> what<00:03:26.660> i<00:03:26.690> was<00:03:26.810> trying<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.020> do<00:03:27.200> was<00:03:27.410> test

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and what i was trying to do was test

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.890 
and what i was trying to do was test
against<00:03:28.610> 3g<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.330> whenever<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.660> turn<00:03:29.720> off

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
against 3g but it whenever I turn off

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.960 
against 3g but it whenever I turn off
LTE<00:03:30.640> I'm<00:03:31.640> not<00:03:31.850> able<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:33.620> whatever<00:03:33.890> reason<00:03:34.340> to

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
LTE I'm not able for whatever reason to

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.180 
LTE I'm not able for whatever reason to
get<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.150> signal<00:03:35.420> here<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.680> let's<00:03:36.800> see<00:03:36.920> if<00:03:36.980> we<00:03:37.070> can

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
get a signal here so let's see if we can

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.580 
get a signal here so let's see if we can
get<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.310> 3g<00:03:37.700> signal

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.229 

I<00:03:45.739> thought<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.489> just<00:03:46.640> keeps<00:03:47.000> saying<00:03:47.209> searching

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
I thought it just keeps saying searching

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.240 
I thought it just keeps saying searching
let<00:03:50.239> me<00:03:50.330> turn<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.720> off<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.200> back<00:03:51.379> on<00:03:54.250> see

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
let me turn that off and back on see

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.140 
let me turn that off and back on see
what<00:03:55.400> happens<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:57.790> from<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.849> looks<00:03:59.060> of

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
what happens but from the looks of

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.020 
what happens but from the looks of
things<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.780> 3g<00:04:00.200> radio<00:04:00.379> in<00:04:00.680> here<00:04:00.830> isn't<00:04:01.069> either

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
things the 3g radio in here isn't either

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.750 
things the 3g radio in here isn't either
something<00:04:02.480> wrong<00:04:02.599> with<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.750> ipad<00:04:03.110> or<00:04:03.760> really

off<00:04:14.030> LTE<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.820> I<00:04:16.820> get<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.780> searching<00:04:19.389> so<00:04:20.389> we're

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
off LTE and I get the searching so we're

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.250
