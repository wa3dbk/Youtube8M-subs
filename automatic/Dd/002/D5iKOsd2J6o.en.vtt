00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:07.055
 Today, we will experiment with the colors. 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.960
 Do you know a song about black losing and the color wins? 

00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:16.617
 We will check its meaning in an experimental way. 

00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:19.315
 I have a few glasses with water here. 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.760
 I will dye them with watercolors on: 

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.046
 black, red and blue. 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.863
 I will still need a drinking straw for experience. 

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.339
 I dip the straw in red water. 

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:25.228
 I clasp my finger and put the straw into clean water. 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.143
 I release my finger 

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:33.336
 and gently, slowly pull out. 

00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:38.606
 ABOUT! The red water went up. 

00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:41.568
 Let's see how it will be with blue. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.958
 I put the straw in blue water, 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.785
 I clasp my finger, 

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:53.250
 I pull it out and translate it to clean water. 

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:54.827
 dip, 

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.135
 I release my finger 

00:01:57.236 --> 00:02:04.288
 and gently, slowly emerge. 

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:06.622
 Blue also went up. 

00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:08.804
 Probably black will be the same. 

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:10.255
 But let's see! 

00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:15.395
 I put the straw in black water. 

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:18.730
 I clasp my finger. 

00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:25.291
 I bring out the straw and translate it into clean water. 

00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:26.723
 dip, 

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:29.879
 I'm letting ... and 

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:36.871
 I pull it gently. 

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:46.867
 You see? Black water goes down. 

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:53.355
 And you see? 

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:56.958
 The color always wins and the black loses. 

00:02:57.514 --> 00:03:01.934
 I hope you did not get fooled about this story about colors? 

00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:04.798
 Do not trust ten-year-old girls! 

00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:07.164
 Of course, this is not about colors 

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:09.751
 only for the water temperature. 

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:14.363
 Colored dyes Ania dissolved in warm water with the addition of boiling water. 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:20.139
 She dissolved the black paint in cold water, cooled with ice cubes. 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.529
 Warm, colorful water 

00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:30.085
 it floats up when we put it in water at room temperature. 

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.839
 Because the warm is lighter. 

00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:37.410
 Cold, black water 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.132
 it is heavier than water at room temperature 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.020
 so when we let her into the glass 

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:49.704
 it fell to the bottom before it could warm up. 

00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:52.544
 If you do not believe, try it yourself. 

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:54.588
 A simple experiment! 

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:57.878
 Because experimenting is really simple and cheap. 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.997
