through a few cranksets and a few rear

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.909 
through a few cranksets and a few rear
cassettes<00:00:28.009> now<00:00:29.009> it's<00:00:29.220> time<00:00:29.399> for<00:00:29.790> another<00:00:29.880> one

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
the drivetrain you see here is has about

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.920 
the drivetrain you see here is has about
maybe<00:00:35.370> 2,000<00:00:36.090> miles<00:00:36.240> on<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.900> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
maybe 2,000 miles on it and got it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.380 
maybe 2,000 miles on it and got it
around<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.470> years<00:00:37.680> ago<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.910> already<00:00:39.090> worn

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
around two years ago it's already worn

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
around two years ago it's already worn
it<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.630> but<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> main<00:00:40.770> problem<00:00:40.950> I've<00:00:41.220> got<00:00:41.250> here

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
as you can see here a rather violent

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.220 
as you can see here a rather violent
blow<00:00:47.490> well<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.910> about<00:00:48.030> 20<00:00:48.690> miles<00:00:48.870> away<00:00:49.050> from

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
blow well it's about 20 miles away from

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.350 
blow well it's about 20 miles away from
home<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.950> within<00:00:50.400> about<00:00:50.640> five<00:00:50.910> miles<00:00:51.120> from

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
home and within about five miles from

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
home and within about five miles from
home<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> rear<00:00:52.350> tube<00:00:52.650> blew<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:55.340> even<00:00:56.340> wrap

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
home the rear tube blew and even wrap

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
home the rear tube blew and even wrap
itself<00:00:56.910> around<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.450> axle<00:00:57.870> back<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.350> as

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
itself around the axle back there as

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
itself around the axle back there as
well<00:00:58.710> too<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.250> it's<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> pretty<00:01:00.420> violent<00:01:02.300> blow

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

to<00:01:20.940> blow<00:01:21.470> but<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> problem<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
to blow but the problem of the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.149 
to blow but the problem of the
drivetrain<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.299> got<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.470> many<00:01:25.590> models<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
drivetrain is it's got so many models on

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.800 
drivetrain is it's got so many models on
it<00:01:26.310> I've<00:01:26.430> written<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.909> much<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.510> Dion

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
it I've written it so much that Dion

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
it I've written it so much that Dion
gears<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.110> worn<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.310> see

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
gears are all worn out as you can see

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.840 
gears are all worn out as you can see
here<00:01:32.970> hopefully<00:01:33.810> I'll<00:01:33.930> try<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.110> focus<00:01:34.440> in<00:01:35.840> this

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
here hopefully I'll try to focus in this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270 
here hopefully I'll try to focus in this
these<00:01:38.850> clogs<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.290> wider<00:01:40.680> than

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
these clogs are very much wider than

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.649 
these clogs are very much wider than
they<00:01:41.430> should<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.150> compare<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
they should be when you compare them to

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.080 
they should be when you compare them to
the<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.409> calm<00:01:43.650> down<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.549> example<00:01:44.700> which

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the to calm down here for example which

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.440 
the to calm down here for example which
is<00:01:45.210> not<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.750> used<00:01:45.990> quite<00:01:46.260> as<00:01:46.470> much<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
is not really used quite as much and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.140 
is not really used quite as much and
between<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:50.159> chain<00:01:50.430> being<00:01:50.670> worn<00:01:50.970> is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
between that and a chain being worn is

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.120 
between that and a chain being worn is
causing<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.630> chain<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.470> skip<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
causing a chain to actually skip the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.749 
causing a chain to actually skip the
rollers<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> chain<00:01:58.340> these<00:01:59.340> chrome

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
rollers in the chain these chrome

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.789 
rollers in the chain these chrome
rollers<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:00.990> worn<00:02:01.290> there's<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.650> lot<00:02:01.770> more

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
rollers are so worn there's a lot more

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.480 
rollers are so worn there's a lot more
space<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:03.030> between<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.570> links<00:02:03.869> basically

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
space in between the links basically

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.179 
space in between the links basically
causing<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.580> chain<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.820> jump<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:08.159> can

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.189 
causing the chain to jump and you can

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.639 
causing the chain to jump and you can
see<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.419> more<00:02:09.539> clearly<00:02:10.049> here<00:02:10.409> on<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
see that a lot more clearly here on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.990 
see that a lot more clearly here on the
large<00:02:10.889> gear<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.859> how<00:02:13.859> high<00:02:14.219> up<00:02:14.519> that

light through there at all because

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.390 
light through there at all because
there's<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.140> much<00:02:19.290> space<00:02:19.470> now<00:02:19.890> between<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
there's so much space now between the

there's so much space now between the

on the pedals just to get going it
actually<00:02:29.730> skips<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.790> what<00:02:32.790> I'm<00:02:32.880> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.120> have

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
actually skips so what I'm going to have

actually skips so what I'm going to have
to<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:34.340> take<00:02:35.340> off<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.730> rear<00:02:35.970> cassette<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
to do is take off this rear cassette and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.960 
to do is take off this rear cassette and
replace<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.320> 7-speed<00:02:37.970> hyperglycemic

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
replace it it's a 7-speed hyperglycemic

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.660 
replace it it's a 7-speed hyperglycemic
oh<00:02:39.000> we're<00:02:39.420> cassette<00:02:39.870> I'll<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.950> replace<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
oh we're cassette I'll have to replace a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.710 
oh we're cassette I'll have to replace a
chain<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:43.340> at<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> same<00:02:44.640> time<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.510> on

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
chain and at the same time I do that on

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.360 
chain and at the same time I do that on
the<00:02:46.110> rear<00:02:46.260> derailleur<00:02:47.030> I'm<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the rear derailleur I'm going to have to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.520 
the rear derailleur I'm going to have to
replace<00:02:50.370> these<00:02:50.640> idler<00:02:51.120> gears<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.720> well<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.380> you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
replace these idler gears as well to you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.520 
replace these idler gears as well to you
can<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:52.830> how<00:02:53.010> wide<00:02:53.420> these<00:02:54.420> teeth<00:02:54.750> are<00:02:55.020> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
can see how wide these teeth are and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.580 
can see how wide these teeth are and
these<00:02:56.070> are<00:02:56.220> plastic<00:02:56.459> gears<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.590> antenna

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
these are plastic gears to so antenna

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.350 
these are plastic gears to so antenna
we're<00:02:58.770> all<00:02:58.920> kind<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.310> fast<00:02:59.550> but<00:02:59.880> not<00:03:00.060> under

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
we're all kind of fast but not under

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.570 
we're all kind of fast but not under
quite<00:03:00.570> as<00:03:00.750> much<00:03:00.900> force<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.680> guess<00:03:02.340> that's<00:03:02.489> why

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
quite as much force I guess that's why

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.190 
quite as much force I guess that's why
the<00:03:02.640> main<00:03:02.850> amount<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.209> plastic<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.989> just

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the main amount of plastic but it just

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.050 
the main amount of plastic but it just
makes<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.220> shifting<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:05.670> bit<00:03:05.910> more

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
makes the shifting a little bit more

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.140 
makes the shifting a little bit more
difficult<00:03:06.239> because<00:03:07.220> all<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> tolerances<00:03:08.940> are

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
difficult because all the tolerances are

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.370 
difficult because all the tolerances are
incorrect<00:03:09.660> now<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:12.140> let<00:03:13.140> me<00:03:13.200> try<00:03:13.320> to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
incorrect now so let me try to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.850 
incorrect now so let me try to
demonstrate<00:03:13.820> what<00:03:14.820> happens<00:03:15.500> when<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.620> start

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
demonstrate what happens when you start

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.610 
demonstrate what happens when you start
out<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.340> thing<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.290> why<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.470> so

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
out with this thing and why it's so

00:03:19.620 --> 00:04:06.930 
out with this thing and why it's so
annoying<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.190> why<00:03:20.340> I've<00:03:20.430> gotta<00:03:20.640> repair<00:03:21.030> it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.110 

so<00:04:07.940> hopefully<00:04:08.120> as<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.629> guys<00:04:08.810> have<00:04:09.019> heard<00:04:09.260> that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
so hopefully as you guys have heard that

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.300 
so hopefully as you guys have heard that
chain<00:04:11.120> skips<00:04:11.569> rather<00:04:12.170> easily<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:13.040> almost

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
chain skips rather easily so it's almost

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.640 
chain skips rather easily so it's almost
impossible<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.970> ride<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.299> bike<00:04:14.569> I'm<00:04:15.409> going

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
impossible to ride this bike I'm going

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.740 
impossible to ride this bike I'm going
to<00:04:15.769> see<00:04:16.280> if<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.519> can<00:04:16.669> soar<00:04:16.970> some<00:04:17.209> parts<00:04:17.510> on<00:04:17.660> the

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
to see if I can soar some parts on the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.300 
to see if I can soar some parts on the
internet<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.500> replace<00:04:18.799> it<00:04:18.949> because<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.160> bike

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
internet to replace it because the bike

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.219 
internet to replace it because the bike
shops<00:04:19.639> would<00:04:19.910> charge<00:04:20.540> way<00:04:20.750> too<00:04:20.780> much<00:04:21.019> money

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
shops would charge way too much money

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.770 
shops would charge way too much money
for<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.590> for<00:04:21.829> parts<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.160> Labor<00:04:22.340> and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
for that for parts of Labor and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.330 
for that for parts of Labor and
hopefully<00:04:23.780> get<00:04:23.900> those<00:04:24.139> in<00:04:24.350> this<00:04:24.979> coming

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
hopefully get those in this coming

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.670 
hopefully get those in this coming
weekend<00:04:25.790> first<00:04:26.510> weekend<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:26.960> May<00:04:27.139> hopefully

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
weekend first weekend in May hopefully

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.500 
weekend first weekend in May hopefully
and<00:04:27.889> I'm<00:04:28.820> gonna<00:04:28.910> try<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.210> document<00:04:30.139> how<00:04:31.010> I

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
and I'm gonna try to document how I

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.200 
and I'm gonna try to document how I
repair<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.040> in<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.130> meantime<00:04:34.340> I'm

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
repair that and in the meantime I'm

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.800 
repair that and in the meantime I'm
going<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:36.070> keep<00:04:37.070> writing<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.760> my<00:04:38.419> backup

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
going to keep writing this my backup

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.760 
going to keep writing this my backup
bicycle<00:04:39.380> which<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.710> Schwinn<00:04:40.550> continental

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
bicycle which is a Schwinn continental

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.390 
bicycle which is a Schwinn continental
1974<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.630> interestingly<00:04:45.010> it's<00:04:46.010> got<00:04:46.220> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
1974 and interestingly it's got the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.300 
1974 and interestingly it's got the
original<00:04:46.960> tires<00:04:48.580> original<00:04:49.580> tubes<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
original tires original tubes and the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.390 
original tires original tubes and the
original<00:04:52.490> drivetrain<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.770> they<00:04:54.949> definitely

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
original drivetrain so they definitely

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.650 
original drivetrain so they definitely
don't<00:04:55.580> make<00:04:55.789> them<00:04:55.910> like<00:04:55.940> they<00:04:56.240> used<00:04:56.449> to

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
don't make them like they used to

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.770 
don't make them like they used to
anymore<00:04:57.430> this<00:04:58.430> bike<00:04:58.639> weighs<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.000> ton<00:04:59.419> so<00:04:59.449> you

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
anymore this bike weighs a ton so you

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.900 
anymore this bike weighs a ton so you
still<00:05:00.020> get<00:05:00.169> a<00:05:00.229> workout<00:05:00.650> can't<00:05:01.639> let<00:05:01.729> me<00:05:01.789> go

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
still get a workout can't let me go

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.790 
still get a workout can't let me go
quite<00:05:02.210> as<00:05:02.240> fast<00:05:02.570> on<00:05:02.840> this<00:05:02.990> black<00:05:03.229> as<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.530> can<00:05:03.770> on

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
quite as fast on this black as I can on

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.620 
quite as fast on this black as I can on
the<00:05:04.010> cannondale<00:05:04.630> but<00:05:06.970> cant<00:05:07.970> rly<00:05:08.060> not<00:05:08.270> get<00:05:08.450> too

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
the cannondale but cant rly not get too

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.500 
the cannondale but cant rly not get too
much<00:05:08.840> because<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.789> road<00:05:11.030> bike<00:05:11.240> doesn't
