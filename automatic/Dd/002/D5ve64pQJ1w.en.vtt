any any albinos from this from this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.820 
any any albinos from this from this
project<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.420> i<00:01:09.659> wouldn't<00:01:10.140> anyway<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:10.680> i

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
project but i wouldn't anyway because i

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.730 
project but i wouldn't anyway because i
was<00:01:11.100> using<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> subspecies<00:01:12.060> genetics<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
was using the subspecies genetics the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.080 
was using the subspecies genetics the
subspecies<00:01:14.130> genetics<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.729> i've<00:01:14.850> been<00:01:14.880> using

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
subspecies genetics that i've been using

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
subspecies genetics that i've been using
is<00:01:15.299> from<00:01:15.330> Martian<00:01:15.990> mcginnis<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> golden<00:01:16.740> gate

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
is from Martian mcginnis of golden gate

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.530 
is from Martian mcginnis of golden gate
geckos<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> results<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.299> nothing<00:01:21.299> short

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
geckos and the results are nothing short

geckos and the results are nothing short
of<00:01:22.020> incredible<00:01:23.210> my<00:01:24.210> goal<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.920> strengthen

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
of incredible my goal was to strengthen

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.340 
of incredible my goal was to strengthen
the<00:01:26.280> genetics<00:01:26.729> enough<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.900> Enigma

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the genetics enough so that the Enigma

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
the genetics enough so that the Enigma
syndrome<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.159> either<00:01:29.400> reduced<00:01:29.850> or

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
syndrome would be either reduced or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.399 
syndrome would be either reduced or
absent<00:01:30.890> completely<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> far<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
absent completely and so far all of the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
absent completely and so far all of the
Dalmatians<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.369> hatched<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.790> from

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
Dalmatians that have hatched out from

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.499 
Dalmatians that have hatched out from
this<00:01:36.119> project<00:01:36.659> show<00:01:37.530> no<00:01:37.860> sign<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.509> enigma

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this project show no sign of enigma

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.830 
this project show no sign of enigma
syndrome<00:01:39.990> okay<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.390> when<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
syndrome okay now when I when the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
syndrome okay now when I when the
Eclipse<00:01:43.200> gene<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> added<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.189> I've<00:01:44.310> hatched

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
Eclipse gene is added now I've hatched

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
Eclipse gene is added now I've hatched
at<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> few<00:01:45.030> eclipses<00:01:45.750> from<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.140> separate

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
at a few eclipses from a separate

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.469 
at a few eclipses from a separate
project<00:01:46.740> where<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> introduced<00:01:48.270> Mac<00:01:48.930> faccio

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
project where I introduced Mac faccio

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.899 
project where I introduced Mac faccio
that<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.630> head<00:01:51.810> Eclipse<00:01:52.170> genetics<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that was head Eclipse genetics to the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.420 
that was head Eclipse genetics to the
dalmatian<00:01:54.450> project<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.829> seems<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.159> when

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
dalmatian project and it seems that when

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.090 
dalmatian project and it seems that when
the<00:01:56.520> Eclipse<00:01:56.880> gene<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> added<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.560> geckos

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the Eclipse gene is added the geckos

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.550 
the Eclipse gene is added the geckos
seem<00:01:59.640> to<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
seem to have a little bit of the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.760 
seem to have a little bit of the
syndrome<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.759> very<00:02:03.119> very<00:02:03.420> mild<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
syndrome but it's very very mild so it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130 
syndrome but it's very very mild so it
seems<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> ADA<00:02:05.460> gene<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.600> case<00:02:06.840> in

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
seems like the ADA gene in this case in

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.460 
seems like the ADA gene in this case in
my<00:02:07.409> experience<00:02:08.959> brett<00:02:09.959> brought<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.319> the

my experience brett brought out the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.860 
my experience brett brought out the

keep<00:03:45.100> an<00:03:45.190> open<00:03:45.340> mind<00:03:45.610> about<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.030> Enigma<00:03:46.420> gene

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
keep an open mind about the Enigma gene

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.030 
keep an open mind about the Enigma gene
in<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.990> past<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.380> lot<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.620> people<00:03:47.860> bread

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
in the past a lot of people bread

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.940 
in the past a lot of people bread
enigmas<00:03:48.780> indiscriminately<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.990> bred<00:03:50.800> them

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
enigmas indiscriminately and bred them

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.860 
enigmas indiscriminately and bred them
two<00:03:51.160> lines<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.700> were<00:03:51.820> already<00:03:52.120> weak<00:03:52.480> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
two lines that were already weak and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.000 
two lines that were already weak and
just<00:03:53.770> line<00:03:54.370> bread<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.300> bread<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.010> just

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
just line bread and in bread and just

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.530 
just line bread and in bread and just
overly<00:03:58.320> just<00:03:59.320> bread<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.340> they<00:04:00.940> didn't<00:04:01.480> really

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
overly just bread and they didn't really

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.570 
overly just bread and they didn't really
care<00:04:01.989> about<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:05.620> strength<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.190> gene<00:04:06.400> they

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
care about the strength of the gene they

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.280 
care about the strength of the gene they
didn't<00:04:06.820> agree<00:04:06.970> they<00:04:07.180> thought<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.989> know<00:04:08.110> that

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
didn't agree they thought you know that

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.810 
didn't agree they thought you know that
the<00:04:08.410> gene<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.800> going<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.130> be<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.700> all

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
the gene is going to be like that in all

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.590 
the gene is going to be like that in all
cases<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.680> my<00:04:11.890> experience<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.760> showing<00:04:13.420> that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
cases so my experience is showing that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.440 
cases so my experience is showing that
it<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.470> possible<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:14.980> produce<00:04:15.250> strong<00:04:16.030> viable

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
it is possible to produce strong viable

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.099 
it is possible to produce strong viable
enigmas<00:04:17.260> okay<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:19.120> may<00:04:19.329> not<00:04:19.359> happen<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:20.049> the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
enigmas okay it may not happen for the

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.110 
enigmas okay it may not happen for the
regular<00:04:20.620> hobbyist<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.340> buys<00:04:21.669> a<00:04:21.700> couple

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
regular hobbyist that buys a couple

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.180 
regular hobbyist that buys a couple
enigmas<00:04:22.510> at<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.660> show<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.110> hopes<00:04:23.890> for<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.160> best

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
enigmas at a show and hopes for the best

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.990 
enigmas at a show and hopes for the best
I<00:04:24.700> think<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.390> key<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:25.870> is<00:04:26.140> using

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
I think the key to this is using

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.560 
I think the key to this is using
subspecies<00:04:28.000> genetics<00:04:28.660> pure<00:04:29.140> strong

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
subspecies genetics pure strong

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.150 
subspecies genetics pure strong

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
subspecies and for this case i used a

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.050

may<00:04:41.770> help<00:04:41.979> it's<00:04:42.760> definitely<00:04:43.060> possible<00:04:44.640> but<00:04:45.640> I

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
may help it's definitely possible but I

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.659

would hate to lose the Enigma gene the

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.420 
would hate to lose the Enigma gene the
Enigma<00:04:49.000> gene<00:04:49.150> is<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.479> unique<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:51.100> think<00:04:51.130> we

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
Enigma gene is so unique and I think we

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.110 
Enigma gene is so unique and I think we
owe<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:53.590> morph<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.280> try<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.580> fix<00:04:54.910> it

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
owe it to this morph to try to fix it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.930 
owe it to this morph to try to fix it

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
because if we just give up on it and let

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.080 
because if we just give up on it and let
it<00:04:57.970> go<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.540> feel<00:04:59.440> we're<00:05:00.280> going<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.460> be<00:05:00.550> losing
