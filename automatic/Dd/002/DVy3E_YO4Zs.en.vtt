evenly<00:02:53.040> across<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> surface<00:02:53.700> whereas<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.210> feel

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
evenly across the surface whereas I feel

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.450 
evenly across the surface whereas I feel
like<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.840> Beautyblender<00:02:55.530> sponge<00:02:55.800> tends<00:02:56.340> to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
like the Beautyblender sponge tends to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.040 
like the Beautyblender sponge tends to
just<00:02:56.670> kind<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.880> pick<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.180> up<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.540> area

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
just kind of pick it up in one area

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.140 
just kind of pick it up in one area
which<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.350> kind<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.710> bummer<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.370> do<00:02:59.820> I<00:03:00.000> never

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
which is kind of a bummer I do I never

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.640 
which is kind of a bummer I do I never
really<00:03:00.540> had<00:03:00.660> noticed<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.140> before<00:03:01.230> until<00:03:01.590> I

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
really had noticed that before until I

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.500 
really had noticed that before until I
had<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.010> Real<00:03:02.160> Techniques<00:03:02.340> sponge<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
that same tip I mean it comes like a

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.540 
that same tip I mean it comes like a
harsher<00:03:15.960> tip<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.620> not<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.130> thin<00:03:17.430> on

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
harsher tip but it's not as like thin on

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.310 
harsher tip but it's not as like thin on
the<00:03:17.670> sides<00:03:17.910> seems<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.840> it's<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.230> little

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the sides seems like it's a little

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.140 
the sides seems like it's a little
curvier<00:03:19.920> so<00:03:20.220> here's<00:03:20.400> how<00:03:20.520> I<00:03:20.550> use<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:20.940> sponge

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
curvier so here's how I use this sponge

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.910 
curvier so here's how I use this sponge
I<00:03:21.330> use<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.690> side<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.170> apply<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.650> foundation

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
I use this side to apply the foundation

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.520 
I use this side to apply the foundation
I<00:03:23.580> also<00:03:24.240> use<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.540> for<00:03:24.600> concealer<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.350> this

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
I also use this for concealer on this

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.860 
I also use this for concealer on this
side<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.190> blend<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.700> then<00:03:27.270> I<00:03:27.300> use<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
side to like blend it in then I use the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.050 
side to like blend it in then I use the
you<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> belly<00:03:28.770> side<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.490> sponge<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060

apply<00:03:30.300> my<00:03:30.540> powder<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.050> then<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.260> actually

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
apply my powder and then I actually

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040 
apply my powder and then I actually
really<00:03:32.130> use<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.580> end<00:03:32.910> because<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.780> side<00:03:34.020> is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050

to kind of test to the difference
between<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.540> two<00:03:45.690> because<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.200> didn't<00:03:46.830> really

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
between the two because I didn't really

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.350 
between the two because I didn't really
need<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.160> test<00:03:47.430> them<00:03:47.610> side<00:03:47.850> by<00:03:47.880> side<00:03:48.000> or

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
need to test them side by side or

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.430 
need to test them side by side or
anything<00:03:48.630> cuz<00:03:48.750> I've<00:03:48.840> used<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.350> long

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440

anything cuz I've used this for a long
time<00:03:49.620> I'm<00:03:49.770> quite<00:03:50.490> aware<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.090> a

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
time I'm quite aware that this is a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150 
time I'm quite aware that this is a
fantastic<00:03:51.510> sponge<00:03:51.990> but<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.770> one's<00:03:52.980> better

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
fantastic sponge but this one's better

line<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.170> video<00:03:55.500> now<00:03:55.800> when<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.100> comes<00:03:56.160> to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
line to this video now when it comes to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.370 
line to this video now when it comes to
clean<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.880> sponge<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.210> could<00:03:57.540> use<00:03:57.780> face<00:03:58.110> wash

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
clean the sponge you could use face wash

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.780 
clean the sponge you could use face wash
or<00:03:58.620> something<00:03:58.710> like<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.130> but<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.370> think<00:03:59.580> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
or something like that but I think the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.430 
or something like that but I think the
best<00:04:00.000> thing<00:04:00.240> to<00:04:00.270> clean<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.960> with<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
best thing to clean it with is the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.740 
best thing to clean it with is the
Beauty<00:04:01.770> Blender<00:04:01.890> solid<00:04:02.520> cleanser<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.150> do<00:04:03.420> also

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
Beauty Blender solid cleanser I do also

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.150 
Beauty Blender solid cleanser I do also
have<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.080> liquid<00:04:04.410> one<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:04.770> got<00:04:04.980> when<00:04:05.130> I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
have the liquid one that I got when I

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.830 
have the liquid one that I got when I
bought<00:04:05.370> like<00:04:05.520> my<00:04:05.640> first<00:04:05.910> Beauty<00:04:06.330> Blender<00:04:06.660> but

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
bought like my first Beauty Blender but

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.510 
bought like my first Beauty Blender but
I<00:04:06.870> mean<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.890> same<00:04:08.070> one<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.460> I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
I mean this is the same one and I

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.190 
I mean this is the same one and I
haven't<00:04:08.850> even<00:04:08.970> used<00:04:09.420> like<00:04:09.660> half<00:04:09.870> or<00:04:10.080> something

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
haven't even used like half or something

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.570 
haven't even used like half or something
reason<00:04:10.620> why<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.710> haven't<00:04:10.860> used<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.280> also<00:04:11.400> I

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
reason why I haven't used it also I

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.980 
reason why I haven't used it also I
think<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.910> solid<00:04:12.240> cleanser<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.660> better<00:04:12.900> I

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
think the solid cleanser is better I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.810 
think the solid cleanser is better I
think<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.440> gets<00:04:13.590> all<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.070> product<00:04:14.400> out<00:04:14.520> much

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
think it gets all the product out much

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.300 
think it gets all the product out much
much<00:04:15.270> quicker<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:16.980> sort<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.160> like

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
much quicker and I just sort of like

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.849 
much quicker and I just sort of like

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
I think the something that needs to be

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.680 
I think the something that needs to be
said<00:04:41.160> about<00:04:41.250> these<00:04:41.460> sponges<00:04:41.850> it's<00:04:42.030> incredible

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.540 
said about these sponges it's incredible
to<00:04:42.870> find<00:04:42.900> I'm<00:04:43.290> better<00:04:43.530> than<00:04:43.620> do<00:04:44.070> for<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:44.520> a

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
to find I'm better than do for like a

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.770 
to find I'm better than do for like a
fraction<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.210> cost<00:04:45.419> of<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.690> original

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
fraction of the cost of the original

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.090 
fraction of the cost of the original
it's<00:04:46.650> crazy

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
it's crazy

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.560 
it's crazy
again<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.669> will<00:04:47.910> say<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.150> kind<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.360> sucks

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
again I will say it kind of sucks

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.879
