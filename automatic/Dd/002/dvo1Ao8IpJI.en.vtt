00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.960
 basic today I bring you a video about the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.090
 game fini street kira kira so I could 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.310
 play a long time ago is my first what 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 tried from like which it was 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.670
 given by my parents and 5 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.800
 The first thing the game asks us is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.019
 put our profile name our 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.449
 blood group the sign of the zodiac and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 the genre of music that we like the most and 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.030
 of course with what hand we are going to use 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.300
 the console stick if I do not remember 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.790
 wrong this game is from 2006 and it's 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.920
 completely in Japanese so the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.629
 I never knew and I still do not know the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.949
 true story of the character but not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.470
 nothing happens because I myself 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.600
 he invented something like our 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.360
 superhero wants to be the best there 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 from the company angela is super 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.250
 motivated and will fight to fulfill the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.250
 dreams 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.750
 the truth is that although not 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.700
 I understood nothing and I had to learn to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.530
 manage menus based on thousands and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.840
 thousands of failures is a game in which 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.880
 the characters are super adorable are 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.020
 very expressive and want or do not end 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.020
 taking out of a company 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.160
 the most striking is perhaps the great 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.540
 variety of collectible accessories 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.420
 what's in the game 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.490
 I played for years and years and I could never finish 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.220
 to unlock all accessories 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.860
 is the map there is an area for each gender 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.110
 of music and in each region they tell us 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.000
 your story and now we will be the head of 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.970
 the area to get their medals or 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.920
 rather its stars 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.200
 all our adversaries have 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.000
 different personalities so it's 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.280
 possible that our character feels 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.350
 uncomfortable or angry as we advance in the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.140
 game 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.970
 has two easy game modes that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.850
 consists only of pressing the buttons of 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.350
 colors or the normal which not only 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.970
 we will have to press the colors in the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.520
 order in which they appear but 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.560
 we must also do the address 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.330
 to win we have to get the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.610
 audience bar that there is about our 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.920
 character is more in our favor but 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.690
 a flaw in this game is very 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.269
 punished our audience bar 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.180
 they go down to unsuspected limits and it's 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.430
 very very very difficult to recover unless it's 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.430
 that our adversary makes a mistake 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.390
 when we finish the games we have 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.640
 the possibility of getting gifts 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.650
 pink is the most common but also 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.500
 We can receive gifts of silver color and 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.720
 gold aside we also get coins 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.610
 for machines stuck where 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.770
 we will get mostly accessories for 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.990
 our character we can unlock 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.480
 backpacks beat up bunnies 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.490
 stuffed animal every time we play against 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.800
 they may unlock 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.330
 also new movements but what 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.010
 it will always happen to us is that we lose 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.370
 many times for trying to look like 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.370
 they dance 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.269
 as I told you each character has its 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.239
 personality and in this case the girl of 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.700
 classic genre is very annoying for 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.290
 say it some way more than once 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.560
 will make us cry at the levels 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.560
 higher 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.909
 It is very difficult to defeat her 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.030
 and now it grows 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.050
 no no 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.540
 here 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.800
 to 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.220
 but our character can all 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.200
 one last thing that I wanted to show you is 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.270
 that when we get all the 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.220
 stars in an area we unlock 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.320
 all the songs and we can always 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.970
 rejugar the ones that we like the most, I hope 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.890
 that you have liked this game to give 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.480
 hello that is more super kawaii and see you 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.480

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.800
 the mind 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.280

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.969
 that 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.439
 good 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.439
 the mind
