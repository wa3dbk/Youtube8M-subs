00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello good morning but on the day 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.870
 today these witnesses 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.500
 the name of carolina 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.499
 efe 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:09.139
 nor a specialty 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.369
 this action part of the package this series of stops 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.869
 to start operating discarded like this every day 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.210
 Scarlet Pact is called x explains to efe 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.919
 if you count 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.349
 look percent 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.630
 several things 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.020
 ee in eighths there is a very strong movement around the opinion of the 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.870
 people because it generated several discontents and that seems interesting for me 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.149
 part and yet on the other hand I am also questioned a bit uneasy 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.490
 the way in which participation is fueled 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.780
 because I say it because it's true 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 paty road participation has been done through social networks and the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.309
 comments that are exposed their comments have strong or 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.800
 these comments bokova stated objective 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 and I think that there was with him 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.110
 a clip site involving text referents understand me now 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.720
 in an aesthetic subject such as st that is also still a marketing issue because 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.290
 the carnival poster what we heard that the pp 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.700
 a tool 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.960
 of marketing but it is also a tool that has a component 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.010
 aesthetic super strong 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.110
 percent is complex that will be done that kind of thing 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.649
 there is a person who is behind you understand 3 is complicated 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.619
 quartetto portillo did to you that yang jiechi is skipped the complex is understood 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.090
 if it's not much the petit cast touched the shepherd 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.680
 Perez on the one hand I find it interesting but I was involved in this 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.890
 but on the other I'm worried about the commercial part 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.570
 that's not the fault but fernando is not yet at fault 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.470
 when submitting a proposal 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.940
 we tried saba and explained by the agent he called me to understand people 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.549
 whoever designed the poster paid an institution 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.440
 I make an exception 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.340
 2 is embodying your quarrel and your imagination and your creativity 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.879
 within this crisis loc why we say one thing to us as 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.059
 means of communication can not comment 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.099
 we are going to keep in mind what we do, we pay attention to the people who 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.189
 soon the followers who call us poplars 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.369
 a poll to see what people think in the program bothered them open the 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.109
 can do it 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.869
 but the fault is not who designed it 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:37.379
 do not have to pounce on the person who designed it because 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.929
 have a job if you are good at criticizing I imagine it is very good 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:41.969
 for do 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.629
 Yes or no 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:45.959
 grassi 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.540
 and in that sense I also think that the situation is not like looking guilty 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.509
 understand this city is like 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.789
 or be able to have a space in which you say 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.939
 hey it seems to me this seems to me the other thing and my proposal would be such 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.059
 efe but in this case I think that 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:07.259
 the style of the initiative is important because it allows you to say it 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.389
 hector that clear but also task to take care of the form a bit because we do not 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.420
 let's forget that 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.980
 same the carnival is of all of which we are all invoices that we are all 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.850
 pastusos 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.389
 the president of pp that these are others who claimed 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.939
 is part of your identity is part of your story when it is outside one is given 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.559
 account of this important work of diego souza bÃ¡rcenas is very beautiful these 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.049
 things 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.999
 the practice I did not like na k because I liked the pickaxe 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.629
 percent but among the dead there is no danger of losing you lose you go home 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.879
 we are today in the vault to explain their proposal 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:46.899
 but attention 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:48.799
 from all of this 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.929
 for one hundrerd 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.329
 what do I think I would think 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.149
 It is important 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:59.439
 the carnival approach me advances a certain who participatory because you 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.009
 you play because you to attack and then letter alcove through skype with the 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:08.229
 family with treatments with what is done has the club this event is 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.979
 with people and other fleets 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.169
 and the islands, I think it's 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.409
 carolina we have little time then cut what you said what 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.789
 we will achieve 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.340
 You do not like Balearic proposal 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.490
 graciascarolina by communication to us 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.009
 for him, fortunately, the people who participate with him many viewers 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.789
 let's do a little bit quick we ask the viewers of favor
