00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
in if you've got a lot of babies in the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.430 
in if you've got a lot of babies in the
tank<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.880> when<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.030> fall<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:28.350> am

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
tank and when they fall they actually am

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.990 
tank and when they fall they actually am
they<00:01:28.710> feel<00:01:28.890> quite<00:01:29.040> quickly<00:01:29.370> and<00:01:29.610> quite<00:01:29.820> hard

and<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.290> did<00:01:31.830> actually<00:01:31.950> am<00:01:32.310> accidentally

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and then I did actually am accidentally

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.990 
and then I did actually am accidentally
crush<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.690> couple<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.230> em<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.640> younger

in to think so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
in to think so
you<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.470> should<00:01:40.650> only<00:01:40.680> stick<00:01:41.160> these<00:01:41.280> in

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you really should only stick these in

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.820 
you really should only stick these in
I've<00:01:41.520> got<00:01:41.790> tank<00:01:42.480> with<00:01:42.660> them<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> majority

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
haven't yet kept him in the tank where

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.210 
haven't yet kept him in the tank where
they've<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.310> risen<00:02:02.610> halfway<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.480> then

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
they've actually risen halfway and then

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.290 
they've actually risen halfway and then
the<00:02:05.220> sea<00:02:05.340> monkeys<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.730> actually<00:02:05.970> managed<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
the sea monkeys have actually managed to

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.979 
the sea monkeys have actually managed to
use<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.750> burn<00:02:07.759> hopefully<00:02:08.780> one<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.869> my

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
use and burn hopefully one of my

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.750 
use and burn hopefully one of my
upcoming<00:02:10.110> tanks<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.830> will<00:02:11.220> stick<00:02:11.459> these<00:02:11.550> back

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
upcoming tanks I will stick these back

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.180 
upcoming tanks I will stick these back
in<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.780> I've<00:02:13.230> got<00:02:13.410> another<00:02:13.440> video<00:02:13.860> up<00:02:13.980> of
