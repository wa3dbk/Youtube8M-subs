00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.359
 in front of us is the samsung galaxy note 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.830
 8.0 I'll show you that again 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.170
 in the attitudes that also no what 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.019
 want to claim other 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.210
 gtm 5100 and i want you on one 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.430
 to point out that problem very much to me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.470
 Strongly noticed and indeed it works 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 to the so-called claudia doubts whether 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 you know that I have here in 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.019
 changed this test mode and here 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.000
 you can see that very clearly 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.140
 claudine these are over all these white ones 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.300
 spots we see here 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.489
 they seem to speak in this case 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.450
 for a bad or a bad one 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.660
 backlight for actually 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.010
 it should be uniform everywhere now 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.170
 be black or at least dark gray 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.700
 but as you can see it is everywhere here 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 Not at all and that is really very 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.750
 very annoying too because you are dark 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.700
 I do not like watching videos 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 really good I'll show you this 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.550
 I'm here you know that maybe 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.070
 I also have this test murder 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.399
 already shown to find out 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.770
 is she just in the phone 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.539
 click a star rhombus 0 stars 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.859
 roughen and then you come in this 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.979
 Testing by the below links 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.320
 on grip sensor and now you will 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.909
 very strong, but not only 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.549
 here the case but even if I do 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.680
 completely new start I look up 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.750
 reboot 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.490
 and then you can look now 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.560
 You see, that's very good 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.450
 really the camera is right back 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.310
 sharp when the picture gets lighter but 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.140
 I think you already recognize that is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 really very strong and very annoying 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 I do not know if that's the case with everyone 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 equipment so you are already in my 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.170
 In any case, this is the case 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.670
 very annoying and I wanted you 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 just said that you do not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.189
 Now think what is that only blowing now 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.259
 that can be that also your galaxy note 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.090
 800 may be affected by claudine 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.560
 I think it was too 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.750
 demonstration purposes really very much 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 practically you have seen what I mean 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.899
 I hope you are not 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.740
 maybe you can give more feedback 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.470
 Do you have such a samsung synonymous 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.329
 600 8.0 you also have the problems if 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.100
 yes, then maybe write that 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.640
 we may find a solution maybe 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.770
 we notice 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.180
 okay it's just a tester and you 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.009
 do not worry 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.299
 I definitely thank you for yours 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.689
 time is good 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.689
 ciao
