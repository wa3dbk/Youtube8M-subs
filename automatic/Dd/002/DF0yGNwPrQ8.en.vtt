00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.780 
part off and off by a couple pounds of
pressure<00:00:30.929> well<00:00:31.740> that's<00:00:32.189> how<00:00:32.369> things<00:00:32.610> were

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
pressure well that's how things were

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.940 
pressure well that's how things were
down<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> last<00:00:33.270> century<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.380> century

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
down in the last century this century

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.490

it's<00:00:35.489> digital<00:00:36.090> tire<00:00:36.329> gauges<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> very

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's digital tire gauges this is very

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.799 
it's digital tire gauges this is very
nice<00:00:37.739> i've<00:00:38.070> had<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.030> several<00:00:39.570> years

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
nice i've had this one for several years

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.229 
nice i've had this one for several years
had<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> buy<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.500> myself<00:00:40.620> though<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
had to buy it for myself though and it

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.049 
had to buy it for myself though and it
is<00:00:42.420> accurate<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.200> within<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.800> half<00:00:44.010> pound<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
is accurate to within a half pound so it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.720 
is accurate to within a half pound so it
gives<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.390> much<00:00:45.780> better<00:00:46.020> control<00:00:46.890> over<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
gives you much better control over the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279 
gives you much better control over the
tire<00:00:47.940> pressure<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.570> keeping<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.079> tires

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
tire pressure and keeping your tires

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.049

properly<00:00:49.590> inflated<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.370> course<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.700> important

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
properly inflated of course is important

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
properly inflated of course is important
for<00:00:51.180> safety<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.559> gas<00:00:52.710> mileage

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
if the tire pressure drops a couple

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
if the tire pressure drops a couple
pounds<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.530> mileage<00:00:55.949> starts<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.550> down

that I really like about it is let me

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
that I really like about it is let me
show<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> front<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.710> screen

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
show you here on the front the screen

show you here on the front the screen
here<00:01:26.790> lights<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.350> take

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
here lights up so when you actually take

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.289 
here lights up so when you actually take
the<00:01:28.860> pressure<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> put<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.909> onto<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the pressure when you put this onto the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.450 
the pressure when you put this onto the
valve<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.810> push<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.380> basically<00:01:31.619> turns<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
valve and push it it basically turns the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789 
valve and push it it basically turns the
device<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> reading<00:01:34.409> here

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
device on and you get the reading here

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.370 
device on and you get the reading here
lit<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.850> means<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.990> need<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> be

here<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.729> was<00:02:09.880> recently<00:02:10.270> out<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> little

here and I was recently out on a little
highway<00:02:11.590> trip<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.070> it's<00:02:12.160> probably<00:02:12.400> like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
highway trip so it's probably like

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.070 
highway trip so it's probably like
coming<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:12.880> little<00:02:12.970> high<00:02:13.180> normally<00:02:13.810> be<00:02:13.930> about

33 take the tire gauge press it against

33 take the tire gauge press it against
it<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.010> hold<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:18.400> less<00:02:18.670> than<00:02:18.700> half<00:02:18.880> a

it and hold it for less than half a

second and it should give me a readout

second and it should give me a readout
of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.890> tire<00:02:21.670> pressure<00:02:23.820> there<00:02:24.820> we<00:02:24.970> go<00:02:25.980> 35.5<00:02:27.090> so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
of the tire pressure there we go 35.5 so

of the tire pressure there we go 35.5 so
that's<00:02:28.270> how<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.510> works<00:02:28.720> takes<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.350> relatively
