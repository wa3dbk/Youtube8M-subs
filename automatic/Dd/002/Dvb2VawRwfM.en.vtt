500 a gas on top of that right oh so now

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.440 
500 a gas on top of that right oh so now
we<00:01:30.440> see<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.799> obligatory<00:01:31.039> Jim<00:01:31.729> Beam<00:01:31.940> cans<00:01:32.240> but

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
we see the obligatory Jim Beam cans but

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.660 
we see the obligatory Jim Beam cans but
it<00:01:32.539> doesn't<00:01:32.810> run<00:01:32.959> on<00:01:33.140> alcohol<00:01:33.619> no<00:01:34.100> runs<00:01:34.490> on

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
it doesn't run on alcohol no runs on

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.620 
it doesn't run on alcohol no runs on
route<00:01:35.270> 16<00:01:35.479> from<00:01:35.959> BP<00:01:36.350> feels<00:01:36.679> so<00:01:37.340> 116<00:01:38.240> octane

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
route 16 from BP feels so 116 octane

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.630 
route 16 from BP feels so 116 octane
fuel<00:01:38.929> yeah<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.470> think<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.069> something<00:01:40.520> like<00:01:40.549> that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
fuel yeah I think so something like that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.359 
fuel yeah I think so something like that
it's<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:41.000> very<00:01:41.320> oxygenated<00:01:42.320> fuel<00:01:42.649> makes<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.250> lot

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
it's a very oxygenated fuel makes a lot

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:43.959 
it's a very oxygenated fuel makes a lot
more<00:01:43.520> horsepower

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
more horsepower

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.849 
more horsepower
yeah<00:01:44.630> well<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.109> it<00:01:45.229> does<00:01:45.409> weight<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.799> you

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
yeah well that it does weight and you

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.410
