in<00:00:18.859> this<00:00:19.160> third<00:00:19.400> segment<00:00:19.640> we'll<00:00:19.970> look<00:00:20.090> at<00:00:20.210> a

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
in this third segment we'll look at a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.269 
in this third segment we'll look at a
pattern<00:00:20.570> called<00:00:20.689> Travis<00:00:21.170> picking<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:22.130> is

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
pattern called Travis picking this is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.859 
pattern called Travis picking this is
used<00:00:22.490> in<00:00:22.640> a<00:00:22.730> lot<00:00:22.880> of<00:00:22.970> different<00:00:23.240> songs<00:00:23.480> most

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
used in a lot of different songs most

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.779 
used in a lot of different songs most
notably<00:00:24.289> dust<00:00:24.650> in<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.890> wind<00:00:25.099> by<00:00:25.279> Kansas

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
notably dust in the wind by Kansas

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.420 
notably dust in the wind by Kansas
that's<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.689> title<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:27.110> we<00:00:27.289> have<00:00:27.739> at<00:00:28.009> a<00:00:28.220> video

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
that's a title that we have at a video

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.179 
that's a title that we have at a video
songs<00:00:28.849> incidentally<00:00:29.419> so<00:00:29.599> if<00:00:29.720> you<00:00:29.840> wanted<00:00:30.109> to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
songs incidentally so if you wanted to

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.439 
songs incidentally so if you wanted to
apply<00:00:31.189> this<00:00:31.279> concept<00:00:31.970> you<00:00:32.059> could<00:00:32.239> check<00:00:32.419> that

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
apply this concept you could check that

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.360 
apply this concept you could check that
video<00:00:32.750> out<00:00:34.300> Travis<00:00:35.300> picking<00:00:35.540> is<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.589> very<00:00:36.890> busy

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
video out Travis picking is a very busy

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.880 
video out Travis picking is a very busy
kind<00:00:37.879> of<00:00:37.940> arpeggiated<00:00:38.600> sound<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.260> it<00:00:39.410> has<00:00:39.860> a

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
kind of arpeggiated sound so it has a

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.349 
kind of arpeggiated sound so it has a
real<00:00:40.390> bass<00:00:41.390> heavy<00:00:41.690> type<00:00:42.110> of<00:00:42.320> feel<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.190> it

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.569 

so<00:00:47.989> that<00:00:48.109> should<00:00:48.289> sound<00:00:48.440> familiar<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:49.190> so

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
so that should sound familiar to you so

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.610 
so that should sound familiar to you so
let's<00:00:49.730> look<00:00:49.850> at<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.359> exact<00:00:51.199> right<00:00:51.409> hand

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
let's look at the exact right hand

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.930 
let's look at the exact right hand
fingering<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:52.159> then<00:00:52.280> we'll<00:00:52.399> apply<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.909> a

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
fingering and then we'll apply it to a

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.959 
fingering and then we'll apply it to a
chord<00:00:53.269> progression<00:00:53.769> in<00:00:54.769> this<00:00:55.370> case<00:00:55.550> I'm<00:00:55.729> still

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
chord progression in this case I'm still

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.789 
chord progression in this case I'm still
assigning<00:00:56.449> right-hand<00:00:56.899> fingers<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:57.620> rather

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
assigning right-hand fingers but rather

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.610 
assigning right-hand fingers but rather
than<00:00:58.129> my<00:00:58.729> index<00:00:59.600> middle<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.049> ring<00:01:00.140> fingers

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
than my index middle and ring fingers

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.009 
than my index middle and ring fingers
being<00:01:00.799> on<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.100> highest<00:01:01.460> strings<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.899> this

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
being on the highest strings in this

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.660 
being on the highest strings in this
case<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.469> ring<00:01:03.619> fingers<00:01:03.920> ending<00:01:04.159> up<00:01:04.280> on<00:01:04.460> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
case the ring fingers ending up on the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.510 
case the ring fingers ending up on the
second<00:01:05.089> string<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.509> that<00:01:06.259> can<00:01:06.439> change

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
second string and that can change

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.710 
second string and that can change
depending<00:01:07.520> on<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.909> chord<00:01:08.149> that<00:01:08.270> you're<00:01:08.420> on<00:01:08.570> or

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
depending on the chord that you're on or

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.719 
depending on the chord that you're on or
the<00:01:08.840> voicing<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.439> want<00:01:09.710> but<00:01:10.430> they'll

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
the voicing that you want but they'll

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.190 
the voicing that you want but they'll
still<00:01:10.970> be<00:01:11.000> assigned<00:01:11.360> two<00:01:11.539> strings<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
still be assigned two strings and the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.320 
still be assigned two strings and the
thumb<00:01:12.470> will<00:01:12.740> still<00:01:12.979> be<00:01:13.100> on<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.640> root<00:01:13.880> note<00:01:13.909> of

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
thumb will still be on the root note of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.300 
thumb will still be on the root note of
the<00:01:14.450> chord<00:01:14.689> that<00:01:14.750> you're<00:01:14.960> on<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.039> case

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
the chord that you're on so in this case

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.300 
the chord that you're on so in this case
with<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.490> C<00:01:16.759> major<00:01:16.970> chord<00:01:17.560> I'll<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.009> thumb

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
with a C major chord I'll have the thumb

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.779 
with a C major chord I'll have the thumb
on<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:20.060> fifth<00:01:20.450> string<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:22.069> ring<00:01:22.429> finger

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
on the fifth string and the ring finger

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.100 
on the fifth string and the ring finger
on<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.000> second<00:01:23.479> string<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:23.750> those<00:01:23.960> will

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
on the second string and those will

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.949 
on the second string and those will
strike<00:01:24.350> simultaneously<00:01:25.659> then<00:01:26.659> I'll<00:01:26.780> go<00:01:26.869> to

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
strike simultaneously then I'll go to

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.100 
strike simultaneously then I'll go to
the<00:01:27.170> index<00:01:27.590> finger<00:01:28.009> on<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.220> fourth<00:01:28.459> string

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
the index finger on the fourth string

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.420 
the index finger on the fourth string
middle<00:01:30.110> finger<00:01:30.259> on<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.740> third<00:01:30.950> string

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.490 

then<00:01:33.940> back<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.390> thumb<00:01:34.780> on<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.140> fifth

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
then back to the thumb on the fifth

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.530 
then back to the thumb on the fifth
string

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.020 

then<00:01:40.470> hitting<00:01:40.830> with<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.010> ring<00:01:41.550> finger<00:01:41.580> again

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
then hitting with the ring finger again

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
then hitting with the ring finger again
on<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.210> second<00:01:42.540> string<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.800> hitting

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
on the second string and then hitting

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.250 
on the second string and then hitting
the<00:01:44.190> index<00:01:44.550> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> fourth<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.960> middle

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
the index on the fourth and the middle

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:57.830 
the index on the fourth and the middle
on<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> third<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> slowly

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 

it'll<00:01:58.320> look<00:01:58.440> like<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.190> then<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.670> some

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it'll look like that and then in some

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.200 
it'll look like that and then in some
cases<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.070> shift<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.520> fingers<00:02:02.970> back

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
cases you can shift these fingers back

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.560 
cases you can shift these fingers back
up<00:02:03.510> the<00:02:04.049> ring<00:02:04.860> middle<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.460> index<00:02:05.670> fingers<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
up the ring middle and index fingers to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.639 
up the ring middle and index fingers to
the<00:02:06.600> first<00:02:06.930> second<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.290> third<00:02:07.530> string

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.259 

for<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> little<00:02:11.160> bit<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> different<00:02:11.819> sound<00:02:12.000> so

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
for a little bit of a different sound so

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.150 
for a little bit of a different sound so
I'll<00:02:12.360> start<00:02:12.629> back<00:02:13.170> here<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.769> second

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
I'll start back here on the second

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.830 
I'll start back here on the second
string<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:14.849> then<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.239> get<00:02:15.360> further<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.720> our

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
string and then as we get further in our

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.809 
string and then as we get further in our
progression<00:02:16.010> when<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> get<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> E<00:02:17.430> minor

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
progression when I get to the E minor

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.229 
progression when I get to the E minor
chord<00:02:18.349> I'll<00:02:19.349> shift<00:02:19.739> those<00:02:19.920> fingers<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
chord I'll shift those fingers up so the

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.400 
chord I'll shift those fingers up so the
chords<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.510> we'll<00:02:21.660> be<00:02:21.750> looking<00:02:21.870> at<00:02:22.170> will<00:02:22.319> be

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
chords that we'll be looking at will be

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.490 
chords that we'll be looking at will be

so<00:02:47.800> all<00:02:47.950> together<00:02:48.099> that'll<00:02:48.610> sound<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:48.970> this

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.320 

you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.559 

you

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.059 

so<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.659> can<00:03:02.780> hear<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:02.930> that's<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.260> nice<00:03:03.439> busy

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
so you can hear that that's a nice busy

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.530 
so you can hear that that's a nice busy
sound<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.400> really<00:03:04.549> accentuates<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.360> bass

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
sound that really accentuates the bass

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.170 
sound that really accentuates the bass
notes<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.980> our<00:03:07.099> next<00:03:07.189> segment<00:03:07.430> segments

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
notes so in our next segment segments

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.420 
notes so in our next segment segments
we'll<00:03:08.299> look<00:03:08.420> at<00:03:08.659> some<00:03:09.019> more<00:03:09.200> patterns<00:03:10.159> that

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
we'll look at some more patterns that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:21.410 
we'll look at some more patterns that
use<00:03:10.730> multiple<00:03:10.939> strings<00:03:11.420> at<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.599> same<00:03:11.840> time

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.670 

always<00:03:22.420> starts<00:03:22.690> with<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.930> thumb<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.500> base

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
always starts with the thumb on the base

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.160 
always starts with the thumb on the base
note<00:03:24.090> which<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.210> this<00:03:25.300> case<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.750> on<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.990> fifth

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
note which in this case is on the fifth

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.740 
note which in this case is on the fifth
string<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.740> I'll<00:03:27.430> pluck<00:03:27.610> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
string and I'll pluck that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.480 
string and I'll pluck that
simultaneously<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.870> my<00:03:29.020> ring<00:03:29.230> finger<00:03:29.490> on

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
simultaneously with my ring finger on

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.640 
simultaneously with my ring finger on
the<00:03:30.600> second<00:03:31.600> string

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.730 

so<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.610> first<00:03:36.790> chord<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.150> just<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.510> C<00:03:37.569> major

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
so the first chord is just a C major

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.820 
so the first chord is just a C major
then<00:03:40.430> we'll<00:03:40.550> go<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.730> AC<00:03:41.180> major<00:03:41.630> seven<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.770> is

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
then we'll go to AC major seven this is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.350 
then we'll go to AC major seven this is
made<00:03:43.160> by<00:03:43.310> just<00:03:43.550> lifting<00:03:43.880> up<00:03:43.970> your<00:03:44.150> first

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
made by just lifting up your first

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.720 
made by just lifting up your first
finger

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.599 

oh<00:03:51.760> geez
