I believe it is around 10 a.m. pacific
which<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:33.960> 1<00:00:34.200> p.m.<00:00:34.710> eastern<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.579> they'll

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
which is what 1 p.m. eastern and they'll

which is what 1 p.m. eastern and they'll
be<00:00:35.850> offline<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.239> roughly<00:00:36.809> two<00:00:37.050> hours<00:00:37.280> now

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
be offline for roughly two hours now

last<00:00:38.489> time<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:38.850> did<00:00:38.879> something<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.420> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
last time they did something like this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
last time they did something like this
it's<00:00:39.930> stayed<00:00:40.200> offline<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> little<00:00:41.160> bit

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it's stayed offline for a little bit

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.010 
it's stayed offline for a little bit
less<00:00:41.520> than<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.059> had<00:00:42.180> anticipated<00:00:42.480> but

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
less than what they had anticipated but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.810

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
i think they like to give themselves a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.119 
i think they like to give themselves a
hefty<00:00:45.239> window<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.230> case<00:00:46.440> shit<00:00:46.710> does<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> go

this<00:01:26.430> week<00:01:26.670> my<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.390> estimate<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:27.930> or

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this week my my estimate is or

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.740 
this week my my estimate is or
guesstimate<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:30.240> i<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
guesstimate is i think i think the the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.050 
guesstimate is i think i think the the
patch<00:01:31.110> should<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.560> hitting<00:01:31.740> sometime<00:01:32.430> around

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
patch should be hitting sometime around

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600 
patch should be hitting sometime around
thursday<00:01:33.840> would<00:01:34.530> make<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> most<00:01:34.920> sense<00:01:35.159> maybe

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
thursday would make the most sense maybe

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
thursday would make the most sense maybe
even<00:01:35.909> maybe<00:01:36.360> even<00:01:36.600> wednesday<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.140> i<00:01:37.259> don't

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
even maybe even wednesday but i don't

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
even maybe even wednesday but i don't
think<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.799> expect<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> patch<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.030> hit

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
think we can expect for the patch to hit

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.660 
think we can expect for the patch to hit
tomorrow<00:01:39.350> because<00:01:40.350> Bungie<00:01:40.740> usually<00:01:41.280> gives<00:01:41.460> us
