see ya but well what's a skeptic its

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.100 
see ya but well what's a skeptic its
skeptic<00:02:08.729> by<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.940> true<00:02:09.390> meaning<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> word

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
all possibilities and with something

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.580 
all possibilities and with something
like<00:02:15.049> this<00:02:15.849> obviously<00:02:16.849> we're<00:02:17.659> looking<00:02:18.019> for<00:02:18.349> a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
like this obviously we're looking for a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.619 
like this obviously we're looking for a
natural<00:02:18.920> cause<00:02:19.459> before<00:02:19.819> we're<00:02:20.150> looking<00:02:20.450> for

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
natural cause before we're looking for

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.059 
natural cause before we're looking for
some<00:02:20.780> sort<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.019> extraterrestrial<00:02:21.260> cause

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
some sort of extraterrestrial cause

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.520 
some sort of extraterrestrial cause
again<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:22.909> because<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.959> extra-terrestrial

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
again just because the extra-terrestrial

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.449 
again just because the extra-terrestrial
cause<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.939> has<00:02:26.450> never<00:02:26.629> been<00:02:26.720> proven<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.069> by

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
cause it has never been proven so by

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.690 
cause it has never been proven so by
looking<00:02:28.700> at<00:02:29.019> natural<00:02:30.019> causes<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:31.159> feel<00:02:31.549> it

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
looking at natural causes we feel it

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.069 
looking at natural causes we feel it
will<00:02:31.819> be<00:02:31.909> able<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.150> come<00:02:32.239> up<00:02:32.269> with<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.540> much<00:02:32.840> more

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
will be able to come up with a much more

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.020 
will be able to come up with a much more
reasonable<00:02:33.319> explanation<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.459> then<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> FAA

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
reasonable explanation and then the FAA

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.550 
reasonable explanation and then the FAA
is<00:02:35.209> also<00:02:35.540> said<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.780> nothing<00:02:36.019> really<00:02:36.379> out<00:02:36.409> of

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
is also said that nothing really out of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.349 
is also said that nothing really out of
the<00:02:36.709> ordinary<00:02:36.739> happened<00:02:37.400> less<00:02:37.519> right<00:02:37.970> unless

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
the ordinary happened less right unless

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.330 
the ordinary happened less right unless
Sunday<00:02:38.629> absolutely<00:02:39.409> but<00:02:39.560> when<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.859> look<00:02:40.069> into

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
Sunday absolutely but when you look into

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.780

flights in the area due to the fires

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.830 
flights in the area due to the fires
that<00:02:46.099> we've<00:02:46.250> been<00:02:46.430> having<00:02:46.790> alistor<00:02:47.299> good<00:02:47.690> one

that we've been having alistor good one

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.300 
that we've been having alistor good one
and<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.349> lot<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.799> things<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.129> have<00:02:49.280> been

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
and a lot of the things that have been

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.580 
and a lot of the things that have been
reported<00:02:50.030> depending<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:50.989> how<00:02:51.139> many<00:02:51.200> lights

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
reported depending on how many lights

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.110 
reported depending on how many lights
they<00:02:51.829> say<00:02:52.040> they've<00:02:52.220> seen<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.670> really<00:02:52.940> varies

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
they say they've seen it really varies

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.940 
they say they've seen it really varies
and<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.569> what<00:02:53.720> direction<00:02:53.750> these<00:02:54.379> were<00:02:54.590> moving

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
and in what direction these were moving

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.149 
and in what direction these were moving
right<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:55.849> there<00:02:56.329> are<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.599> lot<00:02:57.139> of<00:02:57.349> slurry

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
right but there are a lot of slurry

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.190 
right but there are a lot of slurry
bombers<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> lot<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.180> helicopters<00:02:59.810> and<00:02:59.840> things

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
bombers a lot of helicopters and things

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.199 
bombers a lot of helicopters and things
like<00:03:00.379> that<00:03:00.440> could<00:03:01.099> really<00:03:01.310> account<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:01.940> these

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
like that could really account for these

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.569 
like that could really account for these
the<00:03:02.540> wind<00:03:03.290> speed<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.920> we've<00:03:04.099> been<00:03:04.250> having

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
the wind speed that we've been having

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.399 
the wind speed that we've been having
problems<00:03:04.879> with<00:03:05.209> can<00:03:05.450> really<00:03:05.930> bog<00:03:06.139> those

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
problems with can really bog those

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.500 
problems with can really bog those
planes<00:03:06.709> down<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.489> that's<00:03:07.790> interesting<00:03:08.060> when

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
planes down so that's interesting when

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.970 
planes down so that's interesting when
you<00:03:08.629> look<00:03:08.840> at<00:03:09.019> some<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.379> things<00:03:09.560> like<00:03:09.739> this

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
you look at some of the things like this

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.240 
you look at some of the things like this
we<00:03:10.190> think<00:03:10.430> we<00:03:10.549> have<00:03:10.700> some<00:03:10.909> relief<00:03:11.209> at<00:03:11.959> least

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
we think we have some relief at least

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.830 
we think we have some relief at least
good<00:03:13.250> possibilities<00:03:14.060> as<00:03:14.269> far<00:03:14.480> as<00:03:14.599> a<00:03:14.690> good

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
good possibilities as far as a good

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.449 
good possibilities as far as a good
question<00:03:15.200> right<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.739> let's<00:03:15.950> turn<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.190> Doug

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
question right so let's turn to Doug

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.330 
question right so let's turn to Doug
then<00:03:17.260> comment<00:03:18.260> on<00:03:18.379> what<00:03:18.530> he's<00:03:18.680> saying<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.069> in

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
then comment on what he's saying here in

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.909 
then comment on what he's saying here in
n<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.849> add<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:21.169> what<00:03:21.440> proof<00:03:21.709> do<00:03:21.889> you

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
n and add to that what what proof do you

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.339 
n and add to that what what proof do you
have<00:03:22.040> well<00:03:22.879> that's<00:03:23.419> exactly<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:24.079> whole<00:03:24.230> thing

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
have well that's exactly the whole thing

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.470 
have well that's exactly the whole thing
about<00:03:24.500> MUFON<00:03:24.919> we<00:03:25.099> do<00:03:25.280> not<00:03:25.400> have<00:03:25.699> proof<00:03:26.090> we<00:03:26.269> look

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
about MUFON we do not have proof we look

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.860 
about MUFON we do not have proof we look
