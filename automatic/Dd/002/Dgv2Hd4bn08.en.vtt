April she's come over here and just had
a<00:01:56.070> bit<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.450> hands-on<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.870> see<00:01:58.020> what<00:01:58.170> we

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
a bit of hands-on to see what we

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260 
a bit of hands-on to see what we
actually<00:01:58.410> do<00:01:58.620> in<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.830> country<00:01:59.160> as<00:01:59.220> well<00:01:59.370> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
actually do in this country as well it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
actually do in this country as well it
is<00:02:00.330> difficult<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:01.230> make<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.650> transformation

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
is difficult to make the transformation

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.000 
is difficult to make the transformation
from<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.760> qualifiers<00:02:03.390> into<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.110> main<00:02:04.350> TV<00:02:04.650> event

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
from the qualifiers into a main TV event

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.860 
from the qualifiers into a main TV event
this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.729> different<00:02:06.120> positioning<00:02:06.570> around<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
this is different positioning around the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.040 
this is different positioning around the
table<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.760> ever<00:02:08.760> a<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:09.360> pressures<00:02:09.869> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
table and ever a bit more pressures and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.710 
table and ever a bit more pressures and
because<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> TV<00:02:11.130> lights<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.820> warm<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
because the TV lights are so warm it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.830 
because the TV lights are so warm it
does<00:02:12.870> affect<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.560> overall<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.580> yeah<00:02:15.510> she's

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.000 
the surroundings down the big stage and
I<00:02:47.240> think<00:02:47.989> in<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.170> future<00:02:48.260> year<00:02:48.590> she<00:02:48.770> will<00:02:48.890> be

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
I think in the future year she will be

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.660 
I think in the future year she will be
one<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.310> top<00:02:49.459> brass

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.430 

I<00:02:52.700> think<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.920> am<00:02:54.920> getting<00:02:55.640> more<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:55.940> more

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
I think I am getting more and more

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.890 
I think I am getting more and more
confident<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:59.240> this<00:02:59.870> was<00:03:00.140> open<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
confident and so this was open the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.380 
confident and so this was open the
feeling<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.380> very<00:03:03.440> good<00:03:03.950> when<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.580> talk<00:03:04.880> when<00:03:05.209> I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
feeling is very good when I talk when I

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.830 
feeling is very good when I talk when I
came<00:03:05.990> out<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.770> everything<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.970> good<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:08.660> me<00:03:08.810> I

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
came out I everything is good for me I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.630

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.350 

the<00:03:14.390> dream<00:03:14.690> for<00:03:15.020> every<00:03:15.680> referee<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.490> one<00:03:17.150> day
