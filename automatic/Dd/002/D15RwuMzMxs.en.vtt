advantage higher quality or not i I
don't<00:04:59.300> think<00:04:59.720> so<00:04:59.870> that<00:05:00.080> will<00:05:00.260> be<00:05:00.380> higher

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
don't think so that will be higher

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.610 
don't think so that will be higher
quality<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:01.849> was<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.449> two<00:05:02.660> previous<00:05:03.229> matches

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620

it's good if both of us we are playing
at<00:07:04.149> variable<00:07:05.149> level<00:07:05.419> so<00:07:05.689> the<00:07:06.289> match<00:07:06.469> becomes

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 
at variable level so the match becomes

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.610 
at variable level so the match becomes
great<00:07:07.879> because<00:07:08.270> we<00:07:08.449> play<00:07:08.599> long<00:07:08.839> rallies<00:07:09.199> we

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620

bring our our game to them to the limit

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.899 
bring our our game to them to the limit
situations<00:07:13.669> and<00:07:14.830> becomes<00:07:15.830> a<00:07:15.949> very<00:07:16.699> difficult

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:16.909 
situations and becomes a very difficult

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:19.529 
situations and becomes a very difficult
match<00:07:17.240> for<00:07:17.479> both<00:07:17.659> of<00:07:17.810> us<00:07:17.960> now<00:07:18.020> so<00:07:18.529> hopefully<00:07:18.949> I
