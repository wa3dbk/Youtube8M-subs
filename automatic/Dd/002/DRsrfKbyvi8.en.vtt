cords<00:00:01.410> are<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.589> backbone<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.689> pretty<00:00:03.689> much

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
cords are the backbone of pretty much

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.720 
cords are the backbone of pretty much
all<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.440> guitar<00:00:05.250> music<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.640> you're

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
all of the guitar music that you're

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.430 
all of the guitar music that you're
going<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.910> be<00:00:05.970> playing<00:00:06.140> chords<00:00:07.140> come<00:00:07.290> from

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
going to be playing chords come from

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.589 
going to be playing chords come from
scales<00:00:07.770> what<00:00:08.280> I'd<00:00:08.400> like<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.550> do<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.940> explain<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
scales what I'd like to do is explain to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.890 
scales what I'd like to do is explain to
you<00:00:09.750> how<00:00:10.429> chords<00:00:11.429> come<00:00:11.639> from<00:00:11.820> scales<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.480> then

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
you how chords come from scales and then

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.299 
you how chords come from scales and then
I'm<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.170> explain<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> Roman<00:00:14.009> numeral

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
I'm going to explain the Roman numeral

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.650 
I'm going to explain the Roman numeral
system<00:00:14.790> which<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.509> using

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
system which I'm going to be using

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.019 
system which I'm going to be using
throughout<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.260> course<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:17.550> identify<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
throughout this course to identify the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.070 
throughout this course to identify the
different<00:00:18.420> chords<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.779> how<00:00:18.900> they're

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
different chords in how they're

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.900 
different chords in how they're
functioning<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> first<00:00:20.609> thing<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.789> need

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
functioning so the first thing we need

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
functioning so the first thing we need
to<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.539> play<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> C<00:00:22.380> scale<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.430> do

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
to do is play a C scale and we can do

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.140 
to do is play a C scale and we can do
that<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.170> starting<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> 3rd<00:00:25.500> fret<00:00:26.150> 5th

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
that I starting on the 3rd fret 5th

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.169 
that I starting on the 3rd fret 5th
string<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.640> we're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> play<00:00:29.939> our<00:00:30.060> C

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
string and we're going to play our C

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.710 
string and we're going to play our C
scale<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.630> up<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.869> this

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:45.110 

Oh

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210 

okay<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:46.180> that's<00:00:46.420> my<00:00:46.600> C<00:00:46.810> scale<00:00:47.110> C<00:00:47.650> major<00:00:47.860> scale

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
okay so that's my C scale C major scale

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.200 
okay so that's my C scale C major scale
now<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:50.140> you<00:00:50.170> harmonize<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.700> C<00:00:52.000> major

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
now when you harmonize that C major

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.090 
now when you harmonize that C major
scale<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.960> gives<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.470> certain<00:00:53.710> set<00:00:54.070> of

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
scale it gives you a certain set of

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.090 
scale it gives you a certain set of
courts<00:00:54.580> and<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.690> chords<00:00:56.410> that<00:00:56.590> gives<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:56.980> are

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
courts and the chords that gives you are

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.410 
courts and the chords that gives you are
always<00:00:57.340> always<00:00:57.970> going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.510> be<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.809> same<00:01:00.420> no

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
always always going to be the same no

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.520 
always always going to be the same no
matter<00:01:01.540> which<00:01:01.809> key<00:01:02.110> you're<00:01:02.350> in<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:04.500> before<00:01:05.500> I

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
matter which key you're in so before I

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.290 
matter which key you're in so before I
explain<00:01:06.040> which<00:01:06.400> court<00:01:06.700> are<00:01:06.820> derived<00:01:07.180> from

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
explain which court are derived from

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.990 
explain which court are derived from
that<00:01:07.509> scale<00:01:07.780> what<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.770> can<00:01:08.920> do<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.250> we<00:01:09.970> can

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
that scale what we can do is we can

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that scale what we can do is we can
label<00:01:10.420> each<00:01:10.810> note<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.630> may<00:01:13.750> have<00:01:13.780> heard

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
label each note so you may have heard

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.300 
label each note so you may have heard
guitarists<00:01:14.590> say<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:14.770> know<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:14.979> that<00:01:15.220> the

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
guitarists say you know is that the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.130 
guitarists say you know is that the
first-degree<00:01:16.060> second-degree<00:01:16.570> third<00:01:16.960> degree

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
first-degree second-degree third degree

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.870 
first-degree second-degree third degree
or<00:01:17.410> fourth<00:01:17.680> degree<00:01:17.800> of<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.250> scale<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.700> fifth

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
or fourth degree of the scale the fifth

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.100 
or fourth degree of the scale the fifth
graders<00:01:19.180> go<00:01:19.300> that<00:01:19.509> kind<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:19.750> thing<00:01:19.869> what

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
graders go that kind of thing what

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.190 
graders go that kind of thing what
they're<00:01:20.259> talking<00:01:20.590> about<00:01:20.649> is<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.360> if<00:01:23.020> you

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
they're talking about is when you if you

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.020 
they're talking about is when you if you
label<00:01:23.380> each<00:01:23.740> note<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.250> scale<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.850> this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
label each note of the scale so this

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.790 
label each note of the scale so this
particular<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:26.140> first<00:01:26.350> notes<00:01:26.560> going<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.740> be

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
particular the first notes going to be

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.060 
particular the first notes going to be
one<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.450> second<00:01:28.840> note<00:01:28.990> is<00:01:29.170> going<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.500> be<00:01:29.649> to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
one the second note is going to be to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.870 
one the second note is going to be to
the<00:01:30.940> third<00:01:31.149> notes3<00:01:31.830> so<00:01:32.830> on<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.160> forth<00:01:33.250> four

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
the third notes3 so on and so forth four

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.550 
the third notes3 so on and so forth four
five<00:01:34.800> six<00:01:36.030> seven<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.450> then<00:01:37.810> at<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.020> octave

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
five six seven and then at the octave

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.190 
five six seven and then at the octave
that's<00:01:38.800> called<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.100> eight<00:01:39.690> but<00:01:40.690> in<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:40.899> it's

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
that's called a eight but in this it's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.340 
that's called a eight but in this it's
just<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.740> repeat<00:01:42.160> of<00:01:42.399> whatever<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.960> first

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
just the repeat of whatever the first

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.950 
just the repeat of whatever the first
degree<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.039> this<00:01:45.250> happens<00:01:45.550> we<00:01:45.640> see<00:01:45.910> this<00:01:46.810> is

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
degree is so this happens we see this is

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.830 
degree is so this happens we see this is
also<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.350> see<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:48.820> if<00:01:48.910> I<00:01:49.000> take<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.360> same<00:01:49.540> scale

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
also a see now if I take that same scale

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.100 
also a see now if I take that same scale
and<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.020> move<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.290> up<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.500> half<00:01:50.710> step<00:01:51.659> I'm<00:01:52.659> in<00:01:52.930> D

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
and I move it up a half step I'm in D

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.200 
and I move it up a half step I'm in D
flat

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.999 

okay<00:01:58.210> now<00:01:59.079> if<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.229> take<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.740> move<00:01:59.829> it<00:01:59.920> up

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
okay now if I take that and move it up

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.850 
okay now if I take that and move it up
another<00:02:00.070> half<00:02:00.460> step<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:02.170> gonna<00:02:02.350> keep<00:02:02.469> d<00:02:04.860> well

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
another half step I'm gonna keep d well

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.410 
another half step I'm gonna keep d well
these<00:02:05.979> are<00:02:06.130> still<00:02:06.340> one<00:02:06.640> two<00:02:06.880> three<00:02:07.149> four<00:02:07.360> five

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
these are still one two three four five

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.339 
these are still one two three four five
six<00:02:07.899> seven<00:02:08.080> eight<00:02:09.090> ok<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.660> those<00:02:10.869> different

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
six seven eight ok so those different

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.789 
six seven eight ok so those different
scale<00:02:11.650> degrees<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:13.390> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.049> or<00:02:14.260> what

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
scale degrees are going to be or what

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.350 
scale degrees are going to be or what
we're<00:02:14.980> going<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.310> use<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.700> identify<00:02:15.819> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
we're going to use to identify the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.699 
we're going to use to identify the
different<00:02:17.019> chords<00:02:17.620> as<00:02:17.920> we<00:02:18.640> play<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.349> first

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
different chords as we play so the first

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.589 
different chords as we play so the first
degree<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.360> first<00:02:22.660> chord<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.160> be

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
degree or the first chord that can be

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.300 
degree or the first chord that can be
when<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.690> harmonize<00:02:26.110> your<00:02:26.590> major<00:02:26.799> scale<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
when you harmonize your major scale the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.699 
when you harmonize your major scale the
cord<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.239> get<00:02:28.540> built<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.290> root<00:02:29.500> note

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
cord that you get built on the root note

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.430 
cord that you get built on the root note
C<00:02:30.069> as<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.849> C<00:02:31.030> chord

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.589

okay or C chords the second degree of
the<00:03:06.550> scale<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.870> produce<00:03:08.020> a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the scale is going to produce a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.320 
the scale is going to produce a
different<00:03:09.100> type<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.400> cord<00:03:09.700> which<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> minor

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
different type of cord which is a minor

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.490 
different type of cord which is a minor
chord<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.490> my<00:03:12.610> first<00:03:12.880> degree<00:03:13.500> my

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
chord so this is my first degree my

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.980 
chord so this is my first degree my
second<00:03:14.890> degree<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.220> going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.430> be<00:03:15.490> here<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:16.840> I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
second degree is going to be here if I

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.530 
second degree is going to be here if I
build<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.470> cord<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.880> second<00:03:19.210> degree<00:03:19.300> it's

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
build a cord on that second degree it's

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.370 
build a cord on that second degree it's
going<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> give<00:03:19.810> me<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> minor<00:03:20.290> chord

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.550 

okay<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.940> two<00:03:25.180> chord<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.780> every<00:03:26.290> major

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
okay so the two chord and every major

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.100 
okay so the two chord and every major
scale<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:26.920> going<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.220> be<00:03:27.280> minor

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
scale is going to be minor

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.340 
scale is going to be minor
if<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.160> go<00:03:30.340> up<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.670> three<00:03:31.060> chord<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:32.110> three

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
if I go up to the three chord the three

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.600 
if I go up to the three chord the three
chord<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.710> always<00:03:32.980> going<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.160> be<00:03:33.190> minor<00:03:33.430> as

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
chord is always going to be minor as

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.030 
chord is always going to be minor as
well

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.030 

and<00:03:38.549> because<00:03:38.790> I'm<00:03:38.909> in<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.060> key<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.239> C<00:03:40.040> the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
and because I'm in the key of C the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.569 
and because I'm in the key of C the
three<00:03:41.250> chord<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.730> e<00:03:42.390> because<00:03:42.780> c<00:03:43.019> d<00:03:43.500> e<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.459> if

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
three chord is is e because c d e so if

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.630 
three chord is is e because c d e so if
i<00:03:44.700> play<00:03:45.290> my<00:03:46.290> three<00:03:46.829> coordinates<00:03:47.310> get<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.579> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
i play my three coordinates get in the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.289 
i play my three coordinates get in the
key<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.790> C<00:03:47.879> gives<00:03:48.870> me<00:03:49.019> an<00:03:49.079> E<00:03:49.200> minor<00:03:49.349> chord<00:03:50.299> and

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
key of C gives me an E minor chord and

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.899 
key of C gives me an E minor chord and
you<00:03:51.420> can<00:03:51.540> play<00:03:51.629> that<00:03:51.750> II<00:03:51.810> minor<00:03:52.049> here<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:53.760> can

either<00:03:56.760> pledge<00:03:56.970> here<00:03:59.510> okay<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.989> bottom<00:04:01.319> line

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
either pledge here okay the bottom line

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.140 
either pledge here okay the bottom line
is<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.430> three-quarter<00:04:02.909> is<00:04:02.970> always

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
is that the three-quarter is always

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.610 
is that the three-quarter is always
going<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.360> minor<00:04:03.569> now<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.870> four<00:04:04.170> chord<00:04:04.470> is

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
going to be minor now the four chord is

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.410 
going to be minor now the four chord is
going<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.830> be<00:04:04.890> major<00:04:05.069> so<00:04:06.000> since<00:04:06.209> we're<00:04:06.299> in<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
going to be major so since we're in the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.080 
going to be major so since we're in the
key<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.569> F<00:04:06.750> let's<00:04:06.930> go<00:04:07.080> up<00:04:07.200> one<00:04:07.560> two<00:04:07.950> three<00:04:08.430> four

diminish<00:05:50.520> it's<00:05:51.520> what<00:05:51.700> you<00:05:51.820> get<00:05:51.940> when<00:05:52.450> you

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
diminish it's what you get when you

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.110 
diminish it's what you get when you
harmonize<00:05:52.960> it<00:05:53.140> so<00:05:53.350> that's<00:05:53.620> what's<00:05:53.950> meant<00:05:54.370> when

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
harmonize it so that's what's meant when

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.400 
harmonize it so that's what's meant when
they're<00:05:55.240> talking<00:05:55.360> about<00:05:55.570> C<00:05:56.500> scale<00:05:57.330> like<00:05:58.410> when

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
they're talking about C scale like when

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.120 
they're talking about C scale like when
you're<00:05:59.500> talking<00:05:59.680> about<00:05:59.770> the<00:05:59.860> different

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
you're talking about the different

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.830 
you're talking about the different
chords<00:06:00.430> that<00:06:00.580> come<00:06:00.640> from<00:06:01.060> those<00:06:01.270> scales<00:06:01.600> you

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
chords that come from those scales you

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.300 
chords that come from those scales you
say<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.110> one<00:06:02.320> chord<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.740> two<00:06:02.920> chord<00:06:03.190> the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
say the one chord the two chord the

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.120 
say the one chord the two chord the
three<00:06:03.520> quarter<00:06:03.790> for<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.210> five<00:06:04.330> chord<00:06:04.570> etc

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
three quarter for the five chord etc

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.800 
three quarter for the five chord etc
those<00:06:06.130> chords<00:06:06.760> are<00:06:06.880> derived<00:06:07.240> from<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:07.570> scale

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
those chords are derived from the scale

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.080 
those chords are derived from the scale
because<00:06:08.110> they're<00:06:08.410> built<00:06:08.710> on<00:06:08.980> the<00:06:09.760> different

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
because they're built on the different

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.000 
because they're built on the different
scale<00:06:10.330> degrees<00:06:10.720> of<00:06:11.020> that<00:06:11.410> scale<00:06:11.710> which

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
scale degrees of that scale which

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.280 
scale degrees of that scale which
happens<00:06:12.310> to<00:06:12.340> be<00:06:12.430> seen<00:06:12.790> and<00:06:13.540> we<00:06:13.690> can<00:06:13.810> transpose

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
happens to be seen and we can transpose

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.900 
happens to be seen and we can transpose
all<00:06:14.350> of<00:06:14.770> that<00:06:14.920> just<00:06:15.130> in<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.430> different<00:06:15.550> key

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
all of that just in a different key

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.160 
all of that just in a different key
simply<00:06:16.870> by<00:06:17.080> moving<00:06:18.070> up<00:06:18.400> the<00:06:19.180> fretboard<00:06:19.390> so<00:06:20.080> in

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
simply by moving up the fretboard so in

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.460 
simply by moving up the fretboard so in
this<00:06:20.260> case<00:06:20.440> we're<00:06:20.680> in<00:06:20.740> C<00:06:20.920> right<00:06:22.140> if<00:06:23.140> you<00:06:23.320> move

this case we're in C right if you move

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.090 
this case we're in C right if you move

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
up to D flat it's all the same exact

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.830 
up to D flat it's all the same exact

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
chord diminished and it starts all over

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.920 
chord diminished and it starts all over
again<00:06:38.310> so<00:06:39.310> it<00:06:39.460> doesn't<00:06:39.730> it's<00:06:39.940> it's<00:06:40.510> totally

okay<00:06:50.470> that's<00:06:51.190> very<00:06:51.370> important<00:06:52.060> because<00:06:52.150> I'm

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
okay that's very important because I'm

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.820 
okay that's very important because I'm
going<00:06:52.690> to<00:06:52.750> be<00:06:52.810> explained<00:06:53.230> everything<00:06:53.560> I<00:06:53.770> do

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
going to be explained everything I do

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.490 
going to be explained everything I do
from<00:06:54.100> here<00:06:54.340> on<00:06:54.400> out<00:06:54.870> through<00:06:55.870> this<00:06:55.960> course<00:06:56.290> I'm

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
from here on out through this course I'm

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.100 
from here on out through this course I'm
going<00:06:56.740> to<00:06:56.800> be<00:06:56.890> referencing<00:06:58.050> how<00:06:59.050> the

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
going to be referencing how the

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.020 
going to be referencing how the
different<00:06:59.440> chords<00:06:59.860> are<00:06:59.950> functioning<00:07:00.580> if

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
different chords are functioning if

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.550 
different chords are functioning if
they're<00:07:01.210> functioning<00:07:01.720> as<00:07:01.840> major<00:07:02.110> or<00:07:02.350> minor

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
they're functioning as major or minor

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.650 
they're functioning as major or minor
now<00:07:03.660> this<00:07:04.660> formula<00:07:05.560> is<00:07:05.940> pretty<00:07:06.940> much<00:07:07.120> the<00:07:07.180> same

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
now this formula is pretty much the same

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.680 
now this formula is pretty much the same
in<00:07:07.720> the<00:07:07.930> minor<00:07:08.290> key<00:07:08.650> I'll<00:07:09.550> explain<00:07:09.670> a<00:07:10.270> couple

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
in the minor key I'll explain a couple

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.070 
in the minor key I'll explain a couple
of<00:07:10.870> differences<00:07:11.170> coming<00:07:11.800> up<00:07:11.890> next
