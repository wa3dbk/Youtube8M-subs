00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the space behind the defense we had two

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.100 
the space behind the defense we had two
good<00:00:44.700> opportunities<00:00:45.180> woman<00:00:45.420> Ethel<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:45.960> was

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
good opportunities woman Ethel which was

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.479 
good opportunities woman Ethel which was
caught<00:00:46.289> offside<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.100> site<00:00:47.340> so

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
caught offside but it was on site so

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.549 
caught offside but it was on site so
that<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.850> harsh<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.379> had

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that was a bit harsh and then you had

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
that was a bit harsh and then you had
the<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.730> has<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> pass

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the one where I know has are not to pass

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.689 
the one where I know has are not to pass
flurries<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.469> couldn't<00:00:52.739> hit<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> target<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
flurries but couldn't hit the target I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
flurries but couldn't hit the target I
think<00:00:54.239> Spurs<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.020> fast<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.530> did<00:00:55.710> really

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
think Spurs to be fast them did really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
think Spurs to be fast them did really
well<00:00:56.070> first<00:00:56.489> half<00:00:56.730> apart<00:00:57.149> from<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> first<00:00:57.570> 10

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
well first half apart from the first 10

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.060 
well first half apart from the first 10
minutes<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.289> possession<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> us

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
minutes you have more possession and us

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.349 
minutes you have more possession and us
and<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.340> were<00:00:59.430> able<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.699> try<00:00:59.969> controlling

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and they were able to try controlling

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.029 
and they were able to try controlling
their<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> bit<00:01:00.750> more<00:01:01.140> compact<00:01:01.680> than<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.980> expected

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
their a bit more compact than I expected

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.579 
their a bit more compact than I expected
them<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.780> were<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:04.080> forward

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
them to be and they were going forward

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
them to be and they were going forward
well<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.330> thing<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.780> we

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
well but the one thing I think that we

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.450 
well but the one thing I think that we
did<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.320> well<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.010> weren't<00:01:08.159> given

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
did really well but we weren't given

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.950 
did really well but we weren't given
those<00:01:08.610> chances<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> mean<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
those chances if you know I mean if you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
those chances if you know I mean if you
look<00:01:10.140> at<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.159> possession

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
look at that you know as possession

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.980 
look at that you know as possession
stats<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> lot<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.330> possession<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.869> their

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
stats there a lot of possession in their

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.390 
stats there a lot of possession in their
own<00:01:13.110> half<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> rain<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> mid<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> pocket

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
own half and rain the mid of the pocket

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.109 
own half and rain the mid of the pocket
there<00:01:14.700> was<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:16.200> our<00:01:16.710> half<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.700> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
there was not much in our half and I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.310 
there was not much in our half and I
think<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.450> did<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.600> well<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.110> that's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
think we did really well I think that's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.719 
think we did really well I think that's
the<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.650> thing<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> moment

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the one thing that we have at the moment

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
the one thing that we have at the moment
that<00:01:21.060> teams<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.509> finding<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.140> Fred

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that teams are finding you know Fred

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
that teams are finding you know Fred
mental<00:01:22.560> breakdown<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> solid

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
mental breakdown it's not just the solid

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.539 
mental breakdown it's not just the solid
back<00:01:24.750> forward<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:26.369> good

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
dangerous or pearl and that's why I went

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.580 
dangerous or pearl and that's why I went
to<00:03:11.629> play<00:03:11.719> it<00:03:11.780> front<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.049> be<00:03:12.169> honest<00:03:12.319> because<00:03:12.439> he

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
to play it front to be honest because he

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.020 
to play it front to be honest because he
does<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.980> we<00:03:13.069> does<00:03:13.219> he's<00:03:13.340> really<00:03:13.669> good<00:03:13.819> runs

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
does that we does he's really good runs

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.030 
does that we does he's really good runs
and<00:03:14.269> they<00:03:14.359> are<00:03:14.510> borderline<00:03:14.989> off<00:03:15.260> cycle<00:03:15.560> on<00:03:15.829> so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
and they are borderline off cycle on so

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.890 
and they are borderline off cycle on so
but<00:03:16.189> when<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.430> clicks<00:03:16.699> it<00:03:16.939> worked<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.479> that's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
but when it clicks it worked and that's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.879 
but when it clicks it worked and that's
the<00:03:18.019> reason<00:03:18.109> why<00:03:18.259> it's<00:03:18.439> called<00:03:18.560> hatchery

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
the reason why it's called hatchery

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.710 
the reason why it's called hatchery
against<00:03:19.099> Fulham<00:03:19.370> because<00:03:19.579> he<00:03:20.299> was<00:03:20.449> making

against Fulham because he was making

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.240 
against Fulham because he was making
these<00:03:20.840> runs<00:03:21.139> and<00:03:21.379> because<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.099> way<00:03:22.220> he

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
these runs and because the way he

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.969 
these runs and because the way he
attacks<00:03:22.729> that<00:03:23.329> that<00:03:23.629> off<00:03:23.810> sideline<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.530> know

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:24.979 
attacks that that off sideline you know

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.800 
attacks that that off sideline you know
he<00:03:25.189> manages<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.579> get<00:03:25.790> through<00:03:25.849> on<00:03:26.150> goal<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:26.599> um

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
he manages to get through on goal so um

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.990 
he manages to get through on goal so um
you<00:03:27.769> know<00:03:27.859> I<00:03:27.889> don't<00:03:28.069> get<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.489> frustrate<00:03:28.879> when

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
you know I don't get to frustrate when

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.159 
you know I don't get to frustrate when
he<00:03:29.060> does<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.209> when<00:03:29.479> he<00:03:29.599> when<00:03:29.810> he<00:03:29.900> misses

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
he does that when he when he misses

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.710 
he does that when he when he misses
passes<00:03:30.949> because<00:03:31.280> first<00:03:31.639> half<00:03:31.879> hour<00:03:32.120> passing

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
passes because first half hour passing

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.379 
passes because first half hour passing
was<00:03:32.870> dreadful<00:03:33.590> many<00:03:34.459> many<00:03:34.699> times<00:03:34.790> when<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.239> won

the ball but Matty's would win the ball
back<00:03:36.949> he<00:03:37.069> would<00:03:37.159> offload<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.639> to<00:03:37.759> a<00:03:37.790> player<00:03:38.060> and
