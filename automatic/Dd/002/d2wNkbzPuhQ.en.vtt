straight here that doesn't have a whole
lot<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.880> volume<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.360> might<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.689> better<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> blow

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
lot of volume it might be better to blow

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
lot of volume it might be better to blow
dry<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.100> give<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.520> extra<00:01:50.750> lift<00:01:51.750> and

then I go on I don't spend a lot of time
on<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.889> bottom<00:03:27.129> because<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.519> don't<00:03:27.699> really

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
on the bottom because you don't really

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
and then the top player I usually spend

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.990 
and then the top player I usually spend
a<00:04:14.799> little<00:04:14.949> bit<00:04:15.040> more<00:04:15.220> time<00:04:15.459> on<00:04:15.489> just<00:04:15.819> because

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
a little bit more time on just because

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.789 
a little bit more time on just because
it's<00:04:16.599> the<00:04:16.840> top<00:04:17.019> layer<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.380> that's<00:04:17.529> what<00:04:17.650> you

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799

see um

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.730 
see um
so<00:04:21.300> once<00:04:21.780> again<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.350> just<00:04:22.730> take<00:04:23.730> some<00:04:24.000> hair

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740
