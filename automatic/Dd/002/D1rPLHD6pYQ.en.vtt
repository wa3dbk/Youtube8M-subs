00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.760
 good years we will have 78 million 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.720
 classrooms maybe reaching a billion 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.250
 billion true or more change the 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.460
 way of teaching something 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.980
 wonderful that transforms in mind and you 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.190
 what do you tell us the product will become 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.890
 in something that fully suits 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.810
 personalized way to students and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.719
 in 10 years how do you think you are going to see 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.420
 this help good in 10 years we will return 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.130
 to see today and we will say 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.380
 what times those in which education 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.930
 it was not free where you could not 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.870
 learn everything you want in a way 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.790
 free and free online and of course 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.100
 which is personalized and of course 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.079
 the teachers will be using and it will be 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.880
 the way we all learned and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.649
 somehow it 's like when 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.899
 we turn back and in the time that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.000
 we did not have cell phones and we said 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.469
 how we would communicate or maybe in the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.140
 80s when there were no computers 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.840
 personal or use them and use the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.150
 good internet maybe then we think and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.140
 remember and all this technology but 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.600
 we were not useful 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 in the right way it becomes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.550
 obvious becomes obvious and you schalke 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.740
 you say good I was going to start saying 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.540
 that we were going to reach 100 million 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.119
 students but now I'm staying 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.250
 I can see that I am at the low level and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.470
 I am not so ambitious halt good but 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.570
 I will say that at least 100 million 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.060
 students around the world and in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.369
 all the most important languages ​​and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.009
 It will be a very broad experience 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.140
 enriching from arithmetic calculation 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.369
 algebra and it will also be an experience 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.770
 very deep 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.580
 using simulations in a way that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.369
 the teachers also explore 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.050
 interact with khan academy and get the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.090
 when we no longer have these 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.890
 classrooms without windows in which a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.600
 Professor attends 30 students and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 transform it into more open spaces 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.210
 where students pass, let's say 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.130
 20% of your time studying in so 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 academic and the rest of your time what 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.690
 devote to painting to build robots or 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.690
 maybe write movie scripts
