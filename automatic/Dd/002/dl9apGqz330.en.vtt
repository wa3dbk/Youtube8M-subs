00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.530
 essence of 69 horses or 1450 euros of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.509
 more than the classic its meaning with the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.079
 same equipment clim and gps between 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.009
 other 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.330
 but the little retro touch in more 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.480
 we love the full rims and the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.129
 pastel color fm to finish this is the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.900
 returned the first appointment of the 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.849
 season it's in melbourne australia 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.040
 but an official pilot misses the call 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.209
 it's fernando alonso so what is it 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.430
 arrived at the double world champion 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.180
 Spanish during the tests of Barcelona in 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.610
 last february 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.040
 retail review with jean louis moncet 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.269
 the respondent must advance because there is 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.420
 now a real inquiry 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.859
 so what we did not get well 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.180
 understand I take now we have to 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:43.450
 just as fernando was then or 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.769
 either with the discomfort or with a 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.540
 drop in tension as say 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.959
 modestly the spaniards before 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.030
 the accident 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.040
 because now in the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.349
 pilot headsets passed 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.540
 accelerometers accelerometers 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.209
 that it gives by sensors of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.099
 data on the position of the head and one 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.000
 uses it for security and 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.120
 know what happened 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.609
 this is where I did not check but he 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.889
 appears that the accelerometers of 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.409
 Fernando Alonso showed that his head 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.319
 was in very abnormal movements 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.000
 before the accident and before the accident 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.430
 also he was not in a position of 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.230
 defense and so we'll see now what 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.910
 who will arrive but what is sure 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.680
 also it is that the investigation that will go to 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.989
 its term it will probably take some 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.310
 time we probably will not have 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.730
 results right now but we'll have some 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.410
 results 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.299
 find all of this interview 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.430
 where our specialist also evokes the 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.560
 regulation 2015 and the specificities 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.660
