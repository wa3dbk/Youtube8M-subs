their<00:01:24.210> defensive<00:01:24.830> but<00:01:25.830> Sam<00:01:26.340> rocks<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.880> know

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
their defensive but Sam rocks you know

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
their defensive but Sam rocks you know
you<00:01:27.330> never<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> he's<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> hydro

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you never know and he's go for a hydro

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.280 
you never know and he's go for a hydro
pump<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:29.820> i<00:01:29.850> sees<00:01:30.030> life<00:01:30.329> org<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.659> substitute

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
pump when i sees life org and substitute

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950 
pump when i sees life org and substitute
so<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:32.060> don't<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.150> why<00:01:33.270> i<00:01:33.299> taunted<00:01:33.689> there<00:01:33.840> it's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
so i don't know why i taunted there it's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
so i don't know why i taunted there it's
probably<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.320> sheer<00:01:34.799> absolutes<00:01:35.610> massive

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
probably just sheer absolutes massive

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.719 
probably just sheer absolutes massive
stupidity<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> i<00:01:37.470> taunted<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.490> there

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
stupidity that i taunted right there

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.520 
stupidity that i taunted right there
probably<00:01:39.689> cuz<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.869> didn't<00:01:40.020> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> set<00:01:40.439> up

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
probably cuz I didn't want to set up

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740 
probably cuz I didn't want to set up
anything<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.850> again<00:01:41.970> what's<00:01:42.600> he<00:01:42.659> gonna

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
anything but then again what's he gonna

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
anything but then again what's he gonna
set<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.170> nasty<00:01:43.649> plots<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:43.979> whatever<00:01:44.399> so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I'm going to go out to yanmega because I

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230 
I'm going to go out to yanmega because I
want<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> break<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.220> substitute<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> can

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
want to break that substitute so I can

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.340 
want to break that substitute so I can
kill<00:01:48.420> them<00:01:48.479> off<00:01:48.600> before<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.020> gets<00:01:49.200> into

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
kill them off before it gets into

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499 
kill them off before it gets into
torrent<00:01:49.799> range<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> turn<00:01:51.299> does

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
torrent range and that you turn does

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389
