00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello friends with you mechanics and this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 This video is dedicated to this reactor. 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.380
 wonderful which gives record 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.309
 sena ac1900 her for tick exactly why 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.070
 the video is already on another channel and you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.760
 Followed the link and most likely the case 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.470
 that my old channel is thrown 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.430
 strikes I don't know how it could 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.580
 happen like the channel still know 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.969
 do you understand a weak small audience 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.180
 small and so that's blocked mines 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.670
 a lot of things in general now vidos will 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 going out on this channel so 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.040
 subscribe 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.090
 from that channel you can unsubscribe just 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.280
 they are anything 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.469
 warn in advance so well actually 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.199
 concerning 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.400
 the reactor and the circuit itself let me show 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.990
 you 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.300
 scheme itself for those who like those so 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.900
 say at all 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.180
 those monsters who want to collect it 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.330
 real in survival of course already be 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.980
 mega mega mega zadroty to collect 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 all this all these resources dig up and well 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.570
 to get could fuel required 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.410
 huge amount of time in this too 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.350
 need to forget 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.170
 the troops decided and suddenly the admin is all 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.930
 will be very fast so let's 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.619
 actual language fire up the reactor to give 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 you senate 1156 go for tick 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.250
 Of course this is not the limit I heated it all 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.040
 only up to 8000 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.410
 and it explodes at 10 thousand I did not 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.700
 warm more because i don't have here 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.470
 plugins that would nâ€™t blow my 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.480
 territories and burned blocks 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.970
 Well, in general, that's how I did not become much 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.160
 heat so it will give out all 20 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.750
 thousand and long lasting networks this is awesome 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.270
 energy and probably the best scheme and not 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.660
 come up find a tap force two 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.660
 experiment 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.150
 what else did you want to say 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.010
 we have a capacitor 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.670
 because as he quickly burns through more precisely the bottom 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.400
 sits down 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.230
 they have loads I what form I OZNA 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 talked about this lapis lazuli or redstone 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.629
 that's all let's turn off the reactor not 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.340
 It will poke a hole about risk 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.030
 there will be a ground 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.920
 and all my those old reactors are all to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.420
 damn mother so 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 actually let's see how much 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.140
 I gathered energy more than once 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.580
 let his actions 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.610
 it's the same 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:02.970
 18 million energy gathered for it 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:09.180
 of course a lot of energy is ours 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:12.110
 we send a team all the way Well Well it 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.930
 video probably came to an end to 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:21.770
 I renamed reactors 121 well top 20 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:27.390
 den it was like 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:29.910
 Development of the name is already so much so well, that 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.790
 it's time to say goodbye to you as always 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.840
 I was a mechanic subscribe to the channel 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.019
 leave your comments your ideas 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.019
 bye everyone
