00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.136
President Obama: It is a
great pleasure to once again

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.607
see my good friend President
Santos and his delegation.

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:10.176
You know, we've had
two occasions now that

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:14.347
(inaudible) and have so
appreciated the hospitality,

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:19.119
as well as the people there
and, more importantly,

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.020
the cooperation
between our countries,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.592
the friendship between our
countries has been producing

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:29.796
significant results, not
just for the United States

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.999
and Colombia with things
like our trade agreement,

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.770
but also regionally through
the joint participation in a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.940
number of issues and
challenges that we face.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.444
I want to congratulate
President Santos on his

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.714
extraordinary efforts to
bring about an end to a

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:52.819
conflict that has plagued
Colombia for too long.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.288
The United States is very
proud to support

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.623
that effort.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:00.393
Deployed an envoy
(inaudible) with deep

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:03.363
experience in the region to
be supportive of President

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.098
Santos's efforts.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.600
As you heard, many
of the (inaudible),

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.671
this is an issue that many
people care deeply about.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.176
It entails some risks, it's
hard; but President Santos,

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.877
I believe, is doing
the right thing.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:22.315
And we want to be as helpful
as we can in that process.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:25.785
I also want to congratulate
Colombia on what it's been

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.288
able to achieve
economically,

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.057
as well as with
respect to security.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:35.495
The United States, I think,
played an important role in

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.264
that process supporting
Colombia; although,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:42.001
ultimately, the progress
is due to the strength and

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.472
independent determination
of the Colombian people.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:49.642
So I look forward to hearing
more about your plan going

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.378
forward and appreciate
all the efforts of

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.180
your delegation.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.183
And I send my best wishes
to the people of Colombia.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.986
Thank you again for the
wonderful visits that I've

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:04.023
been able to have.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.193
President Santos: Thank you
very much, President Obama.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:10.163
It's a great pleasure
to see you again.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.931
The relations
between the U.S.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:17.270
and Colombia, I think,
are the best level ever.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.908
We are proud to be
considered your partner,

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:28.281
and we have been working
many forms and concentrated

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:33.786
on human rights,
violence, terrorism,

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:39.626
drugs, but today we have
a very, very rich agenda.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:44.130
Education, cooperation
and technology,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.801
sports -- you name
it, it's there.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.904
A very, very rich agenda.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:55.808
(inaudible) all
those issues,

00:02:55.808 --> 00:03:00.346
and very grateful for the
support you've given us

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.483
(inaudible) understood
since the very beginning.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:09.022
You would be informed of our
intentions and you've been

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:15.495
there with us from the very
beginning (inaudible) very

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:19.132
important, and the
importance of the special

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:24.337
category has a special
significance because that

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:29.108
means we've done the
whole process through

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.510
the hemisphere.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.149
So we continue to
have that support,

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:41.387
and in a way it's the cherry
on the cake (inaudible) that

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.924
we have been -- enjoy
(inaudible) in Colombia.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:48.094
And it's with great pleasure
and we're very successful

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:53.132
that we finish these
agreements and strengthen

00:03:53.132 --> 00:04:01.107
our democracy in the
best way possible.

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:07.880
I want to congratulate you
again for your courage in

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.753
taking a step to harmonize
relations with Cuba.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.755
And you've seen
in this summit,

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:21.828
it's the most important
event this would have a

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:25.298
great possible pressures in
the relations between North

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:29.369
America and Latin America
and the Caribbean.

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:36.009
I think everybody south of
Rio Grande has appreciated

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:43.616
this tremendous step and is
very enthusiastic about what

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.619
this could mean in the
future of our relations.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:50.490
So I hope that we can
continue to work together

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.125
the way we have
been working,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:05:01.100
and I look forward to our
conversations (inaudible).

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.602
Thank you.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.437
President Obama: Thank you.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.271
Thank you, everybody.
