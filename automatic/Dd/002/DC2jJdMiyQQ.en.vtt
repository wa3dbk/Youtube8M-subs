hit<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> nerve<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:18.630> me<00:00:18.869> recently<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.960> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
hit a nerve with me recently and the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990 
hit a nerve with me recently and the
reason<00:00:22.260> i<00:00:22.350> didn't<00:00:22.740> use<00:00:22.920> soaps<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.550> long<00:00:23.789> is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
reason i didn't use soaps of so long is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.630 
reason i didn't use soaps of so long is
that<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.449> used<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.260> drying<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.460> just

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
that they used to be so drying and just

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160 
that they used to be so drying and just
strip<00:00:27.029> everything<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:27.840> skin<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
strip everything out of your skin and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990 
strip everything out of your skin and
they<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.439> felt<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.099> horrible<00:00:29.369> after<00:00:29.760> you

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
they just felt really horrible after you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999 
they just felt really horrible after you
use<00:00:30.269> them<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.960> i<00:00:31.320> think<00:00:31.529> that's<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> reason

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
use them and i think that's the reason

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
use them and i think that's the reason
why<00:00:32.189> lots<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.759> younger<00:00:33.630> generation<00:00:34.110> people

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
why lots of younger generation people

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.630 
why lots of younger generation people
don't<00:00:34.590> use<00:00:34.829> them<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.489> those

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
don't use them because they have those

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
don't use them because they have those
horrible<00:00:35.969> memories<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> using<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.200> their

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
