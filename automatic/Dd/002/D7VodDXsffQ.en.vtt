00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hello to all readers Denis Wolves 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.820
 we are in a tournament in arms 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.090
 strictly speaking and organize now 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.540
 next to me is a team player brain about 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.160
 Alexander Zobkov files more 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.949
 known to you as yak Sasha hi kreyf 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.649
 but the experience is now 40 literally just 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.169
 answered the question rushed duma there he 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.699
 told about the most important 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.169
 moments on the game 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.369
 but let's still pass the whitet question 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.739
 Sash how are you the first match and what do you expect from 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.359
 of the game of the world of references 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.119
 first match 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.859
 in principle began quite badly for 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.500
 we have lost us but not much after the first 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.050
 strong bad bill was for us a visa 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.570
 which side to sell went 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.290
 issued not how much went 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.440
 and we began to recruit round gave easy and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 in principle, the game was easy enough 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 therefore, in principle, played a role 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760
 and about the upcoming match 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 but all countries 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700
 but 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.520
 there this time she 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 defeat the internet 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.720
 I think even the center should be a bit 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.720
 easier than we played on the Internet 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.000
 win how 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.750
 but it is really here except how you should 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.230
 it is very difficult to win here to say something 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.890
 everything is in principle aware of that 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.200
 what is in the composition of moscow in debt 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.650
 a series of such growth ryasah dates went away 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.670
 was returning 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.500
 and here about such question you here you 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 team after your return to feeling 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.350
 what's better than before and change the opposite 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.500
 send the other side 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.910
 that's wide 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.140
 can say a little better because i 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.910
 rested, in principle, yes 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.390
 from Igor, in principle, not less, they are guys 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.920
 rested channel after publication 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.020
 they were not pleased was not rest 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.620
 I, too, dahal so successful hour 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.280
 play 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.620
 I wonder how the world would 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.750
 start competitions all interesting 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.970
 how do you even think that those are 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.990
 dam situations but changes there 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.899
 sense of your inner they are in command 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.079
 are beneficial or they do the opposite 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.740
 resonance in life that do not need 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.090
 general composition 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.259
 m of Armenia in the draft amounted 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.869
 do you know when the team 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.039
 events do not concern the game 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.169
 and when there we are people for example quarrel 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.109
 each other and then he understand that 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.759
 understanding was very close to them and when 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.709
 they find him they come close very 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.969
 strongly but such are purely human 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.479
 score do you think it is plus or minus 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.389
 Probably on this plus district find common 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.269
 language is necessary 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.949
 even after forty patient 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.249
 life things 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.729
 how would you need to negotiate 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.349
 communicate with each other 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.689
 then nothing 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.529
 well yes to pass this moment in principle 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.309
 unrealistic but the price is a given tournament 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.719
 passes took place 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.089
 but very soon you have to find out 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:49.469
 relationships with all cis teams 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.329
 Anna I understand that ska that Moscow 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.569
 will win asus and aktoty take duct 3 someone 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.180
 he thinks your forecast you already have 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.299
 consider, therefore, the main struggle with 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.439
 by them 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.659
 of course we need another time 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.299
 lists Russia 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.159
 punish that we are the best 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.109
 on clear and threw out rush on 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.430
 a demonstration 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.259
 I think there are such mannarino 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.139
 we are able to get SR then 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.579
 there is but also but with no cracking to be in 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.289
 top three 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.019
 who is her 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.849
 he is there 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.429
 understandable and generally kept an eye on how 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.119
 right now play other teams are watching 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:31.229
 foam study learn make adapts to 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.969
 of them 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.499
 plants we arrange 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.409
 we try it academicians maybe 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.189
 what is the framework to remember the opponent 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.739
 and based on this weapon 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.319
 agree on the championship itself so 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.579
 we in advance 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.139
 direct claim in advance had no team 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.399
 tactics of something else 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.079
 and why 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.199
 why did they remember so yes 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.589
 Anna because already at the very championship 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.789
 a team can play differently 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:00.999
 you know how will the team plays the case 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.459
 give the union first then already hysteria 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.249
 let's say at least percent on 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.269
 seventy sure that the team will play here 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.409
 so then respect you something against her 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.149
 country music 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.419
 what do you think that's where you can get 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.779
 Generally such confidence 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.579
 for example if a team is in favor there 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.879
 a week before the championship show your game 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.599
 do you think she will play the same 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.619
 the tournament she completely change her tactics 

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:25.709
 commission for the segment we swing the tamper 

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:27.469
 where macao see that from five topics like 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:28.939
 they do the same thing most likely 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.240
 they dream to do the same 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.349
 therefore, based on such 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.979
 considerations can be thought because they 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.529
 do what not 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:39.909
 but it looks 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.990
 but you have it only begins 5 but here 

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.129
 right before the game you can sometimes download 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.259
 those who watch 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.539
 but all the same factor 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.849
 even if we draw an analogy there with us 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.430
 other word locomotive games 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.460
 DPS employee one of the key UAH 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.080
 moments why in Russia 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.720
 but I will not speak for other countries 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.040
 for some reason we have a team 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.650
 nor study their rivals in detail 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.990
 why not in detail 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.860
 You say that during the championship 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.839
 I wanted to associate first 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.469
 if we are ministries in 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.249
 principle everyone is known as the team plays 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:16.779
 measures of exposure there call 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.579
 there is little that they can show 

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:19.859
 natural monopolist 

00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:21.429
 additionally download the demo 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:22.259
 we'll see 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.039
 that there will be a new place but wash 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.850
 the menu is really because he 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.650
 I don't change much 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.740
 all the same 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.650
 strange all the same game players 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.059
 nothing serious will be there 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.929
 Well, thank you very much for the chance 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:39.809
 comprehensive answers at night 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:42.519
 Moscow in the big room I wish you 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:44.800
 good game vs. demand percentages 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.080
 Alexander Zobkov was right with us 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.759
 next can the best by the river 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:50.570
 hope laudrup
