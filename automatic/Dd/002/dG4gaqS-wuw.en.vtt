benchmark I gonna run today is this on

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:58.959 
benchmark I gonna run today is this on
to<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.880> benchmark

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.679 

well<00:03:59.969> we<00:04:00.180> have<00:04:00.299> got<00:04:00.599> 10,000<00:04:01.969> 602<00:04:02.969> which<00:04:03.510> is

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
well we have got 10,000 602 which is

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.809 
well we have got 10,000 602 which is
excellent<00:04:04.260> for<00:04:04.439> a<00:04:04.769> device<00:04:05.069> in<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.430> category

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
excellent for a device in this category

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.839 
excellent for a device in this category
the<00:04:06.810> average<00:04:07.019> result<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.950> galaxy<00:04:08.430> grand<00:04:08.639> is

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
the average result of galaxy grand is

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.069 
the average result of galaxy grand is
about<00:04:09.749> 6,000<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.889> 7,000<00:04:11.639> so<00:04:11.909> this<00:04:12.420> device<00:04:12.780> is

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
about 6,000 to 7,000 so this device is

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.349 
about 6,000 to 7,000 so this device is
much<00:04:13.829> better<00:04:14.099> than<00:04:14.219> galaxy<00:04:14.730> grand<00:04:14.939> in<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
much better than galaxy grand in the

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.659 
much better than galaxy grand in the
processing<00:04:15.840> power<00:04:16.019> segment<00:04:16.380> here<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.519> the

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
processing power segment here is the

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.729 
processing power segment here is the
breakup<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.239> as<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.720> can<00:04:18.870> see<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.320> 3d

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
breakup and as you can see this 3d

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.550 
breakup and as you can see this 3d
graphics<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.340> excellent<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:21.930> device<00:04:22.259> is

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560

a very powerful device and this is going
to<00:04:26.009> be<00:04:26.160> a<00:04:26.190> very<00:04:26.610> good<00:04:26.639> gaming<00:04:27.060> device<00:04:27.530> but

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
to be a very good gaming device but

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.339 
to be a very good gaming device but
still<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.220> price<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.699> this<00:04:29.910> device<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.630> below

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
still the price of this device is below

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.950 
still the price of this device is below
19<00:04:31.710> thousand<00:04:32.190> rupees<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.699> is<00:04:32.849> around<00:04:33.150> 350

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
19 thousand rupees that is around 350

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.400 
19 thousand rupees that is around 350
USD<00:04:34.410> at<00:04:34.560> launch<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.849> think<00:04:36.570> this<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:37.199> very
