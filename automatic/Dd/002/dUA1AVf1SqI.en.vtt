is<00:02:34.300> right<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.930> wrong<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.680> very

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
is right and this is wrong it's very

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.530 
is right and this is wrong it's very
situational<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.790> it's<00:02:36.940> much<00:02:37.180> more<00:02:37.390> difficult

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
situational so it's much more difficult

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.320 
situational so it's much more difficult
for<00:02:37.989> children<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.290> internalize<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:40.120> is

when<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.220> was<00:03:12.370> growing<00:03:12.549> about<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> can

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
when I was growing about that I can

fights<00:03:26.560> were<00:03:26.739> involved<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.310> whatever<00:03:27.519> or<00:03:27.790> not

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
fights were involved and whatever or not

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.599 
fights were involved and whatever or not
this<00:03:28.329> is<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:29.170> much<00:03:29.319> better<00:03:29.590> for<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.400> learn

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
this is so much better for and to learn

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.039 
this is so much better for and to learn
the<00:03:30.910> process<00:03:31.859> after<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.540> we<00:03:34.690> went<00:03:34.900> back

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
the process after on that we went back

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.280 
the process after on that we went back
to<00:03:35.230> our<00:03:35.260> classroom<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.450> we<00:03:37.450> actually<00:03:37.930> made<00:03:38.140> up

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
to our classroom and we actually made up

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.949 
to our classroom and we actually made up
a<00:03:38.410> sign<00:03:38.709> if<00:03:39.700> we<00:03:39.910> didn't<00:03:40.180> want<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.390> talk<00:03:40.569> to<00:03:40.630> them

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
a sign if we didn't want to talk to them

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.190 
a sign if we didn't want to talk to them
because<00:03:41.170> you<00:03:41.319> were<00:03:41.500> too<00:03:41.680> mad<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.870> every

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
because you were too mad and so every

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870 
because you were too mad and so every
time<00:03:44.380> we<00:03:44.620> don't<00:03:44.799> really<00:03:44.980> want<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.430> talk<00:03:45.639> to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
time we don't really want to talk to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.840 
time we don't really want to talk to
them<00:03:46.170> they<00:03:47.170> we<00:03:47.590> make<00:03:47.799> up<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.160> sign<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.549> goes<00:03:48.670> like

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
them they we make up a sign it goes like

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.840 
them they we make up a sign it goes like
that<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.709> think<00:03:50.709> if<00:03:50.859> we're<00:03:51.069> careful<00:03:51.370> about

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
that I think if we're careful about

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.830 
that I think if we're careful about
training<00:03:52.269> children<00:03:52.959> at<00:03:53.799> an<00:03:54.280> early<00:03:54.700> age<00:03:54.840> in

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
training children at an early age in

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.539 
training children at an early age in
