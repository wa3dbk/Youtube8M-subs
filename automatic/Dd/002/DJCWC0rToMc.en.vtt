00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.370 
of our knives have the titanium bonded
passivation<00:01:43.299> they<00:01:43.600> have<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:43.719> fifth<00:01:44.020> tang<00:01:44.259> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
passivation they have a fifth tang the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.440 
passivation they have a fifth tang the
polycarbonate<00:01:45.009> handle<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.729> even<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.149> CUDA

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
polycarbonate handle and even the CUDA

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.020 
polycarbonate handle and even the CUDA
grips<00:01:46.719> are<00:01:47.319> duplicated<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.280> all<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.789> water

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
grips are duplicated so all the water

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.359 
grips are duplicated so all the water
can<00:01:49.810> channel<00:01:50.109> outside<00:01:50.709> of<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:50.950> blood<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.310> the

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
can channel outside of the blood and the

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.399 
can channel outside of the blood and the
guts<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:51.759> keep<00:01:51.939> your<00:01:52.090> handle<00:01:52.479> nice<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.140> cool

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
worldwide patent pending and so we're

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.030 
worldwide patent pending and so we're
very<00:02:21.910> excited<00:02:22.329> about<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:23.049> we<00:02:23.650> also<00:02:23.829> have<00:02:24.160> our

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
very excited about it we also have our

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.559 
very excited about it we also have our
gripping<00:02:27.040> way<00:02:27.160> here<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.790> gripping<00:02:28.150> way<00:02:28.269> is

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
gripping way here the gripping way is

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.690 
gripping way here the gripping way is
all<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> titanium<00:02:29.349> alloy<00:02:29.709> construction<00:02:30.310> so

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
all a titanium alloy construction so

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.789 
all a titanium alloy construction so
it's<00:02:30.849> super<00:02:31.150> lightweight<00:02:31.329> it's<00:02:32.140> adjustable

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
it's super lightweight it's adjustable

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.259 
it's super lightweight it's adjustable
and<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.310> sync<00:02:34.269> up<00:02:34.420> your<00:02:34.480> exact<00:02:35.849> way<00:02:36.849> this

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
and you can sync up your exact way this

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.430 
and you can sync up your exact way this
is<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> 50-pound

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
is a 50-pound

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.280 
is a 50-pound
scale<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.519> see<00:02:39.549> here<00:02:39.940> kilogram<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.019> in

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
scale you can see here kilogram and in

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.830 
scale you can see here kilogram and in
pounds<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.889> again<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.730> all<00:02:43.030> aluminum<00:02:43.450> with

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
pounds and again it's all aluminum with

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.690 
pounds and again it's all aluminum with
possible<00:02:44.230> nylon<00:02:44.709> what's<00:02:45.099> also<00:02:45.310> great<00:02:45.579> about

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
possible nylon what's also great about

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.659 
possible nylon what's also great about
this<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.510> both<00:02:46.870> jaws<00:02:47.290> open<00:02:47.950> instead<00:02:48.519> of

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
this is that both jaws open instead of

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.430 
this is that both jaws open instead of
having<00:02:48.819> one<00:02:49.150> fix<00:02:49.419> like<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> lot<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.290> other

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
having one fix like a lot of the other

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.800 
having one fix like a lot of the other
ones<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.430> easier<00:02:51.790> fix<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.359> on<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
ones and so it's easier fix on on the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.300 
ones and so it's easier fix on on the
lip<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:53.470> pulls<00:02:53.680> right<00:02:53.829> out<00:02:53.889> and<00:02:54.130> again

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
lip and then pulls right out and again

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.059 
lip and then pulls right out and again
you<00:02:54.459> get<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.609> 50

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
you get a 50

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.670 
you get a 50
pound<00:02:55.219> scale<00:02:56.060> integrated<00:02:56.569> into<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.530> last

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
pound scale integrated into it the last

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.020 
pound scale integrated into it the last
thing<00:02:57.920> I'll<00:02:58.040> show<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.310> which<00:02:58.849> is<00:02:58.879> really

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
thing I'll show you which is really

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.970 
thing I'll show you which is really
great<00:02:59.569> is<00:03:00.530> we<00:03:00.709> have<00:03:00.829> two<00:03:00.950> different

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
great is we have two different

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.489 
great is we have two different
sharpeners<00:03:01.670> once<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.359> pocket<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.139> gives<00:03:03.349> you

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:03.499 
sharpeners once a pocket it gives you

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:04.899 
sharpeners once a pocket it gives you
three<00:03:03.739> different<00:03:04.069> types<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.430> scissors<00:03:04.730> and

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
three different types of scissors and

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.670 
three different types of scissors and
shears<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.239> serrated<00:03:05.659> blade<00:03:05.810> sharpener<00:03:06.469> a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
shears a serrated blade sharpener a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.229 
shears a serrated blade sharpener a
straightedge<00:03:07.189> both<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.730> ceramic<00:03:08.090> and

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
straightedge both and ceramic and

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.979 
straightedge both and ceramic and
carbide<00:03:08.719> it<00:03:09.139> gives<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.409> all<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.799> T
