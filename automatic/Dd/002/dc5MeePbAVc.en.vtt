00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
strand and it won't break so that's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.279 
strand and it won't break so that's
because<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> cuticles<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.239> cuticles<00:00:57.899> are

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
because of the cuticles the cuticles are

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.090 
because of the cuticles the cuticles are
the<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.460> spikes<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.660> Petrak<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.859> pokes

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the little spikes that Petrak that pokes

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.920 
the little spikes that Petrak that pokes
little<00:01:02.879> spikes<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.930> protect<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.850> inside<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
little spikes that protect the inside of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.039 
little spikes that protect the inside of
the<00:01:07.530> strand<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> hair<00:01:08.360> cuticle<00:01:09.360> has<00:01:09.600> spikes

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the strand of hair cuticle has spikes

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.880 
the strand of hair cuticle has spikes
that<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:12.900> flow<00:01:13.409> down

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that go like this and they all flow down

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.870 
that go like this and they all flow down
on<00:01:14.310> any<00:01:14.790> hair<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.020> cuticles<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:17.070> virgin<00:01:17.610> hair

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
on any hair the cuticles any virgin hair

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050 
on any hair the cuticles any virgin hair
the<00:01:18.180> cuticles<00:01:18.659> flows<00:01:19.110> straight<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.490> one

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the cuticles flows straight down in one

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.859 
the cuticles flows straight down in one
direction<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> when<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.009> ventilate<00:01:23.570> we<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
direction so when we ventilate we have

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.710 
direction so when we ventilate we have
to<00:01:25.140> loop<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.490> hair<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.850> order<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> ventilate

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to loop the hair in order to ventilate

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.230 
to loop the hair in order to ventilate
right<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> take<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> hair<00:01:29.030> we<00:01:30.030> have

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
right we have to take the hair we have

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.190 
right we have to take the hair we have
to<00:01:30.420> loop<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.210> gives<00:01:33.689> us<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to loop it like this so that gives us a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.980 
to loop it like this so that gives us a
return<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.250> too<00:01:35.490> much<00:01:35.640> return<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:36.689> instead

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
return a too much return so now instead

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.609 
return a too much return so now instead
of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> hair<00:01:37.680> flowing<00:01:38.009> straight<00:01:38.700> down

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
of the hair flowing straight down

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.170 
of the hair flowing straight down
instead<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> cuticle<00:01:41.310> flowing<00:01:41.880> straight

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
instead of the cuticle flowing straight

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.870 
instead of the cuticle flowing straight
down<00:01:42.600> we're<00:01:43.500> looping<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.670> have

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
down we're looping it so we have

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.859 
down we're looping it so we have
cuticles<00:01:45.649> flowing<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:47.000> this<00:01:48.000> direction<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
cuticles flowing up this direction and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.850 
cuticles flowing up this direction and
down<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.530> direction<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:50.970> following

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
down this direction so are we following

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
down this direction so are we following
we<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.070> straight<00:01:53.460> hair<00:01:54.350> cuticles<00:01:55.350> are<00:01:55.439> all

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
we have straight hair cuticles are all

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.280 
we have straight hair cuticles are all
flowing<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.189> direction<00:01:56.719> so<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:58.020> loop<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
flowing in one direction so we loop the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
flowing in one direction so we loop the
hair<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.890> ventilate<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.850> have

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
hair to ventilate so now we have

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.520 
hair to ventilate so now we have
cuticles<00:02:00.750> flowing<00:02:01.590> down<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.549> flowing<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.530> so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
cuticles flowing down and flowing up so

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.490 
cuticles flowing down and flowing up so
that<00:02:04.979> causes<00:02:05.280> friction<00:02:05.790> those<00:02:06.750> little<00:02:07.200> spikes

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that causes friction those little spikes

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
that causes friction those little spikes
they<00:02:08.250> rub<00:02:08.789> against<00:02:09.330> each<00:02:09.509> other<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> they

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
they rub against each other and they

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.480 
they rub against each other and they
cause<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.560> hair<00:02:11.099> to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
cause the hair to

cause the hair to

beautiful and nice but the hair strand
is<00:02:25.020> more<00:02:25.650> thick<00:02:25.980> than<00:02:26.010> any<00:02:26.610> other<00:02:26.880> hair<00:02:27.210> strand

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
is more thick than any other hair strand

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.020 
is more thick than any other hair strand
I<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.930> ever<00:02:28.170> seen<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.490> were<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.700> put

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
I have ever seen and if I were to put

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.410 
I have ever seen and if I were to put
this<00:02:30.240> under<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.830> microscope<00:02:31.830> if<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.910> would<00:02:33.090> take

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this under a microscope if I would take

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.440 
this under a microscope if I would take
this<00:02:33.690> hair<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.550> int<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.610> hair<00:02:35.820> strand<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.330> put

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
this hair and int in hair strand and put

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.990 
this hair and int in hair strand and put
it<00:02:36.540> under<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> microscope<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:38.340> would<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
it under a microscope you would see the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.750 
it under a microscope you would see the
difference<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.960> size<00:02:40.200> well<00:02:41.190> anyway<00:02:41.490> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
difference in the size well anyway so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.690 
difference in the size well anyway so
the<00:02:42.420> spikes<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.590> cuticles<00:02:44.100> other<00:02:44.460> are

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the spikes of the cuticles other are

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.940 
the spikes of the cuticles other are
juni<00:02:45.090> hair<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.630> pretty<00:02:48.260> there<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:49.590> there

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
juni hair is pretty there there there

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.890 
juni hair is pretty there there there
there<00:02:50.160> they<00:02:50.700> caused<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> lot<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.270> friction<00:02:51.510> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
there they caused a lot of friction and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.410 
there they caused a lot of friction and
they<00:02:52.020> cause<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.440> hair<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.970> matte<00:02:53.970> together

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
they cause the hair to matte together

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.250 
they cause the hair to matte together
and<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.590> tried<00:02:56.180> cutting<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> returns<00:02:57.780> and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and I have tried cutting the returns and

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.040 
and I have tried cutting the returns and
I<00:02:58.890> don't<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.850> cutting<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.360> returns<00:03:00.780> because

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
I don't like cutting the returns because

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.810 
I don't like cutting the returns because
what<00:03:01.380> happens<00:03:01.800> when<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.100> cut<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> returns

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
what happens when you cut the returns

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.960 
what happens when you cut the returns
you<00:03:03.060> get<00:03:03.270> little<00:03:04.080> spikes<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.220> stick<00:03:05.550> out<00:03:05.760> and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you get little spikes that stick out and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.820 
you get little spikes that stick out and
I<00:03:06.060> can't<00:03:06.360> cut<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.750> returns<00:03:07.110> all<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.560> way

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
I can't cut the returns all the way

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.420 
I can't cut the returns all the way
close<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.550> net<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:10.350> course<00:03:11.130> from

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
close to the net because of course from

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.690 
close to the net because of course from
washing<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.870> know<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.530> knots<00:03:13.740> may<00:03:14.040> loosen<00:03:14.520> up

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
washing you know the knots may loosen up

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.930 
washing you know the knots may loosen up
and<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.840> won't<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.920> long<00:03:17.370> return

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
and then it won't have that long return

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.120 
and then it won't have that long return
to<00:03:18.210> keep<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.600> place<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.110> they'll<00:03:19.440> slip<00:03:19.770> so

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
to keep it in place so they'll slip so

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.650 
to keep it in place so they'll slip so
you'll<00:03:20.280> end<00:03:20.520> up<00:03:20.670> with<00:03:20.730> little<00:03:21.090> holes<00:03:21.270> and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
you'll end up with little holes and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.800 
you'll end up with little holes and
trust<00:03:22.230> me<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.680> messed<00:03:22.920> up<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.550> lot<00:03:24.270> of<00:03:24.330> my

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
trust me I have messed up a lot of my

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.860 
trust me I have messed up a lot of my
frontals<00:03:25.740> because<00:03:26.160> Indian<00:03:26.640> hair<00:03:26.880> does<00:03:27.180> kind

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
frontals because Indian hair does kind

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.190

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
keep it straight and keep keep it from

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.420 
keep it straight and keep keep it from
puffing<00:03:36.000> up<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.320> what<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.560> wanted<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.100> show<00:03:38.370> you

puffing up so what I wanted to show you

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.920 
puffing up so what I wanted to show you
is<00:03:39.980> what<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.160> our<00:03:41.280> juni<00:03:41.670> hair<00:03:41.970> looks<00:03:42.270> like<00:03:42.630> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
is what the our juni hair looks like the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.100 
is what the our juni hair looks like the
curl<00:03:43.260> pattern<00:03:43.460> when<00:03:44.460> I<00:03:44.790> relaxed<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> roots

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
curl pattern when I relaxed the roots

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.520 
curl pattern when I relaxed the roots
and<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:47.610> want<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.910> see<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.690> can<00:03:48.990> tell<00:03:49.260> me<00:03:49.500> the

and I want to see if you can tell me the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.260 
and I want to see if you can tell me the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
difference if you can tell me which

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.470 
difference if you can tell me which
one's<00:03:51.600> relaxed<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.710> which<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:54.060> not

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.070 

so<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.690> already<00:04:01.050> I<00:04:01.200> do<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:01.980> sections<00:04:02.280> I'm

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
so it already I do it in sections I'm

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.140 
so it already I do it in sections I'm
sweating<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:05.300> right<00:04:06.300> here<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.989> have<00:04:07.370> one<00:04:08.370> set<00:04:08.790> of

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
sweating so right here I have one set of

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.280 
sweating so right here I have one set of
our<00:04:09.480> Ginny<00:04:09.780> hair<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.440> has<00:04:10.650> been<00:04:10.700> relaxed<00:04:11.700> and

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
our Ginny hair that has been relaxed and

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.409 
our Ginny hair that has been relaxed and
one<00:04:13.290> set<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:14.069> has<00:04:14.370> been<00:04:16.489> can<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.519> tell<00:04:18.120> me

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
one set that has been can you tell me

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.670 
one set that has been can you tell me
which<00:04:19.019> one<00:04:19.380> has<00:04:19.829> been<00:04:20.220> relaxed<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.380> which<00:04:22.380> one

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
which one has been relaxed and which one

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.550 
which one has been relaxed and which one
has<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.970> length<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.450> hair<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:25.050> 10<00:04:25.380> to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
has it the length of the hair is 10 to

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.120 
has it the length of the hair is 10 to
12<00:04:25.889> and<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.220> believe<00:04:26.550> 14<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.510> 16<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:30.620> if<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.860> pull

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
12 and I believe 14 to 16 so if I pull

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.090 
12 and I believe 14 to 16 so if I pull
it<00:04:32.280> really<00:04:32.520> really<00:04:32.910> close<00:04:33.330> then<00:04:34.020> I'm<00:04:34.290> sure<00:04:34.620> you

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
it really really close then I'm sure you

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.629 
it really really close then I'm sure you
can<00:04:35.310> probably<00:04:35.960> see<00:04:36.960> which<00:04:37.380> has<00:04:37.650> been<00:04:37.950> relaxed

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
can probably see which has been relaxed

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.020 
can probably see which has been relaxed
and<00:04:39.000> which<00:04:39.540> has<00:04:39.810> not<00:04:40.080> been<00:04:40.320> realized<00:04:40.820> so<00:04:41.820> when

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
and which has not been realized so when

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.280 
and which has not been realized so when
I<00:04:42.060> relaxed<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:43.200> am<00:04:43.580> relaxing<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:45.000> hair<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.660> half

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
I relaxed I am relaxing the hair a half

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.080 
I relaxed I am relaxing the hair a half
an<00:04:46.560> inch<00:04:46.770> from<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.930> web<00:04:49.139> so<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.760> lay<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.910> out<00:04:51.030> on

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
an inch from the web so I lay it out on

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.700 
an inch from the web so I lay it out on
a<00:04:51.450> plastic<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.760> then<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:54.090> put<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.990> have<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.320> little

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
a plastic and then I put I have a little

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.940 
a plastic and then I put I have a little
makeup<00:04:56.130> brush<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.639> use<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.780> relax<00:04:58.260> one

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
makeup brush that I use and I relax one

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.230 
makeup brush that I use and I relax one
half<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:01.380> relax<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.889> edges<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.820> ends

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
half just to relax the edges the ends

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.890 
half just to relax the edges the ends
because<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:04.380> ends<00:05:04.830> is<00:05:04.979> where<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.460> spiking

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
because the ends is where the spiking

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.680 
because the ends is where the spiking
usually<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.470> friction<00:05:07.919> usually<00:05:08.340> occurs<00:05:08.729> so

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
usually the friction usually occurs so

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.500 
usually the friction usually occurs so
can<00:05:10.169> you<00:05:10.560> tell<00:05:11.550> me<00:05:12.500> this<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.800> my<00:05:14.130> left<00:05:14.970> this

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
can you tell me this is a my left this

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.590 
can you tell me this is a my left this
is<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.750> my<00:05:16.080> right

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
is a my right

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.800 
is a my right
look<00:05:18.600> at<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> curl<00:05:19.260> pattern<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.389> hold<00:05:21.630> them

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
look at the curl pattern and I hold them

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.219 
look at the curl pattern and I hold them
up<00:05:21.960> exactly<00:05:22.740> next<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.130> each<00:05:23.400> other<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.930> curl

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
up exactly next to each other the curl

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.370 
up exactly next to each other the curl
has<00:05:25.620> loosened<00:05:26.250> up<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.910> bit<00:05:26.940> so<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.630> course<00:05:27.870> this

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
has loosened up a bit so of course this

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.790 
has loosened up a bit so of course this
is<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:29.729> relaxed<00:05:30.510> are<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.380> knee

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
is the relaxed are to knee

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.629 
is the relaxed are to knee
this<00:05:32.550> has<00:05:33.210> not<00:05:33.539> so<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.320> length<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.830> again<00:05:35.190> or

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
this has not so the length is again or

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.820 
this has not so the length is again or
10<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.330> 12<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:37.169> believe<00:05:38.010> in<00:05:38.280> 14<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:39.090> 16<00:05:39.510> so<00:05:40.500> this

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
10 to 12 I believe in 14 to 16 so this

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.520 
10 to 12 I believe in 14 to 16 so this
is<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.250> difference<00:05:41.820> in<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.870> length<00:05:43.229> of

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
is the difference in the length of

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:51.560 
is the difference in the length of
relaxed<00:05:44.660> so<00:05:48.260> in<00:05:49.260> order<00:05:50.250> for<00:05:50.400> me<00:05:50.729> to<00:05:50.760> ventilate

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
relaxed so in order for me to ventilate

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.430 
relaxed so in order for me to ventilate
with<00:05:52.169> your<00:05:52.470> are<00:05:52.680> Jimi<00:05:53.010> hair<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.960> have<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.260> do

I can't make closures for you so now
anyone<00:06:02.910> that<00:06:03.479> wants<00:06:04.139> a<00:06:04.349> closure<00:06:04.770> made<00:06:05.220> or<00:06:05.580> wig

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
anyone that wants a closure made or wig

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.100 
anyone that wants a closure made or wig

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
made with our joonie hair you

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.020 
made with our joonie hair you
are<00:06:09.440> going<00:06:09.710> to<00:06:09.800> be<00:06:09.890> directed<00:06:10.400> to<00:06:10.520> this<00:06:10.670> video

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
are going to be directed to this video

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.290 
are going to be directed to this video
so<00:06:11.990> you<00:06:12.080> can<00:06:12.500> see<00:06:12.860> what<00:06:13.430> your<00:06:13.730> relaxed<00:06:14.270> hair

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
so you can see what your relaxed hair

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.220 
so you can see what your relaxed hair
looks<00:06:15.200> like<00:06:15.550> because<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.580> lot<00:06:16.880> of<00:06:16.910> you<00:06:17.300> say<00:06:17.870> oh

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
looks like because a lot of you say oh

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.170 
looks like because a lot of you say oh
well<00:06:18.830> what<00:06:18.980> about<00:06:19.220> the<00:06:19.340> curl<00:06:19.640> what<00:06:19.760> happens<00:06:20.090> to

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
well what about the curl what happens to

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.510 
well what about the curl what happens to
the<00:06:20.300> curl<00:06:20.510> the<00:06:20.870> curl<00:06:21.170> still<00:06:21.560> there<00:06:21.890> but<00:06:22.310> it's

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
the curl the curl still there but it's

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.590 
the curl the curl still there but it's
not<00:06:22.790> as<00:06:23.120> tight<00:06:23.750> it<00:06:24.650> does<00:06:25.100> loosen<00:06:25.850> a<00:06:26.000> little<00:06:26.390> bit

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
not as tight it does loosen a little bit

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.410 
not as tight it does loosen a little bit
this<00:06:27.050> is<00:06:27.380> relaxed<00:06:28.280> you<00:06:28.700> can<00:06:28.730> see<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.240> at<00:06:29.390> the

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
this is relaxed you can see the at the

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.830 
this is relaxed you can see the at the
end<00:06:29.720> is<00:06:30.260> pretty<00:06:30.650> straight<00:06:31.160> and<00:06:31.550> then<00:06:32.540> you<00:06:32.660> can

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
end is pretty straight and then you can

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.800 
end is pretty straight and then you can
see<00:06:33.020> the<00:06:33.140> end<00:06:33.320> of<00:06:33.560> that<00:06:33.620> this<00:06:34.520> is<00:06:34.730> not<00:06:34.940> relaxed

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
see the end of that this is not relaxed

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.650 
see the end of that this is not relaxed
so<00:06:36.140> you<00:06:36.200> see<00:06:36.470> that<00:06:36.620> curl<00:06:36.980> that<00:06:37.250> loop<00:06:37.550> right<00:06:38.480> up

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
so you see that curl that loop right up

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.410 
so you see that curl that loop right up
to<00:06:38.840> the<00:06:38.990> net<00:06:39.230> that<00:06:39.980> is<00:06:40.190> that<00:06:40.400> first<00:06:40.730> curl<00:06:41.150> that

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
to the net that is that first curl that

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.530 
to the net that is that first curl that
I'm<00:06:41.600> trying<00:06:41.960> to<00:06:42.080> get<00:06:42.260> rid<00:06:42.470> of<00:06:42.940> I'm<00:06:43.940> trying<00:06:44.420> to

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
I'm trying to get rid of I'm trying to

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:54.700 
I'm trying to get rid of I'm trying to
take<00:06:44.780> out<00:06:47.170> okay<00:06:48.310> relaxed<00:06:49.310> not<00:06:50.320> relaxed<00:06:53.710> okay

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
take out okay relaxed not relaxed okay

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.750 
take out okay relaxed not relaxed okay
so<00:06:55.130> if<00:06:55.250> you<00:06:55.370> have<00:06:55.520> any<00:06:55.700> questions<00:06:56.350> arguments
