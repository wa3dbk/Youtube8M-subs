00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
and you took as much drowns as their

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.840 
and you took as much drowns as their
athletes<00:05:01.900> taught<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:02.410> trained<00:05:02.830> as<00:05:03.010> hard<00:05:03.280> we

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
athletes taught and trained as hard we

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.820 
athletes taught and trained as hard we
might<00:05:04.030> be<00:05:04.120> up<00:05:04.210> there<00:05:04.360> as<00:05:04.510> well<00:05:04.690> but<00:05:05.320> we<00:05:05.440> didn't

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
might be up there as well but we didn't

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.050 
might be up there as well but we didn't
because<00:05:05.980> we<00:05:06.100> didn't<00:05:06.520> know<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.820> we<00:05:06.910> do

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
because we didn't know and we do

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.880 
because we didn't know and we do
probably<00:05:07.210> wouldn't<00:05:07.570> do<00:05:07.660> that<00:05:07.690> because<00:05:08.530> most

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
probably wouldn't do that because most

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.470 
probably wouldn't do that because most
the<00:05:09.250> reality<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:09.700> if<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:09.910> want<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.180> be<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.270> top

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
the reality is if you want to be a top

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.890 
the reality is if you want to be a top
level<00:05:10.630> athlete<00:05:11.170> top<00:05:12.070> level<00:05:13.000> then<00:05:13.510> you<00:05:13.630> have<00:05:13.810> to

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
level athlete top level then you have to

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.980 
level athlete top level then you have to
take<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:14.380> much<00:05:14.500> fucking<00:05:14.770> EPO<00:05:15.660> you're<00:05:16.660> risking

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
take so much fucking EPO you're risking

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.320 
take so much fucking EPO you're risking
the<00:05:17.020> blood<00:05:17.290> clot<00:05:17.560> any<00:05:17.800> moment<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.280> day<00:05:18.430> yes

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
the blood clot any moment the day yes

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.730 
the blood clot any moment the day yes
new<00:05:19.480> blood<00:05:19.690> test<00:05:19.960> every<00:05:20.170> fucking<00:05:20.560> data

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
new blood test every fucking data

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.960 
new blood test every fucking data
checking<00:05:21.010> matter<00:05:21.310> crew<00:05:21.490> doesn't<00:05:21.670> get<00:05:21.820> too

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
checking matter crew doesn't get too

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.450 
checking matter crew doesn't get too
high<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:22.660> get<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:22.840> fucking<00:05:23.110> stroke<00:05:23.590> even<00:05:24.310> though

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
high so get a fucking stroke even though

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.650 
high so get a fucking stroke even though
you're<00:05:24.640> fit<00:05:25.120> as<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.270> fiddle

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
you're fit as a fiddle

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.810 
you're fit as a fiddle
so<00:05:26.590> that's<00:05:26.770> reality<00:05:26.980> most<00:05:27.310> of<00:05:27.400> us<00:05:27.490> wouldn't<00:05:27.700> do

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
so that's reality most of us wouldn't do

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.250 
so that's reality most of us wouldn't do
the<00:05:27.910> drugs<00:05:28.150> or<00:05:28.330> tanks<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.750> get<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.080> level

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
the drugs or tanks to get to that level

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.590 
the drugs or tanks to get to that level
and<00:05:29.670> why<00:05:30.670> don't<00:05:30.730> we<00:05:30.940> make<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.240> more<00:05:31.330> clear<00:05:31.480> on

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
and why don't we make it more clear on

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.850 
and why don't we make it more clear on
that<00:05:31.720> why<00:05:31.990> don't<00:05:32.050> we<00:05:32.350> just<00:05:32.500> make<00:05:32.620> an<00:05:32.740> Olympic
