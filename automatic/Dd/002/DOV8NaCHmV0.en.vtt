00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.250 
watching what neck would you use the
card<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.890> better<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.340> honest<00:02:53.790> though

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
card in it better be honest though

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.510 
card in it better be honest though
alright<00:02:55.260> yeah<00:02:55.770> though<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.950> really<00:02:56.220> think

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
alright yeah though I really think

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.820 
alright yeah though I really think
though<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:57.090> very<00:02:57.390> good<00:02:58.230> card<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.800> think

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
though it's a very good card I think

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.380 
though it's a very good card I think
it's<00:02:59.220> pretty<00:02:59.520> well-balanced<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.120> mean<00:03:00.270> it's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
it's pretty well-balanced I mean it's

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.030 
it's pretty well-balanced I mean it's
not<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.570> generic<00:03:00.900> card<00:03:01.200> either<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.830> seems

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
not a generic card either so it seems

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.010 
not a generic card either so it seems
really<00:03:02.220> balanced<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.180> cannot<00:03:03.480> wait<00:03:03.840> until

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
really balanced and I cannot wait until

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.750 
really balanced and I cannot wait until
