00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.460
 if for you soy is reserved for the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.930
 Asian vegetarian cuisine you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.099
 see that we can use it in a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.920
 traditional menu 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.960
 we start with the entry I will you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.719
 prepare a Chinese cabbage salad 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.380
 also called p of sai with 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.250
 the lawyer and then we will use soy 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.949
 which is actually called cho oyu for 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 to make an Asian vinaigrette 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 to make this cabbage salad 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.599
 Chinese and lawyers we need a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.239
 Chinese cabbage heart 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.460
 a spoonful avocado sauce 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.620
 soy a tablespoon of olive oil 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 sesame 2 tablespoons oil of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.329
 rapeseed half a lemon juice a spoon 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.390
 of gomasio and finally the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.370
 fresh coriander 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 so let's go first is thin and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.539
 the cabbage creed is cut off the lawyer in 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.420
 dice to prevent the lawyer 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.739
 oxidizes arrow that of lemon juice 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.370
 then put the two foods in one 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.440
 bowl 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 finally last step carried out the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 vinaigrette we will put spoon of 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.330
 show you a sesame spoon and two 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.549
 spoons of rapeseed 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.960
 so in fact in this vinaigrette the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.000
 soy will replace vinegar 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 in addition to his room and sauce neck 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 soy a nutritional interest 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.200
 it contains a vitamin that can be 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.880
 interesting for vegetarians under 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.430
 vegans because this famous 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 vitamin b12 it is usually found that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.570
 in animal products 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.430
 cover the cabbage and avocado with this unique 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
 rest then add coriander china 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.060
 threatened and finally sprinkled with 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.369
 which is to say seeds of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.590
 grilled sesame and that's your room to 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.539
 determine 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.560
 following the menu of carbonara pasta 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:45.890
 plants will be used instead of 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.840
 traditional bacon smoked tofu and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.380
 then in the place of the traditional 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.909
 cream of soy cream for 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.369
 cook the twists of spelled 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.520
 at the plant carbonara we need 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.969
 250 g of twists two shots of leeks 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.189
 100 g of a back smoke shallot 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.439
 soy cream brick kitchen and finally 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.539
 chives 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:13.130
 for starters I will peel and 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.720
 mince 7 shallots, cut next 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.819
 top dong then put them in a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.319
 pan with a drizzle of olive oil and 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.540
 cook for five 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.890
 minutes 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.660
 put the small twists and lay 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.060
 in a pan of simmering water 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.099
 finally cut the tofu but in small 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.069
 slats and unlike the bacon of 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.560
 tofu has many benefits need to know 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.150
 that soy in general contains up 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.290
 almost 40% protein 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.379
 so it's true that it's a contribution of 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.639
 protein that is even superior to 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:47.030
 some meat and fish and especially 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:48.500
 it does not contain so-called saturated fat 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.609
 who are the fats we will find in 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.880
 meat and in products 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.489
 but unsaturated fats 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.700
 the famous omega 3 so I'm going 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:03.709
 add the small bacon tofu the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.349
 soy cream that warrants that will get 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.269
 substitute for fresh cream 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.459
 there are more and more people who have 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.500
 problems of intolerance with 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.180
 dairy products and suddenly soy 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.310
 contains neither one nor the other 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.900
 it only remains to add this 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.790
 hop twist preparation of small 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.389
 spelled with some brakes 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.250
 chive 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:27.010
 mix and thighs tic 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.520
 we are going to finish with a mousse 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.080
 silky tofu chocolate to make this 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.900
 hazelnut flavored chocolate mousse 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.590
 we need 200 g of dark chocolate at 70 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.690
 % 400 g silky tofu 2 teaspoons 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.490
 soup of agave syrup 2 spoons 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.110
 Puree soup and hazelnut 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.970
 teaspoon vanilla powder 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.300
 so at first I'm going 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.500
 simply put the chocolate to melt 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.780
 the other basic element of this recipe 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.730
 it's the silky tofu made from 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.190
 of soy milk notebook it is rich in 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.530
 magnesium and its neutral quiz we go all 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.310
 first tofu missiles you see that his 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.640
 texture changes starts a little bit to 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.200
 have some creaminess by 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.450
 compared to the flank aspect he had 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.490
 just now we add in the 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.920
 melted chocolate the nutty purÃ©e and 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.540
 the agave syrup and mix well the 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.060
 ingredients before incorporating them into 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.390
 tofu and then for the greedy touch I 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.470
 add a little vanilla 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.810
 to mix again the chocolate and 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.160
 soy for these desserts to gain in 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.350
 flavors and creaminess 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.720
 it will have to be left united in 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.900
 holds in the refrigerator before the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.900
 savor
