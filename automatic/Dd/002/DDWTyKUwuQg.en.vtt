 you are welcome to the youtube channel 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 of sana court tv 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.939
 I am a sergio, you can find me in 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 twitter by arroba is nothing more than 10 and today 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.140
 let's do the complete analysis of a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 tweet de cydia nuevocito just came out 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.349
 is called 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.480
 super is quite interesting but it's from 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.730
 payment voucher is priced at 0.99 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.680
 American dollars and is available in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
 the big boss repository 'as I say 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.949
 is new just came out and what does 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.540
 this tweet let's go see it as it comes out 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.309
 springboard for you to see a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.780
 little bit what is it that does not then so 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.430
 simple as the following, notice that the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 adjustments application I have open 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.579
 notice that there was a multitasking and I see 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.230
 that the application of adjustments I have 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.879
 open then note that the name of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.379
 settings is marking me in blue 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.680
 see what you have put in the application 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.539
 of the alarm and notice that I am 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.730
 highlighting in blue the name of the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.770
 applications that I have open this 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.480
 is what it does where a single glance in 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.859
 the spum board I will be able to see all 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.199
 those applications that I have open 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.850
 in multitasking in the background like this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 Well, I do not have that machine when it's something 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.720
 much more comfortable especially if you are 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 crazy about the control of the system like 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 I do not and also a very important thing 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.170
 what is perhaps the most important thing is 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.870
 that all these applications that are 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.910
 in according 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.340
 making a gentle gesture up 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.470
 to 8 wrong I touch the application and make a 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.930
 psoe upwards fix that shows me 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.060
 This little window with information from the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.590
 ram memory that is occupying and tells me 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.210
 that I can close the application or that 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.890
 I can cancel to leave it open 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.570
 notice that I do the same with this 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.910
 application I will not cancel stays 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.070
 open I do the same I give it here and the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.170
 I close this is basically what it does 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.420
 this tweet very very interesting as os 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.610
 I say you are crazy about the control of 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.130
 your system the iphone works 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.140
 great you do not need this help so 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.000
 the team performs better but if you want 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.710
 be aware of what you are going 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.510
 using they give you a lot of information 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.160
 this tweet me that's why I bought it and 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.750
 I find very interesting is 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.400
 completely configurable this tweet 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.920
 let's go to the adjustments we're going to 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.990
 go to the tri in question super app and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.330
 here we have as you see all the settings 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.920
 we can change the color of the highlight 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.080
 of the name of the application even 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.670
 we can change the opacity if we see that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.020
 it's too good then we can put it 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.940
 a little weaker like you 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.140
 you want and we can tell him to give us the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.030
 option to have a little window appear 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.190
 to close the application when making a 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.360
 soft up is not very simple the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.800
 agreement adjustments 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.150
 but the truth is that it is very good 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.190
 very good tweet application according to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.470
 I like it a lot and since I do not 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.630
 I recommend to all of you that it is a 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.950
 click of payment and I tell you that you are not going to 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.690
 need our iphone is not going to 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.790
 work better with this tweet from 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.350
 agreement but at least I like it 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.570
 have control as I tell you and for 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.070
 free ram memory to know how much 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.290
 ram are occupying me the applications and 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.790
 all this moved because I think 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.500
 essential as I tell you what 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.360
 and here I recommend dismissal friendly 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.360
 greeting everyone and see you soon chao
