00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 or the sheets and compass and welcome another 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.790
 new beat and how they saw it in the title 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.059
 new weapons for future and possible s 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.650
 and ghost in game part 2 ok and this was 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 something that I wanted to talk to you today 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.699
 since recently in the archives of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.859
 game with what has been included the new 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.199
 update a few days ago they have 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.240
 found new possible codes 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.640
 weapons that can come to us for the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 next d lc the truth is that these 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.630
 weapons are pretty good and I think that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 it's something out of the ordinary that could 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 give a new touch of originality to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.559
 game to be able to enjoy it to the fullest 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.930
 ok and it's been two weapons that have been 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.090
 filtered and then you can see the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.309
 first code as you see it here we can 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 to be watching what the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.100
 first code and how can you see us 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.649
 alekno code 20 ok not with 23 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.140
 would mean to our language fist of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 steel or fist american mitten novillera 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.789
 or ok pugilato key is a weapon 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.710
 formed by a structure that adjusts 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.960
 directly to the hand of whoever 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.790
 put and allows to punch with her 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.510
 the truth that this is a weapon too 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.800
 brutal 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.990
 since it could be a little more 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.900
 fun the fights face to face without 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.270
 use the weapons do not be Mayan and included 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.010
 in other great cars such as is the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.050
 great auto san andreas and the grand 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.360
 theft auto vice city the truth that you are 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.430
 weapons too too funny 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.850
 because when we went to what 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.220
 was going to be the vice city club or the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 nightclub the bay city ​​what was happening is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.330
 that if we entered with something we would 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 something suspicious to the managers or 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.620
 What we did was to start 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 to hit with this steel fist and nothing 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.820
 more that they punch us with 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 that fist of steel tomb us go to the floor 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.720
 and we stop again and again we 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.880
 knock on the floor is not like a weapon to 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.770
 that punch or throw you to the ground and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.479
 It's hard for you to get up, not like you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.280
 they took about three punches or they gave you 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.140
 a kick a hit in the game that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 you can remember that normally 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 when you get one of these the character 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.600
 falls and can take them on the floor but 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.310
 as they see it is something that is pretty 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.470
 well and I think there would be enough 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.690
 well in the game and here as you can 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.670
 to be seeing we are seeing the next 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.040
 code and how can you see are 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.710
 practically part of the same code 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.260
 but if we get it to 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.440
 what the image says apart from not 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.390
 cold oster we can notice that right down 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.700
 of what it would be that it did not cold auster in the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.570
 row 5 we can notice what it says 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.520
 marksman pistolo ok and the marksman gun 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.350
 is already in the game but 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.420
 this is not referred to as that rifle 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.060
 assault that we currently have this is 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.850
 would refer as a portable gun that 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.770
 had the power of the marksman rifle and 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.510
 the truth would be pretty good and that 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.120
 it is quite possible that they then come to 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.370
 put in the next DLT apart from the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.230
 vehicles or various things that go to 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.120
 include because if you remember it 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.780
 in this dlc what they gave us was the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.820
 new submachine gun and apart from that weapon 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.400
 what they gave us were some other things 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.140
 such as the camouflages for 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.120
 yusuf weapons that the truth is 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.830
 pretty good I think they gave him a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.570
 unique touch to the game so as they see it 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.240
 kids are some codes that are 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.670
 could include or things that could be 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.220
 include for the next you give the aura 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.500
 that I would like very much to have more 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.870
 that nothing this new fist of steel put 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.250
 that I do not know is something totally different and 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.140
 I think there would be enough 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.210
 remember that we have some other 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.730
 white arms to say it of some 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.470
 form fist weapons that could be like 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.390
 the knife does not but I think this 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.280
 it would look pretty good and I think it's not 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.900
 give yourself a good punch that will do you well with this 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.210
 come accommodated that could kill you or 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.650
 even ruin you and leave you lying 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.810
 on the floor the truth that would be quite 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.540
 well I think that could be given 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.970
 that we have already had in past 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.560
 games of the same saga no and the truth 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.090
 that would be something that I think people 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.410
 would like a lot 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.480
 so guys I hope you liked it
