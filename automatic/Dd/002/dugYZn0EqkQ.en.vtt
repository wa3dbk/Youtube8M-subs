and he keeps hopping and you go
completely<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> bounds<00:01:32.600> see<00:01:33.600> those<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
completely the bounds see those are the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.050 
completely the bounds see those are the

to see where you're going but you are
completely<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.180> bounds<00:01:49.009> also<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
completely out of bounds also if you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.609 
completely out of bounds also if you
mash<00:01:50.399> um<00:01:50.840> circle<00:01:51.840> enough<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> search

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
mash um circle enough you can search

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
mash um circle enough you can search
staying<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.100> air<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:54.360> certain

staying in the air and like certain

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.940 
staying in the air and like certain
poses<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.439> holding<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
poses like you're holding on to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.440 
poses like you're holding on to
something

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.060 

if<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:00.170> don't<00:02:00.289> press<00:02:00.439> anything<00:02:00.649> he'll<00:02:00.890> just

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
if you don't press anything he'll just

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.170 
if you don't press anything he'll just
keep<00:02:01.189> trying<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.460> hop<00:02:01.610> over<00:02:01.729> something<00:02:02.149> that's

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
keep trying to hop over something that's

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.499 
keep trying to hop over something that's
not<00:02:02.450> there<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.939> think<00:02:08.149> you'll<00:02:08.269> start

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
not there and I think you'll start

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.380 
not there and I think you'll start
getting<00:02:08.569> lower<00:02:08.929> inch<00:02:09.289> by<00:02:09.560> inch<00:02:10.150> but<00:02:11.150> if<00:02:11.239> you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
getting lower inch by inch but if you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.930 
getting lower inch by inch but if you
really<00:02:11.569> want<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.900> sink<00:02:12.080> low<00:02:12.519> teens<00:02:13.519> is<00:02:13.670> hopping

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
really want to sink low teens is hopping

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.750 
really want to sink low teens is hopping
around<00:02:14.030> here<00:02:15.099> well<00:02:16.099> first<00:02:16.370> I'll<00:02:16.489> show<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.699 
around here well first I'll show you
around<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.000> ship<00:02:17.030> more<00:02:17.360> as<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.290> balance<00:02:18.650> is

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
around the ship more as a balance is

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.610 
around the ship more as a balance is
really<00:02:18.890> funny<00:02:20.140> also<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.230> everyone<00:02:21.500> get

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620

glitch like they're just get back to the

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.360 
glitch like they're just get back to the
lab<00:02:27.110> press<00:02:27.380> triangle<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.040> can<00:02:28.190> climb

you're jumping around like this I've
actually<00:03:19.909> done<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.239> near<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.599> ladder<00:03:20.810> where

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
actually done that near the ladder where

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.289 
actually done that near the ladder where
I<00:03:21.079> glitch<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.560> had<00:03:21.739> enemy<00:03:22.519> spot<00:03:22.819> me<00:03:22.969> while<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.209> was

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
I glitch I had enemy spot me while I was

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.869 
I glitch I had enemy spot me while I was
floating<00:03:23.540> out<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:23.930> bounds<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.430> they<00:03:25.430> shot<00:03:25.700> me

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
floating out of bounds and they shot me

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.229 
floating out of bounds and they shot me
back<00:03:26.840> through<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.620> ladder<00:03:27.980> but<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:28.639> was<00:03:28.819> facing

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
back through the ladder but I was facing

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.629 
back through the ladder but I was facing
air<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.469> was<00:03:30.590> climbing<00:03:30.859> an<00:03:31.099> invisible

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
air and I was climbing an invisible

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.319 
air and I was climbing an invisible
ladder<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.150> when<00:03:33.139> that<00:03:33.319> happened<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:35.150> got

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
ladder and when that happened I got

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.879 
ladder and when that happened I got
stuck<00:03:35.780> inside<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.260> pillar<00:03:36.469> and<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.709> was

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
stuck inside the pillar and I was

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.500 
stuck inside the pillar and I was
trapped<00:03:37.159> it's<00:03:38.090> pretty<00:03:38.269> well<00:03:40.359> also<00:03:41.359> if<00:03:41.450> you

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
trapped it's pretty well also if you

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.640 
trapped it's pretty well also if you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
ever want to sink under the ground you

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.819 
ever want to sink under the ground you
can<00:03:42.769> press<00:03:42.919> X<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:45.019> they'll<00:03:45.200> start<00:03:45.439> acting

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
can press X and they'll start acting

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.179 
can press X and they'll start acting
really<00:03:46.189> weird<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:47.650> have<00:03:48.650> eventually<00:03:48.829> fall

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
really weird I have eventually fall

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.280 
really weird I have eventually fall
through<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.549> ground<00:03:49.760> if<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.060> find<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.169> right

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
through the ground if you find the right

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.740 
through the ground if you find the right
area<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.769> press<00:03:51.980> X<00:03:52.189> I<00:03:52.519> think<00:03:53.359> it's<00:03:53.510> about<00:03:53.599> to

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
area the press X I think it's about to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.650 
area the press X I think it's about to
happen<00:03:53.900> right<00:03:54.079> here

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:13.740 

I'm<00:04:02.660> actually<00:04:02.870> not<00:04:03.080> sure<00:04:03.140> what's<00:04:03.440> doing<00:04:03.710> here

I'm still hopping around here are the
bounds<00:04:37.949> then<00:04:38.949> right<00:04:39.099> here<00:04:39.129> is<00:04:39.340> actually<00:04:39.460> the

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
bounds then right here is actually the

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.369 
bounds then right here is actually the
very<00:04:39.849> out<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.300> start<00:04:40.599> area<00:04:40.779> of<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.080> game<00:04:41.259> when

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
very out the start area of the game when

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.529 
very out the start area of the game when
you<00:04:41.499> first<00:04:41.740> some<00:04:42.009> start<00:04:42.789> off<00:04:42.909> on<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.090> tanker
