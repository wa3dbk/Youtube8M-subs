00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello guys today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.900
 subject that I'm sure is going to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 love you will be with me that would be 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.870
 great to always get up with a good 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.549
 aspect and what happens is that how much 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.049
 more we need to have a good face is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.030
 when the woman appears more marked 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.160
 good today I'm going to give you a few 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.050
 tricks because it is in our hand the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 get it and get up then with that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.519
 effect of handsome raised permanent what 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.349
 happens is that we do not always meet them 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 times when we have another chance 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.120
 special because we have to do the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.460
 photographs of the card a wedding one 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.079
 something more important contender and if or 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.520
 if we have to get up with that good 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.520
 Well, I'm not going to tell you how 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.760
 a relaxing bath I know you do not always 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.320
 There is time but one day is a day and the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.090
 excuse to have to get up with good 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.400
 face is perfect for a bath 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 you know I'm a fan of this habit 15 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.470
 minutes soaking relaxed and with the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 blank mind is a magnificent start 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.620
 I recommend lotus bath foam 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.150
 white and green tea of ​​rituals after 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.130
 a quick shower I take the opportunity to spur 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.110
 gently your skin the bathroom will help you 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.000
 sleep better the second advice that you 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 I'm going to give is that coming this skin to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
 Sometimes we fall into the error of reaching 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.120
 house and it's not make up we immediately 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 we have dinner we arrange the things of course the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.390
 moment before going to sleep is with 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.800
 the days we make up well then if of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 Asthma dinner at home with friends and others 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.950
 these perfect but if not what there is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.290
 to do makeup is nothing more 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.490
 get home the skin has to breathe 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 another thing that you have to forget is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 use the toner at night before 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.070
 go to sleep what to do is regulate 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.050
 your ph and in the morning what will 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.340
 is to remove those toxins that I 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.320
 eliminating that it's okay during the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.270
 night when you use to sleep a good 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.070
 moisturizer with retinol and vitamins 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.900
 an eye contour and those are the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 care to need your skin 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.950
 dinner in the first place is convenient 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.840
 dine two hours before going to sleep 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 so that the body has given time to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 digest the food the key is in what 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.120
 you eat 12 hours before the sound 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.940
 alarm clock although if you follow these 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.470
 guidelines all day much better 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.120
 your dinner should be based on proteins and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.700
 vegetables discards the hydrates of 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.700
 carbon pasta bread potatoes fats 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 sitos oils sauces the salt since 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.090
 it retains the liquid this increases the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.520
 dark circles alcohol sugar and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.010
 dairy on the latter there are several 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.870
 options who recommend it and have 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.400
 they also discourage it altogether 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.600
 concrete happens to me that if he took milk for 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.150
 the night I wake up with my eyes 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.610
 swollen and if you have pizza I discount 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.200
 much worse weight I advise you to take 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.520
 notes about what the night has destined 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.709
 before the day you have lifted us up with 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.080
 dark circles each body is a world is more 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.280
 it is worth preventing that to cure for example you 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.620
 I recommend having scrambled eggs 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.600
 with prawns and asparagus some eggs 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.580
 barefoot oven with spinach and in the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.530
 case that you have away from home and in 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.000
 house also chooses some skewers of 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.590
 chicken fish accompanied with 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.480
 vegetables 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.550
 if you take fruits before you start 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.379
 dine and not as a dessert and be careful with the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.150
 invoice that you consume since most 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.310
 has a lot of sugar and if it is abused by 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 our is not so healthy before going 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.480
 to sleep take a relaxing infusion 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.920
 another one of the tips that help is to make 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.049
 exercise during the day this is going to do 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.000
 that during the day we do so much 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.690
 more active and that at night you 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.310
 let's rest much better and to finish 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.989
 sleep peacefully you have to let the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.340
 body rest eight hours and the best 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.799
 way to do it is to get into bed 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.480
 no worries to detonation and 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.370
 sanctuary and leave the problems in the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.260
 door once to get in bed 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.150
 Stop thinking is hard but do not 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.530
 impossible when your quibbles that 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.269
 we have all tried with the one of 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.709
 meditation of a couple of chapters of a 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.480
 book or just think of a day 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.040
 wonderful beach I invent it with 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.900
 all the details and most of the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.870
 times before my imagination 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.590
 arrives at the mind pointed nor will it sleep 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.599
 Inadvisable television for 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.730
 fall asleep a practice nothing relaxing 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.620
 to facilitate drainage is better 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.989
 sleeping on your back will avoid bags and 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.700
 the dark circles pay close attention to your 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.440
 pillow make sure you use the one 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.870
 That suits you not only when 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.430
