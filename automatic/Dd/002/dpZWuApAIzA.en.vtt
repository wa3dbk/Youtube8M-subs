okay<00:00:05.520> I'm<00:00:05.850> back<00:00:06.000> out<00:00:06.180> here<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.570> the<00:00:06.740> second

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
okay I'm back out here with the second

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.060 
okay I'm back out here with the second
version<00:00:07.920> of<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:09.240> Mirage<00:00:09.630> 2000<00:00:11.120> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.299> a<00:00:13.070> an

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
version of the Mirage 2000 this is a an

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.070 
version of the Mirage 2000 this is a an
airframe<00:00:14.459> that<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> built<00:00:15.270> and<00:00:15.420> designed<00:00:15.539> from

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
airframe that I built and designed from

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.609 
airframe that I built and designed from
three<00:00:16.470> views<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> real<00:00:17.850> plane<00:00:18.440> this<00:00:19.440> is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
three views of the real plane this is

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.020 
three views of the real plane this is
again<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.190> is<00:00:20.370> v2<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:22.140> difference<00:00:22.530> from<00:00:23.490> v1

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
again this is v2 the difference from v1

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.120 
again this is v2 the difference from v1
is<00:00:24.270> that<00:00:24.780> this<00:00:25.020> one<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.290> a<00:00:25.500> little<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:26.010> larger

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
is that this one is a little bit larger

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.480 
is that this one is a little bit larger
this<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.790> 22<00:00:27.180> inch<00:00:27.420> wingspan<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.490> down

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
this one is 22 inch wingspan and down

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.510 
this one is 22 inch wingspan and down
it's<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:30.030> heavier<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.410> little<00:00:32.309> over

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it's a little heavier so a little over

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's a little heavier so a little over
16<00:00:33.270> ounces<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:35.570> same<00:00:36.570> power<00:00:36.810> system<00:00:37.380> servos

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
16 ounces and same power system servos

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
16 ounces and same power system servos
are<00:00:38.550> bigger<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.300> nine<00:00:39.570> Grand<00:00:39.870> instead<00:00:40.170> of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
are bigger now the nine Grand instead of

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.810 
are bigger now the nine Grand instead of
five<00:00:40.470> gram<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.950> this<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.640> much

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
five gram and this one is it's much

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.860 
five gram and this one is it's much
better<00:00:45.030> looking<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.540> has<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> much<00:00:46.440> more<00:00:47.250> scale

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
better looking it has a much more scale

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.040 
better looking it has a much more scale
appearance<00:00:49.310> so<00:00:50.360> this<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> maiden<00:00:51.899> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
appearance so this is the maiden I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
appearance so this is the maiden I
couldn't<00:00:52.320> wait<00:00:52.500> any<00:00:52.710> longer<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> nice

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
couldn't wait any longer got a nice

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090 
couldn't wait any longer got a nice
little<00:00:53.850> breeze<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.989> today<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
little breeze out today out of the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.790 
little breeze out today out of the
fields<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.489> bit<00:00:56.760> muddy<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> can

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
fields a little bit muddy and as you can

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.350 
fields a little bit muddy and as you can
see<00:00:58.829> i<00:00:58.980> started<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> paint<00:01:00.420> job<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> hopefully

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
see i started the paint job so hopefully

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.020 
see i started the paint job so hopefully
i<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.439> her<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.309> piece<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.579> we<00:01:05.880> can

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
i can get her in in one piece so we can

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.610 
i can get her in in one piece so we can
finish<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:09.690> i<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.870> not<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.440> to

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
finish it and i do not know what to

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:24.980 
finish it and i do not know what to
expect<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.819 

field<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.229> very<00:01:26.259> muddy<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:29.380> am<00:01:29.530> worried

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
field is very muddy and I am worried

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.349 
field is very muddy and I am worried
about<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.130> torque<00:01:30.399> roll<00:01:30.609> there<00:01:30.939> is<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.119> lot<00:01:31.329> of

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
about the torque roll there is a lot of

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.620 
about the torque roll there is a lot of
trunk<00:01:31.659> roll<00:01:31.899> on<00:01:32.469> this<00:01:32.710> motor<00:01:33.420> even<00:01:34.420> at<00:01:34.509> the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
trunk roll on this motor even at the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.139 
trunk roll on this motor even at the
larger<00:01:34.929> size<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:36.390> we'll<00:01:37.390> see<00:01:37.569> what<00:01:37.659> happens

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
larger size so we'll see what happens

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.279 
larger size so we'll see what happens
four<00:01:40.149> minutes<00:01:40.299> on<00:01:40.539> my<00:01:40.659> timer<00:01:40.929> oh<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.259> a

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
four minutes on my timer oh there is a

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.039 
four minutes on my timer oh there is a
lot<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.590> water<00:01:44.890> out<00:01:45.130> here<00:01:46.859> it<00:01:47.859> goes<00:01:48.069> nothing<00:01:48.490> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
lot of water out here it goes nothing a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:02:01.040 
lot of water out here it goes nothing a
little<00:01:50.049> bit<00:01:50.170> up<00:01:50.350> turn

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.280

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
a good thing because this battery is

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.210 
a good thing because this battery is

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
very far back so I'm gonna move the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.640 
very far back so I'm gonna move the
battery<00:02:15.490> forward<00:02:19.200> well<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.530> great

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
battery forward well this is great

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.760 
battery forward well this is great
that's<00:02:21.130> actually<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.520> great<00:02:21.700> thing<00:02:23.100> because<00:02:24.100> I

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
was really worried about the battery

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.060 
was really worried about the battery
positioning<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.500> was<00:02:29.590> getting<00:02:29.740> so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
positioning because it was getting so

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:42.210 
positioning because it was getting so
far<00:02:30.310> back<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:41.470> right<00:02:41.590> I'm<00:02:41.650> gonna<00:02:41.740> stop<00:02:42.070> the

far back all right I'm gonna stop the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.560 
far back all right I'm gonna stop the
video<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.760> I'm<00:02:42.820> going<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.030> get<00:02:43.210> some<00:02:43.360> tissue

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
video and I'm going to get some tissue

going to try that again i move the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.650 
going to try that again i move the
battery<00:02:48.550> much<00:02:49.210> further<00:02:49.450> forward<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.180> CG

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
battery much further forward so the CG

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.940 
battery much further forward so the CG
is<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:53.080> lot<00:02:53.260> further<00:02:53.440> forward<00:02:53.890> now<00:02:55.890> I'm<00:02:56.890> very
