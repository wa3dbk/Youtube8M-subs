00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.800
 how are you so good girls today we are going to 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.779
 Make a hairstyle and a natural makeup 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.310
 to use on a day-to- day basis 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.529
 This is the look that I use 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.270
 daily for college change 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.009
 of perote a little the hairstyle but the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.230
 makeup is almost always the one that I 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.239
 I use to not go too loaded with 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.790
 makeup but not very simple to 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.040
 study then if you are interested in this 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.110
 video keep watching and let's start with 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.510
 the makeup 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.280
 I'm going to collect all my bangs in the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.560
 back with the help of a clamp 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.660
 so that it does not bother me in the face and I go 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.030
 to start using a thermal serum 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.190
 facial from spy songs to moisturize my 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.890
 skin this is a product that moisturizes me 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.200
 the skin and it does not leave an oily texture 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.860
 because it's liquid and then it's perfect 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.860
 for oily skin 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.360
 I'm going to use a sunscreen now 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.489
 of the umbrella brand and it's also a 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.799
 product that gives you a very texture 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.590
 light does not leave your skin shiny or 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.689
 oily 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.060
 the sunscreen is very important 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.609
 use it every day with a high 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.259
 coverage to ensure greater 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.090
 fixation I will end up tapping 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.130
 and pushing a product a little bit the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.469
 product towards my skin now I'm going to 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 use a maybelline bicrim these 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.219
 products are perfect for using them 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.140
 in the newspaper since they are not so heavy 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.479
 as a base and they have so many 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.310
 benefits for our skin then 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.840
 I'll start by putting it with small 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.000
 taps all over my skin to 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.009
 distribute it and then with the help of 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.209
 I will finish a flat brochita 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.209
 spread all over my skin 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.549
 now I'm going with the proofreader for today 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.829
 I'm using the select cover up of 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.649
 mac and I'm going to put it with the help of a 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.990
 brush forming a triangle below 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.969
 my eyes and then to finish 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.319
 blur I'm going to give a few 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.209
 taps also with my fingers 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.829
 I will also put a little in the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.590
 fins on my nose that usually get 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.389
 reddish and now I'm going to seal all the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.549
 previous steps with the help of a 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.379
 dust and a brush I like more 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.889
 use the brush since it does not leave a 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.889
 appearance as heavy as if the 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.450
 sponge that bring the powder now I'm going 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.489
 with my eyebrows so I'm going to take this 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.099
 brown shadow here looks very clear for 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.840
 it's actually brown and with the help of 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.819
 a brush cut at an angle I'll 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.450
 fill all the empty spaces that 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.450
 There are in my eyebrows 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.870
 I will also help me to extend them 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.870
 a little bit at the end 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.570
 then I will take a shadow clarita 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.700
 the same tone of my skin and with the help 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.400
 of a flat and wide brush I will 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.880
 put it under my eyebrows and in all my 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.880
 eyelid 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.099
 now with this flat brush cut in 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.040
 angle but round I'm going to take a 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.110
 light brown shade to put on the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.330
 fold or in the socket of my eye and that 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.730
 make the look we see more 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.040
 depth and when we get to the end 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.569
 of our eyes in the outer corner 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.989
 let's take it down by forming 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.150
 one uve now with a pointed brush a 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.670
 little bit wet we're going to moisten what a 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.430
 little and we're going to take a black shadow 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.230
 to make a very smooth outline since 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.629
 this is a daily makeup for the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.579
 university or for occasions that we 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.349
 require a very elaborate makeup and 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.709
 then do an outline with shadow 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.629
 it's the best option then I'm going to take 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.349
 a little bit of blink and I'm going to pass 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.349
 two layers 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.550
 let's apply it on the tabs 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.550
 higher and lower 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.730
 Then I'll take a little blush and 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.130
 I'm going to put it on my whole cheek or on 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.120
 my cheeks with the help of a brush 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.120
 at an angle 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.989
 and then for the lips I'm going to take a 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.989
 them to increase them 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.989
 and then a moisturizer with color 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.060
 and this is the result of our 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.060
 let's go now with the hair 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.930
 good and now to finish with my 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.590
 hair I'll fix a little bit taking 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.080
 a section of the top 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.900
 I'm going to look for it in the back with 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.740
 this clamp raising it a little to create 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.740
 a little bomb 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.210
 and now with the help of an iron I'm going 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.050
 to make very soft waves in the 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.050
 front 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.070
 I'm going to plant a little more so that 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.070
 be completely smooth 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:45.009
 a very natural makeup to go to the 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.379
 University for your everyday life 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.629
 I have classes in exactly half 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.490
 hour then I'm leaving and I hope you 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.310

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.960
