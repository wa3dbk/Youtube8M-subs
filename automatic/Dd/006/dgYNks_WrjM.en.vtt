let's<00:02:01.040> how<00:02:01.850> long<00:02:02.180> does<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.479> take<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:03.020> produce<00:02:03.229> a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
let's how long does it take to produce a

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.490 
let's how long does it take to produce a
quality<00:02:03.890> jewelry<00:02:04.430> if<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.540> complex<00:02:05.930> design

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
quality jewelry if it's a complex design

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.359 
quality jewelry if it's a complex design
for<00:02:06.950> example<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.460> woman<00:02:07.670> design

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
for example a woman design

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.570 
for example a woman design
you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.390> much<00:02:09.770> organic<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:11.160> much<00:02:11.190> as

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
you can take as much organic as much as

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.449 
you can take as much organic as much as
one<00:02:12.000> week<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:13.110> bring<00:02:13.319> all<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.620> design<00:02:13.980> you

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
one week to bring all this design you

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.580 
one week to bring all this design you
know<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.790> even<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:15.630> are<00:02:15.690> even<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.140> complex

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
know and even they are even more complex

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.800 
know and even they are even more complex
design<00:02:17.040> standards<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.849> can<00:02:18.000> take<00:02:18.209> two<00:02:18.420> weeks<00:02:18.630> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
design standards I can take two weeks to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.440 
design standards I can take two weeks to
bring<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.230> off<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.950> duration<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.940> designing

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
bring it off so duration of designing

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.510 
bring it off so duration of designing
just<00:02:21.660> depends<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.470> simplicity<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
just depends on the simplicity of the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.960 
just depends on the simplicity of the
design<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.290> era<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.650> unemployment<00:02:26.459> can

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
design in this era of unemployment can

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.720 
design in this era of unemployment can
it<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.480> source<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:28.019> myths<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.890> livelihood<00:02:29.459> or
