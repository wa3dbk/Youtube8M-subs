that the power is low I've actually

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.070 
that the power is low I've actually
spent<00:00:23.880> all<00:00:24.029> day<00:00:24.060> trying<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> battery

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
spent all day trying to get the battery

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
spent all day trying to get the battery
down<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.529> empty<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.039> device<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.550> I

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
down to empty on this device so that I

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.220 
down to empty on this device so that I
can<00:00:26.760> demo<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.720> came<00:00:27.900> across<00:00:28.019> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
can demo this I came across this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.980 
can demo this I came across this
sometime<00:00:29.220> last<00:00:29.369> week<00:00:29.580> after<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> got<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.660> hands

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
sometime last week after I got my hands

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.959 
sometime last week after I got my hands
on<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.099> start<00:00:32.430> playing<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.850> for

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969

a<00:00:33.149> day<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.440> what<00:00:34.620> we're<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.219> try<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> do

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
a day and what we're going to try to do

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540 
a day and what we're going to try to do
is<00:00:36.030> without<00:00:36.780> entering<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.739> users<00:00:38.190> valid

enable<00:00:54.030> USB<00:00:54.480> debugging<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:55.770> lets<00:00:55.980> us

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
enable USB debugging which then lets us

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
enable USB debugging which then lets us
connect<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.850> computer<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.420> push

software to it for example we could
potentially<00:01:00.239> push<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> keylogger<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> now

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
potentially push a keylogger to it now

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.609 
potentially push a keylogger to it now
we<00:01:02.190> may<00:01:02.370> need<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.760> find<00:01:03.359> another<00:01:03.719> exploit<00:01:04.290> text

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
we may need to find another exploit text

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.160 
we may need to find another exploit text
we<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.010> key<00:01:05.220> logger<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.670> place<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:07.020> root

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
we get that key logger in place to root

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.590 
we get that key logger in place to root
the<00:01:07.320> device<00:01:07.670> if<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.760> imagine<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.510> be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the device if I imagine some will be

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000 
the device if I imagine some will be
coming<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.960> soon<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.560> let<00:01:10.710> us<00:01:10.740> do

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
coming out soon that would let us do

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.490 
coming out soon that would let us do
that<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> turn<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.380> we're

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that so when we turn you on and we're

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.750 
that so when we turn you on and we're
going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.010> prompt<00:01:14.280> telling<00:01:14.580> us<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
going to get this prompt telling us that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
going to get this prompt telling us that
the<00:01:14.939> battery<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.390> low<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.200> twelve

if<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.759> connected<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> our

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
if we have this connected to our

computer which show up and we could push

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
computer which show up and we could push
up<00:01:35.790> push<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.420> software<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> there's

up push our software to it so there's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.539 
up push our software to it so there's
the<00:01:40.259> demo<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> exploit<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> motorola

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the demo of the exploit for the motorola

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
the demo of the exploit for the motorola
zooms<00:01:42.000> again<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.110> only<00:01:43.320> works<00:01:43.649> for

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
off turn it back on they will be none

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
off turn it back on they will be none
the<00:01:54.210> wiser<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> key<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.890> their

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the wiser then when the key and their

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.010 
the wiser then when the key and their
password<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> forwarding<00:01:57.899> on

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
password you can have it forwarding on

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.959 
password you can have it forwarding on
to<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.380> web<00:01:58.770> service<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.399> their<00:01:59.579> password

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to your web service with their password

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.719 
to your web service with their password
so<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.270> decrypt<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> at<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> later<00:02:01.079> date

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
so you can decrypt it at a later date

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
so you can decrypt it at a later date
