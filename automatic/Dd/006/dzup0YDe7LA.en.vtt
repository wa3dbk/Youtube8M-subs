for your ABC x y&amp;z and then you've got a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.940 
for your ABC x y&amp;z and then you've got a
we<00:02:48.500> we<00:02:49.040> start<00:02:49.340> button<00:02:49.640> at<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.820> top<00:02:50.000> as<00:02:50.180> well

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
we we start button at the top as well

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.640 
we we start button at the top as well
there's<00:02:51.950> no<00:02:52.100> can<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> macro<00:02:53.510> feature<00:02:53.720> turbo

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.680 
rapid fire any of that kind of stuff
it's<00:02:57.200> basically<00:02:57.380> just<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.299> may<00:02:59.450> find

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
it's basically just that as you may find

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.720 
it's basically just that as you may find
enough<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.290> our<00:03:00.440> kid<00:03:00.680> you've<00:03:00.920> got<00:03:01.100> just<00:03:01.549> your

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
basic controls here and I mean the only

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.810 
basic controls here and I mean the only
difference<00:03:05.600> is<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.989> you've<00:03:06.200> got<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.769> VM<00:03:07.519> use<00:03:07.700> a

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
difference is here you've got a VM use a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.199 
difference is here you've got a VM use a
lot<00:03:08.440> like<00:03:09.440> you'd<00:03:09.590> find<00:03:09.620> in<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.010> regular

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209

on<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.480> different<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.230> get<00:03:30.350> I<00:03:30.410> think<00:03:30.650> there's

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
on a different you get I think there's

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.900 
on a different you get I think there's
three<00:03:30.890> different<00:03:31.100> versions<00:03:31.640> of<00:03:31.730> this

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
three different versions of this

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.060 
three different versions of this
controller<00:03:32.510> they're<00:03:33.050> all<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.290> same<00:03:33.320> really

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
controller they're all the same really

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.340 
controller they're all the same really
but<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:35.480> different<00:03:35.810> regions<00:03:36.110> have<00:03:36.200> a

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
but the different regions have a

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.040 
but the different regions have a
different<00:03:36.800> logo<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.490> this<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.780> towel

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
different logo so this is the towel

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.310 
different logo so this is the towel
version<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.650> think<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.160> um<00:03:41.230> there's<00:03:42.230> a

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
version to think and um there's a

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.290 
version to think and um there's a
different<00:03:42.650> one<00:03:42.740> for<00:03:42.770> Japan<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.670> North

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
different one for Japan and North

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.990 
different one for Japan and North
America<00:03:44.810> as<00:03:44.900> well<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.800> but<00:03:46.640> other<00:03:46.790> than

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
America as well so and but other than

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.240 
America as well so and but other than
that<00:03:47.060> they're<00:03:47.540> all<00:03:47.690> they're<00:03:47.990> all<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.200> same

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
that they're all they're all the same

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.910 
that they're all they're all the same
basically<00:03:49.250> same<00:03:49.520> controller<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.740> really

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
basically same controller and the really

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.470 
basically same controller and the really
nice<00:03:52.040> thing<00:03:52.100> about<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.360> an

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
nice thing about this is is it's an

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.380 
nice thing about this is is it's an
actual<00:03:54.340> mate<00:03:55.340> we've<00:03:55.520> switched<00:03:58.180> joystick<00:03:59.180> this

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
actual mate we've switched joystick this

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.390 
actual mate we've switched joystick this
on<00:03:59.510> up<00:03:59.660> so<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.080> think<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.500> makes<00:04:00.650> class<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.190> we

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
on up so I think that makes class and we

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.060 
on up so I think that makes class and we
can<00:04:01.550> give<00:04:01.700> up<00:04:04.270> but<00:04:05.270> I<00:04:05.330> mean<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.990> basically<00:04:06.170> to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
can give up but I mean it's basically to

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.860 
can give up but I mean it's basically to
me<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.340> feels<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.850> same<00:04:08.000> going<00:04:08.600> into<00:04:08.810> an

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
me it just feels the same going into an

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.770 
me it just feels the same going into an
arcade<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.970> controls<00:04:11.360> you<00:04:11.450> can<00:04:11.600> find

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
arcade and the controls you can find

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.660 
arcade and the controls you can find
their<00:04:13.060> buttons<00:04:14.060> are<00:04:14.240> Weber<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:15.340> don't<00:04:16.340> know<00:04:16.400> the

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
their buttons are Weber I don't know the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.070 
their buttons are Weber I don't know the
something<00:04:17.030> about<00:04:17.239> them<00:04:17.420> that's<00:04:17.570> not<00:04:17.690> quite

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
something about them that's not quite

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.550 
something about them that's not quite
the<00:04:18.200> same<00:04:18.380> as<00:04:18.560> on<00:04:18.680> our<00:04:18.799> kid<00:04:19.060> machine<00:04:20.560> but

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
the same as on our kid machine but

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.590 
the same as on our kid machine but
