00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.950 
you can see there was living wood it was
not<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> dead<00:03:35.400> tree<00:03:35.820> I'll<00:03:36.150> be<00:03:36.480> at<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.630> money

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
not a dead tree I'll be at the money

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.930 
not a dead tree I'll be at the money
this<00:03:37.650> would<00:03:37.860> make<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.220> think<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.910> have

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
this would make you think so we have

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.150 
this would make you think so we have
samples<00:03:39.540> from

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:04:02.030 

what

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.550 

see<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.670> tree<00:04:02.879> that<00:04:03.060> closed

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.230 

but<00:04:09.560> there<00:04:09.740> was<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> cut-off<00:04:10.280> branch<00:04:10.760> on<00:04:11.000> this

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
but there was a cut-off branch on this

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.880 
but there was a cut-off branch on this
top<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.750> this<00:04:11.840> tree<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.320> see<00:04:12.500> no<00:04:12.650> damage

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
top of this tree and you see no damage

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.890 
top of this tree and you see no damage
to<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.280> smaller<00:04:13.670> lens<00:04:13.940> around<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.910 

right<00:04:21.910> there

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.040 

Toby<00:04:29.920> we're<00:04:30.100> decoding<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:31.540> three<00:04:31.870> days

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
Toby we're decoding this three days

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.410 
Toby we're decoding this three days
later<00:04:32.350> she<00:04:32.470> begins<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:33.010> have<00:04:33.220> other<00:04:33.430> activity

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
later she begins to have other activity

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.060 
later she begins to have other activity
and<00:04:34.510> this<00:04:34.570> goes<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.020> intensely<00:04:35.620> for<00:04:35.890> about<00:04:36.040> a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
and this goes on intensely for about a

and this goes on intensely for about a
two<00:04:36.280> week<00:04:36.310> period
