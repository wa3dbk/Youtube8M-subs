like my most kills are with the nasher
by<00:02:17.050> far<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.680> have<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> shitload<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.970> kills<00:02:19.270> with

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
by far I have a shitload of kills with

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.750 
by far I have a shitload of kills with
them<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.110> after<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.680> its<00:02:21.160> kind<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.430> spread

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
them and after that its kind of spread

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.300 
them and after that its kind of spread
out<00:02:21.790> evenly<00:02:22.120> through<00:02:22.780> all<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.349> assault

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
out evenly through all of the assault

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.800 
out evenly through all of the assault
rifles<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:26.349> think<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.130> last<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
rifles and I think that last is the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.390 
rifles and I think that last is the
sawed-off<00:02:28.810> shotgun<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.680> sawed-off<00:02:29.980> man

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
sawed-off shotgun and the sawed-off man

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
see the fun in it but that's pretty much

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.770 
see the fun in it but that's pretty much
the<00:03:21.130> majority<00:03:21.489> of<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.030> way<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.329> people<00:03:22.359> play

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.770 
the majority of the way that people play
I<00:03:23.579> think<00:03:24.579> it's<00:03:24.730> honestly<00:03:25.120> call<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.540> duty

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
I think it's honestly call of duty

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.479 
I think it's honestly call of duty
players<00:03:26.109> coming<00:03:26.410> over<00:03:26.799> from<00:03:26.980> black<00:03:27.220> ops

sawed-off<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.609> what<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.790> see<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.060> hardly<00:03:34.510> getting

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
sawed-off is what I see I hardly getting

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.440 
sawed-off is what I see I hardly getting
any<00:03:34.900> natura<00:03:35.440> fights<00:03:35.709> barely<00:03:36.640> barely<00:03:36.970> getting

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
any natura fights barely barely getting

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.650 
any natura fights barely barely getting
any<00:03:37.480> nastier<00:03:37.989> place<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.299> stressful

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
any nastier place so that's stressful

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.970 
any nastier place so that's stressful
but<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.799> know<00:03:41.950> I'm<00:03:42.040> hoping<00:03:42.549> that<00:03:43.380> epic<00:03:44.380> epic

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
but you know I'm hoping that epic epic

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.800 
but you know I'm hoping that epic epic
is<00:03:45.100> known<00:03:45.370> for<00:03:45.670> putting<00:03:45.850> up<00:03:46.030> title<00:03:46.450> updates

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
is known for putting up title updates

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.099 
is known for putting up title updates
where<00:03:47.079> they<00:03:47.170> really<00:03:47.590> change<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.600> address

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
where they really change and address

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.020 
where they really change and address
issues<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:50.920> game<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.459> I'm<00:03:51.549> hoping<00:03:51.970> that

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
issues in the game so I'm hoping that

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.490 
issues in the game so I'm hoping that
when<00:03:52.299> they<00:03:52.389> put<00:03:52.569> out<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.780> first<00:03:53.019> title<00:03:53.380> update

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
when they put out the first title update

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.920 
when they put out the first title update
which<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:54.010> probably<00:03:54.280> when<00:03:54.730> they<00:03:54.819> pull<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
which is probably when they pull out the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.870 
which is probably when they pull out the
arm<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.769> first<00:03:57.010> map<00:03:57.280> pack<00:03:57.519> because<00:03:57.639> that's

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
arm the first map pack because that's

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.580 
arm the first map pack because that's
usually<00:03:58.060> how<00:03:58.329> they<00:03:58.810> did<00:03:59.019> what<00:03:59.170> girls<00:03:59.380> were

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
usually how they did what girls were

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.910 
usually how they did what girls were
sooo<00:03:59.829> so<00:04:00.549> I'm<00:04:00.700> hoping<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:02.590> do

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
sooo so I'm hoping that that do

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.099 
sooo so I'm hoping that that do
something<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.370> tweak<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.760> tweaked<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.269> solid

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
something to tweak the tweaked a solid

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.860 
something to tweak the tweaked a solid
offer<00:04:05.200> man<00:04:05.799> cuz<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.220> shit<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.519> ridiculous<00:04:06.870> if

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870
