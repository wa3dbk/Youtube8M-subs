00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 all with the astronomical news of the day 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.559
 do you know that the discovery of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.599
 a planet would be 1400 light years away from the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.940
 earth opens again the possibility the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 perspective that there is more life 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.660
 also in the universe the truth is that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.609
 the nasa maintains that if there were more life 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
 if this planet existed, they would be 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.910
 rather more evolved than just 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.429
 was what the Nasa says see some 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.740
 data to keep in mind that it would be a 60 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.690
 percent larger than the earth 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.550
 even with more seniority around here 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.899
 there are the details to gas 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.879
 a similar but unreachable planet 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.670
 so far the closest to the earth 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.370
 but it would take thousands of light years 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.260
 to arrive is the first time that we 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.559
 happens we find a planet possibly 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.449
 earthy or like the earth to still with 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 a sun similar to ours a twin of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.460
 our sun at the correct distance to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.710
 that water is liquid is required 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 there may be life the answer is yes 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.489
 there may be life or there may have been 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 life is a world a little older than 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.940
 of the land this is in the area of 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.800
 ideal is in the area where the water is 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 liquid this has the size t is a 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.670
 little bigger than the earth and we 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.259
 about one more step 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.289
 If we are alone or not, surely not 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.690
 the scientists baptized him the cousin 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.630
 older is older and bigger than 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.450
 our world has at least six thousand 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.789
 millions of years in orbit its 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.429
 star is a little far away is one thousand 400 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.409
 millions of light years which makes the 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.360
 radio communication is difficult but 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.369
 I want to say a news of now the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.909
 ceti group is already targeting the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.740
 radars to see if microwave emission 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.390
 or television or some sign of 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.880
 civilization this we will know 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.069
 in a while but it's already focus 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.020
 of more serious investigations the 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.090
 discovery of this exoplanet to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.039
 charge of the nasa is part of the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.140
 sighting of another 11 small 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.099
 celestial bodies that are in zones 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.780
 habitable solar systems at 1,095 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.689
 the first exoplanet was discovered until 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.539
 thousand 995 had been discovered only 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.190
 stars was not possible from the planet the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.190
 explorer the story that but that 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.049
 is in orbit allows us to search 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.510
 planets we have already a thousand 35 a 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.910
 exoplanet is therefore a body not 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.670
 not stellar care that round that turn of 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.970
 a sun this is the most possible the most 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.950
 like the earth a cousin 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.370
 good because we have planetary neighbors 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.370
 because we are welcome 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 ah 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:49.040
 ah 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.610
 [Music] 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.610
 ah
