that's meant for settling down is kind
of<00:03:20.019> out<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.680> way<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.280> mean<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:21.910> in

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
of out of the way I mean it's in

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.850 
of out of the way I mean it's in
Connecticut<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:22.810> not<00:03:22.989> like<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.350> New<00:03:23.560> York

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
Connecticut it's not like in New York

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.039 
Connecticut it's not like in New York
City<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.940> because<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.480> he'll<00:03:25.810> probably

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
City so because of that he'll probably

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.410
