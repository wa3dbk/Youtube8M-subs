game<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.620> kind<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.280> looked<00:02:47.519> at<00:02:47.610> Boris<00:02:48.180> Becker

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
game I kind of looked at Boris Becker

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.300 
game I kind of looked at Boris Becker
because<00:02:49.230> he<00:02:49.349> had<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.500> all-around<00:02:50.040> power

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
because he had that all-around power

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.399 
because he had that all-around power
game<00:02:50.579> he<00:02:51.299> serve<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.720> volleyer<00:02:51.959> dad<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.110> huge

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
game he serve and volleyer dad a huge

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.140 
game he serve and volleyer dad a huge
serve<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:53.040> he<00:02:53.129> also<00:02:53.250> stayed<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.760> baseline

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
serve but he also stayed in a baseline

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.670 
serve but he also stayed in a baseline
and<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.420> would<00:02:54.569> be<00:02:54.659> comfortable<00:02:55.049> rolling<00:02:55.470> but

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
and it would be comfortable rolling but

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.460 
and it would be comfortable rolling but
he'd<00:02:55.799> be<00:02:55.890> hitting<00:02:56.129> big<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.579> that's<00:02:56.760> kind<00:02:56.970> of

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
he'd be hitting big so that's kind of

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.309 
he'd be hitting big so that's kind of
all<00:02:58.470> around<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.420> focused<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.599> I
