00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 begin a practical cooking lesson 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.689
 healthy food 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.380
 from not quite healthy foods here 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 improvised tried 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.769
 using the base set for 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.670
 environmental prevention adaptation and 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.480
 rehabilitation of each inhabitant of ours 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.800
 immense country 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 what would surprise us from now i don't know 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.869
 how surprised at least 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.489
 try that product which is called 

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:58.710
 not too useful and mayonnaise border 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.210
 may dennis around which so much 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.510
 passions and most importantly about 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.049
 factory mayonnaise water and here and what 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 same transformation awaits this moment we 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.970
 try to saturate him with unsaturated 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.580
 fatty acids beta carotene i.e. 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.150
 provitamin and which is so necessary for us 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.490
 and for normal skin and for sight and for 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.320
 were losing the vascular system of course 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.410
 scary to listen and watch statistics 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.120
 when you see how many people without 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.700
 temporary leave and sit vascular 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.830
 diseases we will try at least 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.510
 least at its local level this 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:48.170
 solve the problem and so you again the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:51.120
 hard work comes here 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.580
 harmful about which they say so much and 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.740
 write today anywhere from dimensional get off 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.310
 or how it turns into harmless 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.020
 tee sign here of the traveler the fact 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 which is most often to the harmful component 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.399
 mayonnaise include different types 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 stabilizers different types 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:17.880
 preservatives and the fact that fats in mayonnaise 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.320
 connecting to water and homogenized 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.460
 are far from being useful 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:29.250
 products in this case adding here 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.140
 such a composition rich in almost all 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.790
 fat soluble vitamins 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.390
 saturated folic acid 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.230
 acid 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.730
 we at least compensated 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.490
 the harmful effects of these components 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.080
 we would not zma more power with these 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.960
 bresser hinged couple 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.470
 and if but we can even make one 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.350
 As if another independent option, and here we are 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.110
 part of this product again is not everything for me 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.570
 neutral 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:09.580
 carrier on the same one moment a 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:14.250
 now and with a slight movement did not give 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.660
 Yes, and add another small amount 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:22.080
 spirulina magic biruni 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:26.350
 and again or angry and stir again and 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.900
 now itâ€™s almost French 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.200
 sauce 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:37.739
 of the most elite restaurants about yourself 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.890
 hip can be like faith need guys 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.540
 bouquet for how it tastes theoretically 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.920
 can not without anything with taste things 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.680
 each of those components that we 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.030
 Today added it turns out gives its 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.519
 flavor range because here's the concentrate 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.530
 beta carotene and text component 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.989
 which spoke the most enough 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.030
 pleasant taste and it can be just here on 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:08.849
 teaspoon or take just even 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.829
 dripping on the tongue or let's say do here 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.209
 such a procedure 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:16.709
 Hammers recommends eating for example 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:20.549
 through the skin and why not watch a little 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.370
 I will put through as a floor a portion for on mine 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.949
 named yes to our forever young ladies this 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.009
 the same could be the same mask I 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.639
 I will not reveal the biggest secrets 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.770
 but even if you apply on your fingertips 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.889
 a little bit of this composition we massage 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.840
 their energy small center and 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.510
 let's open one moment for the second moment 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.909
 then we can put hair there 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.919
 get an extra mask also on 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:52.800
 hair in the process of cooking wash your hands 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.349
 not necessarily and frenzy far to my colleague 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.750
 the other way around and use fully 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.860
 even all the so-called residues at 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.680
 cooking 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.890
 try and where to go day insurance 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.030

 yeah great i can say something 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.740
 what we got here is much 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.570
 different from this original product 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.840
 Naturally wilderness Justus 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.570
 I recommend we are ready to donate 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.050
 manufacturers and these technologies can 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.050
 say more 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.030
 just don't be scared 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.260
 or hide some manufacturers from 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:40.320
 we have a vodka recipe that can 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.720
 cure liver limit multiply clever 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:48.480
 but nevertheless it is a joke having 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.580
 a real basis for such recipes 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.210
 exist and can be mastered like 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.790
 products 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.430
 I can just about you lower your 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.980
 purchases to interest manufacturers 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.680
 vodka such a healing drink to 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.270
 sorry support the interest they sent 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.520
 but at least what we tell them 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.560
 brought they drank drink in 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.060
 at home so we cook 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.820
 tezhu 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.620
 you will be surprised i'm just afraid 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.480
 call this recipe because in 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.810
 at home it is possible to cook 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.810
 so this will be the next gear
