00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello very good good I have decided to do 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.190
 this video because there are many people who 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.100
 is looking to block ads 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.000
 from YouTube 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.100
 with safari 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.390
 good / I guess this tutorial 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.970
 it will also serve the people who want 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.510
 block in general the ads that are 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.960
 Many 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.060
 with safari for mac users 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.230
 good what you have to do is first 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.230
 is going to safari 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 once you are on safari 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.750
 good you can search online at the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.750
 block 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.610
 safari 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.110
 and blog.com 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.180
 You can also do it through 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.180
 safari that are safari extensions 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.810
 and here you will see a list of several 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.740
 extensions 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.840
 what's up farc 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.840
 and one of them is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.000
 einstein good for people who are 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.000
 download from getac block 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.710
 you will surely have that as from others 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.060
 other sources have to configure the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.610
 mac to install it because factory 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.290
 comes with a security 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.760
 what would be preferences 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.560
 you should go to the security that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.320
 first privacy 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.290
 well there was what you see that puts allow 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.490
 applications downloaded from 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.710
 as a rule it comes from mac app store 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 so what's good in my case I've 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.240
 put anywhere 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.920
 because I really like where I under 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.390
 the sources and I know what I should do with 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 My computer 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 for this you have to unlock the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.500
 padlock and put anywhere 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.080
 re-block as simple as that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.130
 you do through safari in a 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.740
 principle there should not be any 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.320
 problem 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.320
 once you have not downloaded 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.760
 those are you going to downloads 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.120
 they are downloads 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.040
 ah well I have it here installed a 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.650
 Once it is installed well, there is 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.310
 several options 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.830
 general was in the block filters 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.920
 of advertising 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.230
 and other type of filters can 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.450
 customize in case you want to block a 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.540
 last url 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.000
 shows a good domain web ad the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.920
 truth is that it goes quite well and in this 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.140
 If we have no more advertising 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.790
 youtube we are going to do a test for 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.790
 see what is true 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.920
 in this case we are going to give it to the first 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.920
 first video 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.280
 there has not been any kind of announcement 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.280
 let's give it to another video 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.739
 that eliminates them completely 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.610
 for example this 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.920
 but 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.120
 this for example 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.409
 Good thing we usually owe them 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.409
 I wanted more publicity let's go to this one 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.340
 you see that no 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.340
 gives us any kind of announcement 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.250
 these ads that are so annoying and 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.250
 that invade us so much internet 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.100
 well, this all friends, I hope that 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.000
 I have served you 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.000
 and chau
