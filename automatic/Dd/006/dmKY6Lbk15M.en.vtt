00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.340
 all right 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.640
 how about youtube people welcome 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.320
 be a new video today I want to 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.750
 talk about a topic that the truth 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.150
 have the balls on the floor I'm going to 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.580
 ask a question if the one who is 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.440
 watching this video sometime you do not 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.330
 comments came saying that you 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.880
 video is boring just for the simple 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.860
 The fact of using loquendo did not reach you 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.020
 comments saying that that voice of 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.240
 loquendo is disgusting and it is not understood 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 nothing have you ever been criticized 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.380
 telling you coward or fagot for not 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.899
 show your face and hide behind 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.970
 a voice emulator program is 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.979
 kind of comments always come to 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.590
 the locos or people who use loquendo 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.660
 eye I did not say that I am what January 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.399
 never consider me one but of all 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.009
 forms criticized me for using that 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.750
 voice emulator program that is the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.509
 topic that I want to talk to you about 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.280
 today same good first of where is 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.610
 originated all this criticism to the program 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.110
 loquendo already the people what in derÃ¡ 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.120
 probably originated a time before 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.280
 but this in my opinion became more 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.320
 strong thanks to a video from the user of 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 the anc robots in which he said that the 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.840
 loqueros were coward people for 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.150
 hide 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.190
 behind a program from there 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.379
 all the army of decerebrados of 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.110
 gross came to attack the shrinks and 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.470
 the people who use this program calling 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.269
 the cowardly fags and so on that 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.730
 said god I thought a reverend 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.010
 stupidity I already know that this subject is old 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.769
 but I do not give a shit that someone 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.290
 more touch the subject does not hurt anyone 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.110
 good that I think about all this what 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.519
 they will know right now to see you are in everything 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.940
 your right that you do not like the 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.010
 loquendo los loqueros et cetera but that 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.989
 it does not give you the right to attack them, it does not give you 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.299
 right to tell them cowardly because 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.000
 please you know all the loqueros 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.560
 as to say cowards how can you 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.579
 tell cowardly someone that neither 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.190
 you do not even know 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.500
 If I use loquendo and then you tell me 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.079
 cowardly what tests do you have to tell me 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.660
 that I am a coward perhaps you know me in 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.090
 real life or who want to know why 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.549
 use loquendo and an avatar instead of using 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.319
 my own face to talk is simple 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.480
 It's more fun for me to use a 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.579
 voice emulator program and an avatar 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.569
 have to shoot me with a camera to do 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.760
 videos 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.549
 and making videos with my face are not my 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.799
 style not because I'm a coward so 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.590
 are not stupid and do not misunderstand the 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.840
 things obviously there are people what you will see 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.819
 that could be said to be cowards but 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.739
 that does not mean that we all are 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.099
 do not put everyone in the same bag 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.349
 because if they do not stay like a caraduras 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.510
 also if the shrinks are cowards for 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.639
 do not show the face then you 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.469
 they would also be cowards because they only 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.480
 they devote to criticizing by writing in 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.819
 comments and they do not show the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.530
 face in a video obviously there are people 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.900
 who does it but those who do it are 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.239
 very few at most only 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.129
 criticizes writing calling cowards 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.199
 the shopkeepers without realizing that 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.599
 they end up being more cowards than 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.819
 never good to me they never came to me 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.069
 comments saying that I'm a coward 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.169
 I use loquendo but I know people who 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.509
 I get comments criticizing why 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.120
 to me the comments that come to me are 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.400
 the following well it would be good that 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.680
 use your own voice to speak because the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.630
 I really do not like that quiet voice 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.400
 I had planned to entertain myself with this 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.800
 video until you hear the voice of the 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.650
 town that more boring voice so I 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.050
 I hate the agreement is the ugliest voice 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.419
 let him hear that he is not understood 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.360
 I get comments like these 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.970
 many times, that is, you only see 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.620
 the video according to how it is done only what 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.440
 they try to bored by the simple fact 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.720
 that is done with it when we put 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.460
 an example any user makes a 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.830
 video talking about pelotudeces that a 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.020
 nobody cares but eye this user 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.780
 he made the video speaking with his own voice 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.669
 and showing his face and another user did 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.310
 a critical video something very important 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.070
 like for example how the economy is going 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.770
 from argentina but eye this user use 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.020
 Loquendo to speak a spectator has 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.030
 to choose one of those two videos the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.550
 user started by watching the video of the 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.590
 user who used loquendo and only looked 20 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.050
 seconds because I was already bored of 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.330
 listen to that boring Galician voice but 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.160
 when I watch the other user's video what 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.020
 I look completely and liked it just for the 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.670
 Simple fact of speaking with your own voice 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.980
 and show your face 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.810
 and this is just an example of what 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.300
 these people do when it comes to looking 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.940
 a video understand what I mean 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.980
 if someone with him when he talks about something 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.170
 important do not see it for the simple fact 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.420
 to use loquendo but when someone 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.880
 talk about any stupidity they see it for 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.640
 the simple fact of showing your face to see 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.710
 for you that is more important the 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.500
 subject of the video or how 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.240
 the most important thing is the issue of 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.340
 who deals and they would not have why 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.290
 criticize him and treat him as bored just 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.360
 by how it's done since what they have 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.820
 that giving importance is the subject of 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.770
 you speak good obviously there is what 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.570
 shopkeepers who make stupid videos and 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.030
 unimportant and there are people who do 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.430
 videos criticizing something important and what 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.200
 he does showing his face but what I 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.210
 I say is that you should not criticize the 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.890
 video according to how they did it with what 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.380
 story or with your face because what 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.330
 important is the subject that deals with me 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.220
 it seems good that you do not like loquendo 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.800
 but understand that there are people who 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.930
 like and if you do not like them 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.820
 advised not to look at it and ready I do not know 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.130
 why they make such a fuss about a 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.360
 stupidity like this is just not what 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.449
 look and stop breaking 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.400
 the balls and something that I almost forgot 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.860
 tell them when I get comments 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.080
 saying that it would be better to talk to 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.030
 my own voice and when I make a video in 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.770
 whoever I speak with my own voice want 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.020
 know the comments that come to me 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.629
 it would have been better if you had done it 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.669
 with the account because you did not use loquendo 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:59.669
 all Caesar and told him 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.629
 making videos is not easy, they have to 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.669
 Take into account the time it takes 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:26.680
 in editing it the time it takes to 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.020
 look for good information if it's about 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.090
 an analysis a documentary the time of 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.729
 rendering and the time it takes to 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.620
 upload the video to the page do not believe that 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:38.319
 this is an easy thing that only takes about 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.659
 few minutes do these videos take 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.970
 enough time and the only way to 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:45.220
 thank for watching the video is 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.139
