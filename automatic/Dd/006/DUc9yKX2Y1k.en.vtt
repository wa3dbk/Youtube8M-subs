00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 we experience it more and more often 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.000
 youtube everything is filmed with everything 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.529
 I mean everything is one 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 stage performance on the video day or 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.320
 the welcome with us africa 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.690
 returning girlfriend 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.849
 you often ask yourself this really needs 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.199
 filmed it does not work anyway 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.550
 wrong if there is someone on the stage 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.740
 talking to his camera if in front of him 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.210
 Thousands of people are some 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.779
 Filmed, I think a lot too 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.970
 Private 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.500
 is not it a little weird by the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.849
 city ​​to go and with the camera too 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.119
 Talk and why does this phenomenon occur 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.980
 go more frequently ask on these 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.660
 We get to the bottom of it today, first of all 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 who got this stone rolling 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.110
 is my observation and studies was 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.090
 Once again the trendsetter is unplayed 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.100
 with the founding of the untidy canal before 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.750
 a good seven months jumped on this train 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 Many people do not just let's play 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.739
 opened video channels are also many 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 lifestyle and comedy youtuber closed 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.940
 The reason why this trend again 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.160
 ask why do you make the heart so busy 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.110
 it is easier to message 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 to earn or make money on youtube 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 it just fun always and everywhere directly 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.489
 to record the events 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.440
 we should first clarify 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.019
 which tool to hold at all 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 these events serve this is the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.350
 canon legria mini she is very simple 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520
 because of that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.140
 easy to put in your pocket 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.400
 can be stuck and it is even more compact 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.890
 as some smartphone 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.189
 she is the near perfect blocking cam 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.920
 if she is too perfect she is the one 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.700
 crucial reason for blocking 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.830
 it transmits a about something like 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.340
 blogging virus we can only 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.110
 speculate 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 nevertheless it often seems whimsical where and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.770
 as it is used everywhere very often 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.020
 we could do it on the video de and the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 gamescom see many youtubers came up 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.290
 the stage in front of thousands of spectators and 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.970
 The multiple cameras you get from all 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.650
 They were photographed and yet they brought 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.090
 her own camera with me turns 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.560
 Here again the question if it is not 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.180
 funny is in front of thousands of people 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.619
 kick and yourself with one 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.299
 Basically it is for everyone to film a hand 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.310
 but leave it up to you 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.930
 to have a perfect blog or just that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.299
 People who were not there to show how 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.290
 it's from your own point of view 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.759
 is subject to much greater power 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.649
 Behind these events is the canon 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.990
 legria mini just a spy 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.670
 tool the nsa is probably more on 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.469
 flop virus on it as we think 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.470
 as always, the truth remains 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.030
 hidden 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.830
 what do you think you write me your opinion 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.120
