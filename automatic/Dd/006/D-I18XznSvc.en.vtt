break through the wall after they go

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.990 
break through the wall after they go
through<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> storages<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.760> they're<00:00:26.970> very

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
through the storages so they're very

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.019 
through the storages so they're very
important<00:00:27.890> also<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.250> important<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.670> on

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
important also it's important that on

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.609 
important also it's important that on
the<00:00:30.179> top<00:00:30.359> you're<00:00:30.810> gonna<00:00:30.900> want<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.199> six<00:00:31.470> wall

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the top you're gonna want about six wall

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.280 
the top you're gonna want about six wall
breakers<00:00:32.329> just<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.420> case<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.840> level<00:00:34.079> 4

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
breakers just in case you have level 4

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.930 
breakers just in case you have level 4
so<00:00:34.559> drop<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> top<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so drop two at the top right there and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.310 
so drop two at the top right there and
then<00:00:36.210> drop<00:00:36.420> two<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> break<00:00:37.050> through<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
then drop two more to break through the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
then drop two more to break through the
second<00:00:37.620> level<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.010> brought<00:00:38.820> six<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.390> case

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
second level I brought six just in case

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.770 
second level I brought six just in case
for<00:00:39.809> security<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> then<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.660> have

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
for security and then now you just have

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.940 
for security and then now you just have
to<00:00:42.870> wait<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.260> bit<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> archers<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to wait a little bit for the archers to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.479 
to wait a little bit for the archers to
break<00:00:44.219> through<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.670> attack<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> storages

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
break through and attack the storages

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.830 
break through and attack the storages
so<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:48.000> fast-forward<00:00:48.570> through<00:00:48.690> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
so as we fast-forward through that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
so as we fast-forward through that
they're<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> break<00:00:49.800> through<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
they're going to break through I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
they're going to break through I
actually<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:51.570> wall<00:00:51.870> breakers

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
actually do have my two wall breakers

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
actually do have my two wall breakers
left<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.620> since<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.610> did<00:00:53.969> break<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> top<00:00:54.570> with

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
left and since I did break the top with

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
left and since I did break the top with
no<00:00:54.930> problems<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.710> use<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.219> wall<00:00:56.430> breakers

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
no problems I can use my wall breakers

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.599 
no problems I can use my wall breakers
on<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.989> top<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.469> over<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.399> I'll<00:00:59.460> go

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
top so as you can see the air defense is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
top so as you can see the air defense is
being<00:02:09.599> destroyed<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> sides<00:02:10.649> and

being destroyed on all the sides and
this<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> very<00:02:11.280> important<00:02:11.760> because<00:02:12.209> what<00:02:12.450> we

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
this is very important because what we

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
this is very important because what we
have<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> dragon<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> clan

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.490 
that's left now is the wizard towers and
the<00:02:51.120> wizard<00:02:51.390> towers<00:02:51.660> are<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:52.110> weak<00:02:52.290> when

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
the wizard towers are really weak when

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.259 
the wizard towers are really weak when
it<00:02:52.590> comes<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:53.130> attacking<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.670> Dragons

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
it comes to attacking the Dragons

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.270 
it comes to attacking the Dragons
because<00:02:54.660> they<00:02:55.019> try<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.410> splash<00:02:55.680> damage<00:02:56.100> to

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
because they try to do splash damage to

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.250 
because they try to do splash damage to
multiple<00:02:56.550> units<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.540> when<00:02:57.690> they<00:02:57.780> attack<00:02:58.050> just

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
multiple units but when they attack just

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.800 
multiple units but when they attack just
one<00:02:58.410> units<00:02:58.709> they're<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.190> weak<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.810> unlike

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
one units they're really weak so unlike

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.660 
one units they're really weak so unlike
me<00:03:01.019> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.320> don't<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.620> level<00:03:01.890> 5<00:03:02.040> Giants<00:03:02.519> or

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
me if you don't have level 5 Giants or

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.100 
me if you don't have level 5 Giants or
if<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.940> didn't<00:03:03.120> use<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> healing<00:03:03.630> spell<00:03:03.840> all

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
if you didn't use a healing spell all

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.479 
if you didn't use a healing spell all
your<00:03:04.380> Giants<00:03:04.709> probably<00:03:04.980> would<00:03:05.070> be<00:03:05.160> dead<00:03:05.340> right

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
your Giants probably would be dead right

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.310 
your Giants probably would be dead right
now<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> one<00:03:06.300> dragon<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.930> did<00:03:07.110> drop

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
now but the one dragon that you did drop

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.070 
now but the one dragon that you did drop
preferably<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.430> them<00:03:08.550> level<00:03:08.790> 2<00:03:09.050> would<00:03:10.050> be

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
preferably have them level 2 would be

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.199 
preferably have them level 2 would be
enough<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.190> ahead<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.640> destroy<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> rest

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
enough to go ahead and destroy the rest

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.710 
enough to go ahead and destroy the rest
of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.390> base

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
of the base

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.790 
of the base
all<00:03:12.870> right<00:03:13.019> maybe<00:03:13.140> go<00:03:13.290> ahead<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.620> fast

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800
