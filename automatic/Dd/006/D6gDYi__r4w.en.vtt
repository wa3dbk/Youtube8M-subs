standing here literally next to the edge
the<00:00:49.680> leading<00:00:49.950> cause<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> death<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.180> Glacier

National Park is drowning because people

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.150 
National Park is drowning because people
get<00:00:55.649> too<00:00:55.860> close<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:57.350> rapidly<00:00:58.350> flowing<00:00:58.649> streams

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
get too close to rapidly flowing streams

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.020 
get too close to rapidly flowing streams
like<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.329> try<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> Ford<00:01:02.030> streams

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
like this one or try and Ford streams

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.740 
like this one or try and Ford streams
and<00:01:04.010> I'm<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.400> switch<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.240> mic<00:01:06.450> over

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and I'm going to just switch my mic over

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.149 
and I'm going to just switch my mic over
so<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.140> it'll<00:01:07.290> pick<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.920> bit<00:01:08.040> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
so that it'll pick up a little bit of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.280 
so that it'll pick up a little bit of
the<00:01:08.250> ambient<00:01:08.729> audio<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.960> hear<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the ambient audio and you can hear the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:33.570 
the ambient audio and you can hear the
roaring<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> water<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.850> flows<00:01:11.880> by

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.340 

the<00:01:34.580> temperature<00:01:35.000> here<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:35.390> absolutely

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
the temperature here is absolutely

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.070 
the temperature here is absolutely
lovely<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:36.979> in<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.430> high<00:01:38.030> 60s<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:38.810> think<00:01:38.990> it

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
lovely it is in the high 60s I think it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.490 
lovely it is in the high 60s I think it
is<00:01:39.170> about<00:01:39.350> 68<00:01:40.040> degrees<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:41.870> is<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:42.080> very

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
is about 68 degrees so this is a very

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.340 
is about 68 degrees so this is a very
nice<00:01:42.710> trail<00:01:43.160> that<00:01:43.520> starts<00:01:44.330> off<00:01:44.479> as<00:01:44.840> a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
use of chainsaws but I don't know what

use of chainsaws but I don't know what
the<00:03:04.310> rules<00:03:04.489> are<00:03:04.670> here<00:03:05.860> alright<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:07.489> got

an explanation of how this happened it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.009 
an explanation of how this happened it
was<00:03:10.010> not<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.220> thunderstorm<00:03:10.700> blast<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.900> was

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
was not a thunderstorm blast it was

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.759 
was not a thunderstorm blast it was
actually<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.650> Avalanche<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.489> so<00:03:13.730> when<00:03:14.120> the

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
actually the Avalanche and so when the

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.350 
actually the Avalanche and so when the
Avalanche<00:03:15.769> came<00:03:16.010> down<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.730> mountain<00:03:16.760> for

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
Avalanche came down the mountain for

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.940 
Avalanche came down the mountain for
which<00:03:17.480> avalanche<00:03:17.989> lake<00:03:18.230> where<00:03:18.530> we're<00:03:18.680> headed

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
which avalanche lake where we're headed

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.660 
which avalanche lake where we're headed
was<00:03:19.130> named<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.870> sucked<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:22.100> air<00:03:22.280> out<00:03:22.310> or

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
was named it sucked the air out or

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.330 
was named it sucked the air out or
pushed<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.390> air<00:03:23.540> out<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.530> air<00:03:24.739> from<00:03:25.160> that

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
pushed the air out and the air from that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.240 
pushed the air out and the air from that
caused<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:26.180> blast<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:27.079> air<00:03:27.260> caused<00:03:27.980> by<00:03:28.190> the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
caused a blast of air caused by the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.560 
caused a blast of air caused by the
Avalanche<00:03:28.790> was<00:03:28.940> what<00:03:29.329> caused<00:03:30.549> these<00:03:31.549> trees<00:03:32.060> to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
Avalanche was what caused these trees to

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.470 
Avalanche was what caused these trees to
snap<00:03:33.200> much<00:03:33.530> like<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.920> might<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.430> guess<00:03:35.150> he<00:03:35.360> had

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
snap much like you might I guess he had

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.880 
snap much like you might I guess he had
in<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.780> microburst<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.530> don't<00:03:36.680> know<00:03:36.739> if<00:03:36.829> I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
in a microburst I don't know if I

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.870 
in a microburst I don't know if I
microburst<00:03:37.340> could<00:03:37.519> do<00:03:37.579> this<00:03:37.700> for<00:03:37.850> a

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
microburst could do this for a

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.539 
microburst could do this for a
thunderstorm<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:39.380> know<00:03:40.040> it's<00:03:40.250> real<00:03:40.400> dangerous

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
thunderstorm I know it's real dangerous

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.680 
thunderstorm I know it's real dangerous
for<00:03:41.000> aircraft<00:03:41.419> but<00:03:42.160> anyway<00:03:43.209> it's<00:03:44.209> quite<00:03:44.480> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
for aircraft but anyway it's quite a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.520 
for aircraft but anyway it's quite a
quite<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> dramatic<00:03:45.889> area

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
quite a dramatic area

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.990 
quite a dramatic area
must<00:03:46.800> be<00:03:46.920> must<00:03:47.310> mean<00:03:47.490> we're<00:03:47.610> getting<00:03:47.670> close<00:03:47.970> to

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
must be must mean we're getting close to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.210 
must be must mean we're getting close to
the<00:03:48.270> side<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.600> gallon<00:03:49.170> all<00:03:49.650> right<00:03:49.860> we<00:03:50.070> have

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
the side of the gallon all right we have

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.310 
the side of the gallon all right we have
been<00:03:50.400> hiking<00:03:50.760> along<00:03:51.030> for<00:03:51.420> about<00:03:51.540> an<00:03:51.780> hour<00:03:51.900> and

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
been hiking along for about an hour and

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.610 
been hiking along for about an hour and
15<00:03:53.040> minutes<00:03:53.460> and<00:03:54.410> we<00:03:55.410> are<00:03:55.620> now<00:03:56.010> seeing<00:03:56.880> a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
15 minutes and we are now seeing a

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.980 
15 minutes and we are now seeing a
spectacular<00:03:58.620> Vista<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.270> don't<00:04:00.330> even<00:04:00.660> think

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
spectacular Vista and I don't even think

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.540 
spectacular Vista and I don't even think
that<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.290> video<00:04:01.530> image<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:02.040> gonna<00:04:02.160> do<00:04:02.430> it

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
that this video image is gonna do it

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.840 
that this video image is gonna do it
justice<00:04:03.080> but<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.470> probably<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.700> most

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
justice but that is probably the most

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.740 
justice but that is probably the most
amazing<00:04:07.610> waterfall<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.640> have<00:04:08.970> ever<00:04:09.150> seen<00:04:09.480> that

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
am positive that water has got to be

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.270 
am positive that water has got to be
pretty<00:05:14.550> cool<00:05:15.030> but<00:05:15.630> I'm<00:05:15.810> gonna<00:05:15.960> try<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.470> take

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
pretty cool but I'm gonna try and take

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.750 
pretty cool but I'm gonna try and take
some<00:05:17.490> panoramic<00:05:18.120> images<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.780> try<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.290> capture

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
some panoramic images to try and capture

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.630 
some panoramic images to try and capture
the<00:05:20.760> full<00:05:21.060> Vista<00:05:21.600> here<00:05:21.810> but<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.290> would<00:05:22.979> say<00:05:23.250> this

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
the full Vista here but I would say this

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.090 
the full Vista here but I would say this
is<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.120> reason<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.750> snowfall<00:05:25.350> is<00:05:25.680> still<00:05:25.979> up

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
is the reason the snowfall is still up

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.580 
is the reason the snowfall is still up
here<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.490> August<00:05:26.700> why<00:05:27.570> we're<00:05:27.810> having<00:05:27.930> flooding

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
here in August why we're having flooding

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.960 
here in August why we're having flooding
on<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.710> Missouri<00:05:29.010> River<00:05:29.100> but<00:05:29.460> as<00:05:29.610> my<00:05:29.820> dad

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
on the Missouri River but as my dad

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.180 
on the Missouri River but as my dad
reminded<00:05:30.270> me<00:05:30.540> we<00:05:30.660> are<00:05:30.780> on<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.110> western<00:05:31.950> side

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
reminded me we are on the western side

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.340 
reminded me we are on the western side
of<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.460> Continental<00:05:32.940> Divide<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.570> all<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.169> this

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
you think dad it was well worth it but I

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:25.760 
you think dad it was well worth it but I
had<00:06:18.150> my<00:06:18.360> doubts<00:06:18.419> part<00:06:19.050> way<00:06:19.169> up<00:06:19.199> oh<00:06:24.289> it's<00:06:25.289> just

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
had my doubts part way up oh it's just

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.409 
had my doubts part way up oh it's just
supposedly<00:06:26.639> it's<00:06:26.789> one<00:06:26.910> of<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.090> shorter

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
supposedly it's one of the shorter

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.600 
supposedly it's one of the shorter
trails<00:06:27.750> number<00:06:28.169> one<00:06:28.350> right<00:06:28.680> right<00:06:29.160> behind<00:06:29.430> us

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
trails number one right right behind us

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.629 
trails number one right right behind us
here<00:06:29.850> it<00:06:29.970> says<00:06:30.210> it's<00:06:30.419> two<00:06:31.229> miles<00:06:31.530> to<00:06:31.889> get<00:06:32.009> on<00:06:32.220> on

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
here it says it's two miles to get on on

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.400 
here it says it's two miles to get on on
up<00:06:32.970> there<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.210> I<00:06:33.360> think<00:06:33.419> it<00:06:33.630> took<00:06:33.780> us<00:06:33.840> about<00:06:34.139> an

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
up there and I think it took us about an

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.159 
up there and I think it took us about an
hour<00:06:34.530> and<00:06:35.389> thirteen<00:06:36.389> hour<00:06:36.539> forty-five<00:06:37.139> and

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
hour and thirteen hour forty-five and

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.200 
hour and thirteen hour forty-five and
just<00:06:38.070> a<00:06:38.130> little<00:06:38.220> over<00:06:38.340> an<00:06:38.550> hour<00:06:38.669> to<00:06:38.849> come<00:06:39.030> down

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
just a little over an hour to come down

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.420 
just a little over an hour to come down
and<00:06:39.419> so<00:06:39.630> of<00:06:39.780> course<00:06:39.840> it<00:06:40.110> was<00:06:40.199> downhill<00:06:41.099> coming
