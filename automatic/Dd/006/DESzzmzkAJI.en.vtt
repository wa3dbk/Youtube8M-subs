00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 I talked about the limits of the body in sport and 'however' there are activities where the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.340
 limit lies in the environment in which they occur when an obstacle is ad 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.020
 example not being a fish but where you can have the same in the water going 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.969
 moreover in depth 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.280
 this requires an adaptation that is part of training and training 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 they are not nearly sixty years of roasted corn and 30 that they overlook 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.140
 happy that on the mainland max as you change the body and mind into 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.730
 this conditions 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.180
 a theory on the evolution of man says that a rape parent abandoned 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.949
 the forests 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.609
 he spent an aquatic evolutionary phase initially feeding himself 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.760
 crustaceans and molluscs that live in the shallow water then dive 

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:54.059
 good form of adaptation to water, life in the water that I am now 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.210
 rediscovered prefectly it was only a matter of rediscovering these 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
 women 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.040
 engineer leader of the Genoese extra-parliamentary left in the 60s 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.740
 grindin manager of a diving equipment company in 1980 one 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.450
 radical life choice 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.119
 then sardinia federica moves both underwater hunting and today also to the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.509
 apnea documentary since then giorgio dapiran has spent more than 50,000 hours 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.719
 underwater simulating direct knowledge is perhaps 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.060
 unique of the underwater life understood 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.970
 as biology and behavior of fish but also in the human body 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.820
 immersed in an environment that many consider all natural know-how for 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.310
 our species 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.560
 how do you stay in more than 3 minutes are so much but without breathing down a 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.000
 less than 30 meters of marriage 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.760
 if I am convinced that our addition to diving &amp; 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.660
 apnea we are ready 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.780
 it is enough just to dust it free from deep instead speech is slightly 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.810
 different because it causes physiological changes 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.360
 and that one must know must know before being prepared to 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.620
 to know how to deal with them such as for example beyblade choice ie concentration 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.140
 of blood around vital organs 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.679
 the diaphragmatic contractions that inform us of this air hunger d 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:13.670
 obliges us 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.339
 having to be able to do it 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:19.099
 to improve this performance before the end of the search for you 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.319
 to carbonize the blood to enrich it of 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.210
 oxygen 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.119
 so as to prolong our dry skin 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.759
 this however bol 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.359
 it is not possible to reach even with a process of true lowering of the 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.499
 metabolism of ways to lower our consumption 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.179
 these are therefore involuntary vegetative mechanisms, as is done with 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.639
 train them 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.639
 I am convinced that with autogenic training techniques 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.370
 practices and pranayama yoga you can still control ours 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.840
 metabolism I'm not done though I can't long book you told me 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.309
 to go to a phase of relaxation and very long surface 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:09.099
 but how can one alarm you to make us realize this harmony 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.389
 It may seem a contradiction, but we also eat what we have 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.349
 because american 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.269
 if we fail to accept our dual nature as animal spiritual nature 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.829
 I will never fully understand what we do there may be one 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.439
 sustainable diving hunt 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.870
 I believe that this aversion towards the hunting family 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:33.050
 underwater sicily 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.920
 the fighter and enological the collection of amateur fishing from one 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.840
 recent FAO survey 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.319
 seems to be zero you are happy 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.629
 sound of the total withdrawal most of the large withdrawal 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.049
 display to devote to professional fishing rather than what 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.819
 attach to underwater hunting to your youth political experiences 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.429
 detective s holy 8 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:01.329
 this mass movement had rebelled against authoritarianism at one 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.830
 too rigid company 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.400
 card joining that experience is a self its evolution and then for 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.210
 subsequent experience the subasio hunter understood that in that instinct of 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.110
 uprising 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.590
 there was not only a revolt towards society 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.340
 and it is just as man lives within this society 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.539
 not respecting those three fundamental principles of lazie la 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.949
 feature not only today we talk so from our spes 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:36.139
 hotel explore and therefore able to hunt and consequently also know how to build 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.469
 the tools with their own hands
