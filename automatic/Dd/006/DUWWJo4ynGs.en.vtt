00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
easy but eventually it will be too much

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.729 
easy but eventually it will be too much
now<00:03:57.760> this<00:03:57.909> shoot<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.299> secret<00:03:58.629> to<00:03:58.750> this<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.169> to

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
now this shoot the secret to this is to

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.860 
now this shoot the secret to this is to
keep<00:03:59.919> one<00:04:00.250> at<00:04:00.549> your<00:04:00.760> window<00:04:00.939> living<00:04:01.480> at<00:04:01.629> all

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
keep one at your window living at all

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.210 
keep one at your window living at all
times<00:04:02.409> you<00:04:03.280> might<00:04:03.430> ask<00:04:03.579> why<00:04:03.909> but<00:04:04.269> I<00:04:05.139> I<00:04:05.769> like<00:04:06.099> to

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
times you might ask why but I I like to

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.879 
times you might ask why but I I like to
get<00:04:06.340> new<00:04:06.459> weapons<00:04:06.609> after<00:04:06.970> almost<00:04:07.299> every<00:04:07.540> round

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
get new weapons after almost every round

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.800 
get new weapons after almost every round
so<00:04:08.889> the<00:04:09.009> only<00:04:09.099> way<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.310> do<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.519> is<00:04:09.729> to<00:04:10.419> keep

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
so the only way to do that is to keep

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.420 
so the only way to do that is to keep
one<00:04:10.989> alive<00:04:11.019> because<00:04:11.709> otherwise<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.280> round

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
one alive because otherwise the round

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.190 
in which case I die so it's really it's
just<00:06:08.180> not<00:06:08.390> worth<00:06:08.600> it

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.320 

for<00:06:13.200> perk<00:06:13.410> locations<00:06:14.160> refer<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.670> map<00:06:14.880> that

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
for perk locations refer to the map that

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.130 
for perk locations refer to the map that
you<00:06:15.450> first<00:06:15.660> saw<00:06:15.960> when<00:06:16.230> we<00:06:16.260> began<00:06:16.590> this<00:06:16.770> video

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
you first saw when we began this video

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.630 
you first saw when we began this video
this<00:06:19.140> is<00:06:19.230> what<00:06:19.350> it<00:06:19.440> looks<00:06:19.560> like<00:06:19.770> when<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.430> die

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
this is what it looks like when you die

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.230 
this is what it looks like when you die
oh<00:06:21.470> you<00:06:22.470> couldn't<00:06:23.340> cover<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.700> window<00:06:23.970> we

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
oh you couldn't cover the window we

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.370 
oh you couldn't cover the window we
could<00:06:24.360> have<00:06:24.450> cover<00:06:24.570> the<00:06:24.690> hallway<00:06:25.050> it<00:06:25.200> just

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
could have cover the hallway it just

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.870 
could have cover the hallway it just
gets<00:06:25.560> too<00:06:25.740> intense<00:06:25.890> I<00:06:26.280> didn't<00:06:26.520> have<00:06:26.640> a<00:06:26.670> ray<00:06:26.850> gun

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
gets too intense I didn't have a ray gun

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.090 
gets too intense I didn't have a ray gun
so<00:06:27.120> it's<00:06:27.420> pretty<00:06:27.510> much<00:06:27.690> impossible<00:06:27.870> as<00:06:28.530> you

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
so it's pretty much impossible as you

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.300 
so it's pretty much impossible as you
can<00:06:29.220> see<00:06:29.430> we<00:06:30.150> get<00:06:30.240> points<00:06:30.750> after<00:06:30.870> points<00:06:31.680> so

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
can see we get points after points so

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.100 
can see we get points after points so
just<00:06:32.580> follow<00:06:32.790> our<00:06:33.000> guide<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.780> you<00:06:33.900> should<00:06:34.050> do

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
just follow our guide and you should do

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.780 
just follow our guide and you should do
extremely<00:06:34.530> well<00:06:36.920> rubbing<00:06:37.920> on<00:06:38.070> that<00:06:38.100> Italian

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.030 
extremely well rubbing on that Italian
leather
