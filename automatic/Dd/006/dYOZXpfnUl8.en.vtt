00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.000
 hello in this short tutorial show 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.340
 I like you your own handwriting 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.470
 in camtasia studio could insert video 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.190
 eg to draw something or to 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.840
 sign 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.219
 that gives the video a bit 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080
 personal character, for example 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.320
 also very suitable for intro 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.710
 is 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.960
 let's start with her needs camtasia 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.150
 studio 8.1 or height 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.949
 then you also need a sign 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.880
 tablet like for example this work 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.990
 completely here 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.859
 then it becomes such a substance 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.230
 written on it or if you have it 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.850
 a proper tablet pc as well 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.550
 a pen input supports this 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.270
 case i use the service pro and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.550
 then you also need one 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.260
 drawing program such as windows journal 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.450
 there is also an alternative of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.090
 open source sun just look 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.730
 okay let's go the idea is 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.219
 we write the following note program 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.050
 with that of the tablets during some pin 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.450
 this process bottled with camtasia 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.760
 in camtasia we will use the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.309
 Function color removal around the wise 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.320
 remove background and that only 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.680
 the handwriting is still visible 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.740
 clear 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.939
 now again in detail first must 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.439
 I open windows german 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.479
 that is on many pcs already 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.459
 preinstalled is the easiest way 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.979
 if you look for it if you do not 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:21.890
 windows journal have a look 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.320
 the link is in the description 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 The background must be a color 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.659
 I go to file set up 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.570
 I can play under the lines art 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.820
 okay on doctrines 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.800
 Now I open the camtasia recorder 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 and set the recording area on the 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.920
 size of my wise note sheet 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.690
 As soon as the recording is running I can 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.500
 start writing or drawing 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 As an example, I write for you 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.640
 my credits like two or three 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.020
 Try recording the recording file 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.240
 we can manage later 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 then cut I finish the recording 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.320
 and open it in camtasia 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.539
 Now I need the first one 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.799
 background for this example i have 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.990
 already a graphic for the end credits 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.810
 prepared and put you on the track 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.849
 under my drawing then I choose the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.770
 recording and opens the visual 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.020
 properties 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.930
 down here is the option color 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.180
 away now all I need is the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.160
 select the color to be removed 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.800
 in this case it is white in the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.310
 background and that was it 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 beautiful 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.790
 we can now also the bigger ones 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.530
 adjust the position of the lettering and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.530
 then look at it in the preview window 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.260
 not bad sometimes offers 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.440
 the speed is a bit too high 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.870
 accelerate 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.730
 a right mouse click on the clip then 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.930
 select clip speed and enter 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.930
 set up a few percent 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.200
 this is how you get the green one 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.550
 under the clip with the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.840
 speed to the desired length 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.840
 can be adjusted exactly 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.520
 that was my side when you 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.990
 this does 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.060
 liked it then click on the 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.870
