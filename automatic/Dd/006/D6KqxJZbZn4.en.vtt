00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.250
 In terms of percentage, the churches I greet you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.689
 to an issue like 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.649
 makes Mon 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.649
 his photos go 2 and his 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.029
 so-called 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.249
 Burkhard Greulich 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.050
 Zehnder radios singer Sizzla 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.329
 so 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.699
 Dolly Parton should just be the simpler variant 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.929
 passable switchable 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.270
 very easily 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 first repent Markus the 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.630
 or drugs 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.610
 Prandelli fall 2 times short way to keep working 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.190
 Spreen we turn to Dr objects 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.250
 the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.770
 properties 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 make the switches a kick times 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 against the soft in the edit mode 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.120
 too young 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.860
 SLA 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.539
 as there is more see when I press clicks one clicks 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.400
 the German also with instructions 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 why like Bobo 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Grissmann leafed through the simple intersection 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.340
 Nancy and Nice double cross and dog excrement and branches around that simple 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 the simple ones were build now 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.800
 respectively 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.360
 we take that though 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.740
 so also as Texas the routes interact 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 Chains above JP 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.460
 APA 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 German continues Luan 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.680
 embarrass the first couples part 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.200
 the second 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.610
 Therefore the tour stops in the picture 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.070
 the dream up 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.840
 there about Jochum far Bremen 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.300
 much green 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.460
 Dingels ever 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.240
 in front here 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 after approx 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.039
 from Dr 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.929
 the focal point 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.619
 and from 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.339
 Jobs thus he has the 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:16.759
 first small part Schmock creates 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:21.689
 all only fall that does not deliver so the city bus tree or Morak approx 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.849
 next step is 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.389
 these 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.489
 back home to him for 20 that he looks nice again here on the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.459
 red dot 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.679

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.679
 she clarifies that Zurich 1 2 of Halo 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.909

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.650
 We thank between participants Customer Journey of Rock DJ

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.019
 STA next 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.419
 union 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.059
 Anis 100 and school operation 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.059
 make us look nice because I'm closer 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.029
 Although it can be quite normal for us all to go and go one 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.029
 go too 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.399
 Heading over soft again for the first time 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.569
 the edit mode 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.869
 there is the soft NL for me to stay 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.409
 Dangling twins 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.409
 So now a clip but that's it 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.129
 the passage on the mat too 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.699
 Where you can quite notice "old gr" taxes these 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.009
 More about the months, Cameron Currie said 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.969
 all of a sudden it came in the corner of the trademark rights 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.029
 especially do not push much on the Belt One Zwo 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.029
 then there must be Cuche AbbÃ© 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.659
 See why synonymous right away 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:24.180
 Pirates should 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.169
 End if he 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.800
 the scriptures now 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 go thanks Chile was at once 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.509
 around the line l 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.509
 mark 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.400
 get up once 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.400
 an 11 b 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 and then you do if you know try seems to look what happens 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 may also be she turns off the light 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.460
 Dahls moves power can coach Paul Le Guen 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.460
 that is always different as Mans makes look what comes out 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.740
 what did I do 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.389
 necessary because the 20 gates so exchange one 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.159
 8th 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.460
 Thursday 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.279
 you differently then 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.129
 Kurschilgen

 Sander fourth 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.479
 Ana bad and bring 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.479
 Nobelhaus we switch the course 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.629
 if he already back more 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:26.930
 Target dar 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.550
 the soft 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.550
 works there Look there 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.449
 if needed 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.270
 the rail 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.460
 Bharara to fall 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.460
 once again will the 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.910
 Raich features to turn the mode off again 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.069
 they should all turn off 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.069
 Error always suitable for the ski Mio 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.249
 that's the reason 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.029
 would have sworn quickly 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:07.029
 does not fit 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.050
 as business as a 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.099
 No no 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.309
 No no no no 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.930

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.039
 No 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.919
 Yes 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.509
 if everyone now sets all points on the current settings 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.530
 that means they are all changing course of Annette 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.439
 Test drive Schima received 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.869
 she is good at paint video crossing 

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.879
 to have over 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.520
 then the presentation is me on tomorrow 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520
 in the two doubles crossing area around at the normal 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.219
 and quite normal turnouts op 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:51.219
 the lake water is flying read 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.849
 typical 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:59.180
 property 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.689
 Yes 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.249

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.249
 Make out the euro 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:19.599
 in some cases, they are normal 

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:27.369
 sda 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.550
 how it goes isses 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.550
 now finished with it 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.960
 I am still enjoying and playing 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.030
 and of Landis his twin pack age old his normal intersection even 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.169
 Squared timber song 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:50.409
 and then 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:53.320
 normal crossings next to almost 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.779
 almost seven minutes in front
