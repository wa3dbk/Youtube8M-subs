00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.670 
of two to three minutes and stir in
between<00:01:57.599> so<00:01:58.599> now<00:01:58.779> we<00:01:58.840> add<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.679> chunky

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
between so now we add the chunky

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.340 
between so now we add the chunky
into<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.280> mix<00:02:01.460> despair<00:02:01.940> obviously<00:02:02.480> do<00:02:02.630> some

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
into the mix despair obviously do some

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.480 
into the mix despair obviously do some
coffee

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.310 

so<00:02:10.490> all<00:02:10.760> of<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:11.030> ingredients<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.690> moved<00:02:12.200> in

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
so all of the ingredients that moved in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.350 
so all of the ingredients that moved in
the<00:02:12.380> peas<00:02:12.590> have<00:02:12.620> had<00:02:13.040> around<00:02:13.430> two<00:02:13.670> minutes

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the peas have had around two minutes

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.600 
the peas have had around two minutes
and<00:02:14.510> quite<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> good<00:02:15.410> stir<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:16.310> we're<00:02:16.460> just

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and quite a good stir so now we're just

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:30.030 
and quite a good stir so now we're just
going<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.910> flop<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.570> mushroom<00:02:18.200> quarts<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.710> it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.559 

so<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.159> mixture<00:02:31.430> everything<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.180> there<00:02:32.360> as

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
so the mixture everything in there as

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.690 
so the mixture everything in there as
basic<00:02:33.079> have<00:02:33.200> been<00:02:33.319> announcer<00:02:33.980> between<00:02:34.430> five

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
basic have been announcer between five

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.369 
basic have been announcer between five
and<00:02:34.730> eight<00:02:35.000> minutes<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.720> two<00:02:35.959> stairs

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
and eight minutes it's have two stairs

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.470 
and eight minutes it's have two stairs
part<00:02:36.890> way<00:02:37.069> through<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:37.700> with<00:02:37.819> you<00:02:37.939> curry<00:02:38.180> sauce

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
part way through so with you curry sauce

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.800 
part way through so with you curry sauce
it<00:02:38.810> does<00:02:38.989> contain<00:02:39.590> nine<00:02:39.920> portions<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.569> what

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
it does contain nine portions and what

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.360 
it does contain nine portions and what
we've<00:02:41.959> done<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.349> we've<00:02:42.500> already<00:02:42.650> used<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:43.099> third

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
we've done is we've already used a third

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.130 
we've done is we've already used a third
of<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.790> box<00:02:44.000> because<00:02:44.239> we<00:02:44.360> like<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.659> extra

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
three people so taking into account

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.940 
three people so taking into account
obviously<00:02:50.840> we've<00:02:50.989> already<00:02:51.140> used<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.620> third<00:02:51.799> of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
obviously we've already used a third of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.350 
obviously we've already used a third of
the<00:02:52.040> box<00:02:52.220> mustard<00:02:52.579> eyeball<00:02:52.909> there's<00:02:53.090> just

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
the box mustard eyeball there's just

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.399 
the box mustard eyeball there's just
settled<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.409> down<00:02:54.650> halved<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:55.819> that's

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
settled it down halved it and that's

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.440 
settled it down halved it and that's
half<00:02:57.409> of<00:02:57.560> what's<00:02:57.769> left<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.400> that's<00:02:58.819> our<00:02:59.000> second

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
half of what's left so that's our second

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
portion which we'll leave as one more

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.670 
portion which we'll leave as one more
passion<00:03:01.370> form<00:03:01.790> another<00:03:01.970> correct<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.750> it's

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
passion form another correct and it's

there we need to add 340 mils of water
and<00:03:09.920> we're<00:03:10.010> adding<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.370> slowly<00:03:10.940> while

stirring at the same time so you don't

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.479 
stirring at the same time so you don't
get<00:03:13.819> any<00:03:13.879> lumps<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.650> keep<00:03:15.829> constantly

up with any longer so we've gone to the
medium<00:03:27.470> heat<00:03:27.739> now<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.400> as<00:03:28.549> we're<00:03:28.730> bringing

the temperature back up is obviously we

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.339 
the temperature back up is obviously we
have<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.859> cold<00:03:31.129> water<00:03:31.459> dice<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.750> medium<00:03:33.139> heat

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349
