00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello to all guys and well found a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.600
 this new installment of top a tobruk 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.450
 we have arrived at iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.610
 to the number 29 bet left 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.960
 lose the scooter you just passed 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.849
 that surely will have given some 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.250
 problem in the audio so no vi 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 worry so much only the intro if 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 get the number 29 bet 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.680
 so let's see the best ones 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.420
 applications also for this week 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 that came out on app stores that are 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.699
 been updated 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.109
 let's see also one of the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 applications that you recommended me 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.880
 you and I will mention some news that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.450
 will come from the next episodes then 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.450
 let's start right away 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.870
 the first application that I present to you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.940
 this week is the app 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.650
 official outlook to manage the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.210
 mail on iphone with this application 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.690
 we can go and use several 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.240
 email account without any problem 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.040
 ok forget another one 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.050
 I don't know if another scooter will 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.090
 will be avid to pass from under the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.650
 my window let's see this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 application this application there 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.220
 allows you to manage the mail you send me 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.220
 so many other clients do 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.979
 unmark the emails mark them 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.200
 put them between completed to go to 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.360
 try to archive them check the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.070
 sent are all the sections we could 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 have push notifications all that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 we need it from a mail client not there 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.300
 let's dwell so much on this much on one 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 of important features 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.200
 the app that is integration with some 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.640
 online storage services for 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.229
 attachments in this way will be much more 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 simple to go share 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 certain things via email that maybe 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.500
 we saved on our space ad 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 juan drive example the next game 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.890
 that I want to present to you is a version 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.960
 let's say 2.0 of the classic tetris though 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.690
 the gameplay is a little different let's talk about 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.140
 blocks of color different color that 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.210
 they fall into four possible lines 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.700
 imaginary on a grid 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.500
 in this way we should go to 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.119
 combine the lines with softer colors 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.649
 to the darker ones in order to punish them and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.680
 transform at least one horizontal line 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.290
 of four blocks for the same color 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.000
 in this way that line will come 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.430
 eliminated and we would have more room for 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.010
 manage the next blocks becomes 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.140
 much more complicated with the advancing of the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 levels because the blocks no longer come 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.860
 managed or not they get it 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.799
 in the screen to be 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.410
 managed quickly and above all by 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.690
 think how to go and put them one 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.970
 close to the other to expand the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.190
 shades then go to climb 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.630
 more and more because two clear blocks 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.709
 and become a block a little darker and 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.959
 etc 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.400
 so have a very application 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.769
 interesting because it will require a lot 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.540
 concentration the next application 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.910
 an application for the management of 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.690
 photos in this way we can go to 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.370
 remove 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.860
 quickly all the photographs present 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.110
 on our tulino seeing the obviously 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.050
 one by one if it annoys us to go to 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.400
 click on the command delete from ios 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.710
 with this application we will have a 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.810
 arrangement a much wider view 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.600
 We will be able to make one of the photographs 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.310
 swipe to obviously save the photo if 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.380
 we don't want to eliminate it to eliminate it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.480
 or to put it among those to be checked 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.590
 then later to decide 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.360
 whether to eliminate it or not 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.640
 obviously we will authorize the application 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.380
 to access the photos of ios and then 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.080
 also to delete images from 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.300
 Our camera roll still a 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.830
 photo application the next one 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.350
 application that allows us to insert 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.500
 graphic elements and special texts at 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.330
 our projects to our images in 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.670
 this way we can go and take advantage 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.420
 a wide range of fonts already present 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.190
 in the application and of line shapes 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.960
 objects that can be included in the photos 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.000
 obviously overlap the level by 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.860
 level we could also buy 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.710
 additional content by purchase in 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.489
 app is still very very interesting 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.770
 the possibility of going to manage at 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.450
 better all the parameters related to 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.850
 texts to the objects we insert from 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.230
 color to size the position to 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.390
 rotation etcetera 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.560
 the next application for lovers 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.780
 of fitness and those who want 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.850
 create a personal card in a way 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.540
 autonomous, however, to transform one's own 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.919
 digital fashion gym card 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.870
 also useful if you train at home yes 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.270
 look for exercises targeted on 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.220
 certain types of muscle bundles or 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.450
 however certain goals with 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.160
 this application we will have a 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.600
 available many exercises already 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.460
 in the basic version others will 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.260
 be purchased with the version 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.150
 complete but there is one thing very much indeed 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.770
 interesting and of course once 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.530
 created our training we could 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.350
 go and use it or better save 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.030
 in our event calendar 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.969
 also use the timer to give us one 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.149
 hand during 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.549
 slow and use sharing 

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:53.110
 training data in apple health 

00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:55.809
 and therefore in the application that holds us 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.849
 track of all calories burned by 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.219
 all the training done then of 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.479
 have an application that goes to 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:04.179
 integrate very well into the ecosystem 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.589
 apple health good guys with le 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.509
 This week's apps we have 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:08.919
 finished we go to see one of the 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.319
 applications that you recommended me 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.269
 this time I chose to treat 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.369
 to the doubts even if we had already done the 

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:18.309
 tutorial on our site indeed if 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:20.619
 you have special advice needs 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.169
 to watch those tutorials I will explain 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:24.549
 in the video ones how to use al 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.829
 better the application let's say 

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:28.659
 quickly what is it because it comes 

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:30.369
 used you can use imovie for 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.319
 go and edit short videos too 

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:35.589
 videos a little longer directly from 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:38.469
 iphone or ipad via touch controls 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.699
 very interesting and intuitive that there 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.589
 allow you to cut scenes 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.839
 rearrange them using effects 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:47.049
 go to adjust the audio use of the 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:48.549
 fade texts, etc. a 

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:50.769
 really very interesting editor that there 

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:53.139
 also allows you to export in hd i 

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:55.719
 projects we have created 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.269
 also integrates with icloud so as to 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:00.969
 still give us all the videos if there 

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:02.860
 we want to insert in the teaser so yes 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.419
 call and see them also for example on 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.059
 apple tv or on other devices 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.099
 compatible well guys for this 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:11.050

 comment on my video telling me which ones 

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:22.029
 are the best applications for 

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:23.799
 users just arrived in the iphone world 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.569

 so from the next video I will go to 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.050
 give two alternatives than maybe to 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.760
 applications that do the same thing e 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.590
 don't tell me which one you prefer for 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.240
