00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 today we talked about juice stage 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.319
 of fruits and vegetables so step for 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
 talk about detoxification which is the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.559
 process that is in process 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 metabolic which transforms the molik 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.799
 toxic molecules in less compounds 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.719
 toxic 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.910
 so not to be confused with the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.490
 detoxification which is the action of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.199
 to stop the dependence on a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.670
 toxic product so we often hear 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.420
 talk since we had this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.369
 application 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.769
 so here we want to talk about alcohol 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.599
 drugs and everything and everything we go we will do 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.809
 no rehab here my 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.300
 will rather do a detoxification cure 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.829
 with fruits and vegetables why 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 fruits and vegetables because that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.120
 facilitates the absorption of vitamins salts 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.770
 minerals and all that so today 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.309
 for in fruit juice tops 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.660
 and vegetables 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.010
 we chose cucumber pineapple and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.379
 carrot 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 so we'll put everything in our 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.670
 mix hours we'll mix we'll see we're going 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.020
 drink is everything their daughter named had 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.699
 continued jean louis belanger fruit and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.559
 vegetables yes it's very good for the 6th 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.409
 day and that's why people refuse 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.840
 to give this weird it does but the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 last I know I'll be careful 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:23.159
 is maybe the taste of today will be 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:25.560
 different the trust contract share 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.759
 to mafia but if I want to know in 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.780
 outside of fruits and vegetables is this 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.509
 that there are products 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.150
 pharmaceuticals by mathilde cardon who 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 are used in the case of the detox 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.619
 yes yes there is a lot of 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.840
 fruits as the fruit of products 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.409
 pharmaceutical but the ideal is the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.479
 natural 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.060
 you have natural fruit that is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.880
 true that it's grown with 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.040
 insecticide pesticides and all that but 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 the ideal is to consume fruits 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.110
 really advice to his advisors 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.110
 So here we go 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.890
 but if we can say yes 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:17.230
 do not be afraid so go cut yourself a 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.090
 little more at this time does not see the pole 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.140
 yes if you were a lot to him 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.140
 to announce the room to each his turn 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.230
 it's the real life we'll just decrease 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.100
 a little see wait wait what is it 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.870
 yara then during that time yes we 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.730
 so that's meanwhile I'm you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.560
 urges to consume a lot of fruits 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.050
 and vegetables but do not forget the good 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.580
 health does not only go through the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.990
 healthy food consumption it takes 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.500
 also have very good hygiene 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.840
 of life 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.320
 so try to get away from everything 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.150
 which is toxins so the cigarette tried 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.150
 best to abstain from quitting smoking 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.190
 concerned because I know how to read the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.480
 free radicals and we know them 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:14.230
 free radicals are responsible for 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:18.040
 everything about his daughter already two 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.320

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.800
 quickly just a little bit when I wanted 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.920
 do a lot for everyone but 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.920
 good 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 1 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:08.700
 isolated from the party ali is coming out yes because 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:17.430

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:20.359
 last time the audience with all this 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.180

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.860
