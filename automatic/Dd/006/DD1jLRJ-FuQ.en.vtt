00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.990
 why do you open the image you want me 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.150
 picked such that well to two 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.150
 ways that suits you well 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.239
 first make headlights words double 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 click and can edit 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:29.220
 then press the contour t 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.690
 here's the transformation opens right 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.140
 button deformation 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.330
 and now these sliders are top below you 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.460
 grieve 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.450
 change position to navigate by 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.390
 bottom 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.390
 and brother on top can do more 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.730
 So 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.730
 side 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.730
 you can and more under 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.579
 there will have to be but already so much 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.160
 will be noticeable 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.059
 peaceful deal to 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.059
 to the same places 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.600
 awards 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.150
 and so 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.720
 you can make a little bulge like that 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.720
 in a way 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.990
 and so rarely 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.000
 but if the image so changes the best 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.590
 parties 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.190
 in principle, this image is so ready 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.750
 but not always so good 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.970
 better under foot 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.970
 a little stock is roomy 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.100
 yummy 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 mesh is penetrated 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.180
 guarantee 4 things 4 where the tag and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.180
 the Internet 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.300
 prune right 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.100
 that's your less 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:10.660
 here's a cut off principle ready save 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:14.210
 Now I show a second way to broadcast 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.790
 cushion layer 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.790
 Now you create a new layer. 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.760
 rashid sign tool call 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.100
 threw here from above long tormented 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.960
 I thought how to make offices 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.060
 in the middle 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.010
 Well it singled out the play in the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.090
 the circle and so here is not at all caught the corner 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.090
 brother stepping 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.580
 I will 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:55.000
 so now 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:03:00.190
 brush and edit so he was 7 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.180
 it is normal and the rigidity is not this 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.180
 were the most 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.430
 Why do you open the picture ? 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.239
 do you want me to pick one that well two 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.819
 ways 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:20.459
 to whom the first suits well 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.459
 make headlamps a double click layer and 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.580
 can edit then click 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.640
 contour t 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.080
 here's the transformation opens right 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.320
 button deformation 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.760
 and now these sliders are top bottom 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.860
 you feed changing position 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.830
 navigate to the bottom 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.830
 and brother over the top you can 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.140
 So 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.140
 side 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.819
 you can and more 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.030
 but then it will be 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.550
 much will be noticeable 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.480
 it is up to 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.480
 to the same places 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.000
 a bit too much 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:17.140
 and so can be a little bulge 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.140
 do this way 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.840
 and so rarely 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:27.040
 but if the image is the better side 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.620
 Basically you are this image so ready 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.180
 but not always so good 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.520
 better under foot 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.520
 a little bit of the action whistles and our 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.560
 yummy 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.919
 the grid has one hall 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.610
 valentine 8 4 things three where the tag and 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.610
 the Internet 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.720
 you cut dimensional 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.790
 you know 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.520
 she still 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:11.020
 then we are basically ready to save 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:14.650
 now show 2 taste protect 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:19.229
 when novice layer 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.229
 Now you create a new layer . 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.330
 breathing tool sign called
