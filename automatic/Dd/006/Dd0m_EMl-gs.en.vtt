00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
really neat so the cables underneath my

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.710 
really neat so the cables underneath my

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
seat aren't all clustered together I use

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.009 
seat aren't all clustered together I use
a<00:03:34.750> zip<00:03:35.019> ties<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.730> did<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.850> really<00:03:37.090> really<00:03:37.870> good

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
a zip ties and did it really really good

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.840 
a zip ties and did it really really good
job<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.680> think<00:03:38.950> um<00:03:41.310> again<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.459> comes<00:03:42.609> with

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
job and I think um again it comes with

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.800 
job and I think um again it comes with
two<00:03:43.150> these<00:03:43.389> keyless<00:03:44.230> remotes<00:03:44.590> they<00:03:45.690> say<00:03:46.690> about

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
two these keyless remotes they say about

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.300 
two these keyless remotes they say about
a<00:03:46.930> hundred<00:03:47.290> feet<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.560> think<00:03:47.709> or<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> hundred

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
a hundred feet I think or a hundred

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.789 
a hundred feet I think or a hundred
yards<00:03:48.819> on<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.690> distance<00:03:50.139> where<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.620> turn

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
yards on the distance where you can turn

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.020 
yards on the distance where you can turn
it<00:03:50.980> on<00:03:52.410> having<00:03:53.410> quite<00:03:53.620> tested<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.190> yet<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:54.730> I'm

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
it on having quite tested it yet but I'm

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.410 
it on having quite tested it yet but I'm
sure<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.420> works<00:03:55.630> from<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.380> far<00:03:56.590> away<00:03:57.420> are

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
sure it works from that far away are

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.009 
sure it works from that far away are
