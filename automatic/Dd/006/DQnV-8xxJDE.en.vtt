00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
an iPhone so in this video I'm gonna try

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
an iPhone so in this video I'm gonna try
and<00:00:37.469> clear<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.430> differences<00:00:38.850> between

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
and clear up the differences between

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940 
and clear up the differences between
Android<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.690> Windows<00:00:39.780> phones<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> benefits

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
Android and Windows phones the benefits

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.650 
Android and Windows phones the benefits
of<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> disadvantages<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
of one and the disadvantages of the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400 
of one and the disadvantages of the
other<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.550> stay<00:00:45.090> tuned<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.260> let's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
other so I'm just stay tuned so let's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
other so I'm just stay tuned so let's
start<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> most<00:00:46.980> important<00:00:47.520> thing<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
start with the most important thing for

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.029 
start with the most important thing for
most<00:00:48.059> people<00:00:48.450> which<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.719> price<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.410> this

most people which is price and this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.410 
most people which is price and this
section<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:50.789> side<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
section I would actually side with the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.500 
section I would actually side with the
windows<00:00:51.719> phones<00:00:52.250> most<00:00:53.250> new<00:00:53.610> Android<00:00:54.059> phones

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
windows phones most new Android phones

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
windows phones most new Android phones
actually<00:00:54.840> come<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> seven<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> eight

flagship<00:00:58.170> devices<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.010> whereas<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
flagship devices that is whereas the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
flagship devices that is whereas the
Windows<00:01:00.090> ones<00:01:00.300> don't<00:01:00.870> normally<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.530> over<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
Windows ones don't normally go over the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
Windows ones don't normally go over the
$600<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:03.090> top<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.539> you're<00:01:03.719> actually

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
$600 on top of that you're actually

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.210 
$600 on top of that you're actually
getting<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.320> better<00:01:04.500> camera<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.159> an

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
getting a better camera with an

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520 
getting a better camera with an
equivalently<00:01:05.729> priced<00:01:06.060> Windows<00:01:06.479> Device<00:01:06.840> for

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
equivalently priced Windows Device for

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.590 
equivalently priced Windows Device for
example<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> Nokia<00:01:08.369> Lumia<00:01:08.549> series<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.570> just

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
example the Nokia Lumia series is just

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.929 
example the Nokia Lumia series is just
known<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.049> their<00:01:10.320> fantastic<00:01:10.770> cameras<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
known for their fantastic cameras it's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.370 
known for their fantastic cameras it's
just<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> ways<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.780> Windows<00:01:13.080> device

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
just one of the ways that Windows device

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.469 
just one of the ways that Windows device
manufacturers<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.520> found<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.060> separate

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
manufacturers have found to separate

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
manufacturers have found to separate
themselves<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> Android<00:01:16.500> competitors

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
themselves from the Android competitors

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.160 
themselves from the Android competitors
so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.580> Windows<00:01:18.450> mice<00:01:18.659> are<00:01:18.840> actually

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so I think Windows mice are actually

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
so I think Windows mice are actually
tailored<00:01:19.770> towards<00:01:20.040> people<00:01:20.340> who<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.640> taking

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
tailored towards people who like taking

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.510 
tailored towards people who like taking
photographs<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.750> think<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.040> didn't<00:01:23.369> like

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
photographs I think if you didn't like

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.679 
photographs I think if you didn't like
taking<00:01:23.850> photographs<00:01:24.030> while<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> weren't

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
taking photographs while you weren't

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.240 
taking photographs while you weren't
using<00:01:25.049> your<00:01:25.170> phone<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.409> photographs<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
using your phone for photographs you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710 
using your phone for photographs you
would<00:01:26.369> almost<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.729> wasting<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.299> money<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
would almost be wasting your money on a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
would almost be wasting your money on a
Windows<00:01:28.080> Device<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> big

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
Windows Device so one of the big

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
Windows Device so one of the big
benefits<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.509> Android<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.960> software<00:01:31.470> updates

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
benefits of Android is software updates

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
benefits of Android is software updates
whereas<00:01:32.640> Windows<00:01:33.000> asila<00:01:33.420> stayed<00:01:33.720> very<00:01:33.750> very

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
whereas Windows asila stayed very very

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.749 
whereas Windows asila stayed very very
similar<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> last<00:01:35.220> three<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:35.490> four<00:01:35.610> years

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
similar for the last three or four years

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
similar for the last three or four years
Android<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> constantly<00:01:37.229> upgrading<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
Android is constantly upgrading and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920 
Android is constantly upgrading and
improving<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> mean<00:01:39.329> we've<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> brand

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
improving so I mean we've got a brand

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.660 
improving so I mean we've got a brand
new<00:01:39.990> version<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.439> Android<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.340> every

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
new version of Android just about every

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
new version of Android just about every
year<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.659> incremental

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.050 
year with you know incremental
improvements<00:01:43.890> every<00:01:43.979> couple<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.490> months<00:01:44.640> just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
improvements every couple of months just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870 
improvements every couple of months just
to<00:01:45.240> keep<00:01:45.840> things<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.229> smoothly<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.130> think

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to keep things going smoothly I think

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310 
to keep things going smoothly I think
said<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.210> though<00:01:48.390> when<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> buy<00:01:49.020> under

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
said that though when you buy under

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.050 
said that though when you buy under
devices<00:01:49.680> they<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.040> tend<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> lose<00:01:50.850> support

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
devices they do tend to lose support

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
devices they do tend to lose support
quite<00:01:51.540> quickly<00:01:51.810> unless<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.619> buy

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
quite quickly unless you actually buy

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850 
quite quickly unless you actually buy
the<00:01:52.950> Nexus<00:01:53.369> devices<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:54.509> example<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.770> know

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the Nexus devices for example you know

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
the Nexus devices for example you know
the<00:01:55.979> Galaxy<00:01:56.369> s5<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.299> might<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.689> supported

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the Galaxy s5 you might get supported

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.749 
the Galaxy s5 you might get supported
updates<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.710> every<00:01:58.920> year<00:01:59.159> or<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.670> then

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
updates for every year or so and then

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
updates for every year or so and then
after<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.090> it'll<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.329> pretty<00:02:00.630> much<00:02:00.810> ditched

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
after that it'll be pretty much ditched

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.499 
after that it'll be pretty much ditched
now<00:02:02.070> another<00:02:02.340> thing<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:02.729> does<00:02:03.180> favor

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
now another thing that really does favor

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.300 
now another thing that really does favor
the<00:02:03.719> Android<00:02:04.110> ecosystem<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> amount<00:02:05.159> of

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the Android ecosystem is the amount of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.550 
the Android ecosystem is the amount of
apps<00:02:05.549> available<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.570> as<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
apps available and as you all know the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
apps available and as you all know the
Google<00:02:08.009> Play<00:02:08.190> Store<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.759> massive<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
Google Play Store is just massive you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.770 
Google Play Store is just massive you
know

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
know

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.390 
know
well<00:02:09.929> over<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> million<00:02:10.560> amps<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.220> could

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
well over a million amps and you could

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.180 
well over a million amps and you could
you<00:02:11.970> could<00:02:12.150> sit<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:13.080> new<00:02:13.440> page<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
you could sit on the just new page and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.559 
you could sit on the just new page and
just<00:02:14.370> keep<00:02:14.520> refreshing<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.240> you'd<00:02:15.330> see

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
just keep refreshing it and you'd see

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.150 
just keep refreshing it and you'd see
more<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:15.959> being<00:02:16.319> produced<00:02:16.709> that's<00:02:16.980> how

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
more up being produced that's how

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.770 
more up being produced that's how
quickly<00:02:17.459> they're<00:02:17.819> made<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> Android<00:02:18.630> App

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
quickly they're made on the Android App

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.350 
quickly they're made on the Android App
Store<00:02:19.069> on<00:02:20.069> windows<00:02:20.520> on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> other<00:02:20.760> hand<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
Store on windows on the other hand I

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.910 
Store on windows on the other hand I
mean<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.930> work<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.260> progress<00:02:22.530> it's

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
mean it's a work in progress it's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.980 
mean it's a work in progress it's
growing<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.790> don't<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.780> ever

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
growing but I don't think it's ever

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.240 
growing but I don't think it's ever
going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> be<00:02:25.350> quite<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.620> size<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
going to be quite the size of the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.490 
going to be quite the size of the
Android<00:02:26.580> ecosystem<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:27.360> think<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.840> just

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
Android ecosystem I think that just

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.280 
Android ecosystem I think that just
because<00:02:28.800> there's<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.970> smaller<00:02:30.360> user<00:02:30.660> base<00:02:30.959> for

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
because there's a smaller user base for

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.890 
because there's a smaller user base for
Windows<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.920> sort<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.190> less<00:02:32.970> incentive<00:02:33.420> for

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
Windows it's sort of less incentive for

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.600 
Windows it's sort of less incentive for
developers<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.590> actually<00:02:34.739> make<00:02:35.160> games<00:02:35.459> for

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
developers to actually make games for

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.930 
developers to actually make games for
that<00:02:35.910> platform<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:38.220> know<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.520> apps<00:02:38.730> in

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that platform you know just apps in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
that platform you know just apps in
general<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> mean<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.780> does<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.140> most<00:02:40.410> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
general but I mean it does have most of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.229 
general but I mean it does have most of
the<00:02:40.650> major<00:02:40.860> up<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.520> thinking<00:02:42.000> things

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
the major up so if you thinking things

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.380 
the major up so if you thinking things
like<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.590> eBay<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.370> YouTube<00:02:44.580> app<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.239> do

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
like the eBay up the YouTube app you do

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.699 
like the eBay up the YouTube app you do
have<00:02:45.510> all<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.840> kind<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.140> stuff<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.410> I

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
have all that kind of stuff so I

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.830 
have all that kind of stuff so I
wouldn't<00:02:47.100> worry<00:02:47.850> too<00:02:47.970> much<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:48.780> just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
wouldn't worry too much but it's just

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.110 
wouldn't worry too much but it's just
you<00:02:48.989> won't<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.410> as<00:02:49.620> much<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:50.010> diverse<00:02:50.459> set

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you won't have as much of a diverse set

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.990 
you won't have as much of a diverse set
of<00:02:51.300> applications<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.050> Windows<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:53.820> thing

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
of applications on Windows so one thing

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.220 
of applications on Windows so one thing
that<00:02:54.030> people<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.540> really<00:02:54.690> bothered<00:02:55.170> about

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
that people have really bothered about

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.390 
that people have really bothered about
is<00:02:55.530> performance

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
is performance

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.250 
is performance
how<00:02:56.790> does<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.150> performance<00:02:57.360> differ<00:02:57.959> between

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
how does the performance differ between

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.920 
how does the performance differ between
Android<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.920> Windows<00:02:58.980> Phones<00:02:59.400> well<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.810> be

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
Android and Windows Phones well to be

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.559

having said all that though it doesn't

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.100 
having said all that though it doesn't
necessarily<00:03:33.120> mean<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.329> Android<00:03:33.780> has<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
necessarily mean that Android has the

necessarily mean that Android has the
smoother<00:03:34.410> experience<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:35.310> mean<00:03:36.030> just

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
smoother experience I mean just

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.030 
smoother experience I mean just
generally<00:03:36.660> Android<00:03:37.019> is<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.140> heavier<00:03:37.500> package

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
generally Android is a heavier package

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.099 
generally Android is a heavier package
it's<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.489> lot<00:03:38.970> more<00:03:39.060> customizable<00:03:39.600> there's<00:03:40.079> a

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
it's a lot more customizable there's a

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.710 
it's a lot more customizable there's a
lot<00:03:40.230> more<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.760> terms<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.090> actual<00:03:42.239> the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
lot more to it so in terms of actual the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.270 
lot more to it so in terms of actual the
amount<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.959> storage<00:03:43.200> space<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.709> takes<00:03:43.859> up<00:03:44.100> it

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
amount of storage space it takes up it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.460 
amount of storage space it takes up it
does<00:03:44.400> take<00:03:44.549> up<00:03:44.670> more<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.450> more<00:03:45.660> sort<00:03:46.350> of

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
does take up more and it's more sort of

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.539 
does take up more and it's more sort of
resource<00:03:46.950> intensive<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.959> equivalent<00:03:49.549> set

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
resource intensive so the equivalent set

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.370 
resource intensive so the equivalent set
of<00:03:50.670> components<00:03:51.359> on<00:03:51.450> an<00:03:51.600> Android<00:03:51.870> device<00:03:52.109> will

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
of components on an Android device will

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.750 
of components on an Android device will
perform<00:03:52.650> less<00:03:52.890> well<00:03:53.070> than<00:03:53.220> they<00:03:53.519> would<00:03:53.670> on

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
perform less well than they would on

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.640 
perform less well than they would on
Windows<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> think<00:03:55.049> said<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.380> think

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
Windows so I think said that I think

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.490 
Windows so I think said that I think
that<00:03:55.859> both<00:03:56.100> would<00:03:56.609> offer<00:03:57.170> fairly<00:03:58.170> equal

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that both would offer fairly equal

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500 
that both would offer fairly equal
experiences<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.190> terms<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.579> speed<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.090> know

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
experiences in terms of speed you know

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.539 
experiences in terms of speed you know
I've<00:04:00.600> done<00:04:00.720> web<00:04:00.930> browser<00:04:01.200> tests<00:04:01.799> I've<00:04:02.280> done

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
I've done web browser tests I've done

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.490 
I've done web browser tests I've done
just<00:04:02.579> general<00:04:03.420> smoothness<00:04:03.959> tests<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.410> it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
just general smoothness tests and it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.620 
just general smoothness tests and it
does<00:04:04.650> seem<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.920> be<00:04:05.070> that<00:04:05.220> both<00:04:05.940> perform<00:04:06.359> very

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
does seem to be that both perform very

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.900 
does seem to be that both perform very
well<00:04:06.690> if<00:04:07.049> you're<00:04:07.200> buying<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.620> 2014<00:04:08.340> or<00:04:08.519> 2015

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
well if you're buying a 2014 or 2015

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.330 
well if you're buying a 2014 or 2015
phone<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.170> lot<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.350> people<00:04:10.709> have<00:04:10.799> also<00:04:10.950> asked

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
phone so a lot of people have also asked

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.150 
phone so a lot of people have also asked
me<00:04:11.459> about<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:12.000> know<00:04:12.030> build<00:04:12.359> quality<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.160> it's

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
me about you know build quality and it's

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.099 
me about you know build quality and it's
pretty<00:04:14.609> difficult<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.299> comment<00:04:15.840> on<00:04:15.959> this

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
pretty difficult to comment on this

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.839 
pretty difficult to comment on this
because<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.799> really<00:04:16.829> just<00:04:17.250> depends<00:04:17.579> on<00:04:17.729> the

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
because it really just depends on the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.670 
because it really just depends on the
manufacturer<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:19.169> there<00:04:19.320> are<00:04:19.409> lots<00:04:19.560> of

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
manufacturer so there are lots of

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.229 
manufacturer so there are lots of
different<00:04:19.950> manufacturers<00:04:20.519> for<00:04:20.640> Android<00:04:21.000> and

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
different manufacturers for Android and

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.220 
different manufacturers for Android and
lots<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:21.539> different<00:04:21.810> ones<00:04:21.900> will

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
lots of different ones will

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.040 
lots of different ones will
and<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.520> know<00:04:23.670> like<00:04:24.030> for<00:04:24.210> example<00:04:24.240> he/she<00:04:24.870> say

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
and you know like for example he/she say

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.760 
and you know like for example he/she say
produces<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.680> brand<00:04:25.980> new<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.910> know<00:04:27.030> metal

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
produces a brand new you know metal

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.010 
produces a brand new you know metal
aluminium<00:04:28.770> unibody<00:04:29.100> or<00:04:29.730> whatever<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.270> that

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
aluminium unibody or whatever and that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.210 
aluminium unibody or whatever and that
feels<00:04:31.260> really<00:04:31.380> good<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:31.980> know<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.130> feels

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
feels really good you know it feels

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.980 
feels really good you know it feels
really<00:04:32.730> really<00:04:32.880> well<00:04:33.090> built<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
really really well built and on the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.180 
really really well built and on the
other<00:04:34.140> hand<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:34.380> have<00:04:34.500> Samsung<00:04:35.040> who

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
other hand you have Samsung who

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.040 
other hand you have Samsung who
continues<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.790> sort<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.150> churn<00:04:36.420> out<00:04:36.630> plastic

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
continues to sort of churn out plastic

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.590 
continues to sort of churn out plastic
handsets<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:38.760> it<00:04:39.000> just<00:04:39.060> depends<00:04:39.570> on

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
handsets and it just it just depends on

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.910 
handsets and it just it just depends on
the<00:04:39.660> manufacturer<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.290> mean<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> Nokia<00:04:40.890> Lumia

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
the manufacturer I mean the Nokia Lumia

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.770 
the manufacturer I mean the Nokia Lumia
series<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.700> Windows<00:04:41.970> phones<00:04:42.180> are<00:04:42.420> very<00:04:42.450> well

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
series for Windows phones are very well

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.630 
series for Windows phones are very well
built<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.980> know<00:04:44.100> although<00:04:44.310> they<00:04:44.550> are

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
built and you know although they are

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.240 
built and you know although they are
plasticky<00:04:45.330> they<00:04:45.900> do<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:46.410> sort<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.740> have<00:04:46.980> a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
plasticky they do just sort of have a

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.940 
plasticky they do just sort of have a
sense<00:04:47.280> of<00:04:47.930> quality<00:04:48.930> about<00:04:49.470> them<00:04:49.740> which<00:04:49.920> you

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
sense of quality about them which you

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.840 
sense of quality about them which you
don't<00:04:50.330> get<00:04:51.330> with<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.540> lot<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.780> plastic<00:04:52.050> phones

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
don't get with a lot of plastic phones

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.250 
don't get with a lot of plastic phones
so<00:04:53.850> just<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.210> quick<00:04:54.420> you<00:04:54.450> mentioned<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:55.050> I

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
so just that quick you mentioned that I

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.620 
so just that quick you mentioned that I
think<00:04:55.800> Android<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.370> progressing<00:04:57.060> at<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.210> faster

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
think Android is progressing at a faster

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.390 
think Android is progressing at a faster
rate<00:04:57.660> than<00:04:57.840> Windows<00:04:58.350> I<00:04:58.380> mean<00:04:58.680> we're<00:04:59.130> seeing<00:04:59.280> a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
rate than Windows I mean we're seeing a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.130 
rate than Windows I mean we're seeing a
lot<00:04:59.550> more<00:04:59.580> innovation<00:04:59.940> in<00:05:00.480> terms<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:00.870> Android

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
lot more innovation in terms of Android

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.050 
lot more innovation in terms of Android
smartphones<00:05:01.710> than<00:05:01.860> Windows<00:05:02.160> ones<00:05:02.400> for

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
smartphones than Windows ones for

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.430 
smartphones than Windows ones for
example<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.570> know<00:05:03.690> we're<00:05:03.840> getting<00:05:04.110> heart

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
example you know we're getting heart

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.580 
example you know we're getting heart
rate<00:05:04.650> sensors<00:05:05.100> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.310> back<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.640> phones<00:05:05.880> and

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
rate sensors on the back of phones and

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.920 
rate sensors on the back of phones and
dual<00:05:07.590> cameras<00:05:08.340> for<00:05:08.640> image<00:05:08.940> stabilization<00:05:09.450> and

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
dual cameras for image stabilization and

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.540 
dual cameras for image stabilization and
that<00:05:10.080> kind<00:05:10.290> of<00:05:10.320> thing<00:05:10.500> whereas<00:05:11.070> with<00:05:11.220> Windows

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
that kind of thing whereas with Windows

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.100 
that kind of thing whereas with Windows
I<00:05:11.730> think<00:05:11.940> we've<00:05:12.090> just<00:05:12.120> been<00:05:12.300> seeing<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.810> steady

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
I think we've just been seeing a steady

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.350 
I think we've just been seeing a steady
increase<00:05:13.590> in<00:05:13.740> specifications<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:14.970> not<00:05:15.180> much

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
increase in specifications and not much

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.960 
increase in specifications and not much
else<00:05:15.980> said<00:05:16.980> should<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.370> buy<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.550> Windows<00:05:17.940> Phone

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
else said should you buy a Windows Phone

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.760 
else said should you buy a Windows Phone
or<00:05:18.360> should<00:05:18.600> you<00:05:18.630> buy<00:05:18.840> an<00:05:18.960> Android<00:05:19.110> phone<00:05:19.320> in

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
or should you buy an Android phone in

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.620 
or should you buy an Android phone in
your<00:05:19.890> next<00:05:20.130> contract<00:05:20.550> upgrade<00:05:21.030> well

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
your next contract upgrade well

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.180 
your next contract upgrade well
personally<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.110> think<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.530> really<00:05:22.770> depends<00:05:23.100> on

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
personally I think it really depends on

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.860 
personally I think it really depends on
your<00:05:23.280> budget<00:05:23.490> if<00:05:23.940> your<00:05:24.120> budget<00:05:24.300> is<00:05:24.480> around<00:05:24.750> the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
your budget if your budget is around the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.990 
your budget if your budget is around the
$600<00:05:25.590> mark<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.100> you're<00:05:26.310> looking<00:05:26.610> for<00:05:26.760> a<00:05:26.820> phone

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
$600 mark and you're looking for a phone

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.930 
$600 mark and you're looking for a phone
with<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.780> know<00:05:27.900> powerful<00:05:28.470> camera<00:05:28.920> and<00:05:29.130> then<00:05:29.910> I

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
with you know powerful camera and then I

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.430 
with you know powerful camera and then I
just<00:05:30.240> think<00:05:30.420> Windows<00:05:30.780> Phone<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.140> really

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
just think Windows Phone is a really

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.500 
just think Windows Phone is a really
good<00:05:31.590> way<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.770> go<00:05:32.100> you'll<00:05:32.760> be<00:05:32.790> getting<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.180> solid

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
good way to go you'll be getting a solid

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.680 
good way to go you'll be getting a solid

with it on top of that where the

with it on top of that where the
flagship<00:05:57.870> device<00:05:58.140> is<00:05:58.320> just<00:05:58.560> they're<00:05:59.070> just

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
more there's more to them I think if you

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.020 
more there's more to them I think if you
actually<00:06:01.830> compare<00:06:02.370> something<00:06:02.730> like<00:06:02.940> the

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
actually compare something like the

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.140 
actually compare something like the
galaxy<00:06:03.150> s5<00:06:03.750> or<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:04.110> HTC<00:06:05.010> One<00:06:05.160> m8<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.940> best

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
galaxy s5 or the HTC One m8 the best

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.220 
galaxy s5 or the HTC One m8 the best
that<00:06:06.300> Windows<00:06:06.600> has<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:06.930> offer

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
that Windows has to offer

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.440 
that Windows has to offer
I<00:06:07.320> think<00:06:07.560> Windows<00:06:08.400> has<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.760> really<00:06:08.970> said<00:06:09.210> about

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
I think Windows has to really said about

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.200 
I think Windows has to really said about
its<00:06:09.630> head<00:06:09.810> in<00:06:09.930> shame<00:06:09.960> you<00:06:10.890> do<00:06:11.100> get<00:06:11.400> more<00:06:11.880> for

its head in shame you do get more for

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.780 
its head in shame you do get more for
paying<00:06:12.480> extra<00:06:12.870> with<00:06:13.140> Android<00:06:13.530> I<00:06:13.560> think<00:06:13.860> so

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
paying extra with Android I think so
