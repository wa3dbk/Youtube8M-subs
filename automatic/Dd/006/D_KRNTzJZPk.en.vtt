 change the multitasking bar 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.980
 as we can see now we will still have 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.260
 image that the application will show us 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.439
 in addition to the con we could close 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.040

 the music has been changed 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.340
 and here we could adjust the brightness 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.890
 of our screen and we will have some 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.689
 shortcuts that will allow us to 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 activate for example the 3g wifi e 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.030
