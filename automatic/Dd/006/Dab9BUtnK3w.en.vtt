from<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.859> game<00:02:03.070> um<00:02:03.430> what<00:02:04.329> they're<00:02:04.479> doing<00:02:04.750> is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
from the game um what they're doing is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.300 
from the game um what they're doing is
they're<00:02:04.869> making<00:02:05.289> tree<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.619> life<00:02:05.770> like<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.009> cool

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
they're making tree of life like a cool

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.969 
they're making tree of life like a cool
down<00:02:06.609> as<00:02:06.880> opposed<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.659> something<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.830> you're

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
down as opposed to something that you're

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.880 
down as opposed to something that you're
always<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:10.479> you're<00:02:10.600> healing<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
always in when you're healing and the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.050 
always in when you're healing and the
reason<00:02:12.160> they<00:02:12.220> did<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.490> was<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:12.910> you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
reason they did this was so that you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.720 
reason they did this was so that you
could<00:02:13.180> also<00:02:13.480> play<00:02:13.810> offensively<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.250> resto

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
could also play offensively as a resto

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.470 
could also play offensively as a resto
druid<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.210> not<00:02:16.420> just<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.050> healer<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:19.150> cool

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
druid and not just be a healer but cool

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.180 
druid and not just be a healer but cool
down<00:02:19.690> based<00:02:19.930> healing<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> resto<00:02:20.890> druid<00:02:21.160> is

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
down based healing for a resto druid is

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.560 
down based healing for a resto druid is
kind<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.520> strange<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.970> me<00:02:22.090> because<00:02:22.210> you're

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
kind of strange to me because you're

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.320 
kind of strange to me because you're
usually<00:02:22.750> raid<00:02:23.260> healing<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.860> you're<00:02:23.980> healing

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
constantly like I don't really

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.440 
constantly like I don't really
understand<00:02:27.760> where<00:02:27.880> they<00:02:28.000> were<00:02:28.060> going<00:02:28.120> with

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
understand where they were going with

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.570

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
reasoning for this let me know because

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.040 
reasoning for this let me know because

druid<00:03:20.440> because<00:03:20.920> it's<00:03:21.130> all<00:03:21.220> based<00:03:21.430> on<00:03:21.610> hot<00:03:21.940> sand

talent to a cool-down talent which is

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.790 
talent to a cool-down talent which is
really<00:03:49.540> weird<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:49.989> me<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.140> don't<00:03:50.440> know<00:03:50.530> let<00:03:50.769> me

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
really weird for me I don't know let me

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.020 
really weird for me I don't know let me
know<00:03:50.980> do<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.220> think<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.519> weird<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.850> think

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
know do you think it's weird I think

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.640 
know do you think it's weird I think
it's<00:03:52.150> really<00:03:52.269> weird<00:03:52.450> they're<00:03:53.260> making<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
it's really weird they're making the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.620 
it's really weird they're making the
feral<00:03:53.890> cat<00:03:54.100> rotation<00:03:54.670> more<00:03:54.880> forgiving<00:03:55.390> so

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
feral cat rotation more forgiving so

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.479 
feral cat rotation more forgiving so
that<00:03:55.840> if<00:03:56.290> you're<00:03:56.470> not<00:03:56.590> using<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.100> exact

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
that if you're not using the exact

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.550 
that if you're not using the exact
perfect<00:03:58.030> correct<00:03:58.570> rotation<00:03:59.140> you're<00:03:59.350> not

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
perfect correct rotation you're not

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.140 
perfect correct rotation you're not
going<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.769> be<00:03:59.860> like<00:03:59.980> doing<00:04:00.280> like<00:04:00.400> half<00:04:00.640> GPS

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
going to be like doing like half GPS

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.860 
going to be like doing like half GPS
because<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.610> cat<00:04:03.910> druid<00:04:04.330> rotation<00:04:04.750> is

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
because the the cat druid rotation is

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.240 
because the the cat druid rotation is
kind<00:04:05.080> of<00:04:05.170> like<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.350> mathematical<00:04:06.040> equation

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
kind of like a mathematical equation

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.190 
kind of like a mathematical equation
like<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.850> think<00:04:07.030> it's<00:04:07.120> very<00:04:07.180> very<00:04:07.660> complicated

and kudos to you rest of us will have a
new<00:04:53.039> talent<00:04:53.520> called<00:04:53.699> efflorescence<00:04:54.539> which

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
new talent called efflorescence which

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.310 
new talent called efflorescence which
causes<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.500> bed<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:55.860> healing<00:04:56.250> flora<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:57.320> grow

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
causes a bed of healing flora to grow

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.050

beneath targets that are critically
healed<00:05:00.270> by<00:05:00.479> regrowth<00:05:00.900> I'm<00:05:01.860> thinking<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:02.370> is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
healed by regrowth I'm thinking this is

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.170

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
have any interrupts and they will be

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.379 
have any interrupts and they will be
adding<00:05:19.050> captain<00:05:19.590> bear's<00:05:19.830> like<00:05:20.099> a<00:05:20.130> kick<00:05:20.490> /

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
adding captain bear's like a kick /

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.170 
adding captain bear's like a kick /
pummel<00:05:21.870> equivalent<00:05:22.470> um<00:05:23.190> an<00:05:23.430> interrupt

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
pummel equivalent um an interrupt

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.700 
pummel equivalent um an interrupt
that'll<00:05:24.449> be<00:05:24.630> off<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.050> global<00:05:25.320> cooldown<00:05:25.500> and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
that'll be off the global cooldown and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.339 
that'll be off the global cooldown and
won't<00:05:26.039> do<00:05:26.190> any<00:05:26.340> damage<00:05:26.780> it'll<00:05:27.780> it'll<00:05:28.169> be

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
won't do any damage it'll it'll be

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.529 
won't do any damage it'll it'll be
really<00:05:28.530> useful<00:05:28.770> for<00:05:29.520> pretty<00:05:30.000> much<00:05:30.060> everything

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
really useful for pretty much everything

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.640 
really useful for pretty much everything
because<00:05:30.930> that's<00:05:31.080> something<00:05:31.199> that<00:05:31.349> feral

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
because that's something that feral

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.260 
because that's something that feral
druids<00:05:31.919> are<00:05:31.979> really<00:05:32.250> lacking<00:05:32.400> right<00:05:32.759> now<00:05:32.820> so<00:05:33.240> I

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
druids are really lacking right now so I

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.150 
druids are really lacking right now so I
think<00:05:33.449> that's<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.810> great<00:05:33.930> change<00:05:34.410> Blizzard

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
think that's a great change Blizzard

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.950
