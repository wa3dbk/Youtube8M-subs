contact<00:00:50.969> lenses<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.480> well<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:52.949> see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
contact lenses as well so as you can see

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
contact lenses as well so as you can see
it<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> makes<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.660> eye<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it kind of makes my eye more of like a

it kind of makes my eye more of like a
steel<00:00:55.890> blue<00:00:56.489> color<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.239> already<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
steel blue color and it's already you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
steel blue color and it's already you
know<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> doesn't<00:00:58.920> seem<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> call<00:00:59.579> cover<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
know it doesn't seem to call cover the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
know it doesn't seem to call cover the
whole<00:01:00.449> eye<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.199> already<00:01:01.469> kind<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
whole eye and it's already kind of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
whole eye and it's already kind of
dissipating<00:01:02.640> quite<00:01:02.910> fast<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.449> color<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.080> says

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
dissipating quite fast in color it says

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.230 
dissipating quite fast in color it says
on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> website<00:01:04.739> last<00:01:04.949> maybe<00:01:05.369> 10<00:01:05.729> minutes<00:01:06.090> but

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
I feel like it lasts just a few seconds

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
I feel like it lasts just a few seconds
at<00:01:08.850> least<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.299> full<00:01:09.630> color

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
