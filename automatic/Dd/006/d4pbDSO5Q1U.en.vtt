00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so for this for this tutorial I'm gonna

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370 
so for this for this tutorial I'm gonna
bend<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.850> way<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.299> did<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> audience

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
bend them this way so did the audience

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.249 
bend them this way so did the audience
they'll<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.220> seeing<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> backs<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> cards

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
they'll be seeing the backs of the cards

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.300 
they'll be seeing the backs of the cards
so<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.350> you're<00:01:19.439> gonna<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.830> hold<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.189> like

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
so what you're gonna do is hold it like

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.789 
so what you're gonna do is hold it like
this<00:01:20.360> palm<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.509> these<00:01:21.659> cards<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this palm all these cards like that and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.499 
this palm all these cards like that and
these<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.490> got<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.060> stick<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
these have got to really stick in the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
these have got to really stick in the
knuckle<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.140> can't<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:26.159> fingers

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
knuckle like you can't have your fingers

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
knuckle like you can't have your fingers
beyond<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> very<00:01:27.119> edge<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
beyond the very edge you have to have

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700 
beyond the very edge you have to have
them<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.150> first<00:01:30.630> knuckle<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
them go to the first knuckle there and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640 
them go to the first knuckle there and
I'll<00:01:31.890> show<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> why<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.430> sec<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.530> have

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
I'll show you why in a sec so I have

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.319 
I'll show you why in a sec so I have
really<00:01:34.860> small<00:01:35.070> hands<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> find<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> really

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
really small hands so I find it really

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.660 
really small hands so I find it really
hard<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> pawn<00:01:37.229> these<00:01:37.409> cards<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.430> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
hard to pawn these cards and if you do I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
hard to pawn these cards and if you do I
figured<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> solution<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.200> just

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
figured the solution for this is to just

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
figured the solution for this is to just
squeeze<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.909> you're<00:01:42.030> doing<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
squeeze when you're doing this and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.060 
squeeze when you're doing this and
you're<00:01:42.659> gonna<00:01:42.780> need<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.170> anyway<00:01:43.409> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
you're gonna need to do this anyway so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.719 
you're gonna need to do this anyway so
you<00:01:44.159> squeeze<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.500> okay<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.640> your

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you squeeze like this okay so that your

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.520 
you squeeze like this okay so that your
thumb<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.149> reach<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.259> your<00:01:49.380> thumb

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
thumb can reach here and when your thumb

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
thumb can reach here and when your thumb
reaches<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.880> thumb<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> gonna<00:01:51.390> do

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
reaches here or your thumb is gonna do

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.230 
reaches here or your thumb is gonna do
is<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.290> gonna<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.920> card<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.729> you're

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
is it's gonna take this card and you're

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.469 
is it's gonna take this card and you're
going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.680> rotate<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.280> didn't<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> very

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
going to rotate it I didn't do that very

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.179 
going to rotate it I didn't do that very
well<00:01:58.880> since<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.149> small<00:02:00.420> hand<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
well since I have small hand so you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
well since I have small hand so you
that's<00:02:02.610> proof<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.149> why<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.360> need<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> lot<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that's proof of why you need a lot of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
that's proof of why you need a lot of
room<00:02:04.049> around<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> knuckles<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.950> because<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
room around the knuckles is because this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
room around the knuckles is because this
really<00:02:06.090> needs<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.689> rotate<00:02:07.590> you're<00:02:07.979> gonna<00:02:08.069> push

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
really needs to rotate you're gonna push

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.449 
really needs to rotate you're gonna push
this<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.709> gonna<00:02:10.800> rotate<00:02:11.129> around

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
this like that it's gonna rotate around

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.729 
this like that it's gonna rotate around
your<00:02:11.730> middle<00:02:11.879> finger<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:13.349> you'll<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
your middle finger and then you'll be

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.010 
your middle finger and then you'll be
showing<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.370> back<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.790> card<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.120> them<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
showing the back of the card to them and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.110 
showing the back of the card to them and
as<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.340> bending<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> cards<00:02:18.030> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
as you see this is bending the cards a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.119 
as you see this is bending the cards a
lot

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
lot

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.479 
lot
okay<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.190> I'll<00:02:20.730> show<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.209> again<00:02:21.440> so

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
okay so I'll show out to you again so

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.260 
okay so I'll show out to you again so
got<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.520> make<00:02:23.670> sure<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.879> have<00:02:23.970> room<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
got to make sure you have room in the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.390 
got to make sure you have room in the
knuckle<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:25.560> kind<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.770> hard<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.190> hide

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
knuckle and it's kind of hard to hide

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.430 
knuckle and it's kind of hard to hide
the<00:02:26.550> cards<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.000> work<00:02:27.629> on<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.959> practice<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the cards just work on that practice it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.229 
the cards just work on that practice it
in<00:02:28.500> front<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.800> mirror<00:02:29.160> whatever<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.030> need

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
in front of a mirror whatever you need

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.210 
in front of a mirror whatever you need
and<00:02:30.450> then<00:02:31.110> you're<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.349> going<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.709> push<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and then you're just going to push this

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.780 
and then you're just going to push this
up<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.379> rotate<00:02:34.379> it<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.489> should<00:02:35.670> just

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
up and rotate it and it should just

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.750 
up and rotate it and it should just
flick<00:02:36.599> out<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.170> into<00:02:37.680> your<00:02:37.800> hand<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.220> from

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
flick out and into your hand and from

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.430 
flick out and into your hand and from
the<00:02:38.879> front<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.930> looks<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:40.260> you're<00:02:40.410> just

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
the front it looks like you're just

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
the front it looks like you're just
holding<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> normal<00:02:41.160> card<00:02:41.580> I'll<00:02:42.180> show

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
holding it like a normal card I'll show

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.949 
holding it like a normal card I'll show
you<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.720> sec<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.540> rotate

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
you that in a sec and so you just rotate

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.850 
you that in a sec and so you just rotate
it<00:02:45.989> up<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.730> get<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.030> motion<00:02:48.239> going

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
it up and then you get that motion going

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.259 
it up and then you get that motion going
and<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:49.950> keep<00:02:50.160> practicing<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.970> motion

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
and just keep practicing that motion

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.509 
and just keep practicing that motion
I'll<00:02:52.140> show<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.680> from<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.920> top<00:02:53.190> since

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
I'll show it to you from the top since

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.720 
I'll show it to you from the top since
you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.760> see<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.000> kind<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:55.220> flick<00:02:56.220> out<00:02:56.430> like

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
you can see it kind of flick out like

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.300 
you can see it kind of flick out like
that<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.900> then<00:02:58.530> when<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.709> get<00:02:58.860> down<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
that and then when you get down to the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.850 
that and then when you get down to the
last<00:02:59.489> card<00:02:59.909> I<00:03:00.180> think<00:03:01.140> I'm<00:03:01.230> at<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.349> last<00:03:01.590> card

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
last card I think I'm at the last card

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.440 
last card I think I'm at the last card
now<00:03:02.010> there's<00:03:02.640> nothing<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.180> do

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
now there's nothing you can really do

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.839 
now there's nothing you can really do
with<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:03.659> one<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.379> can<00:03:04.500> kind<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.769> just

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
with this one so you can kind of just

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.070 
with this one so you can kind of just
secretly<00:03:05.849> put<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.480> top<00:03:06.659> of<00:03:06.870> all<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
secretly put that on top of all the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.240 
secretly put that on top of all the
other<00:03:07.110> ones<00:03:07.319> if<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.650> were<00:03:07.769> gathering<00:03:08.099> them

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
other ones if you were gathering them

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:18.110 
other ones if you were gathering them
into<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.489> hand<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.370> again<00:03:17.760> I'll<00:03:17.909> show

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
that to you from the front view so you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.630 
that to you from the front view so you
got<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> palm<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.620> cards<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.159> this<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.610> of

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
got a palm the cards and this is kind of

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.940 
got a palm the cards and this is kind of
hard<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.450> spot<00:03:24.690> because<00:03:25.200> for<00:03:25.830> me

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
hard to do on the spot because for me

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.410 
hard to do on the spot because for me
it's<00:03:26.069> really<00:03:26.190> sensitive<00:03:26.670> since<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.060> have<00:03:27.180> small

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
it's really sensitive since I have small

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.589 
it's really sensitive since I have small
hands<00:03:27.659> I<00:03:28.019> have<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.590> kind<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.920> palm<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.480> know

in<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.170> right<00:03:31.290> spot<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.739> be<00:03:31.799> able<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:32.010> do

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
in just the right spot to be able to do

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.119 
in just the right spot to be able to do

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
it so to the spectator it looked like

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.149 
it so to the spectator it looked like
that<00:03:35.370> now<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:36.450> if<00:03:36.900> you're<00:03:37.230> doing<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.860> it's

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.800 
that now now if you're doing it and it's
looking<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.819> kind<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.269> sagging

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
looking like that kind of sagging

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.320 
looking like that kind of sagging
instead<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.099> this<00:03:41.489> since<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.090> looks

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
instead of like this since that looks

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.729 
instead of like this since that looks
really<00:03:42.569> good<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.989> means<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.500> you're<00:03:43.590> not

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
really good that means that you're not

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.550 
really good that means that you're not
rotating<00:03:44.370> around<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.720> knuckle<00:03:46.170> point<00:03:46.409> that

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
rotating around that knuckle point that

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.680 
rotating around that knuckle point that
I<00:03:46.620> was<00:03:46.739> talking<00:03:46.920> about<00:03:47.159> enough<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.480> really

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
I was talking about enough so you really

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.970 
I was talking about enough so you really
need<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> make<00:03:48.989> sure<00:03:49.019> you've<00:03:49.230> enough<00:03:49.440> room<00:03:49.709> you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
need to make sure you've enough room you

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.680 
need to make sure you've enough room you
might<00:03:50.489> see<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.790> cards<00:03:51.030> here<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.390> just<00:03:51.510> want

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
might see the cards here but I just want

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.080 
might see the cards here but I just want
to<00:03:51.750> show<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.069> that<00:03:53.069> looks<00:03:53.340> really<00:03:53.549> effective

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
to show you that looks really effective

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.940 
to show you that looks really effective
even<00:03:54.450> though<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.599> could<00:03:54.750> see<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.989> cards<00:03:55.319> it's

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
even though you could see the cards it's

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.259 
even though you could see the cards it's
like<00:03:56.099> if<00:03:56.340> you're<00:03:56.959> it's<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:59.060> versus<00:04:00.060> like

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
like if you're it's this versus like

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.910 
like if you're it's this versus like
that<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:03.209> that's<00:04:03.599> kind<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:03.959> bad<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.500> want

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
that so that that's kind of bad you want

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.350 
that so that that's kind of bad you want
to<00:04:05.010> work<00:04:05.129> up<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.489> rotate<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.030> knuckles

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
to work up so you rotate on the knuckles

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.289 
to work up so you rotate on the knuckles
and<00:04:06.510> be<00:04:06.569> able<00:04:06.629> to<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:06.959> that

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
and be able to do that

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.210 
and be able to do that
so<00:04:09.299> obviously<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.049> don't<00:04:10.290> practice<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.980> much

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
so obviously I don't practice this much

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.070 
so obviously I don't practice this much
it's<00:04:11.580> not<00:04:11.640> one<00:04:11.879> of<00:04:11.970> my<00:04:12.060> top<00:04:12.269> priority<00:04:12.750> tricks

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
it's not one of my top priority tricks

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.690 
it's not one of my top priority tricks
because<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.650> can't<00:04:13.830> really<00:04:14.010> incorporate<00:04:14.610> it

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
because you can't really incorporate it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.420 
because you can't really incorporate it
into<00:04:14.879> any<00:04:15.150> routines<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:15.959> it's<00:04:16.919> pretty<00:04:17.160> flashy

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
into any routines but it's pretty flashy

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.099 
into any routines but it's pretty flashy
just<00:04:17.759> to<00:04:17.940> show<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.570> know<00:04:18.600> what<00:04:18.810> you're<00:04:18.930> doing

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
just to show you know what you're doing

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.020 
just to show you know what you're doing
with<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.320> cards<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.669> pretty<00:04:20.850> amazing

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
with the cards and it's pretty amazing

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.340 
with the cards and it's pretty amazing
even<00:04:21.419> though<00:04:21.540> people<00:04:21.900> will<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.229> have

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
even though people will know you have

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.520 
even though people will know you have
something<00:04:22.740> your<00:04:23.009> hand<00:04:23.220> because

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
something your hand because

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.560 
something your hand because
does<00:04:23.680> look<00:04:23.830> suspicious<00:04:24.430> but<00:04:25.000> they'll<00:04:25.300> really

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
does look suspicious but they'll really

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.210 
does look suspicious but they'll really
be<00:04:25.660> amazed<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.170> you<00:04:26.260> can<00:04:26.380> just<00:04:26.530> start<00:04:26.710> flipping
