about it's not me that's got to tell the
boys

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.020 

this<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.770> again<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.039> has<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> lot<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.759> charm

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
this is again that has a lot of charm

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.399 
this is again that has a lot of charm
much<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.479> its<00:01:57.630> predecessor<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
much like its predecessor and the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.050 
much like its predecessor and the
constant<00:01:58.920> shift<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.310> protagonists<00:01:59.969> and

themes<00:02:00.600> mission<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> mission<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.710> definitely

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
themes mission to mission is definitely

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.730 
themes mission to mission is definitely
one<00:02:02.429> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> game's<00:02:02.729> biggest<00:02:02.939> strengths<00:02:03.509> as

one of the game's biggest strengths as

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.580 
one of the game's biggest strengths as

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.379 
a crapload of depth and like I said
earlier<00:06:30.099> it<00:06:30.279> trumps<00:06:30.639> the<00:06:30.699> first<00:06:31.029> game<00:06:31.210> in

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
earlier it trumps the first game in

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.659 
earlier it trumps the first game in
every<00:06:31.599> conceivable<00:06:31.960> way<00:06:32.409> from<00:06:33.159> the<00:06:33.279> visuals

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
every conceivable way from the visuals

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:34.890 
every conceivable way from the visuals
through<00:06:33.940> to<00:06:34.089> the<00:06:34.180> mechanics<00:06:34.659> and<00:06:34.810> the

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
through to the mechanics and the

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.170 
through to the mechanics and the
gameplay<00:06:35.110> on<00:06:35.440> a<00:06:35.469> much<00:06:35.650> deeper<00:06:35.830> level<00:06:36.180> that's

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
gameplay on a much deeper level that's

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.459 
gameplay on a much deeper level that's
not<00:06:37.330> to<00:06:37.449> say<00:06:37.599> that<00:06:37.629> the<00:06:37.870> first<00:06:38.080> game<00:06:38.229> is<00:06:38.440> a

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
not to say that the first game is a

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.809 
not to say that the first game is a
write-off<00:06:38.770> but<00:06:39.099> if<00:06:39.190> you've<00:06:39.310> got<00:06:39.460> these<00:06:39.610> two

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
write-off but if you've got these two

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.450 
write-off but if you've got these two
side-by-side<00:06:40.150> the<00:06:40.930> choice<00:06:41.199> is<00:06:41.379> simple<00:06:41.529> good

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
side-by-side the choice is simple good

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.540 
side-by-side the choice is simple good

serious hours into now I might be a

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 
little bit biased but I really think it

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.890 
little bit biased but I really think it

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
this review I'm reminded just how

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.029 
this review I'm reminded just how
enjoyable<00:07:07.120> and<00:07:07.360> fun<00:07:07.629> it<00:07:07.750> is<00:07:07.839> overall<00:07:08.229> and<00:07:08.949> I'm

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 
enjoyable and fun it is overall and I'm

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.529 
enjoyable and fun it is overall and I'm
sure<00:07:09.189> anyone<00:07:09.460> else<00:07:09.669> who<00:07:09.789> gets<00:07:09.939> their<00:07:10.120> hands<00:07:10.479> on

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539 
sure anyone else who gets their hands on

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.050 
sure anyone else who gets their hands on
it<00:07:10.599> will<00:07:10.810> think<00:07:11.020> the<00:07:11.169> same<00:07:11.379> thing<00:07:11.710> I<00:07:12.060> can

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
it will think the same thing I can

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
it will think the same thing I can
remember<00:07:13.240> reading<00:07:13.479> a<00:07:13.629> review<00:07:13.810> for<00:07:13.900> this<00:07:14.020> game

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
remember reading a review for this game

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.689 
remember reading a review for this game
in<00:07:14.319> a<00:07:14.379> magazine<00:07:14.560> that<00:07:14.889> basically<00:07:15.250> said<00:07:15.580> that

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
in a magazine that basically said that

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.249 
in a magazine that basically said that
this<00:07:15.849> game<00:07:16.060> would<00:07:16.180> appeal<00:07:16.509> to<00:07:16.689> anyone<00:07:16.960> with

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:17.259 
this game would appeal to anyone with

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.200 
this game would appeal to anyone with
reflexes<00:07:17.919> and<00:07:18.069> a<00:07:18.159> central<00:07:18.520> nervous<00:07:18.729> system

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
reflexes and a central nervous system

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.730 
reflexes and a central nervous system
and<00:07:19.449> I<00:07:19.750> couldn't<00:07:20.050> have<00:07:20.139> said<00:07:20.259> it<00:07:20.289> better<00:07:20.379> if<00:07:20.650> I

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
and I couldn't have said it better if I

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.740 
and I couldn't have said it better if I
try
