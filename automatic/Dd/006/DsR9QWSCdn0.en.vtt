it's a Makana voor and there's the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's a Makana voor and there's the
instruction<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:46.950> know

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
instruction so I really don't know

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.260 
instruction so I really don't know
anything<00:00:47.219> about<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:49.020> never<00:00:50.000> assembled<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
or played with it so here we go lots of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.979 
or played with it so here we go lots of
pieces<00:00:55.940> let's<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.210> idea<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.719> first

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
pieces let's get an idea here first

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.439 
pieces let's get an idea here first
let's<00:00:58.890> hold<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> instruction<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.149> number

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
let's hold up the instruction so number

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.900 
let's hold up the instruction so number
one<00:01:00.690> you're<00:01:01.410> stacking<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.129> structure<00:01:02.730> number

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
one you're stacking the structure number

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
one you're stacking the structure number
two<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.870> setting<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.199> your<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
two you're setting up your can of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.620 
two you're setting up your can of
Paulton<00:01:04.949> three<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:06.060> knocking<00:01:06.450> things

Paulton three you're knocking things

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
Paulton three you're knocking things
down<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.130> sure<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:08.610> saying

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
down so I'm not sure what they're saying

land try to cat oh so it's an option I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
land try to cat oh so it's an option I
guess<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.689> try<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.960> into<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> box<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.250> let's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
guess to try it into the box so let's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.620 
guess to try it into the box so let's
see<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.000> show<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.689> here<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:21.060> show<00:01:21.330> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
here no not that one

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.609 
here no not that one
let's<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> pieces<00:01:24.930> first<00:01:25.350> let's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
let's see all the pieces first let's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.219 
let's see all the pieces first let's
analyze<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> straight<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
analyze here so the straight one is the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.490 
analyze here so the straight one is the
center<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:34.070> mmm<00:01:36.020> c'mon<00:01:37.020> boys

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
center one this is the mmm c'mon boys

and girls their pictures are horrible oh
there's<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.280> pieces<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> goes<00:01:42.360> on

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
there's more pieces here this goes on

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.069 
there's more pieces here this goes on
the<00:01:42.540> top<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> here's<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.829> we're<00:01:46.979> launching

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
the top so here's what we're launching

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.460 
the top so here's what we're launching
so<00:01:49.079> let's<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.380> least<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> launcher<00:01:50.340> set

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
so let's at least get the launcher set

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.800 
so let's at least get the launcher set
we<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.920> can't<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> he's<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
we can do that can't we so he's going to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.679 
we can do that can't we so he's going to
go<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.110> there<00:01:58.579> do<00:01:59.579> they<00:01:59.700> show<00:01:59.909> any<00:02:00.030> specific

you see so he's going to fly this is the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.760 
you see so he's going to fly this is the
top<00:02:09.539> piece<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> structure<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
top piece of the structure this is the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.830 
top piece of the structure this is the
center<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.810> then<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:13.560> show

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
like a puzzle I don't like that looks

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.009 
like a puzzle I don't like that looks
more<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:42.849> doesn't<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.569> I<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.810> tell

from the picture exactly what they want
they<00:02:50.440> show<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.860> one<00:02:51.069> on<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.310> right<00:02:51.519> they

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
they show this one on the right they

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.059 
they show this one on the right they
show<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.420> z1<00:02:54.090> umm<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:57.130> left<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.650> then<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.890> show

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
show the z1 umm the left and then I show

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.229 
show the z1 umm the left and then I show
this<00:03:00.280> one<00:03:00.489> next

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
this one next

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.960 
this one next
but<00:03:01.930> with<00:03:02.079> this<00:03:02.489> upside<00:03:03.489> down<00:03:03.519> with<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.090> nub

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
but with this upside down with this nub

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.259 
but with this upside down with this nub
very<00:03:06.970> confusing<00:03:08.940> Wow

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
very confusing Wow

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.080 
very confusing Wow
all<00:03:10.989> right<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.500> saw<00:03:11.769> cut<00:03:12.099> there<00:03:12.370> why

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
all right so you saw cut there why

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.569 
all right so you saw cut there why
because<00:03:14.220> these<00:03:15.220> instructions<00:03:16.000> are<00:03:16.410> wrong

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
because these instructions are wrong

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.640 
because these instructions are wrong
compared<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.790> website<00:03:19.359> this<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.230> not<00:03:20.470> how

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
compared to the website this is not how

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.740 
compared to the website this is not how
you<00:03:20.709> build<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.100> structure<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.630> you

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
you build the structure this is you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.039 
you build the structure this is you
build<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.079> structure<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:24.819> actually<00:03:25.049> fits

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
build a structure and it actually fits

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.580 
build a structure and it actually fits
this<00:03:26.350> way<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:27.250> way<00:03:27.540> does<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:29.019> mean<00:03:29.290> would

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
this way this way does not I mean would

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.319 
this way this way does not I mean would
be<00:03:29.620> very<00:03:29.980> difficult<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.519> stack<00:03:30.790> these<00:03:30.970> kinds

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
be very difficult to stack these kinds

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.970 
be very difficult to stack these kinds
of<00:03:31.359> blocks<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:31.810> way<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.319> sorry<00:03:32.709> about<00:03:32.950> that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
of blocks this way so sorry about that

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.300 
of blocks this way so sorry about that
splice<00:03:33.790> there<00:03:34.380> but<00:03:35.380> how<00:03:35.500> would<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.799> know<00:03:35.980> if

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
splice there but how would you know if

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.449 
splice there but how would you know if
you<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:37.359> toy<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.769> try<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.040> build<00:03:39.280> it

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
you get this toy and you try to build it

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.150 
you get this toy and you try to build it
this<00:03:39.579> way<00:03:39.880> when<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.049> website<00:03:41.260> shows<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.950> this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
this way when the website shows it this

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.000 
this way when the website shows it this
way<00:03:42.489> now<00:03:43.090> if<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.269> look<00:03:43.450> at<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.690> pieces

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
way now if you look at the pieces

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.009 
way now if you look at the pieces
there's<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.130> reason<00:03:45.669> the<00:03:45.819> taps<00:03:46.090> are<00:03:46.329> flat<00:03:46.660> here

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
there's a reason the taps are flat here

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.009 
there's a reason the taps are flat here
the<00:03:47.200> bottoms<00:03:47.680> have<00:03:47.919> grooves<00:03:48.730> in<00:03:49.000> them<00:03:49.209> because

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
the bottoms have grooves in them because

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.740 
the bottoms have grooves in them because
these<00:03:50.200> grooves<00:03:50.700> fit<00:03:51.700> with<00:03:51.880> these<00:03:52.090> groups<00:03:52.480> and

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
these grooves fit with these groups and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.470 
these grooves fit with these groups and
kind<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.319> hold<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.739> in<00:03:53.829> place<00:03:54.040> then<00:03:54.940> even<00:03:55.329> this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
kind of hold it in place then even this

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.620 
kind of hold it in place then even this
section<00:03:56.109> see<00:03:56.650> how<00:03:56.769> this<00:03:56.919> kind<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.310> works

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
section see how this kind of works

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.809 
section see how this kind of works
together<00:03:58.630> not<00:03:59.500> not<00:03:59.859> totally<00:04:00.250> together<00:04:00.549> but<00:04:00.730> it

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
together not not totally together but it

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.819 
together not not totally together but it
works<00:04:01.000> together<00:04:01.329> now<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.650> say

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
works together now is that to say

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.289 
works together now is that to say
there's<00:04:03.069> only<00:04:03.190> one<00:04:03.370> way<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.730> build<00:04:04.060> it

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
there's only one way to build it

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.210 
there's only one way to build it
um<00:04:04.780> again<00:04:05.019> if<00:04:05.290> I'm<00:04:05.410> gonna<00:04:05.530> try<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.829> build<00:04:06.069> it

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
um again if I'm gonna try to build it

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.259 
um again if I'm gonna try to build it
their<00:04:06.430> way<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.139> and<00:04:08.549> then<00:04:09.549> this<00:04:09.910> piece

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
their way like this and then this piece

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.180 
their way like this and then this piece
it<00:04:11.109> doesn't<00:04:11.470> make<00:04:11.560> any<00:04:11.709> sense

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.229 

it<00:04:15.190> really<00:04:15.400> doesn't<00:04:17.519> they<00:04:18.519> kind<00:04:18.849> of<00:04:18.940> show<00:04:19.090> this

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
it really doesn't they kind of show this

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.569 
it really doesn't they kind of show this
piece<00:04:19.450> upside<00:04:19.900> down<00:04:20.109> but<00:04:20.349> so<00:04:21.220> that's<00:04:21.370> why<00:04:21.519> I

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
piece upside down but so that's why I

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.070 
piece upside down but so that's why I
was<00:04:21.729> struggling<00:04:22.000> there<00:04:22.300> it's<00:04:22.659> like<00:04:22.750> hmm

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
was struggling there it's like hmm

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.770 
was struggling there it's like hmm
what's<00:04:23.530> going<00:04:23.830> on<00:04:23.950> here<00:04:24.280> why<00:04:25.060> did<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:25.390> show<00:04:25.630> us

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
what's going on here why did you show us

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.290 
what's going on here why did you show us
this<00:04:26.050> way

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
this way

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.690 
this way
it'd<00:04:28.300> be<00:04:28.480> very<00:04:28.510> difficult<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.470> build<00:04:29.620> going<00:04:30.580> to

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
it'd be very difficult to build going to

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.940 
it'd be very difficult to build going to
have<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.850> lot<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.180> upset<00:04:31.480> kids<00:04:31.780> out<00:04:31.960> there<00:04:32.230> so

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
have a lot of upset kids out there so

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.400 
have a lot of upset kids out there so
again<00:04:33.250> let<00:04:34.180> me<00:04:34.210> show<00:04:34.270> you<00:04:34.480> one<00:04:34.690> more<00:04:34.720> time

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
again let me show you one more time

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.650 
again let me show you one more time
you<00:04:36.130> can<00:04:36.280> kind<00:04:36.490> of<00:04:36.550> see<00:04:36.760> how<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:36.970> pieces<00:04:37.270> match

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
you can kind of see how the pieces match

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.600 
you can kind of see how the pieces match
together<00:04:38.190> like<00:04:39.190> that<00:04:40.020> then<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.140> take<00:04:41.380> your

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
together like that then you take your

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.700 
together like that then you take your
not<00:04:42.610> side<00:04:43.000> not<00:04:43.300> side<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.990> put<00:04:44.200> those<00:04:44.380> down

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
not side not side you put those down

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.010 
not side not side you put those down
onto<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.430> tower<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:49.180> does<00:04:49.390> stack<00:04:49.720> better

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
onto this tower it does stack better

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:58.410 
onto this tower it does stack better
when<00:04:50.230> you<00:04:50.350> do<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:56.730> then<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.910> last<00:04:58.120> piece

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
when you do that and then the last piece

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.480 
when you do that and then the last piece
sits<00:04:58.780> here<00:05:00.330> then<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:02.470> take<00:05:02.740> your<00:05:02.770> launcher

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
sits here then you take your launcher

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.650 
sits here then you take your launcher
and<00:05:04.420> you<00:05:04.480> put<00:05:05.170> your<00:05:05.820> little<00:05:06.820> fella<00:05:07.120> on<00:05:07.360> there

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
and you put your little fella on there

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:19.709 
and you put your little fella on there
hold<00:05:08.050> on<00:05:08.170> a<00:05:08.230> second

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.679 

okay<00:05:20.559> so<00:05:20.619> now<00:05:21.009> we're<00:05:21.459> ready<00:05:21.669> to<00:05:21.759> test<00:05:22.059> the

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:22.689 
okay so now we're ready to test the

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.959 
okay so now we're ready to test the
launch<00:05:22.959> so<00:05:23.860> we'll<00:05:24.009> see<00:05:24.189> how<00:05:24.339> this<00:05:24.489> works<00:05:24.789> for

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
launch so we'll see how this works for

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.219 
launch so we'll see how this works for
the<00:05:25.239> first<00:05:25.509> attempt

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
the first attempt

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.719 
the first attempt
ooh<00:05:26.999> not<00:05:27.999> bad<00:05:28.059> flies<00:05:28.629> good<00:05:28.929> went<00:05:29.139> right<00:05:29.349> over

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
ooh not bad flies good went right over

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
so you see how his he kind of locks in

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.119 
so you see how his he kind of locks in

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
there little his tail sits underneath

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.129 
there little his tail sits underneath
into<00:05:36.489> that<00:05:36.639> area<00:05:36.969> there<00:05:37.179> so<00:05:37.539> let's<00:05:37.749> go<00:05:37.899> back<00:05:37.929> a

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139
