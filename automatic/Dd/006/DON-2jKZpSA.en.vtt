of a showing you a little bit of how the

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.109 
of a showing you a little bit of how the
shifting<00:00:26.180> works<00:00:26.359> it<00:00:26.600> looks<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.410> same<00:00:27.680> as

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
shifting works it looks the same as

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.420 
shifting works it looks the same as
camping<00:00:29.119> no<00:00:29.240> those<00:00:29.680> herbal<00:00:30.680> power<00:00:30.859> shifting

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
camping no those herbal power shifting

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.759 
camping no those herbal power shifting
the<00:00:31.609> mechanical<00:00:32.269> one<00:00:32.419> and<00:00:32.660> that<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:32.930> have<00:00:33.199> the

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
the mechanical one and that you have the

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.729 
the mechanical one and that you have the
one<00:00:33.980> lever<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.809> on<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.640> body<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.739> shifter

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
one lever and on the body of the shifter

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.520 
one lever and on the body of the shifter
and<00:00:39.860> then<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:40.579> have<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.790> second<00:00:41.390> lever<00:00:41.540> inside

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
and then you have a second lever inside

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.000 
and then you have a second lever inside
the<00:00:43.399> brake<00:00:43.610> lever<00:00:43.850> itself<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:44.809> it<00:00:45.800> works

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
the brake lever itself and it works

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.150 
the brake lever itself and it works
exactly<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.520> same<00:00:46.790> in<00:00:46.969> terms<00:00:47.000> of<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:48.800> press

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
exactly the same in terms of you press

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.340 
exactly the same in terms of you press
on<00:00:49.520> one<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:50.090> push<00:00:50.329> on<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.600> other<00:00:50.750> however

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
on one and you push on the other however

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.400 
on one and you push on the other however
of<00:00:51.620> course<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:51.950> electronic<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.300> if<00:00:54.170> you

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
of course it's electronic so if you

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.110 
of course it's electronic so if you
press<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:55.250> on<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:56.230> then<00:00:57.230> you'll<00:00:57.640> get<00:00:58.640> shifting

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
press in on it then you'll get shifting

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.670 
press in on it then you'll get shifting
happening<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.140> if<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.320> move<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.590> other

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
happening and if you move the other

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.969 
happening and if you move the other
direction<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:02.000> moves<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.449> other<00:01:02.480> way<00:01:05.770> now<00:01:06.770> one

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
direction it moves the other way now one

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.980 
direction it moves the other way now one
of<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.130> things<00:01:07.479> that's<00:01:08.479> interesting<00:01:08.689> about

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
of the things that's interesting about

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.630 
of the things that's interesting about
this<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.560> if<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:09.860> just<00:01:10.159> hold<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.640> lever<00:01:10.869> then

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
this is if you just hold the lever then

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.710 
this is if you just hold the lever then
it<00:01:13.640> goes<00:01:13.790> all<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:13.970> way<00:01:14.030> down<00:01:14.240> if<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.479> hold<00:01:14.630> got

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
it goes all the way down if you hold got

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.630 
it goes all the way down if you hold got
a<00:01:14.750> lever<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.860> goes<00:01:15.979> all<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.159> way<00:01:16.250> up<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.470> a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
a lever it goes all the way up this is a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.730 
a lever it goes all the way up this is a
clay<00:01:19.640> unique<00:01:20.150> feature<00:01:20.420> because<00:01:20.869> mom<00:01:21.380> does<00:01:21.590> not

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
clay unique feature because mom does not

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.870 
clay unique feature because mom does not
have<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:21.979> which<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.460> one<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.729> things

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
have that which is one of the things

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.850 
have that which is one of the things
that<00:01:23.060> some<00:01:23.630> people<00:01:23.659> do<00:01:24.140> complain<00:01:24.350> about<00:01:24.590> with

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
that some people do complain about with

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.940 
that some people do complain about with
it<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.610> they<00:01:26.540> have<00:01:26.720> managed<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.259> come<00:01:27.590> up<00:01:27.740> with

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
it so they have managed to come up with

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.380 
it so they have managed to come up with
something<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.610> would<00:01:28.729> be<00:01:28.820> differentiates

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
something that would be differentiates

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:52.150 
something that would be differentiates
them<00:01:30.159> front<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.280> rear<00:01:31.400> both<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.820> same

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160
