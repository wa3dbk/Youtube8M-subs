token<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:06.010> can<00:03:06.250> flip<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.670> all<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.060> way

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
token you can flip this all the way

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.809 
token you can flip this all the way
around<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.569> back<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.049> use<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.040> magnet

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
around to the back and use that magnet

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.530 
around to the back and use that magnet
as<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.870> stand<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.129> see<00:03:12.579> how<00:03:13.090> I've<00:03:13.269> kind

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
as a stand so you can see how I've kind

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.720 
as a stand so you can see how I've kind
of<00:03:13.629> tucked<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:15.040> magnetically

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
of tucked it in and it magnetically

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.409 
of tucked it in and it magnetically
attaches<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:17.590> stand<00:03:18.069> works<00:03:18.549> ok<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.269> is

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
attaches this stand works ok it is

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.020 
attaches this stand works ok it is
almost<00:03:19.780> straight<00:03:19.959> up<00:03:20.169> and<00:03:20.440> down<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.889> say<00:03:21.700> ok

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
almost straight up and down I say ok

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.759 
almost straight up and down I say ok
because<00:03:22.209> remember<00:03:22.569> this<00:03:22.810> case<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.290> targeted

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
because remember this case is targeted

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.670 
because remember this case is targeted
towards<00:03:24.010> lap<00:03:24.849> use<00:03:25.180> or<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.660> your<00:03:25.810> leg<00:03:26.109> and<00:03:26.349> so<00:03:26.560> it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
towards lap use or on your leg and so it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.559 
towards lap use or on your leg and so it
has<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.859> bit<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.250> contour<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.540> a

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
has a bit of a contour to it so it is a

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.119 
has a bit of a contour to it so it is a
little<00:03:28.810> bit<00:03:28.989> more<00:03:29.169> wobbly<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.769> can<00:03:29.950> see

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
little bit more wobbly and you can see

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.069 
little bit more wobbly and you can see
what<00:03:30.310> just<00:03:30.549> happened<00:03:30.940> when<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.120> wobble<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.750> too

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
what just happened when I wobble it too

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.400 
what just happened when I wobble it too
much<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.590> falls<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.730> be<00:03:34.510> cautious<00:03:34.810> when<00:03:35.260> you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
much it falls so be cautious when you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.520 
much it falls so be cautious when you
use<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.919> stand<00:03:36.370> mode<00:03:36.730> because<00:03:37.419> you<00:03:38.139> run<00:03:38.410> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
use this stand mode because you run the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.009 
use this stand mode because you run the
risk<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.889> having<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.310> happen<00:03:39.700> but<00:03:40.450> again<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
risk of having that happen but again I

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.050 
risk of having that happen but again I
think<00:03:41.980> that's<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.310> nature<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.699> this<00:03:42.819> case

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
think that's the nature of this case

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.229 
think that's the nature of this case
being<00:03:43.419> targeted<00:03:44.019> towards<00:03:44.470> lap<00:03:44.949> use<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.760> a

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
being targeted towards lap use in a

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.569 
being targeted towards lap use in a
typing<00:03:46.720> angle<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:47.169> a<00:03:47.199> table<00:03:47.650> again<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.430> is

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
typing angle on a table again this is

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.949 
typing angle on a table again this is
what<00:03:48.760> it's<00:03:48.879> going<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.030> look<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.599> is<00:03:49.629> much

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
what it's going to look like it is much

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.110 
what it's going to look like it is much
more<00:03:49.989> stable<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:51.310> if<00:03:51.430> you're<00:03:51.579> wondering<00:03:51.760> what

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
more stable so if you're wondering what

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.430 
more stable so if you're wondering what
this<00:03:52.180> looks<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:52.599> when<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:52.959> rest<00:03:53.139> it<00:03:53.290> on<00:03:53.379> your

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
this looks like when you rest it on your

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.409 
this looks like when you rest it on your
leg<00:03:53.739> after<00:03:54.010> all<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.549> is<00:03:54.730> what<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.120> case<00:03:55.359> is

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
leg after all that is what this case is

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.599 
leg after all that is what this case is
all<00:03:55.720> about<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:56.379> contour<00:03:56.980> here<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.459> mag

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
all about this contour here on the mag

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.449 
all about this contour here on the mag
folio<00:03:58.030> lounge<00:03:58.359> just<00:03:59.109> fits<00:03:59.530> right<00:03:59.650> on<00:04:00.010> top<00:04:00.340> of

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
folio lounge just fits right on top of

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.610 
folio lounge just fits right on top of
your<00:04:00.549> leg<00:04:00.699> like<00:04:00.879> that<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:01.959> can<00:04:02.139> see<00:04:02.379> it's

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
your leg like that and you can see it's

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.409 
your leg like that and you can see it's
pretty<00:04:02.889> stable<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:03.669> if<00:04:03.819> you're<00:04:04.000> on<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> bus<00:04:04.389> a

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
pretty stable so if you're on a bus a

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.809 
pretty stable so if you're on a bus a
train<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.989> plane<00:04:05.169> maybe<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.680> car<00:04:06.069> you<00:04:06.579> don't<00:04:06.730> have

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
train a plane maybe a car you don't have

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.789 
train a plane maybe a car you don't have
a<00:04:06.879> tabletop<00:04:07.239> available<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.349> can<00:04:08.500> do<00:04:08.650> your

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
a tabletop available you can do your

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.860 
a tabletop available you can do your
work<00:04:09.040> play<00:04:09.340> your<00:04:09.489> game<00:04:09.699> whatever<00:04:10.269> it<00:04:10.419> is<00:04:10.599> on

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
work play your game whatever it is on

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.530 
work play your game whatever it is on
your<00:04:11.079> leg<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.980> works<00:04:12.250> very<00:04:12.489> well<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.419> the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
your leg and it works very well so the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.180 
your leg and it works very well so the
final<00:04:13.720> thing<00:04:13.900> I'll<00:04:14.199> mention<00:04:14.349> about<00:04:14.739> this<00:04:14.949> case

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
final thing I'll mention about this case

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.219 
final thing I'll mention about this case
is<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.400> when<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:16.030> closed<00:04:16.479> because<00:04:16.870> it's

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
is that when it is closed because it's

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.050 
is that when it is closed because it's
using<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.709> magnet<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.370> stays<00:04:18.639> closed

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
using that magnet it stays closed

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.699 
using that magnet it stays closed
relatively<00:04:19.810> well<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.169> don't<00:04:20.320> have<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.500> worry

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
relatively well you don't have to worry

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.620 
relatively well you don't have to worry
about<00:04:20.829> it<00:04:21.130> flopping<00:04:21.609> open<00:04:21.969> and<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.479> other

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
about it flopping open and the other

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.360 
about it flopping open and the other
thing<00:04:22.719> is<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.229> holds<00:04:23.530> its<00:04:23.620> position<00:04:24.099> pretty

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
thing is it holds its position pretty

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.180 
thing is it holds its position pretty
well<00:04:25.080> so<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.349> can<00:04:26.500> see<00:04:26.710> it's<00:04:26.890> not<00:04:27.010> going

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
well so that you can see it's not going

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.750 
well so that you can see it's not going
to<00:04:27.250> put<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.550> to

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
to put it to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.250 
to put it to
to<00:04:27.820> sleep<00:04:28.450> when<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:28.720> kind<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.930> move<00:04:29.080> it<00:04:29.200> around

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
to sleep when you kind of move it around

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.140 
to sleep when you kind of move it around
like<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.160> here's<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.580> deal<00:04:30.610> at<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.030> end

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
like that so here's the deal at the end

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.520 
like that so here's the deal at the end
of<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.330> day<00:04:31.480> I'm<00:04:31.660> going<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.050> give<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.350> mag

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
of the day I'm going to give the mag

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.810 
of the day I'm going to give the mag
folia<00:04:32.950> lounge<00:04:33.250> by<00:04:33.460> spec<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.240> 4<00:04:35.050> out<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.350> 5<00:04:35.820> this

folia lounge by spec a 4 out of 5 this

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.210 
folia lounge by spec a 4 out of 5 this
is<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.030> very<00:04:37.120> targeted<00:04:37.600> case<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.500> would<00:04:38.650> say<00:04:38.920> it's

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
is a very targeted case I would say it's

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.490 
is a very targeted case I would say it's
not<00:04:39.580> going<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:39.820> be<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.120> everybody<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.750> again

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
not going to be for everybody and again

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.080 
not going to be for everybody and again
if<00:04:41.830> you're<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.160> business<00:04:42.370> traveler<00:04:43.060> or

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
maybe a plane a bus car and you just

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.570 
maybe a plane a bus car and you just
need<00:04:50.050> some<00:04:50.380> type<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.920> working<00:04:51.430> environment

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580

you don't have access to a desktop or a
tabletop<00:04:55.950> what<00:04:56.950> are<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.100> going<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.280> do<00:04:57.370> you're

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
tabletop what are you going to do you're

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.650 
tabletop what are you going to do you're
going<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.640> put<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.850> on<00:04:57.880> your<00:04:58.030> leg<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.540> know

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
going to put it on your leg and you know

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.260 
going to put it on your leg and you know
what<00:04:58.780> this<00:04:58.930> case<00:04:59.200> is<00:04:59.260> where<00:04:59.740> it<00:05:00.190> excels<00:05:00.610> is<00:05:00.880> on

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
what this case is where it excels is on

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.880 
what this case is where it excels is on
your<00:05:01.690> leg<00:05:01.900> as<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.200> see<00:05:02.350> right<00:05:02.380> there<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.860> you

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
your leg as you see right there and you

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.460 
your leg as you see right there and you
saw<00:05:03.130> in<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.280> video<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.940> for<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.870> think<00:05:05.230> it

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
saw in the video so for that I think it

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.410 
saw in the video so for that I think it
really<00:05:05.500> execute<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.520> feature<00:05:06.790> quite<00:05:07.180> well

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
really execute this feature quite well

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.180 
really execute this feature quite well
now<00:05:07.930> if<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.170> take<00:05:08.350> it<00:05:08.500> off<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.800> your<00:05:08.860> leg<00:05:09.010> and

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
now if you take it off of your leg and

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.920 
now if you take it off of your leg and
you<00:05:09.280> put<00:05:09.490> it<00:05:09.580> on<00:05:09.640> a<00:05:09.700> tabletop<00:05:10.180> environment

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
you put it on a tabletop environment

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.900 
you put it on a tabletop environment
that's<00:05:11.050> where<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:11.380> see<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.650> little<00:05:12.010> difference

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
that's where you see a little difference

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
that's where you see a little difference
in<00:05:13.380> opinion<00:05:14.380> here<00:05:14.650> from<00:05:14.890> me<00:05:15.010> i<00:05:15.190> would<00:05:15.610> say<00:05:15.850> that

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
in opinion here from me i would say that

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.780 
in opinion here from me i would say that
on<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:17.380> typing<00:05:17.890> angle<00:05:18.010> it<00:05:18.280> works<00:05:18.460> pretty<00:05:18.670> well

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
on a typing angle it works pretty well

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.850 
on a typing angle it works pretty well
on<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.540> viewing<00:05:19.990> angle<00:05:20.320> you're<00:05:20.440> going<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.620> find

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
on a viewing angle you're going to find

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.680 
on a viewing angle you're going to find
that<00:05:21.220> if<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.610> apply<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:21.970> little<00:05:22.270> bit<00:05:22.390> too<00:05:22.570> much

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
that if you apply a little bit too much

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.660 
that if you apply a little bit too much
pressure<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:23.170> it<00:05:23.470> or<00:05:23.650> too<00:05:23.860> much<00:05:24.010> tapping<00:05:24.520> it

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
pressure to it or too much tapping it

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.550 
pressure to it or too much tapping it
can<00:05:24.970> collapse<00:05:25.300> like<00:05:25.780> i<00:05:25.930> showed<00:05:26.140> you<00:05:26.200> in<00:05:26.440> this

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
can collapse like i showed you in this

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.760 
can collapse like i showed you in this
video<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:27.220> just<00:05:27.910> note<00:05:28.180> that<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.720> then<00:05:29.320> i<00:05:29.560> would

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
video so just note that and then i would

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.200 
video so just note that and then i would
also<00:05:29.890> say<00:05:30.040> that<00:05:30.220> this<00:05:30.460> one<00:05:30.700> of<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:30.850> nicer

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
also say that this one of the nicer

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.460 
also say that this one of the nicer
cases<00:05:31.600> spec<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:31.990> made<00:05:32.170> for<00:05:32.410> the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
cases spec is made for the

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.560 
cases spec is made for the
third-generation<00:05:32.920> ipad<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:33.820> far<00:05:34.060> it's<00:05:34.270> very

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
third-generation ipad so far it's very

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.660 
third-generation ipad so far it's very
slim<00:05:35.050> as<00:05:35.650> you<00:05:35.800> can<00:05:35.950> see<00:05:36.190> here<00:05:36.430> it's<00:05:36.550> pretty

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
slim as you can see here it's pretty

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.880 
slim as you can see here it's pretty
lightweight<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.420> there<00:05:38.200> is<00:05:38.320> no<00:05:38.470> curling

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
lightweight and there is no curling

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.320 
lightweight and there is no curling
around<00:05:39.010> the<00:05:39.280> edges<00:05:39.430> it<00:05:39.730> just<00:05:39.910> feels<00:05:40.120> like<00:05:40.300> a

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
around the edges it just feels like a

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.930 
around the edges it just feels like a
solid<00:05:40.780> case<00:05:40.990> so<00:05:41.260> I<00:05:41.290> like<00:05:41.530> that<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:42.610> final

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
solid case so I like that the final

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.280 
solid case so I like that the final
thing<00:05:42.970> I'll<00:05:43.210> say<00:05:43.240> is<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:43.660> price<00:05:43.900> I<00:05:44.140> don't

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
thing I'll say is the price I don't

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.690 
thing I'll say is the price I don't
really<00:05:44.380> care<00:05:44.650> for<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.920> price<00:05:45.130> of<00:05:45.340> this<00:05:45.460> case

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
really care for the price of this case

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.390 
really care for the price of this case

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
on the flip side it is a unique case we

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
don't see too many of these types where

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.930 
don't see too many of these types where

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
they work on your lap so that's you know

they work on your lap so that's you know
to<00:05:58.090> be<00:05:58.360> debated<00:05:58.800> finally<00:05:59.800> personally<00:06:00.340> I'm

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
to be debated finally personally I'm

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.480 
to be debated finally personally I'm
holding<00:06:01.030> out<00:06:01.150> for<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.990> mag<00:06:02.260> folio<00:06:02.770> whenever

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
holding out for the mag folio whenever

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.100 
holding out for the mag folio whenever
that<00:06:03.760> is<00:06:03.790> released<00:06:04.240> because<00:06:04.510> that's<00:06:04.840> going<00:06:05.020> to

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
that is released because that's going to

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.810 
that is released because that's going to
be<00:06:05.260> from<00:06:05.500> what<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.680> can<00:06:05.800> tell<00:06:05.950> just<00:06:06.130> like<00:06:06.520> this

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
be from what I can tell just like this

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.660 
be from what I can tell just like this
except<00:06:07.720> for<00:06:08.080> tabletop<00:06:08.800> use<00:06:09.190> so<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:09.430> doesn't

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
except for tabletop use so it doesn't

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.880 
except for tabletop use so it doesn't
have<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:09.790> contour<00:06:10.330> it<00:06:10.570> uses<00:06:10.990> stand<00:06:11.350> similar

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
have the contour it uses stand similar

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.730 
have the contour it uses stand similar
to<00:06:12.100> a<00:06:12.130> fit<00:06:12.700> folio<00:06:12.940> and<00:06:13.470> hopefully<00:06:14.470> that<00:06:14.710> is

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
to a fit folio and hopefully that is
