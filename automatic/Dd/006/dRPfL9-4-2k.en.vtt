00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
occasionally in some of the different

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.189 
occasionally in some of the different
sections<00:00:17.940> there's<00:00:18.420> been<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.840> looked<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
sections there's been what looked like a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.980 
sections there's been what looked like a
sword<00:00:19.650> icon<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> heavy<00:00:20.580> web<00:00:20.820> slot<00:00:21.270> well

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
sword icon in the heavy web slot well

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.779 
sword icon in the heavy web slot well
that<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.769> an<00:00:22.980> illusion<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.580> is

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
that was not an illusion that is

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580 
that was not an illusion that is
actually<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> new<00:00:24.539> weapon<00:00:24.810> type<00:00:24.960> coming<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
actually a new weapon type coming to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.349 
actually a new weapon type coming to
destiny<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> didn't<00:00:26.640> actually<00:00:26.760> show<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> in

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
destiny now I didn't actually show it in

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.880 
destiny now I didn't actually show it in
the<00:00:27.449> stream<00:00:27.660> today<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.080> imagine<00:00:28.740> we'll

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the stream today I imagine we'll

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.380 
the stream today I imagine we'll
probably<00:00:29.070> see<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.640> next<00:00:29.939> week's<00:00:30.119> stream

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
probably see it in next week's stream

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.939 
probably see it in next week's stream
when<00:00:30.900> they<00:00:30.990> show<00:00:31.109> their<00:00:31.260> strike<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.679> actually

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
when they show their strike and actually

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.319 
when they show their strike and actually
shows<00:00:32.099> from<00:00:32.250> combat<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.880> they<00:00:32.969> might<00:00:33.120> show

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
shows from combat so they might show

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.389 
shows from combat so they might show
that<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.750> action<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.530> right<00:00:35.130> at<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> end<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that in action but right at the end of

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.740 
that in action but right at the end of
the<00:00:35.489> stream<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.420> were<00:00:36.510> scrolling

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the stream when they were scrolling

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
the stream when they were scrolling
through<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> votes<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:38.010> quickly<00:00:38.399> skimmed

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
through the votes they quickly skimmed

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
through the votes they quickly skimmed
over<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.149> corner<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.930> sword<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.469> thanks

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
over the corner of the sword and thanks

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.380 
over the corner of the sword and thanks
to<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> power<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.520> editing<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.180> able<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to the power of editing I was able to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
to the power of editing I was able to
freeze<00:00:42.629> frame<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.710> take<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> more

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
freeze frame that and we can take a more

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
freeze frame that and we can take a more
detailed<00:00:44.520> look<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.480> begin<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.050> called

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
detailed look to begin with it's called

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
detailed look to begin with it's called
arc<00:00:46.590> edge<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.489> need<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.910> level<00:00:48.120> 40<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
arc edge and you need to be level 40 to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.430 
arc edge and you need to be level 40 to
use<00:00:49.079> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
use this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
use this
it's<00:00:49.800> got<00:00:49.950> 220<00:00:50.550> attack<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it's got 220 attack which is one of the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
it's got 220 attack which is one of the
higher<00:00:51.780> attack<00:00:52.110> values<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> also<00:00:53.309> deals

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
higher attack values and it also deals

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
higher attack values and it also deals
arc<00:00:54.000> damage<00:00:54.329> hence<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> name<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.140> kitsch<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
arc damage hence the name are kitsch the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
arc damage hence the name are kitsch the
description<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.820> reads<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.270> dark<00:00:57.480> heart

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
description for it reads the dark heart

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
description for it reads the dark heart
of<00:00:57.809> will<00:00:58.020> breakup<00:00:58.350> burns<00:00:58.620> within<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.129> blade

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of will breakup burns within this blade

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
of will breakup burns within this blade
you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.270> has<00:01:00.359> speed<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.960> obviously

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you can see it has speed so obviously

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.119 
you can see it has speed so obviously
that's<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> rate<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that's kind of the rate at which you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.250 
that's kind of the rate at which you
attack<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.300> has<00:01:03.449> impact<00:01:03.870> range

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
attack now this has impact range

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
attack now this has impact range
efficiency<00:01:05.250> defense<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> energy<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
efficiency defense and energy so I

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
efficiency defense and energy so I
imagine<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.350> respect<00:01:07.650> energy<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
imagine in this respect energy is the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
imagine in this respect energy is the
kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> ammo<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> sword<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.229> like

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
kind of ammo for the sword so just like

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050 
kind of ammo for the sword so just like
in<00:01:10.530> Halo<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.250> say<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> sword<00:01:12.000> or

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
in Halo when you say like the sword or

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.490 
in Halo when you say like the sword or
the<00:01:12.119> hammer<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.600> can't<00:01:13.049> use<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.290> infinitely

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the hammer you can't use it infinitely

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.899 
the hammer you can't use it infinitely
it<00:01:13.890> does<00:01:14.040> obviously<00:01:14.159> still<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.670> an<00:01:14.790> ammo

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
it does obviously still have an ammo

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.550 
it does obviously still have an ammo
reserve<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.810> obviously<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.409> gave

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
reserve because obviously if they gave

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.690 
reserve because obviously if they gave
your<00:01:16.710> sword<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.009> destiny<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> had

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
your sword and destiny and it had

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.640 
your sword and destiny and it had
infinite<00:01:17.970> ammo<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.020> ridiculously

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
infinite ammo it would be ridiculously

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
infinite ammo it would be ridiculously
overpowered<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:21.000> still<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.479> heavy

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
overpowered so it will still be a heavy

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
overpowered so it will still be a heavy
weapon<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> goes<00:01:22.560> into<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.770> heavy<00:01:22.920> weapon<00:01:23.189> slots

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
weapon it goes into a heavy weapon slots

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
weapon it goes into a heavy weapon slots
but<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:24.479> look<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.110> description

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
but if we then look at the description

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.810 
but if we then look at the description
further<00:01:25.740> down<00:01:25.950> there's<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> perk<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
further down there's a perk for it it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.690 
further down there's a perk for it it
says<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.360> l2<00:01:27.630> -<00:01:28.049> god<00:01:28.350> effective<00:01:29.310> against

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
says use l2 - god effective against

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.880 
says use l2 - god effective against
solar<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> void<00:01:30.600> attacks<00:01:30.930> less<00:01:31.470> effective

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
solar and void attacks less effective

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
solar and void attacks less effective
against<00:01:32.340> arc<00:01:32.549> attacks<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> sounds<00:01:33.630> like

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
against arc attacks so it sounds like

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
against arc attacks so it sounds like
you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.290> use<00:01:34.439> these<00:01:34.560> swords<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> block

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you can use these swords to block

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.950 
you can use these swords to block
certain<00:01:35.610> types<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.850> attacks<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.840> would

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
certain types of attacks and you would

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330 
certain types of attacks and you would
obviously<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.409> pair<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.799> against<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
obviously then pair up against the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
obviously then pair up against the
different<00:01:38.729> elements<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.420> again<00:01:39.659> awkward

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
different elements so again awkward

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
different elements so again awkward
clearly<00:01:40.409> blocking<00:01:40.740> solo<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> void<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.610> would

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
clearly blocking solo and void I would

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.340 
clearly blocking solo and void I would
therefore<00:01:42.180> imagine<00:01:42.689> there's<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> void<00:01:43.079> blade

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
therefore imagine there's a void blade

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
therefore imagine there's a void blade
and<00:01:43.530> also<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> solar<00:01:44.610> blade<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.030> would<00:01:45.149> then

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and also a solar blade which would then

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.210 
and also a solar blade which would then
block<00:01:45.509> against<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> other<00:01:46.110> elements<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.740> all

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
block against the other elements and all

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
block against the other elements and all
be<00:01:47.340> only<00:01:47.579> very<00:01:47.939> briefly<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> quick

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
be only very briefly we also get a quick

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.069 
be only very briefly we also get a quick
look<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.460> actual<00:01:50.790> weapon<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
look at the actual weapon right at the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.719 
look at the actual weapon right at the
very<00:01:52.290> end<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> stream<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.430> they're

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
very end of the stream when they're

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.249 
very end of the stream when they're
dancing<00:01:53.880> showing<00:01:54.479> off<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> new<00:01:54.689> dance<00:01:55.020> moves

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
dancing showing off the new dance moves

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.139 
dancing showing off the new dance moves
which<00:01:55.560> by<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> way<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.670> really

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
which by the way are really really

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.670 
which by the way are really really
awesome<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.719> something<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.200> if

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
awesome you can see something here if

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.840 
awesome you can see something here if
you<00:01:58.770> look<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> hunter<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
you look at the hunter on the right the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.969 
you look at the hunter on the right the
awoken<00:02:00.030> Hunter<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.689> his<00:02:00.899> back<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> sword

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
awoken Hunter on his back is a sword

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
awoken Hunter on his back is a sword
because<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.490> taken<00:02:02.759> King<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> tower

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
because in the taken King in the tower

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.850 
because in the taken King in the tower
you<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.869> able<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.229> choose<00:02:04.469> whatever

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you will be able to choose whatever

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.410 
you will be able to choose whatever
weapon<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> display<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> back<00:02:06.030> by

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
weapon you display on the back by

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.029 
weapon you display on the back by
standing<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.840> tower<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.350> swapping<00:02:07.860> weapons

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
standing the tower and swapping weapons

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.680 
standing the tower and swapping weapons
like<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.819> game<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.420> swap<00:02:09.569> them

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
like you would in game you can swap them

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.420 
like you would in game you can swap them
in<00:02:09.780> real<00:02:09.959> time<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.470> tower<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.099> example

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
in real time in the tower so for example

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.619 
in real time in the tower so for example
if<00:02:11.489> you're<00:02:11.580> carrying<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:12.000> yellow<00:02:12.239> horn<00:02:12.450> you

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
if you're carrying like yellow horn you

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.920 
if you're carrying like yellow horn you
want<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.840> show<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.050> off<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.680> can

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
want to show that off you can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.119 
want to show that off you can
found<00:02:14.170> your<00:02:14.319> back<00:02:14.439> or<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.739> can<00:02:14.859> carry<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
found your back or you can carry a

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.039 
found your back or you can carry a
primary<00:02:15.579> or<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> secondary<00:02:15.849> or<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:16.840> case

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
primary or a secondary or in this case

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.750 
primary or a secondary or in this case
he<00:02:17.290> has<00:02:17.409> a<00:02:17.530> sword<00:02:17.829> in<00:02:17.980> his<00:02:18.069> heavy<00:02:18.250> slot<00:02:18.519> and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
he has a sword in his heavy slot and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.089 
he has a sword in his heavy slot and
that<00:02:19.299> is<00:02:19.540> what<00:02:19.780> he<00:02:19.900> has<00:02:20.079> equipped<00:02:20.469> so<00:02:20.920> as<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
that is what he has equipped so as you

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.410 
that is what he has equipped so as you
can<00:02:21.159> see<00:02:21.370> if<00:02:21.670> we<00:02:21.730> zoom<00:02:21.969> in<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.150> little<00:02:22.239> bit

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
can see if we zoom in a little bit

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.289 
can see if we zoom in a little bit
closer<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.959> looks<00:02:23.260> really<00:02:24.040> really<00:02:24.219> awesome<00:02:24.969> I

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
closer it looks really really awesome I

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.670 
closer it looks really really awesome I
just<00:02:25.480> cannot<00:02:25.750> wait<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.989> see<00:02:26.200> gameplay<00:02:26.500> for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
just cannot wait to see gameplay for

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.500 
just cannot wait to see gameplay for
this<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:26.980> imagine<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.730> will<00:02:27.819> probably<00:02:28.000> function

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
this I imagine it will probably function

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.030 
this I imagine it will probably function
all<00:02:28.629> kind<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.810> behave<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.379> a<00:02:29.469> similar<00:02:29.709> way<00:02:30.010> to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
all kind of behave in a similar way to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.679 
all kind of behave in a similar way to
say<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.609> swords<00:02:30.969> like<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> sword<00:02:31.389> you<00:02:31.480> get

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
say the swords like the sword you get

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.539 
say the swords like the sword you get
from<00:02:31.840> sword<00:02:32.079> bearers<00:02:32.439> but<00:02:33.040> obviously<00:02:33.340> until

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
from sword bearers but obviously until

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.670 
from sword bearers but obviously until
we<00:02:33.609> see<00:02:33.730> gameplay<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.719> not<00:02:34.959> know<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:35.590> for

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
we see gameplay we will not know but for

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
we see gameplay we will not know but for
the<00:02:35.739> time<00:02:35.920> being<00:02:36.129> I<00:02:36.219> want<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.400> show<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.549> guys

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
the time being I want to show you guys

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.369 
the time being I want to show you guys
that<00:02:36.879> that's<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.269> new<00:02:37.450> weapon<00:02:37.689> type<00:02:37.840> coming<00:02:38.260> to

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
that that's a new weapon type coming to

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.129 
that that's a new weapon type coming to
taking<00:02:38.560> King<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.760> was<00:02:40.030> seen<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.359> date<00:02:40.569> so

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
taking King and that was seen to date so

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.209 
taking King and that was seen to date so
hopefully<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.620> guys<00:02:41.680> enjoyed<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.980> video<00:02:42.189> if

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.890 
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
