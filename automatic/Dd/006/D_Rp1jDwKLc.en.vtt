00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this this chain wrap continues to well

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.590 
this this chain wrap continues to well
into<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> hundreds<00:00:38.670> hundreds<00:00:39.090> yes<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
into the hundreds hundreds yes and I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.970 
into the hundreds hundreds yes and I
think<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.930> F<00:00:40.079> seen<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.680> yes

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
think it just F seen there right yes

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
think it just F seen there right yes
look<00:00:41.280> yes<00:00:41.670> okay<00:00:41.940> that's<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.270> counselor

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
look yes okay that's what counselor

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.030 
look yes okay that's what counselor
there<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.469> know<00:00:43.530> why<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> did<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.890> back

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
there I don't know why I did it back

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.260 
there I don't know why I did it back
throw<00:00:44.219> their<00:00:44.370> even<00:00:44.760> F<00:00:44.879> throw<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.090> think

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
throw their even F throw I think

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.799 
throw their even F throw I think
would've<00:00:45.450> been<00:00:45.539> better

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
would've been better

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
would've been better
right<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.610> buddy<00:00:47.610> gets<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> three

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
right but that buddy gets a three

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.510 
right but that buddy gets a three
hundred<00:00:48.090> percent<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.719> right<00:00:49.100> nicely<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> sent

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
hundred percent so right nicely and sent

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
hundred percent so right nicely and sent
him<00:00:50.640> off<00:00:50.789> max<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.539> though<00:00:51.780> Brooks<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
him off max is back though Brooks the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.139 
him off max is back though Brooks the
hash<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> access<00:00:53.579> oh<00:00:53.670> wait<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> minute

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hash that access oh wait a minute

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.389 
hash that access oh wait a minute
oh<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.840> they're<00:00:55.050> into<00:00:55.440> doesn't<00:00:56.100> quite<00:00:56.250> get

him with one it'll be irrelevant about

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.630 
him with one it'll be irrelevant about
the<00:01:00.600> remaining<00:01:00.960> its<00:01:01.079> save<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.590> save<00:01:01.829> hacks<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the remaining its save as save hacks and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
the remaining its save as save hacks and
skip<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.480> shocking<00:01:03.780> step<00:01:03.989> yeah<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
skip the first shocking step yeah it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.190 
skip the first shocking step yeah it
takes<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.830> knee<00:01:04.979> oh<00:01:05.630> those<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:06.990> fast

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
takes a knee oh those are really fast

there yeah Oh guess the turnip Wow
alright<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:12.090> hacks<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.450> hoping<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> tech

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
alright I think hacks was hoping to tech

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.859 
alright I think hacks was hoping to tech
into<00:01:13.260> second<00:01:13.500> stage<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> us<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.390> turnip<00:01:15.720> just

soft with the with the chain grab that
it<00:02:28.570> seems<00:02:29.050> like<00:02:29.200> hacks<00:02:29.410> has<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.769> had

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it seems like hacks has just had

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.440 
it seems like hacks has just had
complete<00:02:30.280> control<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.850> match<00:02:31.000> now<00:02:31.239> ever

stuff<00:05:59.800> two<00:05:59.860> hacks<00:06:00.040> money<00:06:00.280> I<00:06:00.370> mean<00:06:00.699> he<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.449> know

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
stuff two hacks money I mean he you know

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.340 
stuff two hacks money I mean he you know
I<00:06:03.150> think<00:06:04.150> he<00:06:04.240> favors<00:06:04.630> the<00:06:04.660> Fox<00:06:04.960> doodle<00:06:05.229> for

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
I think he favors the Fox doodle for

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.290 
I think he favors the Fox doodle for
that<00:06:05.440> matchup<00:06:05.800> just<00:06:05.830> because<00:06:06.190> it<00:06:06.310> is<00:06:06.940> a<00:06:06.970> better

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
that matchup just because it is a better

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.210 
that matchup just because it is a better
matchup<00:06:07.600> I<00:06:07.840> mean<00:06:07.990> Fox<00:06:08.199> beats<00:06:08.500> Falcon<00:06:08.889> handily

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
matchup I mean Fox beats Falcon handily

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.779 
matchup I mean Fox beats Falcon handily
but<00:06:09.430> Fox

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
but Fox

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.700 
but Fox
you<00:06:10.389> know<00:06:10.510> it's<00:06:10.720> winnable<00:06:11.050> for<00:06:11.199> falcon<00:06:11.440> falcon

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
you know it's winnable for falcon falcon

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.110 
you know it's winnable for falcon falcon
can<00:06:11.889> Kendall<00:06:12.250> wouldn't<00:06:12.520> once<00:06:12.669> Falcon<00:06:12.970> gets

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
can Kendall wouldn't once Falcon gets

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.939 
can Kendall wouldn't once Falcon gets
the<00:06:13.210> momentum<00:06:13.330> and<00:06:13.630> gets<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:13.840> it's<00:06:14.440> a<00:06:14.530> solid<00:06:14.830> hit

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
the momentum and gets a it's a solid hit

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.820 
the momentum and gets a it's a solid hit
or<00:06:15.070> a<00:06:15.100> grab<00:06:15.340> yeah
