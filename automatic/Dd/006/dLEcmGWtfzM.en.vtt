00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.160
 physical and ideological 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.290
 the butterfly in Chinese culture and 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.960
 been used for centuries as a 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.590
 a symbol of joy and happiness

 the letter pointed up symbolizes the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 strength to fight and achieve the goals 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.100
 already when it is listed down 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.900

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.700
 were performed works with tattoos 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.500

 people told me a little is imported 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.100

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.020
 me is the lifestyle actually the rate 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100
 the lifestyle 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.170
 they all have meaning 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.150
 I have seen several people who make themselves 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.310
 simply for aesthetics there and I go 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.890
 stay up because everyone guy 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.950
 It is almost an accessory to the COMAND is 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.560
 as like high school expand one 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.320
 Once your touch she just got robbed 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.550
 she came in tremendous type added 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.580
 I think I need this to feel 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.220
 well then case zero half an hour 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.590
 mood injection in the lull if 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.870
 I even found a guy that I like 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:50.200
 A lot of pain is jiu jitsu and he said 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:53.490
 So you're playing, you're so fucked up. 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.490
 well so it's more or less so 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.010
 he really remembered pressure and this 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.299
 have the knowledge 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.900
 I discovered that I wanted to do something. 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.799
 great plenty of time and still if you 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.519
 chose the worst 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.139
 I think that anyone who does not drive 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.699
 enrolled in our channel is very 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.389
 important is that guy talk 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.789
 O button down here below do not find 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.370
 but they cheat the conversation up the side 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:38.919
 left from left to right 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.330
 the law goes there and goes down it made a 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.490
 tattoo on the back 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.400
 We do not have any 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.449
 meaning of it and that you chose the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.600
 back 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:56.129
 at the time went to champion woman 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:05:00.739
 dark family half closed on the back 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:03.119
 even real break limits 

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:04.649
 freedom it symbolizes to me is 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:08.159
 truth that is a more important thing 

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:09.509
 For me, we have to be careful and 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.989
 unfortunately still has a lot of prejudice 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.610
 against the fuselage is then as 

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:17.639
 take care of the places you choose 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.229
 think about your profession if you have 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.259
 children is not a place you can 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.259
