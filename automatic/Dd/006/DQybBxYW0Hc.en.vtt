the gym one day doing leg presses and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.979 
the gym one day doing leg presses and
I've<00:00:32.669> never<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.090> been<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> fan<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> leg

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
I've never really been a fan of leg

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.470 
I've never really been a fan of leg
presses<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.670> manner<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.030> which<00:00:36.090> he<00:00:36.210> was

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
presses but the manner in which he was

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
presses but the manner in which he was
doing<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.680> leg<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> time

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
doing them was one leg at a time

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.549 
doing them was one leg at a time
basically<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.120> that's<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.079> he<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.410> do

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559

now as you can see that we'll go through
it<00:01:31.200> again<00:01:31.320> when<00:01:32.070> he<00:01:32.189> does<00:01:32.400> come<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:32.700> he<00:01:33.420> comes
