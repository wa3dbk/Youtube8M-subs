00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.120
 for this life choice how to touch brain 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.500
 of nirvana we are going to connect tuning 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.080
 standard although they use 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.910
 tunings a little lower for 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.010
 we who are that cool are there a 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.960
 standard is the same what happens that goes 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.610
 to sound more acute a lot of chord 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.140
 power we're going to mean that 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.810
 let's start on the 2nd fret of the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.470
 string 5 3 hits slide to fret 6 of 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.470
 5 chord power chord is worth 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.950
 The hits 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:41.050
 we climb to fret 4 to the rope 6 and 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.050
 we go down to the 4th fret of rope 5 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.170
 as you see between chords and chord there 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.630
 several ways to touch the install 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.630
 and it comes out lengthens the chords that we play 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.720
 to make it a bit bigger but it's worth 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.720
 letting go a little bit more to the right 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.090
 that already like you the air that 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.520
 you want to give the subject all the topics 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.500
 that we are in this type of chords of 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.530
 Fifth chords are lent much 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.390
 we make a small bridge fret 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.770
 two of the rope remembers power 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.440
 twice 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.110
 rope without knowing years and measures different 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.860
 we went down to the fret on 4 of the rope 5 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.860
 agreed power 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.050
 and finally 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.840
 good storage rooms let's go for power 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.229
 ropes to go where power 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.640
 when a 634 agreed power is worth and 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.640
 again we would start again 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.560
 in between there is a part as well as a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.690
 little bit more relaxed, it does everything 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.780
 relying on soft strokes in a chord 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.690
 power of the rope 6 13 4 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.789
 and then it's getting a kind of 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.770
 sounds a little dirty psychedelic very 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.420
 slow very slowly to choose the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.180
 tabs and see what they are or can 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.180
 improvise on this basis 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.980
 for the other I say that it is improvising 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.650
 about that because you have seen that they are 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.540
 This is the theme of jun and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.430
 sisters but well I forget nothing in 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.080
 the brother if I forget you do not stop 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.460
 because now I now add the ending like this 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.460
 I wish you like it
