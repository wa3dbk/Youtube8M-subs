 I need to draw magneto from the street. 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 With a girl, she's fucking you. 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.340
 knows nothing only ointments and ends the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.520
 31 years old magneto any simple way 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.050
 cheap and you can do key to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.200
 to mark a turn is called a 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 solder , and a drill grinder 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.579
 in your life but if you do not have you 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 You may request seeking to make you not 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.570
 It will be so expensive, huh? 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.250
 this plate he spends and seven reais to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.129
 to show you how you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.440
 Do you think you did not quote an idea? 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.199
 often on the bike and drop a door 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.899
 or something of the genre in the genre 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.579
 and you need to lock an engine or even 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.699
 to release the magnet to say it does not 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 Turns can not get the best you 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.340
 catching it a little more direct 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 so I 've already tested 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.299
 so I'll explain how you want it here 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.060
 Do you have a strap on you buy at 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.509
 electrical house that yes it is 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 a bost brace a brace that goes round 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.060
 the insulation can not be secured in the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.070
 case ô ô ô pipe of the product and vice versa 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.770
 arrives at the house of fissile material for 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.990
 a brace of seven real industries 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 only it's an old ratchet wrench that I 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 I was right 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.479
 I'm gay, it's a screw I go 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.040
 show you here I 'm not that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.420
 wrench ratchet a whole welded bolt 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.340
 screw that screw a certain nut 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 the door I'm good at this iron plate 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.130
 I already thought I cut from a tube then by 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.619
 example had or do you have a plate want 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.369
 download any or anything like this 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.259
 had a square tube I cut and took 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.710
 This iron plate 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.950
 so everything here I cut here 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.860
 I took this plate from the right tube it factor 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.890
 already used but no problem whatsoever 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.760
 You'll spin feeling in case. 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.450
 counterclockwise then it will cut a 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.280
 A little bit more but here you are quiet 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.739
 just the door on this plate on that plate 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.440
 true thing you make two wrinkles 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:36.480
 to pass the clamp that is in the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:38.970
 mogul okay I have a daughter of the tycoon 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.980
 here why then this part that goes 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.220
 being in the engine may have a motor 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.599
 I thought it might be light here. 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.510
 direct 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:57.150
 Are you going to tighten the screw for the pressure? 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:00.269
 in this key and skate 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.050
 but you can skate this is that the tycoon 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:07.620
 smooth can skate to not skate you 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.170
 has a tire camera right in the camera. 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.769
 tire and you can put around here the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.200
 tires bed here not batini 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.420
 So you can hold this tip here. 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.300
 support on the workbench and with another key you 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.590
 come back, huh? 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.739
 another key than the son until I 'm yours 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.319
 Okay, your door, you need to get the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.379
 Magnesium in a battery and causes a 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.680
 pressure for the food to have this 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.870
 another key that I did myself 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.610
 The key here is simple to do not 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.489
 I spent a lot of faith in the old iron 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.230
 a gear against this gear 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.489
 Will I ever be able to find a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.290
 gear what is 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.629
 It does not have to be the same as the season. 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.280
 even with a square of iron if round 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.629
 also ne 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.939
 being about the size of the 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.939
 magnetom of your bike is super important 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.220
 so then when I thought you did 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.409
 several holes right 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.319
 as only the holes I've made are 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.930
 to run on multiple bikes but you can 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.769
 make holes if you want another 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.430
 huh 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.430
 You'll need to get out of here. 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:27.690
 what do you do the holes in the gear 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.250
 here you know I'm from a door 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.050
 inside a nut and bolt and 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.479
 How does this work? 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.940
 these magneto screws 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.520
 in the case of z there is no Brazilian thread 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.110
 box is magnetic that has a 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.940
 match already has face 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.820
 then you put the thread that account team 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.240
 on the other side and a pilot chaos here 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.020
 to be dusky things finally also find 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.289
 over there 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.060
 and this screw will push the tycoon 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.639
 out will bring the tycoon to each 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.300
 time tighten it will bring a war for 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.690
 out 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.130
 You're going to get it out of it. 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.789
 super simple and inexpensive tool to 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.380
 do 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.030
 then this tool will be more 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.190
 complicated by the crisis, all right, you have to 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.120
 be a fervent one here is close to 10 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.460
 minutes I think and it's more complicated than 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.940
 sticking to the wall irons are connected have 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.539
 to be low spin né new block 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.470
 vote will burn and this one is 7 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.800
 real 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.720
 I spent super cheap, you got one. 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.820
 quality of a tool by its 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.010
 lawyers when it works is that 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.320
 to move the engine in your house is super 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:43.169
 easy to do and has been tested and 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.570
 approved there today and there you can do 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.810
 same as supersimples line and will want 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.750
 give the greatest affection 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.620
 That's it, folks, the tips out of the 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.620
 disassembly
