percent of renault-nissan decision now
we<00:00:25.240> said<00:00:25.420> ten<00:00:25.720> percent<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.289> global<00:00:26.380> market

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
we said ten percent of the global market

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.620 
we said ten percent of the global market
ten<00:00:27.340> percent<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.820> global<00:00:27.910> market<00:00:28.359> will<00:00:28.510> be

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
ten percent of the global market will be

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.509 
ten percent of the global market will be
made<00:00:28.810> by<00:00:28.840> electric<00:00:29.439> cars<00:00:29.619> in<00:00:29.800> 2020<00:00:30.400> Rose

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519

made by electric cars in 2020 Rose
brands<00:00:30.910> yeah<00:00:31.119> cross<00:00:31.359> brands<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:31.810> obviously

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
brands yeah cross brands and obviously

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.100 
brands yeah cross brands and obviously
because<00:00:33.520> we<00:00:33.670> are<00:00:33.790> pioneering<00:00:34.270> this<00:00:34.510> effort<00:00:34.870> we

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
because we are pioneering this effort we

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.229 
because we are pioneering this effort we
think<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.380> our<00:00:35.710> our<00:00:36.219> share<00:00:36.610> should<00:00:36.910> be<00:00:37.030> much

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
think that our our share should be much

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.060 
think that our our share should be much
much<00:00:37.390> higher<00:00:37.629> than<00:00:38.200> other<00:00:38.379> car<00:00:38.649> manufacturers

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
much higher than other car manufacturers

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.830 
much higher than other car manufacturers
that's<00:00:39.370> why<00:00:39.489> we<00:00:39.700> we<00:00:40.030> consider<00:00:40.329> twenty<00:00:40.570> percent

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
that's why we we consider twenty percent

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.779 
that's why we we consider twenty percent
of<00:00:41.020> ours<00:00:41.260> would<00:00:41.649> be<00:00:41.710> electric<00:00:42.070> so<00:00:42.309> given<00:00:42.579> even

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
of ours would be electric so given even

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.040 
of ours would be electric so given even
that<00:00:42.910> sort<00:00:43.090> of<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.180> stiff<00:00:43.390> target<00:00:43.539> which<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.960> lot

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
that sort of a stiff target which a lot

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.360 
that sort of a stiff target which a lot
of<00:00:44.079> people<00:00:44.170> were<00:00:44.440> surprised<00:00:44.860> by<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:45.280> you

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
of people were surprised by that you

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.590 
of people were surprised by that you
know<00:00:45.430> you<00:00:45.550> come<00:00:45.700> up<00:00:45.820> with<00:00:45.969> such<00:00:46.059> an<00:00:46.239> aggressive

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
know you come up with such an aggressive

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.150 
know you come up with such an aggressive
target<00:00:47.140> but<00:00:47.289> a<00:00:47.320> lot<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.530> your<00:00:47.710> supplies<00:00:47.980> are

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
target but a lot of your supplies are

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.130 
target but a lot of your supplies are
you<00:00:48.250> also<00:00:48.370> encouraging<00:00:48.940> them<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.180> look<00:00:49.510> at<00:00:49.660> you

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
you also encouraging them to look at you

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.720 
you also encouraging them to look at you
know<00:00:50.170> alternate<00:00:50.800> methods<00:00:51.190> not<00:00:51.489> just<00:00:51.670> a

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
know alternate methods not just a

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.490 
know alternate methods not just a
production<00:00:52.120> but<00:00:52.270> also<00:00:52.300> in<00:00:53.140> terms<00:00:53.289> of<00:00:53.410> the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
production but also in terms of the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.740 
production but also in terms of the
materials<00:00:53.800> they're<00:00:53.949> using<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:54.579> know<00:00:54.610> I<00:00:54.750> think

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
materials they're using you know I think

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.900 
materials they're using you know I think
the<00:00:55.840> question<00:00:56.140> is<00:00:56.260> not<00:00:56.500> electricity<00:00:57.219> versus

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
the question is not electricity versus

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.770 
the question is not electricity versus
oil<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.649> is<00:00:59.710> complementary<00:01:00.609> I<00:01:00.850> think<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.570> more

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
oil it is complementary I think the more

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.439 
oil it is complementary I think the more
we<00:01:01.809> develop<00:01:02.320> electric<00:01:02.769> car<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:04.000> more<00:01:04.239> we

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
we develop electric car the more we

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.650 
we develop electric car the more we
allow<00:01:04.750> oil<00:01:05.340> to<00:01:06.340> be<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> normal<00:01:06.910> commodity

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
allow oil to be a normal commodity

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.630 
allow oil to be a normal commodity
having<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.140> normal<00:01:08.320> life<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:09.160> mean<00:01:09.310> even<00:01:09.550> the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
having a normal life that mean even the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.120 
having a normal life that mean even the
oil<00:01:09.820> producer<00:01:10.300> do<00:01:10.480> not<00:01:10.630> like<00:01:10.870> situation<00:01:11.620> where

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
oil producer do not like situation where

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.940 
oil producer do not like situation where
oil<00:01:12.310> price<00:01:12.640> all<00:01:13.090> of<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.420> sudden<00:01:13.450> goes<00:01:14.260> up<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.770> one

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
oil price all of a sudden goes up to one

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.410 
oil price all of a sudden goes up to one
hundred<00:01:14.980> eighty<00:01:15.340> dollars<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.000> barrier<00:01:16.300> or

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
hundred eighty dollars the barrier or

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.360 
hundred eighty dollars the barrier or
200<00:01:16.900> but<00:01:17.050> dark<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.440> body<00:01:17.620> because<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.070> creates

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
200 but dark the body because it creates

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.590 
200 but dark the body because it creates
a<00:01:18.460> lot<00:01:18.550> of<00:01:18.610> disruption<00:01:18.940> in<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.330> global

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
a lot of disruption in the global

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.900 
a lot of disruption in the global
economy<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.500> there<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.160> a<00:01:21.490> kind<00:01:21.760> of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
economy so there is a kind of

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.850 
economy so there is a kind of
complementarity<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:22.960> means<00:01:23.170> developing

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
complementarity that means developing

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.670 
complementarity that means developing
electric<00:01:24.340> cars<00:01:24.580> in<00:01:24.850> order<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.690> allow<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.290> oil

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
electric cars in order to allow the oil

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.310 
electric cars in order to allow the oil
market<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.370> be<00:01:27.490> stable<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:28.420> grow<00:01:28.600> steadily<00:01:28.900> and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
market to be stable to grow steadily and

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.970 
market to be stable to grow steadily and
avoid<00:01:30.040> this<00:01:30.550> big<00:01:31.170> volatility<00:01:32.170> which<00:01:32.770> are

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
avoid this big volatility which are

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.370 
avoid this big volatility which are
detrimental<00:01:33.280> not<00:01:33.880> only<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.450> producer<00:01:34.960> but

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
detrimental not only to the producer but

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.190 
detrimental not only to the producer but
also<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:36.430> consumer<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.240> what<00:01:38.020> we're

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
also to the consumer so what we're

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.520 
also to the consumer so what we're
trying<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.470> do<00:01:38.680> here<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.790> kind<00:01:40.150> of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
trying to do here is a kind of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.390 
trying to do here is a kind of
complementary<00:01:41.530> effort<00:01:41.830> because<00:01:41.980> we<00:01:42.190> have<00:01:42.280> no

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
complementary effort because we have no

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.130 
complementary effort because we have no
illusion<00:01:42.760> on<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.970> fact<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.270> all<00:01:43.540> is<00:01:43.750> still<00:01:43.870> a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140

but if you have a startup dealing with
the<00:02:18.330> battery<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.080> think<00:02:19.710> you're<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> right

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the battery I think you're in the right

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.190 
the battery I think you're in the right
track<00:02:20.580> you're<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.690> right<00:02:21.810> track<00:02:22.050> because

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
track you're in the right track because

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.140 
track you're in the right track because
the<00:02:22.920> technology<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.700> battery<00:02:24.030> is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the technology of the battery is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.790 
the technology of the battery is
probably<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.600> most<00:02:24.780> promising<00:02:25.230> technology

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
probably the most promising technology

probably the most promising technology
for<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> next<00:02:26.310> year's<00:02:26.520> why<00:02:27.090> why<00:02:27.480> it's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
for the next year's why why it's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.330 
for the next year's why why it's
important<00:02:28.050> because<00:02:28.140> today<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.100> don't<00:02:29.250> know

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
important because today we don't know

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.410 
important because today we don't know
how<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.520> store<00:02:29.790> energy<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:31.650> don't<00:02:31.830> know<00:02:32.270> okay<00:02:33.270> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
how to store energy we don't know okay I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.780 
how to store energy we don't know okay I
mean<00:02:34.020> today<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.980> are<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.400> building<00:02:35.670> like

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
mean today if you are in a building like

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.780 
mean today if you are in a building like
this<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.270> you're<00:02:36.990> using<00:02:37.170> electricity<00:02:37.790> while

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
this and you're using electricity while

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.220 
this and you're using electricity while
you<00:02:38.940> paying<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.270> cost<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.660> electricity<00:02:39.780> at

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
you paying the cost of electricity at

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.370 
you paying the cost of electricity at
the<00:02:40.380> moment<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.709> use<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.660> okay<00:02:42.660> when<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.230> have

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the moment you use it okay when you have

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.520 
the moment you use it okay when you have
a<00:02:43.410> nuclear<00:02:43.770> central<00:02:44.220> Central<00:02:45.200> nuclear<00:02:46.200> power

a nuclear central Central nuclear power

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.380 
a nuclear central Central nuclear power
you<00:02:47.220> know<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.430> produce<00:02:47.700> nuclear<00:02:48.030> power<00:02:48.330> if

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you know you produce nuclear power if

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.390 
you know you produce nuclear power if
you<00:02:48.450> don't<00:02:48.660> use<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.080> wasted<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.190> you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you don't use it it's wasted you can you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.479 
you don't use it it's wasted you can you
can<00:02:50.550> store<00:02:50.820> energy<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.560> startup<00:02:53.190> we're

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
can store energy so the startup we're

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.920 
can store energy so the startup we're
going<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.700> find<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.000> solution<00:02:54.150> about<00:02:54.660> how<00:02:54.870> to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
going to find a solution about how to

humankind what we're trying to do is by

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.780 
humankind what we're trying to do is by
developing<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.600> battery<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.020> cars<00:03:04.260> is

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
developing the battery for cars is

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.170 
developing the battery for cars is
entering<00:03:05.790> into<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.150> cycle<00:03:06.450> where<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:09.000> means

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
entering into a cycle where that means

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.020 
entering into a cycle where that means
for<00:03:09.270> example<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.810> user<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.530> car<00:03:10.739> can<00:03:11.700> charge

for example the user of a car can charge

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.220 
for example the user of a car can charge
the<00:03:12.180> battery<00:03:12.510> at<00:03:12.600> night<00:03:12.810> where<00:03:13.080> usually

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the battery at night where usually

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.790 
the battery at night where usually
electricity<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.190> cheaper<00:03:15.410> using<00:03:16.410> during<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
electricity is cheaper using during the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.979 
electricity is cheaper using during the
day<00:03:16.950> where<00:03:17.280> electricity<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.910> usually<00:03:18.540> more

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
day where electricity is usually more

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.100 
day where electricity is usually more
more<00:03:19.709> expensive<00:03:20.190> more<00:03:20.580> expensive<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.540> then

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
more expensive more expensive and then

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.110 
more expensive more expensive and then
