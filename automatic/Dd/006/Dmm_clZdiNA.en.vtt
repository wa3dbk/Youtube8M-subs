00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.890
 ok we're recording hi guys like 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.870
 but how things go as usual 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.370
 I ask you how summer because why 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 I want to know if you are still alive well 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.299
 I'm still alive and nothing like 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.650
 you can see from the team you serve 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.270
 needed once provided then 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.820
 you can already see from the title of this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.230
 video I will reveal to you where the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 hedgehog in the last video I have 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.650
 published on richard h all that of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.789
 leonardo di caprio because he didn't have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.140
 see the link below in 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.849
 description but in the case can always 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.949
 going to see his search channel 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.690
 htt so not only will I reveal where it was 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.570
 hidden the hedgehog but I will also reveal you 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.480
 that is the winner of this drawing 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.520
 of the cai the grip crippa choukri pc 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 comics and then we go immediately to 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.789
 analyze and where it was hidden succeeds 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 meanwhile a premise 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 this is perhaps one of the most well-known curls 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.750
 hidden that I have ever hidden in all 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.730
 the videos in which I hid the hedgehog 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.670
 and indeed I was very worried about the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.530
 fact that was very ass I was there 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 very worried because I thought you didn't 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.119
 you could not see enough 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 in fact to which tommy person of di 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.860
 euro ie the hedgehog is not there but 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 just because I was worried 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
 that no one could possibly have succeeded in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 find him because he was really seen 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 just a little bit this time 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
 I have nobody noticed but I have 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.299
 a photo published before the video 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.670
 spoiler on the page and nobody has it 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.159
 noticed the photo spoiler on the page that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.280
 it was a huge clue 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.829
 and here it is to be able to see it well in the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.079
 3 minutes that this one should 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.329
 to be exactly 3 17 minutes when 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:51.000
 I raise my arm hidden under mine 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.710
 hairy armpit is the hedgehog and therefore 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.420
 some people have seen it anyway 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.090
 I am very happy but it makes me strange 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 that nobody noticed on the page 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.200
 there I published the screen that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.369
 is the day before two days before 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.570
 realization of the video of the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.490
 video publication 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.960
 I had published this stream and none 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.910
 he noticed anyway 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.770
 let's go straight to the point so you who 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.140
 you are looking at knowing who is the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.470
 real winner because you want to know if 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.209
 you got it right and in the case if I choose 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.370
 just you as winners 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.540
 no winner is meant to say 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.530
 winners of the creation can not be said 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.670
 winner on youtube 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.180
 but let's do as chosen chosen for 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.730
 the for the gift that the design therefore 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.920
 let's go straight to choosing ok 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.550
 then I choose to do randomly 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.550
 one thing I type the minute in 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.330
 search type 317 and then pushing 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.200
 randomly on the furrow until for 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.110
 go back and forth 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.870
 the first one that finds me then that one 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.500
 who comes out is the winner in this 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.030
 in case the winner writes it directly 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:14.640
 so in the press we take a pen 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:17.459
 like this ok so then the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.980
 winner is therefore we write our own 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:29.600
 so this can put it to you 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:32.600
 see then how to spell or my god 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 know 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:57.490
 to bean friend of yu gi liu river 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:01.090
 I wrote very badly akiko giglio juve 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.670
 this won this press at 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.830
 print of the dl pikachu so I am 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.660
 glad anyway that you managed to 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.020
 find hedgehog in the next but there 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.430
 I swear 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.620
 I'll try to do it a little easier 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.750
 so at least he did n't kill you too much a 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.570
 try to find the hedgehog maybe or 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.950
 I make really beautiful evident me 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.720
 I recommend you continue to follow the hedgehogs 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.660
 attacked because there will be many others 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.580
 drawings to be able to win many gods 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.250
 which will come directly from the channel 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.340

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.990
 I show then I will realize the drawing 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.790
 which then you could win in a video 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.800
 search capti and I recommend it 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.370
 stay up to date with rht talk e 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.070

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.700
 where it was hidden to hedgehog and who they will be 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.140
 the winners 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.090
