00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
as well well

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.850 
as well well
definitely<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.590> team<00:00:49.829> has

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860

seen tomorrow night different attitude
and<00:00:58.340> also<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.579> we'll<00:00:59.820> probably<00:00:59.910> see

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
on defenses where they had some good

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
on defenses where they had some good
they<00:01:05.400> played<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> better<00:01:05.790> fourth<00:01:06.120> quarter<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
they played a better fourth quarter and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.710 
they played a better fourth quarter and
they<00:01:06.690> might<00:01:06.870> try<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.110> pick<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.800> that<00:01:07.979> momentum

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
they might try and pick up that momentum

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.270 
they might try and pick up that momentum
how<00:01:09.720> much<00:01:09.870> does<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.110> help<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.710> able<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.380

unfortunately some of those turnovers
are<00:02:25.110> from<00:02:25.290> me<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> end

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
are from me in the end

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.619 
are from me in the end
trying<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.319> force<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.769> couple<00:02:29.069> things<00:02:29.220> but

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
trying to force a couple things but

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.820 
trying to force a couple things but
there's<00:02:30.629> got<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:30.870> smarter<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.620> think

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
there's got to be smarter and I think

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.559 
there's got to be smarter and I think
you<00:02:31.980> go<00:02:32.099> with<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> better<00:02:32.760> mindset<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.480> know

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
you go with a better mindset you know

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.710 
you go with a better mindset you know
we're<00:02:34.129> trying<00:02:35.129> to<00:02:35.250> reach<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.879> record<00:02:36.269> last<00:02:36.420> week
