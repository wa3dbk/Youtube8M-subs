00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
think this is just a cool Easter egg

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.380 
think this is just a cool Easter egg
that<00:02:36.950> Club<00:02:37.130> Penguin<00:02:37.370> put<00:02:37.550> in<00:02:37.700> because<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.270> be

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
that Club Penguin put in because to be

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.280 
that Club Penguin put in because to be
honest<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.810> doesn't<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.140> represent

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
honest it doesn't really represent

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.170 
honest it doesn't really represent
anything<00:02:39.740> besides<00:02:40.160> Halloween<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.150> I

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
anything besides Halloween but I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.900 
anything besides Halloween but I
definitely<00:02:41.390> think<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.900> they're<00:02:42.050> hinting<00:02:42.440> at

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
definitely think that they're hinting at

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.520 
definitely think that they're hinting at
how<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:43.970> Halloween<00:02:44.360> party<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.810> coming<00:02:45.230> up<00:02:45.350> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
how the Halloween party is coming up and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.660 
how the Halloween party is coming up and
they're<00:02:45.650> giving<00:02:45.860> us<00:02:45.980> something<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.490> look

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
they're giving us something to look

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.130 
they're giving us something to look
forward<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.330> just<00:02:47.810> thought<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:47.960> was

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
forward to I just thought that was

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.330 
forward to I just thought that was
really<00:02:48.290> funny<00:02:48.530> because<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:49.010> didn't<00:02:49.220> even

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
really funny because I didn't even

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.980 
really funny because I didn't even
notice<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.730> beforehand<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.420> read<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
notice it beforehand I read it on the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.050 
notice it beforehand I read it on the
wiki<00:02:51.110> like<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.530> said<00:02:51.770> but<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.580> really<00:02:52.910> really

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
wiki like I said but I really really

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.790 
wiki like I said but I really really
liked<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.390> for<00:02:53.840> some<00:02:53.990> reason<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.380> just<00:02:54.410> really

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
liked that for some reason I just really

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.220 
liked that for some reason I just really
think<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.430> really<00:02:55.670> cool<00:02:55.820> background<00:02:56.330> yeah

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
think it's a really cool background yeah

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.870 
think it's a really cool background yeah
so<00:02:57.500> these<00:02:58.010> are<00:02:58.310> some<00:02:58.490> of<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.640> things<00:02:58.790> that

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880
