some<00:01:59.549> talented<00:01:59.939> young<00:02:00.119> men<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> we've

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
some talented young men that we've

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.630 
some talented young men that we've
recruited<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.350> chance<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> step<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.549> be

recruited a chance to step up and be
great<00:02:02.969> players<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:04.049> that'll<00:02:04.469> happen

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
great players and I think that'll happen

great players and I think that'll happen
and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.899 
and
I<00:02:05.869> think<00:02:06.860> we're<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.010> lot<00:02:07.220> deeper<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.790> the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
I think we're a lot deeper in the

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.580 
I think we're a lot deeper in the
secondary<00:02:08.330> lot<00:02:08.690> more<00:02:08.869> experience<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
secondary lot more experience in the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.570 
secondary lot more experience in the
secondary<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:11.569> think<00:02:12.530> we're<00:02:12.830> very<00:02:12.860> solid<00:02:13.459> up

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
secondary so I think we're very solid up

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.220 
secondary so I think we're very solid up
front<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.940> think<00:02:14.180> we're<00:02:14.330> gonna<00:02:14.450> give<00:02:15.050> some

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
