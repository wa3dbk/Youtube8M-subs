00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.680
 and well hello to all we find ourselves for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.510
 a new part of the day so with a 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.340
 replay sent to us by yoyo 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:23.699
 big boss of the 31st of the clan 2db the 2nd db I 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.859
 think a 2nd armored division is one is 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.550
 in team battle on image of in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.079
 winter without surprise we have jubilation 3 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.760
 so in in the composition of 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.950
 the team and yoyo actually this 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.550
 pretty original composition a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.350
 carnival attend 34 t24 iron metal and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.120
 two opposite pitches is more 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.550
 conventional as a team at caen 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 composition only has two r31 t34 and 2 t1 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.730
 it's true that in general when I see 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.370
 original compositions I 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.410
 tend to tell me that it's not okay 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660
 to be effective that does not mean anything 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.269
 it's a matter of work as soon as they 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 pass and all players play 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.860
 really in a team and that his 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.960
 contact information 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.070
 whatever the charges it can 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 quite do it and not need 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.040
 to have in account to the silly follies for 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.630
 win or at 50 cent mx it's really 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.400
 a teamwork issue 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.250
 even if some floats like the carnival 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.480
 was 24 at the barrel level they are 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.870
 much less powerful crisis is king 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.300
 they have other qualities that can 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.710
 compensate for 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.520
 these weaknesses so has the yo yo se 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.440
 place on the right 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.600
 so we were acquired going forward there he 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.790
 for spots and the two terrors if it's 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.080
 a little bit advanced too and so he 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.780
 y to asharq and this side on the other side 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 atheists 34 and while in front there 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.380
 is king the zoets the raid metal is 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.460
 that what it is still sending 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.930
 prunes they do anyway 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.070
 a lot of damage and so he risks 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.840
 what but soon man some 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.520
 minds finally probably as much as he 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.120
 does not have much difficulty in drilling 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.130
 the hopes of face despite the armor 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.530
 hyper inclined ds3 was not wrong 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.660
 with a good pace a good pace 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.640
 and a good penetration value of 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.020
 penetration so there he is on the barrel 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.970
 at 12:08 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.370
 if I'm not mistaken then he does less 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.860
 damage we have 4 x 4 to 10 damage 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.420
 descent and rake penetration me 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.800
 personally I prefer the other piano 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.910
 solid 15 cm 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.880
 who does 780 damage is king who is 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.890
 there for now it is necessary that you can 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.640
 there he magnifies a little I find in bass 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.200
 they expose themselves far too much voice there 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.730
 to ultimately do nothing since it does 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.960
 do that to receive shots for 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.790
 as much as they cleaned up both grounds 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.360
 of the audio team so they find themselves 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.870
 without scouts and his photos yet 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.510
 still the status quo at it does not move forward 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.110
 too much they did not take he should have 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.400
 search with a rock composition 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.690
 so my opinion they really missed 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.840
 their art opportunity at this level 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.310
 so we agnÃ¨s 3 kg hp2 wireless hp on 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.940
 do not know where the others are we did not 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.170
 all seen so there I think he'll see 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.150
 an imminent bypass Hass hasi 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.980
 that's what I said so atheists 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.850
 34 6 3 who arrives from behind the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.520
 arrive on the cape 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.840
 they have who are capturing and 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.290
 alternating vonn who is in the process of 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.900
 to make a front turn back he did not forget 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.100
 crevier reinforcement to the voltage it their 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.290
 is the metal is very fragile so 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.720
 attention to its loss and produces very 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.430
 quickly the t34 metal raid him in 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.140
 anyway it's good you are cannet 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.239
 at the last shot was actually a 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.890
 little too risky 1 he had big 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.480
 chances of not doing damage 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.519
 jubilant three Hercules lakes and therefore of 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.409
 side of the poses sometimes they receive 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.200
 noodle metal replicas 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.239
 they are two to two half 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.319
 of their life points carnival without 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.019
 advanced since he still has all his 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.780
 points of life again one reasons on 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.969
 the flanks the tea 34 to die 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.500
 the king is there he has two dying shots 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.319
 attention there is the t1 that is behind 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.439
 fear cap and since just now 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.669
 so the zoo and at 33.17 villers chatila 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.340
 eat a little bit so they finish 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.569
 them t34 ds3 which always has 800 points of 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.459
 life almost thrown one who is behind 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.180
 him leading cap and right now 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.009
 double-dip cards is passed 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.919
 just behind carnavalet almost touching 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.320
 philippe of the same clan he is he has 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.140
 fly is a result of 4 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.090
 how awesome is he finishing 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.030
 y is carnival king did it all the same 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.300
 well managed also allowed anyway 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.280
 to stay under cover and there he will be able to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.930
 finish what they do what makes 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.430
 that they have completely saved the base 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.790
 it was not far we were less 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.620
 of ten points of yoyo capture and at 3 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.760
 kills for now there are still three 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.590
 tanks in front a t1 2nd 3 by cons the 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.310
 tipped this four lots hp can more 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.990
 moving forward 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.550
 the theater is here and is less exposed 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.780
 what's left only two tanks puyo 4 kills 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.270
 there are two left there is king 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.530
 so there we see in front he has beauty 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.880
 just under half of his points 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.820
 of life and then the carnival lost 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.280
 almost half the iace 6 the crowds 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.560
 tea 34 lots hpt 26 lots hp and so 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.940
 the victims are only tea 34 which 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:25.650
 can really move serenely 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:27.300
 that ofc effect also affected during 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.590
 head 34 in the laws I do sealer 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.350
 that's what could advance corn is 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.000
 taken at his prune prices there he has 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.100
 very calm and so it does not go too much 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.080
 advanced I imagine they said they 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.300
 expect that they were waiting for the office 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.620
 and the carnival that go around that go 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.320
 take the lead take them by the 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.250
 flanks then be there wallace is 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.020
 the same there they are 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.850
 he means to remain static which 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.440
 do that really expose themselves to 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.140
 bypass it asks for a 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.180
 bypass there it's really a shame 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.030
 from them as much the composition 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.580
 that they had not really 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.910
 example is not huge in default in 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.720
 gold in their compositions 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.730
 no longer use their strength which is the 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.870
 mobility speed and there may be 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:14.150
 in bad faith and so that's who 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.340
 finish the penultimate 3 is the last 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.880
 there he has 300 points of city on the air 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.510
 5 Kill stressed polio and then there will 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.340
 go for the last one so it's 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.780
 so here it was a shame and a very 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.660
 beautiful part I find it rather 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.990
 well managed without limit she was not 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.810
 necessarily a part where allah 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.250
 exceptional metal because we 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.320
 wanted level these levels 8 lorraine 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.750
 metal are fighting very very well against 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.970
 new again eight whatever the 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.430
 tank opposite it's more I find it 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.350
 there is a good coordination in his 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.690
 team despite a proposal that has 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.040
 quite original a bit too original and 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.810
 which still has a lot of deposit by 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.840
 relationship to the composition of a pass that 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.240
 is crazy beds exploited 34 so voila 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.950
 it was mostly to show his can not 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.170
 believe that there are only chips ds3 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.180
 and amic 55 people who can win the 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.370
 team battles 1 do not hesitate to 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.870
 change to take a little bit of t d 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.010
 epuis average tanks this can 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.440
 obviously very well do the earth 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.730
 afterwards it's mostly a coordination that 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.180
 yet between the members of your 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.340
 team 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.200
 so here I tell you all to very 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.220
 soon for a new part of the day 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.220
 ciao everyone
