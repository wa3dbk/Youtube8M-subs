is on the sea in this sea shorter the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.460 
is on the sea in this sea shorter the
second<00:03:37.010> bar<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.430> shared<00:03:37.910> by<00:03:38.210> this<00:03:38.270> scene<00:03:38.990> and

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
second bar is shared by this scene and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.930 
second bar is shared by this scene and
this<00:03:40.220> Court

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:04:04.180 

again

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190
