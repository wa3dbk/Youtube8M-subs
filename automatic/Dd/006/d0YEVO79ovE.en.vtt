launched says it hasn't been that way
for<00:00:19.859> decades<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.550> there's<00:00:21.000> good<00:00:21.180> reasons<00:00:21.570> why

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
for decades and there's good reasons why

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
for decades and there's good reasons why
no<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.100> couldn't<00:00:23.340> afford<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.850> it

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
no it is if we couldn't afford to do it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
no it is if we couldn't afford to do it
that<00:00:24.150> way<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.810> people<00:00:24.990> couldn't<00:00:25.320> afford<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that way the people couldn't afford to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.109 
that way the people couldn't afford to
buy<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> cherries<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.699> had<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> be

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
buy the cherries if we had to be

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.470 
buy the cherries if we had to be
harvested<00:00:27.960> by<00:00:28.170> by<00:00:28.830> hand<00:00:29.130> labor<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
harvested by by hand labor so this is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.030 
harvested by by hand labor so this is
where<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> lot<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> industry<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.679> gone

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
where a lot of the industry is gone

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.370 
where a lot of the industry is gone
we've<00:00:32.790> gotta<00:00:33.000> find<00:00:33.239> ways<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.870> things<00:00:34.170> using

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
we've gotta find ways to do things using

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.280 
we've gotta find ways to do things using
less<00:00:34.739> labor<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> beauty

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
less labor and the thing is the beauty

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.619 
less labor and the thing is the beauty
of<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.040> machine<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> work

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
of it is that machine will do the work

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.049 
of it is that machine will do the work
of<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> hundred<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.200> fifty<00:00:40.500> workers<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.910> buy

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
of a hundred and fifty workers to buy

of a hundred and fifty workers to buy
150<00:00:42.660> ladders<00:00:43.230> at<00:00:43.379> two<00:00:43.500> hundred<00:00:43.649> dollars

150 ladders at two hundred dollars
apiece

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
apiece

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.209 
apiece
we<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> machine's<00:00:46.289> expensive<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
we think the machine's expensive the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.400 
we think the machine's expensive the
ladders<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> expensive<00:00:48.329> -<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.809> just

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
ladders with the expensive - it's just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
ladders with the expensive - it's just
the<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> industry<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.149> it's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the way the industry is going and it's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.439 
the way the industry is going and it's
gone<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.550> you're<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.329> more

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
gone and you're going to see some more

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.959 
gone and you're going to see some more
innovations<00:00:55.079> don't<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.680> wrong<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.219> for

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
innovations don't get me wrong but for

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
innovations don't get me wrong but for
us<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> big<00:00:58.020> step<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.590> right

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
us this is a big step in the right

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.069 
us this is a big step in the right
direction<00:00:59.000> is<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> hard<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> taste<00:01:00.780> I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
direction is it hard on the taste I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.560 
direction is it hard on the taste I
think<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.000> anything<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.059> shakes<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
think it is anything that shakes the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
think it is anything that shakes the
tree<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.680> takes<00:01:04.890> ten<00:01:05.129> years<00:01:05.400> off<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
tree I think it takes ten years off the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.789 
tree I think it takes ten years off the
light<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.150> tree<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.200> we're<00:01:07.439> starting<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
light of a tree and we're starting to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.880 
light of a tree and we're starting to
prove<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> trees<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
prove that now and but the trees are

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
prove that now and but the trees are
easy<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> plan<00:01:11.520> there's<00:01:11.970> only<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.210> hundred<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
easy to plan there's only a hundred and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
easy to plan there's only a hundred and
eight<00:01:12.720> trees<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> acre<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.369> like

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
eight trees to the acre it's not like

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
eight trees to the acre it's not like
apples<00:01:14.970> were<00:01:15.060> planning<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> thousand

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
apples were planning now a thousand

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.770 
apples were planning now a thousand
trees<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> acre<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.700> relatively<00:01:18.630> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
trees to the acre so relatively it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
trees to the acre so relatively it's
it's<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.200> an<00:01:19.350> expensive<00:01:19.710> crop<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> plant<00:01:20.340> okay

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it's not an expensive crop to plant okay

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
it's not an expensive crop to plant okay
so<00:01:21.150> why<00:01:21.659> don't<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.560> regular

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so why don't we do this with regular

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.820 
so why don't we do this with regular
cherries<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:23.909> apples<00:01:24.420> we've<00:01:25.110> tried<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> with

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
cherries or apples we've tried it with

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.850 
cherries or apples we've tried it with
sweet<00:01:26.100> cherries<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.960> secret<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
sweet cherries and the secret of that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
sweet cherries and the secret of that
right<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.490> trevor<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.329> fact<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
right there trevor is the fact that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
right there trevor is the fact that
those<00:01:31.860> cherries<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.610> immediately

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
those cherries are going immediately

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.690 
those cherries are going immediately
into<00:01:33.780> cold<00:01:34.140> water<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.890> soon<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.250> their<00:01:35.400> harps

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
into cold water as soon as their harps

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.300 
into cold water as soon as their harps
you<00:01:35.970> notice<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:36.329> were<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> tank

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
you notice they were going into the tank

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.920 
you notice they were going into the tank
by<00:01:38.310> doing<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.880> we're<00:01:39.270> keeping<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.689> air<00:01:39.840> away

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
by doing this we're keeping the air away

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.499 
by doing this we're keeping the air away
from<00:01:40.079> them<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> any<00:01:41.490> bruises<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
from them and any bruises are on the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
from them and any bruises are on the
cherry<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.380> happens<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:44.009> cherry

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
cherry because what happens one cherry

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.760 
cherry because what happens one cherry
knocks<00:01:44.670> off<00:01:44.909> another<00:01:45.210> cherry<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:46.380> shake<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
knocks off another cherry we shake the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.460 
knocks off another cherry we shake the
tree<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.850> thing<00:01:48.060> that's<00:01:48.180> easiest<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.930> if
