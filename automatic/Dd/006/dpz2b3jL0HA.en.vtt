Charlotte if you've never worked off a
chart<00:00:14.580> before<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.420> seem<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.750> little

chart before they can seem a little
intimidating<00:00:16.410> at<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.040> but<00:00:17.910> really<00:00:18.330> once<00:00:18.630> I

intimidating at first but really once I
talk<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.439> through<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:19.920> you'll<00:00:20.220> see

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
talk you through it I think you'll see

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.800 
talk you through it I think you'll see
that<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:20.970> no<00:00:21.090> different<00:00:21.599> than

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that it's really no different than

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.200 
that it's really no different than
reading<00:00:22.200> the<00:00:22.500> text<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.730> has<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> added

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
reading the text and it has the added

a<00:00:26.550> visual<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.180> how<00:00:27.989> something<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.739> to

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
a visual of how something is going to

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.510 
a visual of how something is going to
look<00:00:29.310> after<00:00:29.579> it's<00:00:29.880> knit<00:00:30.290> so<00:00:31.290> for<00:00:32.040> each<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> our

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
look after it's knit so for each of our

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.500 
look after it's knit so for each of our
charts<00:00:33.000> you'll<00:00:33.840> see<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.829> row<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> blue<00:00:36.030> numbers

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
charts you'll see a row of blue numbers

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.490 
charts you'll see a row of blue numbers
these<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.560> your<00:00:37.740> row<00:00:38.070> numbers<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.500> you'll

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
these are your row numbers and you'll

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
these are your row numbers and you'll
notice<00:00:40.740> that<00:00:41.040> there<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.340> no<00:00:41.580> odd-numbered

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
notice that there are no odd-numbered

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.550 
notice that there are no odd-numbered
rows<00:00:42.990> it<00:00:43.350> goes<00:00:43.770> 2<00:00:44.070> 4<00:00:44.580> 6<00:00:44.940> 8<00:00:45.240> and<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:46.200> because

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
rows it goes 2 4 6 8 and that's because

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.380 
rows it goes 2 4 6 8 and that's because
the<00:00:46.740> instructions<00:00:47.400> tell<00:00:47.670> us<00:00:47.880> that<00:00:48.150> on<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the instructions tell us that on the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.570 
the instructions tell us that on the
odd-numbered<00:00:48.750> rows<00:00:49.560> which<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.370> wrong

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
odd-numbered rows which are the wrong

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.880 
odd-numbered rows which are the wrong
side<00:00:51.000> rows<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.200> supposed<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
side rows what we're supposed to do is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
side rows what we're supposed to do is
purl<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> entire<00:00:53.910> row<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> exception

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
purl the entire row with the exception

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.430 
purl the entire row with the exception
of<00:00:55.950> when<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.880> come<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.390> double<00:00:57.810> yarn<00:00:58.079> overs

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
of when we come to double yarn overs

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.030 
of when we come to double yarn overs
those<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.340> work<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.730> knit<00:01:00.180> 1<00:01:00.390> purl<00:01:00.420> 1<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> those

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
those we work as knit 1 purl 1 so those

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.950 
those we work as knit 1 purl 1 so those
are<00:01:02.220> simple<00:01:02.850> instructions<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.810> don't

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
are simple instructions and we don't

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.130 
are simple instructions and we don't
need<00:01:04.079> to<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.589> charted<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.700> us<00:01:05.880> so

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
need to have that charted out for us so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.450 
need to have that charted out for us so
what<00:01:07.140> we've<00:01:07.259> done<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.650> we've<00:01:07.799> charted<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
what we've done is we've charted out the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.569 
what we've done is we've charted out the
even<00:01:08.819> numbered<00:01:09.149> rows<00:01:09.679> so<00:01:10.679> let's<00:01:10.950> start<00:01:11.369> with

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
even numbered rows so let's start with

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.459 
even numbered rows so let's start with
the<00:01:11.700> first<00:01:11.939> row<00:01:12.329> that<00:01:12.600> you'll<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.109> to<00:01:13.259> come

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
the first row that you'll have to come

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.889 
the first row that you'll have to come
to<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.609> for<00:01:14.999> Row<00:01:15.270> 2<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:16.319> instructions<00:01:17.009> tell<00:01:17.369> us

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
to so for Row 2 the instructions tell us

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.770 
to so for Row 2 the instructions tell us
that<00:01:18.899> with<00:01:19.289> right<00:01:19.530> side<00:01:19.859> facing<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:21.299> first

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that with right side facing we first

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.739 
that with right side facing we first
cast<00:01:22.499> on<00:01:22.740> 5<00:01:23.069> stitches<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.969> we<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.270> using<00:01:24.539> the

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
cast on 5 stitches which we do using the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.639 
cast on 5 stitches which we do using the
cable<00:01:24.960> cast<00:01:25.319> on<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.149> then<00:01:27.149> we<00:01:27.299> knit<00:01:27.810> 12<00:01:28.289> and

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
cable cast on and then we knit 12 and

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.139 
cable cast on and then we knit 12 and
then<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> says<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.999> work<00:01:30.240> chart<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.139> row<00:01:31.829> two<00:01:32.149> so

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
then it says to work chart a row two so

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.289 
then it says to work chart a row two so
you<00:01:33.209> come<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.539> chart<00:01:33.959> a<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.499> here's<00:01:34.950> Row<00:01:35.189> 2<00:01:35.299> you

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you come to chart a and here's Row 2 you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.819 
you come to chart a and here's Row 2 you
read<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> charts<00:01:36.959> from<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.469> left

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
read the charts from right to left

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.859 
read the charts from right to left
because<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.030> same<00:01:39.270> direction<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
because that's the same direction that

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.099 
because that's the same direction that
we<00:01:40.139> knit<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.060> by<00:01:42.060> looking<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> symbols

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
we knit and by looking at the symbols

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.919 
we knit and by looking at the symbols
and<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.889> can<00:01:44.130> compare<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.359> key<00:01:45.630> on

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
and you can compare them to the key on

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.899 
and you can compare them to the key on
the<00:01:46.319> page<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.859> tells<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.219> what<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> symbols

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the page that tells you what the symbols

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
the page that tells you what the symbols
mean<00:01:47.969> you<00:01:48.959> can<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.529> if<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.740> read<00:01:49.979> this

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
mean you can see that if you read this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
mean you can see that if you read this
it<00:01:50.429> says<00:01:51.259> left<00:01:52.259> lifted<00:01:52.829> increase<00:01:53.420> knit<00:01:54.420> three

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
it says left lifted increase knit three

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.660 
it says left lifted increase knit three
yarn<00:01:55.490> over<00:01:56.569> double<00:01:57.569> increase<00:01:58.069> yarn<00:01:59.069> over<00:01:59.490> knit

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
yarn over double increase yarn over knit

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.609 
yarn over double increase yarn over knit
three<00:02:00.889> right<00:02:01.889> lifted<00:02:02.429> increase<00:02:03.319> so<00:02:04.319> that's

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
three right lifted increase so that's

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.730 
three right lifted increase so that's
what<00:02:04.889> you<00:02:05.039> work<00:02:05.279> and<00:02:05.779> then<00:02:06.779> the<00:02:06.959> pattern<00:02:07.229> will

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
what you work and then the pattern will

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.970 
what you work and then the pattern will
tell<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:11.600> knit<00:02:12.600> seven<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.380> then<00:02:13.800> you're

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
tell you to knit seven and then you're

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.370 
tell you to knit seven and then you're
at<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> end<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.790> row<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.930> that's<00:02:16.110> how

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
at the end of that row so that's how

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.540 
at the end of that row so that's how
you're<00:02:16.650> going<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.830> go<00:02:16.950> back<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.340> forth

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
you're going to go back and forth

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.150 
you're going to go back and forth
between

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
between

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.030

texts and chart as you work this so

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.190 
texts and chart as you work this so
let's<00:02:21.250> read<00:02:21.640> another<00:02:21.760> row<00:02:22.270> just<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.990> make<00:02:23.170> sure

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
let's read another row just to make sure

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.470 
let's read another row just to make sure
that<00:02:23.680> we've<00:02:24.580> got<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.910> clear<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.470> for<00:02:26.470> Row<00:02:26.650> 4<00:02:27.480> the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
from here on out as we go so let's do

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.300 
from here on out as we go so let's do
rows<00:03:19.690> 16<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.480> instructions<00:03:23.380> tell<00:03:23.680> us<00:03:23.709> for

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
rows 16 so the instructions tell us for

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.830 
rows 16 so the instructions tell us for
row<00:03:24.459> 16<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:25.990> knit<00:03:26.890> three<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.720> then<00:03:28.720> it

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
row 16 that we knit three and then it

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.370 
row 16 that we knit three and then it
tells<00:03:29.080> us<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.560> work<00:03:29.860> chart<00:03:30.400> B<00:03:30.640> row<00:03:31.090> 16<00:03:31.480> three

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
tells us to work chart B row 16 three

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.220 
tells us to work chart B row 16 three
times<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.910> means<00:03:34.150> you're<00:03:34.570> going<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.990> come
