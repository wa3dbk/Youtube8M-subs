GoPro hero3 to the gopro hero2 in mainly
looking<00:00:17.570> at<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:17.900> distortion<00:00:18.680> of<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.279> fisheye

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
looking at the distortion of the fisheye

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.330 
looking at the distortion of the fisheye
lens<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.320> what<00:00:21.740> we're<00:00:21.830> going<00:00:21.920> to<00:00:22.010> do<00:00:22.130> is<00:00:22.250> we're

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
lens so what we're going to do is we're

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.830 
lens so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:22.429> to<00:00:22.519> start<00:00:22.820> off<00:00:22.970> by<00:00:23.269> sending<00:00:23.539> these<00:00:23.630> two

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
going to start off by sending these two

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.109 
going to start off by sending these two
cameras<00:00:24.230> up<00:00:24.460> facing<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.730> I've<00:00:25.820> just<00:00:25.939> got<00:00:26.090> a

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
cameras up facing and I've just got a

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.019 
cameras up facing and I've just got a
piece<00:00:26.359> of<00:00:26.650> its<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:27.710> piece<00:00:27.830> of<00:00:27.859> graph<00:00:28.220> paper<00:00:28.250> so

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
piece of its a piece of graph paper so

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.419 
piece of its a piece of graph paper so
what<00:00:29.720> we<00:00:29.810> can<00:00:29.990> look<00:00:30.140> at<00:00:30.349> offset<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.130> camera<00:00:31.369> is

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
what we can look at offset the camera is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.010 
what we can look at offset the camera is
up<00:00:31.519> facing<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.300> we<00:00:32.360> can<00:00:32.509> look<00:00:32.630> at<00:00:32.810> how

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
up facing this and we can look at how

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.610 
up facing this and we can look at how
much<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.560> a<00:00:34.130> curve<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.000> lines<00:00:35.900> on<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.200> outside

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
much of a curve the lines on the outside

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.280 
much of a curve the lines on the outside
edge<00:00:36.800> of<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.100> get<00:00:37.420> when<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.660> cameras<00:00:39.050> start

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
edge of it get when the cameras start

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.470 
edge of it get when the cameras start
recording<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:40.790> can<00:00:40.940> move<00:00:41.030> farther<00:00:41.300> away

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
recording and we can move farther away

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.610 
recording and we can move farther away
from<00:00:41.750> them<00:00:41.870> we're<00:00:41.990> going<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.200> do<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:42.350> once

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
from them we're going to do this once

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.550 
from them we're going to do this once
outside<00:00:43.580> of<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.030> cases<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:44.870> just<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.230> cameras

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
outside of the cases so just the cameras

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.110 
outside of the cases so just the cameras
themselves<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.250> then<00:00:46.760> we'll<00:00:46.880> put<00:00:46.910> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
themselves and then we'll put the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.970 
themselves and then we'll put the
cameras<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:47.630> their<00:00:47.930> cases<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.710> see<00:00:48.860> if<00:00:48.890> that

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
cameras in their cases to see if that

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.060 
cameras in their cases to see if that
makes<00:00:49.220> a<00:00:49.370> difference<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:51.650> recording

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
makes a difference the recording

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.010 
makes a difference the recording
resolutions<00:00:52.550> on<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.760> cameras<00:00:53.150> are<00:00:53.300> both<00:00:53.720> set

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
resolutions on the cameras are both set

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.920 
resolutions on the cameras are both set
to<00:00:54.170> 1080p<00:00:54.620> at<00:00:55.070> 30<00:00:55.910> frames<00:00:56.120> per<00:00:56.300> second<00:00:56.750> in

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
to 1080p at 30 frames per second in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.360 
to 1080p at 30 frames per second in
protune<00:00:57.470> mode<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:59.840> can<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:00.350> both<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:01.010> 1080p

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
protune mode so you can see both a 1080p

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.359 
protune mode so you can see both a 1080p
both<00:01:02.360> of<00:01:02.510> 30<00:01:02.720> frames<00:01:02.960> per<00:01:03.020> second<00:01:03.500> both<00:01:03.950> 34<00:01:04.250> is

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
both of 30 frames per second both 34 is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.109 
both of 30 frames per second both 34 is
your<00:01:04.489> second<00:01:04.820> both<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.150> T<00:01:06.820> just<00:01:07.820> going<00:01:07.969> to<00:01:08.030> hit

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
your second both in T just going to hit

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.789 
your second both in T just going to hit
record<00:01:08.420> on<00:01:08.509> both<00:01:08.719> of<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.899> cameras<00:01:09.549> and<00:01:11.799> then

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
record on both of the cameras and then

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.649 
record on both of the cameras and then
they'll<00:01:12.979> start<00:01:13.070> recording<00:01:13.399> and<00:01:14.240> we'll<00:01:14.479> set<00:01:14.630> up

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
they'll start recording and we'll set up

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.550 
they'll start recording and we'll set up
a<00:01:14.810> test<00:01:16.420> all<00:01:17.420> right<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:17.750> guys<00:01:17.899> here's<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.200> test

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
a test all right so guys here's the test

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.399 
a test all right so guys here's the test
set<00:01:18.829> up<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.189> can<00:01:19.399> see<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.359> far<00:01:20.749> left<00:01:21.259> of

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
set up you can see on the far left of

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.010 
set up you can see on the far left of
the<00:01:21.469> frame<00:01:21.859> there's<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.640> piece<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.600> graph

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
the frame there's the piece of graph

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.630 
the frame there's the piece of graph
paper<00:01:24.049> which<00:01:24.619> i'm<00:01:24.770> holding<00:01:25.070> up<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:25.399> on<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
paper which i'm holding up and on the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.849 
paper which i'm holding up and on the
right<00:01:25.850> there's<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.210> cameras<00:01:26.689> i'm<00:01:27.380> trying<00:01:27.770> to

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
right there's the cameras i'm trying to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.679 
right there's the cameras i'm trying to
get<00:01:27.920> quite<00:01:28.399> close<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:28.999> cameras<00:01:29.329> i'll<00:01:29.570> move

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
get quite close to the cameras i'll move

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:30.969 
get quite close to the cameras i'll move
it<00:01:29.780> back<00:01:29.990> here<00:01:30.289> a<00:01:30.320> bit<00:01:30.469> we<00:01:30.619> can<00:01:30.710> see<00:01:30.799> what

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
it back here a bit we can see what

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.069 
it back here a bit we can see what
happens<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.460> shot<00:01:31.670> but<00:01:31.939> i'm<00:01:32.659> trying<00:01:32.990> to

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
happens in the shot but i'm trying to

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.399 
happens in the shot but i'm trying to
get<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.259> quite<00:01:33.649> close<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:36.170> piece<00:01:36.380> of

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
get it quite close to the the piece of

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.899 
get it quite close to the the piece of
paper<00:01:36.499> just<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.749> make<00:01:38.749> sure<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.909> grafter

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
paper just to make sure that the grafter

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.279 
paper just to make sure that the grafter
hit<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.210> hole<00:01:41.299> shot<00:01:41.569> and<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:41.899> really<00:01:42.140> get

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
hit to the hole shot and we really get

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.260 
hit to the hole shot and we really get
to<00:01:42.409> see<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.679> distortion<00:01:43.249> from<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:43.999> fisheye

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
to see the distortion from the fisheye

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.489 
to see the distortion from the fisheye
lens<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.600> on<00:01:44.719> the<00:01:44.810> edge<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.259> shot<00:01:50.499> we're

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
lens is on the edge of the shot we're

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.020 
lens is on the edge of the shot we're
now<00:01:51.590> going<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.829> go<00:01:51.889> ahead<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:52.429> slide<00:01:52.880> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
now going to go ahead and just slide the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:20.809 
now going to go ahead and just slide the
cameras<00:01:53.389> into<00:01:53.749> their<00:01:53.780> cases

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.720 

so<00:02:21.819> holding<00:02:22.270> both<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.600> these<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.520> graph

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
so holding both of these and the graph

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.520 
so holding both of these and the graph
paper<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:27.430> get<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> look<00:02:28.150> again<00:02:28.300> at<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
paper we get to have a look again at the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:39.900 
paper we get to have a look again at the
kind<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:31.260> change<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.950> distortion<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.850> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
kind of change in the distortion of the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.229 
kind of change in the distortion of the
two<00:02:40.209> cameras<00:02:40.690> depending<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.440> me<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:43.060> lens

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
two cameras depending on me on the lens

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.960 
two cameras depending on me on the lens
now<00:02:43.540> what<00:02:44.290> we've<00:02:44.500> learned<00:02:45.130> from<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.670> past

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
now what we've learned from the past

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.479 
now what we've learned from the past
experience<00:02:46.720> when<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.110> had<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.350> gopro<00:02:48.250> hero2

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
experience when we had the gopro hero2

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.630 
experience when we had the gopro hero2
in<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.910> dive<00:02:49.180> housing<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.049> not<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.400> dive

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
in the dive housing and not in the dive

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.130 
in the dive housing and not in the dive
housing<00:02:51.910> was<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.450> there<00:02:52.630> really<00:02:52.780> wasn't<00:02:53.019> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
housing was that there really wasn't a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.330 
housing was that there really wasn't a
very<00:02:53.260> big<00:02:53.350> difference<00:02:53.650> between<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
very big difference between the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.150 
very big difference between the
distortion<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:56.080> cameras<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:56.950> it'll<00:02:57.130> be

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
distortion of the cameras so it'll be

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.680 
distortion of the cameras so it'll be
interesting<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.850> see<00:02:57.940> if<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.950> holds<00:02:59.950> true

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
interesting to see if that holds true

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.500 
interesting to see if that holds true
with<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:02.110> hero<00:03:03.010> 1<00:03:03.549> or<00:03:03.850> with<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> server<00:03:04.420> with

the hero 3 in the hero to my expectation
is<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:07.900> whatever<00:03:08.170> we<00:03:08.410> saw<00:03:08.650> out<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.310> case

is that whatever we saw out of the case

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.099 
is that whatever we saw out of the case
will<00:03:09.760> be<00:03:09.880> exactly<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.390> same<00:03:10.450> as<00:03:10.690> what<00:03:10.810> we<00:03:10.840> see

will be exactly the same as what we see

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.630 
shot than a fish i shot the you will
have<00:03:44.380> seen<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.799> sample<00:03:45.130> footage<00:03:45.250> rolling

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
have seen the sample footage rolling

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.699 
have seen the sample footage rolling
throughout<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:45.910> shot<00:03:46.120> now<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.569> i<00:03:47.019> will<00:03:47.350> talk

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
throughout the shot now and i will talk

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.539 
throughout the shot now and i will talk
a<00:03:47.769> little<00:03:47.859> about<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.370> after<00:03:48.910> i<00:03:49.120> looked<00:03:49.420> at<00:03:49.569> it

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
a little about that after i looked at it

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.770 
a little about that after i looked at it
ok<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:51.609> i've<00:03:51.760> had<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> chance<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.359> look<00:03:52.480> over<00:03:52.600> the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
ok so i've had a chance to look over the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.949 
ok so i've had a chance to look over the
video<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.350> well<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.370> graph<00:03:55.209> paper<00:03:55.480> doesn't

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
video and well the graph paper doesn't

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.229 
video and well the graph paper doesn't
tell<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.709> much<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.310> story<00:03:57.579> about<00:03:57.700> what's

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
tell that much of a story about what's

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.090 
tell that much of a story about what's
going<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.989> how<00:03:59.019> much<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.560> fish<00:03:59.709> i<00:03:59.859> had

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
going on and how much the fish i had

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.789 
going on and how much the fish i had
effect<00:04:00.400> has<00:04:00.549> changed<00:04:01.060> if<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:02.139> look<00:04:02.350> at<00:04:02.560> the

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
effect has changed if you look at the

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.640 
effect has changed if you look at the
the<00:04:03.180> windowsill<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.630> wall<00:04:05.019> that's<00:04:05.410> in

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
the windowsill and the wall that's in

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.330 
the windowsill and the wall that's in
the<00:04:05.769> shot<00:04:06.010> on<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.760> left<00:04:07.120> of<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.690> shot<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.440> you

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
the shot on the left of the shot so you

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.360 
the shot on the left of the shot so you
can<00:04:09.549> see<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:10.180> amount<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.860> distortion

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
can see the amount of the distortion

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.110 
can see the amount of the distortion
between<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.670> hero

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
between the hero

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.430 
between the hero
to<00:04:13.269> an<00:04:13.390> hero<00:04:13.540> 3<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.840> thought<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.080> changed<00:04:14.260> a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
to an hero 3 I thought you changed a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.099 
to an hero 3 I thought you changed a
fair<00:04:14.680> bit<00:04:14.860> whereas<00:04:15.370> on<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.549> hero<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:16.870> wall

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
fair bit whereas on the hero to the wall

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.479 
fair bit whereas on the hero to the wall
starts<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.530> get<00:04:17.620> narrower<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.250> distance

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
starts to get narrower and the distance

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.219 
starts to get narrower and the distance
from<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.639> table<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.299> windowsill<00:04:20.019> starts

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
from the table and the windowsill starts

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.629 
from the table and the windowsill starts
to<00:04:20.290> get<00:04:20.350> an<00:04:20.440> error<00:04:20.590> on<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.859> hero<00:04:21.130> 3<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.489> does

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
to get an error on the hero 3 it does

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.490 
to get an error on the hero 3 it does
not<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.210> looks<00:04:22.389> way<00:04:22.540> more<00:04:22.570> square<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:25.500> think

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
not and it looks way more square I think

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.340 
not and it looks way more square I think
this<00:04:26.740> does<00:04:27.070> actually<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.370> pretty<00:04:27.520> good<00:04:27.669> job<00:04:27.820> of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
this does actually a pretty good job of
