see<00:03:14.020> all<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.489> called<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.050> kind

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
see all this this is called this is kind

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.479 
see all this this is called this is kind
of<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.530> guess<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.890> don't<00:03:17.950> know<00:03:18.070> what<00:03:18.340> they

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
of like I guess I don't know what they

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.190 
of like I guess I don't know what they
call<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.910> but<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.180> says<00:03:19.360> Mogo<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:19.989> I'm<00:03:20.080> gonna

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
call it but it says Mogo so I'm gonna

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.320 
call it but it says Mogo so I'm gonna
assume<00:03:20.290> it's<00:03:20.650> their<00:03:21.040> moko<00:03:21.459> padding<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.060> this

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
assume it's their moko padding on this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.900 
assume it's their moko padding on this
and<00:03:22.570> it's<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.530> able<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.220> keep<00:03:24.370> my<00:03:24.519> foot<00:03:24.730> up

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
and it's just able to keep my foot up

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.140 
and it's just able to keep my foot up
really<00:03:25.180> well<00:03:26.130> here's<00:03:27.130> kind<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.790> guess

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
really well here's kind of the I guess

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.090 
really well here's kind of the I guess
we<00:03:28.299> call<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.630> our<00:03:29.019> traction<00:03:29.440> plate<00:03:29.830> on<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
we call it our traction plate on the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.120 
we call it our traction plate on the
bottom<00:03:30.540> if<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:31.930> use<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.110> football<00:03:32.739> cleat

the<00:05:25.720> bottom<00:05:25.990> of<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.140> shoe<00:05:26.350> so<00:05:27.810> far<00:05:28.810> it's<00:05:29.140> held

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
the bottom of the shoe so far it's held

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.800 
the bottom of the shoe so far it's held
up<00:05:29.560> really<00:05:29.620> well<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:31.090> may<00:05:31.210> see<00:05:31.270> throughout

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
up really well you may see throughout

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.660 
up really well you may see throughout
it's<00:05:32.080> got<00:05:32.260> some<00:05:32.440> red<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.710> not<00:05:32.980> just<00:05:33.160> that's

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
it's got some red and not just that's

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.000 
it's got some red and not just that's
just<00:05:33.820> because<00:05:33.940> I<00:05:34.090> run<00:05:34.360> on<00:05:34.450> a<00:05:34.570> red<00:05:35.320> surface

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
just because I run on a red surface

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.480 
just because I run on a red surface
track<00:05:36.550> so<00:05:37.270> you'll<00:05:37.540> kind<00:05:37.720> of<00:05:37.780> see<00:05:37.960> it's<00:05:38.080> got

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
track so you'll kind of see it's got

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.250 
track so you'll kind of see it's got
sometimes<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.760> would<00:05:39.850> be<00:05:39.880> really<00:05:40.450> red<00:05:40.750> just

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
sometimes it would be really red just

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.770 
sometimes it would be really red just
depending<00:05:41.650> on<00:05:42.180> its<00:05:43.180> kind<00:05:43.360> of<00:05:43.420> worn<00:05:43.600> off

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
depending on its kind of worn off

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.540 
depending on its kind of worn off
because<00:05:44.020> I've<00:05:44.170> run<00:05:44.770> on<00:05:44.890> different<00:05:45.040> surface

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
because I've run on different surface

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.330 
because I've run on different surface
not<00:05:45.700> long<00:05:45.880> ago<00:05:46.120> but<00:05:46.360> it's<00:05:47.260> got<00:05:47.440> just<00:05:47.710> like<00:05:48.010> this

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
not long ago but it's got just like this

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.920 
not long ago but it's got just like this
nice<00:05:48.550> padding<00:05:49.120> through<00:05:49.300> here<00:05:49.480> it's<00:05:49.600> got<00:05:49.780> this

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
nice padding through here it's got this

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.650 
nice padding through here it's got this
I<00:05:50.110> think<00:05:50.290> this<00:05:50.410> is<00:05:50.560> like<00:05:50.890> a<00:05:50.950> gel<00:05:51.280> padding<00:05:51.660> just

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
I think this is like a gel padding just

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.280 
I think this is like a gel padding just
to<00:05:52.750> kind<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:52.930> help<00:05:53.080> soften<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.680> run<00:05:55.200> you<00:05:56.200> know

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
to kind of help soften the run you know

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.650 
to kind of help soften the run you know
I<00:05:56.320> think<00:05:56.620> I've<00:05:56.710> put<00:05:56.860> about<00:05:57.130> I'd<00:05:57.790> say<00:05:57.850> almost<00:05:58.180> 25

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
I think I've put about I'd say almost 25

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.370 
I think I've put about I'd say almost 25
miles<00:05:58.960> so<00:05:59.320> far<00:05:59.350> into<00:05:59.920> these<00:06:00.160> shoes<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:01.380> which

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
miles so far into these shoes and which

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.100 
miles so far into these shoes and which
really<00:06:02.830> isn't<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.250> lot<00:06:03.460> over<00:06:04.000> but<00:06:04.480> I've<00:06:04.960> only

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
really isn't a lot over but I've only

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.880 
really isn't a lot over but I've only
had<00:06:05.320> these<00:06:05.530> for<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:07.240> know<00:06:07.330> close<00:06:07.600> to<00:06:07.890> almost

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
had these for you know close to almost

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.770 
had these for you know close to almost
two<00:06:09.100> months<00:06:09.250> now<00:06:09.550> but<00:06:09.850> looking<00:06:10.450> to<00:06:10.540> get<00:06:10.660> more

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
two months now but looking to get more

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.750 
two months now but looking to get more
out<00:06:10.840> of<00:06:11.020> these<00:06:11.230> I<00:06:11.710> really<00:06:12.010> do<00:06:12.190> think<00:06:12.430> this<00:06:12.580> is

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
out of these I really do think this is

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.110 
out of these I really do think this is
just<00:06:13.090> a<00:06:13.210> good<00:06:13.720> neutral<00:06:14.200> running<00:06:14.530> shoe<00:06:15.120> from

just a good neutral running shoe from

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.180 
just a good neutral running shoe from
Brooks<00:06:16.420> and<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:17.140> would<00:06:17.290> highly<00:06:17.620> recommend<00:06:17.650> it

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780
