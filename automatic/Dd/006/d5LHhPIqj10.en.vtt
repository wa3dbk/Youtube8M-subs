00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
getting down to the wire it's getting to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.230 
getting down to the wire it's getting to
be<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.760> close<00:02:12.000> battle<00:02:12.240> now<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.040> yeah<00:02:14.150> racking<00:02:15.150> up

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
be a close battle now so yeah racking up

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.000 
be a close battle now so yeah racking up
more<00:02:15.390> damage<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.140> who<00:02:16.350> keeps<00:02:16.620> using<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
more damage and who keeps using the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.320 
more damage and who keeps using the
little<00:02:17.850> annoying<00:02:18.440> via<00:02:19.440> town<00:02:19.740> good<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.330> spawners

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
little annoying via town good I spawners

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.820 
little annoying via town good I spawners
but<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:21.900> really<00:02:22.050> effective<00:02:22.530> though<00:02:22.680> because

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
but it's really effective though because

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.430 
but it's really effective though because
we<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.160> just<00:02:23.250> flip<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.580> out<00:02:23.790> lowered<00:02:24.120> play<00:02:24.440> but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
we can just flip it out lowered play but

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.350 
we can just flip it out lowered play but
it<00:02:26.430> doesn't<00:02:26.700> get<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.880> much<00:02:26.940> damage

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it doesn't get out much damage

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.780 
it doesn't get out much damage
thankfully<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.650> go<00:02:29.280> ahead<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.520> I've<00:02:29.580> tried

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
thankfully so I go ahead and I've tried

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.310 
thankfully so I go ahead and I've tried
to<00:02:29.880> keep<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> lure<00:02:30.780> them<00:02:30.870> toward<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
to keep going to lure them toward the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.810 
to keep going to lure them toward the
edge<00:02:31.410> second<00:02:31.830> meteor<00:02:32.010> smash<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.670> it's

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
edge second meteor smash with it it's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.730 
edge second meteor smash with it it's
not<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.210> taking<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.260> too<00:02:34.470> well<00:02:34.590> it's

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
not really taking that too well it's

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.270 
not really taking that too well it's
really<00:02:34.950> counting<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.120> DL<00:02:36.420> are<00:02:36.570> damaged<00:02:37.280> so

so<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:06.890> think<00:04:07.130> about<00:04:07.160> Kirby<00:04:07.549> though<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.790> that

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
so you think about Kirby though is that

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.990 
so you think about Kirby though is that
he<00:04:08.330> has<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.780> side<00:04:09.170> B<00:04:10.100> which<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.340> great<00:04:10.790> in<00:04:10.910> the

mid air because I'm leaking it twice as

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.090 
mid air because I'm leaking it twice as
its<00:04:13.430> kind<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.120> Z<00:04:14.330> little<00:04:14.660> bit

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
I hit right on the right time it

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.220 
I hit right on the right time it
counters<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.300> he<00:04:37.510> shoots<00:04:37.720> out<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> bunch<00:04:38.140> of

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
counters it and he shoots out a bunch of

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.800 
counters it and he shoots out a bunch of
like<00:04:38.530> spores<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:40.000> damaged<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.480> he<00:04:40.570> upon

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
like spores and it damaged that he upon

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.560 
like spores and it damaged that he upon
itself<00:04:41.140> I<00:04:42.100> keep<00:04:42.460> trying<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.180> but<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.360> haven't

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
itself I keep trying that but I haven't

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.450 
itself I keep trying that but I haven't
really<00:04:43.660> hit<00:04:43.870> him<00:04:43.960> with<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.170> yet<00:04:44.380> walking<00:04:45.130> these

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
really hit him with it yet walking these

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.810 
really hit him with it yet walking these
attacks<00:04:45.930> but<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.830> also<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.130> risk<00:04:48.370> though<00:04:48.520> so

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
attacks but it's also a risk though so

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.750 
attacks but it's also a risk though so
because<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.390> know<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:49.840> may<00:04:50.320> not<00:04:50.500> get<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.860> off<00:04:51.130> at

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
because you know I may not get it off at

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.310 
because you know I may not get it off at
the<00:04:51.880> right<00:04:52.030> time<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.510> take<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.750> water<00:04:52.930> damaged

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
the right time and take a water damaged

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.290 
the right time and take a water damaged
so<00:04:53.500> go<00:04:53.980> ahead<00:04:54.040> and<00:04:54.130> I<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.490> knock<00:04:54.760> him<00:04:54.970> out<00:04:55.000> with

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
so go ahead and I I knock him out with

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.650 
so go ahead and I I knock him out with
the<00:04:55.360> side<00:04:56.230> smash<00:04:56.500> but<00:04:57.000> he<00:04:58.000> keeps<00:04:58.150> going<00:04:58.330> from

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
the side smash but he keeps going from

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.140 
the side smash but he keeps going from
with<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:58.990> little<00:04:59.110> brown<00:04:59.530> attacking<00:05:00.160> but<00:05:01.120> I

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
with that little brown attacking but I

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.060 
with that little brown attacking but I
actually<00:05:01.360> survived<00:05:01.930> all<00:05:02.110> week<00:05:02.710> especially

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
actually survived all week especially

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.940 
actually survived all week especially
those<00:05:03.400> factors<00:05:03.760> really<00:05:04.450> wide<00:05:05.230> like<00:05:05.650> it's

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
those factors really wide like it's

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.950 
those factors really wide like it's
really<00:05:06.160> why<00:05:06.370> it's<00:05:06.700> not<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:07.000> tall<00:05:07.300> but<00:05:07.600> really

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
really why it's not that tall but really

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.530 
really why it's not that tall but really
wide<00:05:08.140> so<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.440> can<00:05:08.770> recover<00:05:09.760> even<00:05:10.030> get<00:05:10.330> away

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
wide so you can recover even get away

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.370 
wide so you can recover even get away
out<00:05:10.720> there<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.020> finally<00:05:11.410> get<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:11.590> support<00:05:13.380> so

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
out there I finally get that support so

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.340 
out there I finally get that support so
um<00:05:15.130> she's<00:05:15.820> up<00:05:15.970> being<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.300> back<00:05:16.420> on<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.960> little

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
um she's up being it back on a little

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.800 
um she's up being it back on a little
roll<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.950> some<00:05:18.850> reason<00:05:19.150> I've<00:05:19.270> tried<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.660> do

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
roll and some reason I've tried to do

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.380 
roll and some reason I've tried to do
right<00:05:19.840> down<00:05:20.200> be<00:05:20.470> but<00:05:21.000> suffered<00:05:22.000> it's<00:05:22.150> too

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
right down be but suffered it's too

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.050 
right down be but suffered it's too
predictable<00:05:22.600> so<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:24.010> get<00:05:24.190> home<00:05:24.520> just<00:05:24.700> kicks

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
predictable so you get home just kicks

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.370 
predictable so you get home just kicks
me<00:05:25.270> I'm<00:05:25.720> still<00:05:26.110> surviving<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.490> wide<00:05:27.790> and<00:05:28.380> then
