was<00:03:02.890> massive<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.640> came<00:03:03.790> took<00:03:03.970> me<00:03:04.120> forever

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
was massive that came took me forever

and this one has even more 100 hours I

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.500 
and this one has even more 100 hours I
think<00:03:09.220> that's<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:09.760> low<00:03:09.910> side<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.390> be

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
think that's on the low side to be

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.720 
think that's on the low side to be
honest<00:03:10.840> there's<00:03:11.590> probably<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.070> lot<00:03:12.310> more<00:03:12.340> than

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
honest there's probably a lot more than

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.520 
honest there's probably a lot more than
that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
