00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:09.950
 we are in another unboxing video like 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.130
 I told them I will not stop I will raise the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.560
 praxis and the nitro let's open it nitro 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.490
 with what they see this made our 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.359
 new that I do not know what it is but it is very useful 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.359
 we can the lethal weapon here 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.650
 but without saying what I have that is a 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 submachine gun and has 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.780
 hey it's very china we're going to 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.340
 so this is a lethal weapon 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.850
 good 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.850
 and let's take out the gun first 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.610
 to see without hurting the gun 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.610
 and I think that's all 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.250
 here is gun help in all your 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.670
 splendor to this big backpack so 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.670
 that sells 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.180
 Well, if you want this, you can 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.280
 getting to me cost me a lot of work 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.550
 get obvious because as I am Mexican 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.620
 and we have a hard time getting these 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.260
 guns because when they take it out they 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.490
 they finish very fast I luckily the 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.720
 I got here here we are going to put it here 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.380
 a moment we have the instructive though 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.380
 I never read it 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.369
 here he says 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.990
 instructive let's go here is for nothing 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.760
 and here is the look I thought I was going to 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.030
 be a little smaller not since 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.670
 out of this good size they are also 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.670
 China, I think we're going to put it 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.709

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.709

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.220

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.879

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.430

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.430

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.640

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:23.560

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.560

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.950
 we are going to put them 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.510

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.819

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.280
