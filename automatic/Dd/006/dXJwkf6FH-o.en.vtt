 presumably macbook air 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.750
 in performance what should be 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.850
 something averages between and there and core i3

 according to apple in the first week of january 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.460
 the owners of the gadgets spent on NPP 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.070
 about half a billion dollars on 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.140
 app and in-app purchases like 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.030
 The company notes such an unprecedented 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.580
 activity did not notice consumers 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.290
 never before 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.989
 Apple recently received a patent for flexible 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.670
 smartphone thanks to new technology 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.310
 iphone or any other gadget you can 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.390
 bend folding tube 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.850
 warp without harming him 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600
 component are all from battery to 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.220
 processor 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.220
 must also be bent by them 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.540
 this week thanks to the files 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.180
 localization with 8 12 developers 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.430
 found that the voice assistant siri 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.920
 from apple soon learn to understand new 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.840
 languages ​​as evidenced by speech files 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.830
 goes about supporting czech slovak and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.870
 Polish 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.700
 but since Russian is indirect 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.290
 belong to this particular group and 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.390
 moreover is much more 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.220
 common in the world can safely 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.020
 assume that the apple is quite so 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 can announce series in Russian 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.220
 besides earlier there were rumors about the search 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.960
 employees by the apple with a view 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.570
 add seri support russian 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.120
 Danish Finnish and other languages well 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.070
 let's hope that in ios 9 voice 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.930
 the assistant will still get it so 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:24.550
 desired by all of us on the introduction of the company 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.830

 fresh this situation on the market p.k. 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.090
 based on the information provided 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.950
 the situation is in favor of apple in 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.440
 particular sales of mac computers 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.080
 increased over the past year by almost 19 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.180
 percent or in other words per 1 million 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.880
 devices closest to apple by 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.519
 success rate turned hp at 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.380
 manufacturer’s observed 15 percent 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.170
 growth analysts predict 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.030
 increase the share of computers on stn and in 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.970
 further reasons for declining interest 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.310
 There is no more consumer yet 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.209
 new superfine macbook air can 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.209
 its only warm 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.840

 air with retina-display can go on 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.730
 the market is already this quarter the thing is that 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.680
 quantum computer has already begun production 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.600
 in 12 inch devices in volume 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 sufficient for early sales 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.709
 analysts suggest retina macbook 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.840
 air would replace the current starting 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.940
 model 11 inch macbook air 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.280
 whereas the 13 inch version on the market 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.560
 will be left assumed that the new 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.770
 the product will receive intel series processors 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.840
 broadwell connector yusbi 31 type 7 track 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.180
 path without buttons and also thinner and 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.490
 lighter body 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.830

 Smartphone camera with dual lenses and 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.150
 also by force touch technology 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.370
 determining pressure on touch 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.139
 display and used in apple watch 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.759
 use two lenses like 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.530
 supposed to allow the manufacturer
