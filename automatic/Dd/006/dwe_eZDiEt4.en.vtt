00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
your guitar this way it is important

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.010 
your guitar this way it is important
that<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> go<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.920> get<00:02:26.010> heavier<00:02:26.400> strings

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
that you go out and get heavier strings

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.850 
that you go out and get heavier strings
because<00:02:28.020> they<00:02:28.260> are<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> lot

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
because they are going to be a lot

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.130 
because they are going to be a lot
looser<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.640> guitar<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.870> don't<00:02:31.020> want

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
looser on the guitar and you don't want

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.580 
looser on the guitar and you don't want
to<00:02:31.170> flopping<00:02:31.530> around<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.660> that's<00:02:33.660> about<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> C

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to flopping around so that's about it C

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.040 
to flopping around so that's about it C
sharp<00:02:34.920> drop<00:02:35.790> C<00:02:36.030> sharp<00:02:36.330> would<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.570> your<00:02:36.660> tuning
