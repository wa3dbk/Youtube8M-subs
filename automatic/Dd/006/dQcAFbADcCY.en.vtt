mung<00:00:09.300> beans<00:00:09.620> first<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.800> need<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> soak<00:00:11.340> them

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.200 

12<00:00:14.639> hours<00:00:15.830> until<00:00:16.830> until<00:00:17.550> they<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.850> swollen

to<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.170> dub<00:00:19.380> double<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> size<00:00:20.330> that<00:00:21.330> they

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to the dub double the size that they

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.740 
to the dub double the size that they
just<00:00:21.990> need<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.560> enough<00:00:22.800> water<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.130 

after<00:00:27.750> 12<00:00:28.050> hours<00:00:28.199> they<00:00:28.650> look<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:30.140> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
after 12 hours they look like this and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
after 12 hours they look like this and
we<00:00:31.320> need<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.710> rid<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> green<00:00:32.700> water<00:00:35.120> we

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
we need to get rid of the green water we

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.150 
we need to get rid of the green water we
don't<00:00:36.300> want<00:00:36.480> them<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.870> sprout<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.680> dirty

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
don't want them to sprout in in dirty

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
don't want them to sprout in in dirty
water<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> good<00:00:45.870> measure<00:00:46.110> i

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.360 
water and so just for a good measure i
rinsed<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:47.100> once<00:00:47.340> more

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.830 

then<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.460> pour<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.879> water<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.540> now<00:00:57.780> we

then I pour off the water and now we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.470 
then I pour off the water and now we
just<00:00:58.199> leave<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.680> sprout<00:00:59.059> no<00:01:00.059> more<00:01:00.269> water

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
just leave them to sprout no more water

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.619 
just leave them to sprout no more water
than<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:02.519> water<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> beans

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
than this the water that is on the beans

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.620 
than this the water that is on the beans
after<00:01:03.989> rinsing<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.850> see<00:01:05.850> absolutely<00:01:06.330> no

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
after rinsing and see absolutely no

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.719 
after rinsing and see absolutely no
water<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> button<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.979> risk<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.399> your

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
water in the button you risk it your

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
water in the button you risk it your
risk<00:01:08.940> bedded<00:01:09.270> rut<00:01:09.450> ins<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.110> well<00:01:10.860> pad

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
risk bedded rut ins and that's well pad

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.719 
risk bedded rut ins and that's well pad
in<00:01:11.520> any<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.960> 24<00:01:12.960> hours<00:01:13.110> later<00:01:13.440> they<00:01:14.399> look<00:01:14.580> like

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
in any way 24 hours later they look like

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
in any way 24 hours later they look like
this<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.200> rinse<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.649> every<00:01:16.979> 12

this and you have to rinse them every 12

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.800 
this and you have to rinse them every 12
hours<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:21.090> second<00:01:21.450> time<00:01:21.570> i

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

hours so this is the second time i
rinsed<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.170> after<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> start<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.549> sprout

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
rinsed them after this start to sprout

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.969 
rinsed them after this start to sprout
and<00:01:26.399> i<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.020> sieve<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.470> what's<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and i put the sieve in back what's this

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
and i put the sieve in back what's this
time<00:01:29.479> but<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:30.509> don't<00:01:30.660> have<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> pull<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.410> back

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
time but i don't have to pull them back

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.389 
time but i don't have to pull them back
in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.160> container<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.740> beans<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
in the container the beans are the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.639 
in the container the beans are the
sprouts<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.600> are<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.560> can

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
sprouts as they are now and you can

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.139 
sprouts as they are now and you can
actually<00:01:37.830> start<00:01:38.190> evenly<00:01:38.580> eating<00:01:39.000> them

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
actually start evenly eating them

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.899 
actually start evenly eating them
already<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:40.009> taste<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.130> greenbee

already they taste like greenbee
greenpeace<00:01:45.050> so<00:01:46.050> in<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.350> cool<00:01:46.740> dark<00:01:46.920> place<00:01:47.270> 24

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
greenpeace so in a cool dark place 24

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.740 
greenpeace so in a cool dark place 24
hours<00:01:48.569> and<00:01:49.020> i<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.289> rinsed<00:01:50.039> them<00:01:50.250> once<00:01:50.750> every

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
hours and i have rinsed them once every

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.840 
hours and i have rinsed them once every
12<00:01:52.020> hours<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:53.039> have<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.369> many<00:01:53.640> already

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
12 hours and we have this many already

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:04.440 
12 hours and we have this many already
and<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:54.840> i<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.649> taste<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.069> best

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.720 

but<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:05.600> just<00:02:05.780> repeat<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.230> process<00:02:06.650> every<00:02:07.430> 12

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
but we just repeat that process every 12

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.420 
but we just repeat that process every 12
hour<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:09.050> only<00:02:09.260> takes<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.680> minute<00:02:09.860> or<00:02:10.040> two<00:02:10.100> so

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
hour it only takes a minute or two so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.080 
hour it only takes a minute or two so
it's<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:10.940> much<00:02:10.970> trouble<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.880> leave<00:02:13.880> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it's not that much trouble and leave the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's not that much trouble and leave the
live<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.750> bit<00:02:15.080> off<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.980> they<00:02:16.070> can<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.340> some<00:02:16.520> air

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
live a bit off so they can get some air

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.900 
live a bit off so they can get some air
they<00:02:16.970> are<00:02:17.120> living<00:02:17.390> organisms<00:02:18.050> by<00:02:18.260> now<00:02:18.910> they

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
they are living organisms by now they

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.440 
they are living organisms by now they
are<00:02:20.090> actually<00:02:20.270> vegetables<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:26.240> as

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
are actually vegetables and this is as

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.790 
are actually vegetables and this is as
long<00:02:26.600> as<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.810> should<00:02:26.990> give<00:02:27.170> them<00:02:27.320> no<00:02:27.620> longer

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
long as you should give them no longer

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.630 
long as you should give them no longer
than<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.450> they<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.570> started<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.640> grow

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
than this they have started to grow

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.360 
than this they have started to grow
leaves<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:33.050> that's<00:02:33.350> time<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.740> get<00:02:33.890> bitter<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
leaves and that's time to get bitter and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.200 
leaves and that's time to get bitter and
I<00:02:34.490> get<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.820> dirty<00:02:35.660> taste<00:02:36.280> dirt<00:02:37.280> taste<00:02:37.820> that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
I get that dirty taste dirt taste that

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.480 
I get that dirty taste dirt taste that
the<00:02:38.540> bean<00:02:39.110> sprouts<00:02:39.470> can<00:02:39.710> get<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.040> when<00:02:40.370> they

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
the bean sprouts can get it when they

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.240
