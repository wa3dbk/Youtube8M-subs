00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:18.000
 For clarity, I took the thread of another 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.369
 colors now my my loop is 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.200
 in the same place where you should have it 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 when you stopped at the end of the row when 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.930
 fixed now we do 3 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.300
 air loops look now 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.480
 carefully turn the canvas 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 Here I turn his power just like that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.010
 top down i mean i got 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.920
 I hold it now on the wrong side now I 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.089
 I turn to myself these loops 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.940
 I put the hook in the first upper frame then 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.570
 there is this back loop of the loop in this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.600
 the case when I turned over and 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.290
 I knit a column with one without nakida 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.810
 doing again 3 air loops and 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 I knit the next shackle 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.680
 the back handle in this case is again 3 and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.680
 so i keep on knitting 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.470
 on and on and on 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.860
 3 air loops we should 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.850
 dope up to the moment when we get to 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.370
 look at the end of the circle you have now 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.070
 such a spiral where you can see stitches 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.159
 these are the stitches here and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 are those arms that remained 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.950
 now when i get to the edge i will start 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.909
 knit in each of these bows and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.159
 it will be an interesting picture 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.990
 interesting pattern 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:03.979
 there is another way to knit when 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.979
 here you are now knit these loops 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.840
 and you can alternate them that is not 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.110
 necessarily in each of the loops now 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.739
 You can perform this 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.110
 do a little further look like this 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.500
 it turns out here I do three and here 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.819
 skip the loop do the next yes 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:35.349
 then the loops are wider not 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:39.150
 so often they go in that case 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:44.440
 it turns out that your drawing has become more 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.459
 so loose not so packed dense 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:53.069
 as when knitting 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.069
 like this and become more loose 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.310
 experiment because it can 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.440
 be many many different ways for 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.630
 In order to understand what I am now 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.980
 said you need to just knit 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.579
 it will be this way and then 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.670
 in the same way when you have 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:20.079
 look at the gap anymore 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.920
 now a fringe is formed is a fringe 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:28.900
 just creates our petals in 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.299
 flower here you can do not just 3 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.590
 air loops can do more 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:41.340
 can be done with air loops 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.340
 any other elements 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:50.459
 this is an example of one of knitting 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.459
 bulk 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:02.370
 There is such a volume knitting which 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:08.020
 time here is one of the parts of it so when 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:11.380
 imposed upon the canvas of you into one 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.070
 free arc that is left 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.380
 in advance 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:19.150
 we get that we are just 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.660
 released beforehand left the handle and 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.810
 her 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.860
 knit now I'll get to the end of this one 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.570
 squad to show you how 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.230
 knit further 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.940
 to make it clearer and to the end 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.340
 the flower itself can already be up 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.340
 knit independently until the middle of it 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.800
 when you will knit already more distant 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.150
 rows inner rows 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.310
 it will be a little harder to interfere 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.289
 previous rows of petals that you 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.219
 already knitted here look I got to 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.560
 end and now i'm spiraling here 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:20.349
 here is a perfume that can be seen just 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.810
 here is the first moment when I use my finger 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:33.550
 move back the petals of the previous row 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:35.199
 this is how I see it once two three and again 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.330
 I see the leaves 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.710
 get in the way so I fold them with my finger 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.650
 last last column now 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.490
 I will see what happens now 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.279
 it looks like this 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.620
 unusual but very beautiful continue 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:56.729
 so here in a spiral go to the middle 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.729
 here to the end
