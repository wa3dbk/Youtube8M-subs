00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.979
 become more expensive drug prices 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.590
 rising incomes while falling workers 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.780
 places becomes less automatically 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.270
 growing tension in society and level 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.999
 aggression at such a time is very important 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.189
 to remain people when it’s not easy 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:34.189
 don't get past the evils of another maybe 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.079
 even a stranger has news 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.679
 fateful for the whole country of the region 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.359
 cities or parts of society have news 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.009
 fateful for one person we have 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.469
 journalism always teaches choose 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.450
 message on relevance they say that 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.270
 should touch most people then 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.429
 and interesting and still think that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.880
 troubles of those who are with us worthy 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.520
 maximum attention and should concern 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.079
 most and in this sense the story 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.139
 published by our ngs colleagues about 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.389
 mothers of three sons sick dtsp 

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.950
 it seems to me extremely important and not 

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:09.200
 just because they need 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.900
 support and help without a father 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.569
 you can imagine what it is 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.850
 grow up three sons 1 and slimmer 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.310
 more difficult when they need special care 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.530
 I will not retell in detail the most 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.960
 history explained that the boy is now 10 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.200
 years that mom does her best to 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.140
 they were happy 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.150
 that caring people responded 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 to a call for help published by our 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.959
 It turned out to be a lot of colleagues 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.000
 me in this publication especially 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.849
 hooked one phrase said and in an interview 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.709
 my colleagues are mother reaction of others 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.019
 my situation is different from 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.120
 ordinary people often go discussion 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.430
 our society is not ready for children with 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.870
 limited capacity 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.540
 disabled children mostly hide in 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.760
 apartments parents feel free to display 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.510
 them into society program accessible environment 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.140
 abstract concepts i think we then 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.790
 learn to understand forgive to negotiate 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.510
 when we recognize not on paper not in 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.000
 declarations in the soul the right to happiness 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.549
 each person we are different because 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.440
 beautiful world is colorful and 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.920
 polyphonic because we speak 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.680
 different languages ​​and with different intonations we 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.730
 born with different features and we 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.680
 have the right to different views maybe 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.760
 need as often as possible presents itself 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.160
 in place of others 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.010
 try to feel what they feel 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.680
 other people and then we can lower 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.430
 level of aggression and create a common 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.799
 happy accessible environment by the way about 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.230
 weather forecasters generously promised warm 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.560
 spring and warm summer 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.130
