00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 This morning I saw how hunger ate 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.970
 another pigeon 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.069
 there was only a wing dripping from him 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.200
 the blood and he all pecked and pecked at one and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.040
 same place here and there is nothing 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.080
 strange 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 how is it ok to eat yourself 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 like and here I thought that maybe this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.300
 the truth is that people look the same 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 the spirit just can't be together i rarely 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 I meet my people and just do not know 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 what to do with them so want to find that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.630
 I understand for myself and how to understand it 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.910
 I know how it should be 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.340
 so lack this feeling when you can 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.160
 talk about everything with it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.490
 keep silence it when people go silent 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.980
 and their thoughts scream shout and understand each 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.130
 friend how to understand exactly what is your 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.520
 man i often get carried away when only 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.800
 get acquainted it seems god in the water and gentle 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.350
 and passionate smart cheerful same 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.360
 difficult as i think is life and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.000
 shopping with you goes talented at 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.339
 not narcissist and dream like you 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 buy a house all together achieve be 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.930
 light up each other drink wine in 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.040
 car under the moon and it seems like I 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.650
 I will go down the aisle 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.380
 it will not be trivial stupid like everyone else 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.130
 and especially for good and all that I do not want 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.979
 get married 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.700
 I, like everyone, want my man 1 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.140
 native protector and loving husband 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.540
 think you found him it turns out he 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.640
 me and you on friends hangout or he 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.080
 just wanted to get you when you're here 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.960
 you sit next to him 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.030
 uninteresting and do not care he wanted to make sense 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.520
 life is the main thing who scored a goal in the last 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.950
 a match and you already plunged 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 you are already stuck and every time everything 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.270
 harder to break away harder then 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.240
 again and believe and look again 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.600
 and now decides what better to be at all 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.689
 alone you sit by the window 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.330
 and then it rains and he writes poems and you dream 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.420
 about how you will meet with someone like that 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.650
 calm and yet so exciting 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.290
 so you can feel yourself 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.840
 little little and nothing at all 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.080
 to think and to heat to spill on 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.569
 all your body from his gaze 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.450
 deep sweet with bitterness and through 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.790
 year to also tickled compression through 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.770
 two more 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.650
 so that he thinks you exist from you 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.800
 whether aliens are about why we live 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.810
 freedom about childhood chewing about how 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.100
 cool to have a dog for your mom and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.100
 preferably about everything at once 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.329
 I had this I ran away from him 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.530
 tired of jealousy spying up rooms in 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.409
 women's dorm around 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.810
 a sort of esenin yes I myself even more 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.730
 esenin we just exhausted each other and 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.519
 any burned in us and burned everything 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.680
 for a long time I generally thought that 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.450
 they normally cant help but think no 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.599
 worry never rest and not 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.450
 would stop and it hurt so much I was thinking 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.569
 that i'm all alone not catching up with anyone 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.819
 I do not understand and do not stop me strangers 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.370
 words harmony I canâ€™t be friends with 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.500
 myself and so scared to be alone to be 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.659
 with someone forever and everyone who is me 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.629
 once loved love other girls 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.760
 good calm on and not sad 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.370
 just still the same 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.319
 a man of my dreams 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.819
 afraid to meet him late or already 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.190
 met could not understand 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.440
 My friend and I know exactly when we need to. 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.140
 cry and when have fun I can 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.900
 call and say in the middle of the night to 7 me 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.879
 so for some reason it's scary in half an hour we 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.549
 we sit in bars and talk about movie pictures 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.310
 life and we well we know each other and 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.870
 we always understand that sometimes I think that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.579
 there must be a man somewhere 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.819
 and sometimes I think I need to look for him 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:51.370
 I do not know the time will tell but I will wait 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.910
 its as much as it takes my 1 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.910
 man of my dreams
