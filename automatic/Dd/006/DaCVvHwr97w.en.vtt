00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
cut your bread I say cut it because the

sliced bread that you get in shops is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200 
sliced bread that you get in shops is
generally<00:00:58.859> too<00:00:59.070> thin<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> work<00:00:59.940> well

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
generally too thin for this to work well

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.270 
generally too thin for this to work well
though<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> sharp<00:01:02.010> bread

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
bread without crushing the out of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.230 
bread without crushing the out of
it<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.390> buy<00:01:06.540> fit<00:01:06.840> cut<00:01:07.110> sliced<00:01:07.409> bread

it then just buy fit cut sliced bread
butter<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:09.510> side<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> bread<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.380> put<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
butter one side of the bread and put it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.500 
butter one side of the bread and put it
into<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> frying<00:01:11.250> pan<00:01:11.369> onto<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> medium<00:01:12.119> heat

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
into the frying pan onto a medium heat

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.580 
into the frying pan onto a medium heat
and<00:01:12.780> let<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.960> toast

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and let it toast

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.190 
and let it toast
then<00:01:14.280> take<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.790> flip<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> over<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.840> butter

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
then take it out flip it over and butter

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.590 
then take it out flip it over and butter
the<00:01:16.439> other<00:01:16.590> side<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> cut<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the other side then you can cut out your

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
the other side then you can cut out your
heart-shaped<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.500> find<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> easier<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
heart-shaped I find it's easier to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.640 
heart-shaped I find it's easier to
outline<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> heart<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> end<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
outline the heart with the end of a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.810 
outline the heart with the end of a
knife<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.610> I'm

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
knife but that's because I'm

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
knife but that's because I'm
functionally<00:01:24.299> useless<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.869> doing<00:01:25.080> anything

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
functionally useless at doing anything

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980 
functionally useless at doing anything
freehand<00:01:25.890> cut<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> heart<00:01:27.479> shape<00:01:27.720> and
