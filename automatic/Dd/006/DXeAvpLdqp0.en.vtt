00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.360
 I am posting a Gundam production video. It is a gunpla team. 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.720
 This time also following the last time, 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.000
 I would like to work on the production of Sotheby's foot. 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.340
 I have cut out a lot of parts here, but 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.460
 This part is 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.940
 Even the parts of Sozaby's feet will be the parts of the sune. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.220
 Last time I made this ankle part, 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.400
 It is part of upper part here, 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.300
 Down from the knee, it will be part of the upper part from the ankle. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 So, as before, 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.220
 There is no distinction between right and left foot, but in this part, 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.680
 You will see two identical parts lined up. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.160
 So as always 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.880
 Using this smear fill paint, 

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:52.154
 After putting in the smear, the rest is ... 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.400
 This part is silver part 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.080
 The rest is this yellow part, 

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.494
 I also want to paint this one, 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.700
 This silver part is titanium silver, 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 This yellow part, this one is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.960
 I would like to paint with titanium gold. 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 The amount that the smear put in the paint comes out, 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.760
 It is this solvent and cotton swab, using this, 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.120
 I would like to wipe it off. 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.380
 As we finished putting in, 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.420
 I would like to apply this frosted spray. 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.220
 As the frosted spray has dried, 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.100
 I would like to color this Weathering Master. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.340
 Coloring with Weathering Master is also complete. 

00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:40.677
 As painting was dry, 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.920
 I would like to assemble it.
