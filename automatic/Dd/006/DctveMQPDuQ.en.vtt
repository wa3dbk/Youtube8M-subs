00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.020 
out with this early probe and this does
come<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.200> surprise<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.649> me<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.759> saw

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
come as a bit of a surprise to me we saw

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.749 
come as a bit of a surprise to me we saw
that<00:02:03.060> he<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.600> scouting<00:02:04.049> out<00:02:04.409> much<00:02:04.979> earlier<00:02:05.159> in

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that he was scouting out much earlier in

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
that he was scouting out much earlier in
the<00:02:06.270> previous<00:02:06.659> games<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> figure<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.469> what

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the previous games to figure out what

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.589 
the previous games to figure out what
his<00:02:07.649> opponent<00:02:08.129> was<00:02:08.250> doing<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.360> game

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
his opponent was doing but in this game

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.290 
his opponent was doing but in this game
he<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.929> actually<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.590> scouting<00:02:11.310> he<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.849> simply

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
he is actually not scouting he is simply

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.120 
he is actually not scouting he is simply
staying<00:02:12.720> in

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
staying in

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.850 
staying in
bass<00:02:13.430> getting<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.120> very<00:02:14.330> strong<00:02:14.650> economy<00:02:15.650> and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
bass getting a very strong economy and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.160 
bass getting a very strong economy and
then<00:02:16.460> perhaps<00:02:16.730> moving<00:02:17.240> out<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.570> little<00:02:17.930> bit

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
then perhaps moving out a little bit

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.890 
then perhaps moving out a little bit
later<00:02:18.500> more<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.640> as<00:02:19.850> we<00:02:20.300> come<00:02:20.540> back<00:02:20.690> we

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
later more on that as we come back we

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.840 
later more on that as we come back we
are<00:02:21.080> looking<00:02:21.440> at<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> reaper<00:02:22.070> now<00:02:22.280> about<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.730> be

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
of the map very quickly spot that the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.960 
of the map very quickly spot that the
nexus<00:03:06.020> is<00:03:06.200> there<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.770> what<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.580> going<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.850> be

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
nexus is there and what is going to be

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.060 
nexus is there and what is going to be
the<00:03:08.090> follow-up<00:03:08.570> play<00:03:08.780> after<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.350> mothership

the follow-up play after this mothership
core<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.460> nearby<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.750> reaper<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.320> says

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
core is nearby and the reaper just says

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.320 
core is nearby and the reaper just says
to<00:03:12.680> himself<00:03:12.800> you<00:03:13.040> know<00:03:13.100> what<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.460> can't<00:03:14.030> deal

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
to himself you know what I can't deal

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.060

scout this out here now if non you all

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.380 
scout this out here now if non you all
wanted<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.590> be<00:03:27.830> extra<00:03:28.340> extra<00:03:28.370> deceptive<00:03:29.180> he

wanted to be extra extra deceptive he

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.960 
wanted to be extra extra deceptive he
could<00:03:29.690> in<00:03:29.870> fact<00:03:30.140> cancel<00:03:30.980> this<00:03:31.130> nexus<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.820> then

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
could in fact cancel this nexus and then

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.820 
could in fact cancel this nexus and then
go<00:03:32.180> for<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.450> four<00:03:32.810> gate<00:03:33.020> with<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.380> mothership

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830
