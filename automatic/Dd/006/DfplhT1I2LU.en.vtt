00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
see snowfall let's take a look at some

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.170 
see snowfall let's take a look at some
of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> current<00:00:50.340> temperatures<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:51.000> here

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
of the current temperatures out here

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
of the current temperatures out here
first<00:00:51.420> starting<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.840> Sumatra<00:00:52.350> 25<00:00:52.920> degrees<00:00:53.510> 25

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.600 
first starting in Sumatra 25 degrees 25
degrees<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.559> much<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> constant

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
degrees that's pretty much the constant

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
degrees that's pretty much the constant
for<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.510> time<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:57.989> year<00:00:58.230> oh<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:59.129> basically

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
for this time of year oh it's basically

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.500 
for this time of year oh it's basically
about<00:01:00.210> 20<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.230> 25<00:01:01.699> possibly<00:01:02.699> 30<00:01:03.059> degrees

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
about 20 to 25 possibly 30 degrees

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840 
about 20 to 25 possibly 30 degrees
Celsius<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.280> first<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> foremost

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
Celsius out here so first and foremost

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
Celsius out here so first and foremost
it<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.720> cold<00:01:07.140> enough<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.560> snow<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.070> did

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it is not cold enough for snow and did

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.260 
it is not cold enough for snow and did
not<00:01:08.700> snow

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
camera is to dodging all over the place

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.349 
camera is to dodging all over the place
but<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:22.090> does<00:03:22.180> feel<00:03:22.569> like<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:23.109> is<00:03:24.099> there<00:03:24.400> well

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359

is not real so with that said a lot said
there<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.299> video<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.630> not<00:04:16.810> real<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.440> with<00:04:17.590> that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
there the video is not real so with that

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.589 
there the video is not real so with that
said<00:04:18.099> I<00:04:18.159> guess<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.699> video<00:04:18.820> is<00:04:19.150> pretty

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
said I guess the video is pretty

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.810 
said I guess the video is pretty
harmless<00:04:20.199> in<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.739> sense<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.159> I<00:04:21.310> don't<00:04:21.609> think

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
harmless in the sense that I don't think

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.270 
harmless in the sense that I don't think
anybody<00:04:22.060> ran<00:04:22.659> out<00:04:22.900> buying<00:04:23.289> extra<00:04:23.560> blankets

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
anybody ran out buying extra blankets

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.550 
anybody ran out buying extra blankets
and<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.460> big<00:04:24.669> fur<00:04:24.969> coat<00:04:25.330> when<00:04:25.930> they<00:04:26.080> saw<00:04:26.320> this

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
and a big fur coat when they saw this

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.530 
and a big fur coat when they saw this
video<00:04:26.889> if<00:04:27.190> they<00:04:27.490> did

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
video if they did

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.210 
video if they did
then<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:28.960> guess<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.290> did<00:04:29.470> cause<00:04:29.710> some<00:04:29.740> damage

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
then I guess it did cause some damage

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.700 
then I guess it did cause some damage
for<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.580> most<00:04:31.090> part<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.540> probably<00:04:32.110> didn't<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
for the most part it probably didn't the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.340 
for the most part it probably didn't the
reason<00:04:33.220> why<00:04:33.430> these<00:04:33.490> people<00:04:33.790> made<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:35.020> video

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
reason why these people made this video

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.910 
reason why these people made this video
and<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.400> Mindanao<00:04:36.910> one<00:04:37.260> probably<00:04:38.260> as<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.530> gag

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
and the Mindanao one probably as a gag

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.340 
and the Mindanao one probably as a gag
and<00:04:39.310> also<00:04:39.790> if<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.120> noticed<00:04:40.630> on<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:41.170> it<00:04:41.320> is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
and also if you noticed on it it is

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.560 
and also if you noticed on it it is
monetized<00:04:42.130> which<00:04:42.640> means<00:04:42.940> they're<00:04:43.210> making

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
monetized which means they're making

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.050 
monetized which means they're making
money<00:04:43.720> off<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.440> both<00:04:45.040> videos<00:04:45.520> combined
