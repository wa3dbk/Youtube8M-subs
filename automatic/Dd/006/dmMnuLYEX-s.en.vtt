what's<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:42.960> nice<00:00:43.170> about<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.559> sneaker<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
what's really nice about the sneaker is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.650 
what's really nice about the sneaker is
that<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> features<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> fine<00:00:44.969> an<00:00:45.149> upper<00:00:45.420> that's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that it features a fine an upper that's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.270 
that it features a fine an upper that's
going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:45.989> very<00:00:46.200> similar<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> recent

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
going to be very similar to the recent

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.360 
going to be very similar to the recent
of<00:00:47.430> Planet<00:00:48.149> Roshi<00:00:48.360> run<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> say<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
of Planet Roshi run and what I say that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
of Planet Roshi run and what I say that
similarity<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> entire<00:00:51.899> upper<00:00:52.260> has

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
similarity is that the entire upper has

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.880 
similarity is that the entire upper has
an<00:00:53.190> interlocking<00:00:53.670> weave<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.539> fly<00:00:55.530> net<00:00:55.739> which

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
an interlocking weave of fly net which

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.889 
an interlocking weave of fly net which
adds<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> lot<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> support<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.239> giving

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
adds for a lot of support with giving

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.599 
adds for a lot of support with giving
you<00:00:57.989> some<00:00:58.170> flexibility<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
you some flexibility as you can see the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.869 
you some flexibility as you can see the
sneaker<00:01:00.000> moves<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:00.930> very<00:01:01.050> freely<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:02.640> does

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
sneaker moves very very freely it does

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.060

not<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.420> any<00:01:03.690> H<00:01:03.930> standing<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.830> does

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
not have any H standing but it does

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.060 
not have any H standing but it does
feature<00:01:05.510> basically<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> same<00:01:06.869> sock<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
feature basically the same sock that you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.030 
feature basically the same sock that you
saw<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> mercurial<00:01:09.570> fly<00:01:10.439> nets<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.830> well

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
saw on the mercurial fly nets as well

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.789 
saw on the mercurial fly nets as well
and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> also<00:01:11.939> has<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.510> nice<00:01:12.840> full

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and then it also has a very nice full

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
and then it also has a very nice full
ply<00:01:14.070> leather<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.060> back<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
ply leather on the back here now I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.630 
ply leather on the back here now I
originally<00:01:16.500> thought<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.860> pair<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.310> dirty

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
originally thought my pair was dirty

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.219 
originally thought my pair was dirty
because<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> midsole<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.049> some

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
because the midsole does have some

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
because the midsole does have some
speckling<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.890> kind<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.310> weird<00:01:20.580> gray

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
speckling that's kind of a weird gray

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.539 
speckling that's kind of a weird gray
but<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> gray<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.650> consistent

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
but the gray is consistent

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
but the gray is consistent
throughout<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.150> was<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> design<00:01:24.840> thing

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
throughout so this was a design thing

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
throughout so this was a design thing
don't<00:01:25.890> freak<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.460> me<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> think

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
don't freak out like me if you think

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
don't freak out like me if you think
that<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.659> pair<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.740> pre<00:01:28.950> worn<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that your pair was pre worn and the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.130 
that your pair was pre worn and the
other<00:01:29.880> thing<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
other thing that I really like about the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
other thing that I really like about the
black<00:01:31.350> model<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.829> particular<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> gun

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
black model in particular is the gun

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
black model in particular is the gun
hits<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> ounce<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.290> thing<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> goes

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
hits on the ounce or thing that goes

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
hits on the ounce or thing that goes
really<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.280> well<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.450> white<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.689> the

really really well with the white in the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
really really well with the white in the
black<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.799> far<00:01:38.040> they've<00:01:38.250> released<00:01:38.579> a
