00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.800
 so original for a kid 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 of the good athlete a search on the old 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.250

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.820
 old now that I can do the other one 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.890
 day on television I saw a 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.990
 documentary on the caterpillars explained that 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.330
 what they eat like the little ones do 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.100
 they live in cocoons and then you don't have to do 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.170
 other than going to an old man and closing 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.880
 of what prefers magistri right 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.290
 on the eastern front of a cozio but 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.430
 all these objects date back to 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.800
 second World War 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.380

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.690
 thousand 666 goal total destruction 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.649
 of everything and I think I was a pilot 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.810
 seriously 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.300
 you were a pilot who exactly was a 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.100
 test pilot pilot even 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.230
 inventor pilot inventor of this 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.120
 contraption was called apocalypse son 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.680
 of capacity I read well Mr gray e 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.970
 I hope you haven't forgotten to 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.980
 take the medicines 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.050

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.150
 sir knew to you that my uncle is 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.190
 was the inventor of the little slip 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.290
 mine will certainly be a search over 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.260
 negative an oven we will beat everything 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.010
 launching the operation h more 7 but which 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.050
 I'm doing 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.600
 woe to you if you touch my vestiges 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.319
 those are ancient museum pieces and that 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.900
 they are priceless 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.180
 but subjects here that I tell you how 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.040
 you can see the torpedo launchers of 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.140
 this beautiful model unfortunately not 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.420
 naturally this is more operational 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.680
 it happens for obvious security reasons but 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.660
 I would like to get your attention 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.520
 on the care with which they have been 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.380
 get details how the periscope is 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.180
 the electric passarella they allow 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.630
 to play within a radius of 200 meters or 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.630
 to end 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.970
 yes good no bad for a kid 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.410
 it's not bad compliments but 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.000
 wait for my turn to come 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.030

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.400

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.950
 of the second world war mine 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.230
 hero really did anything 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.330
 he was the pilot of the little safe sentinel 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.120
 myth make it a few slip nothing exists 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.340

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.340

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.400
 quiet son everything to his 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.620
 time the surprise effect plays on ours 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.120
 please in thesis we will surprise you at 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.130
 way of what i am going to take the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.600
 affirmative colonel trunk colonel ha 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.600
 little slip fronton late 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:04.950
 you know I didn't think titeuf's uncle 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.689
 were such rhinestones plots you saw it 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.329
 Dive this is a surprise effect 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.799
 I know that many of you think that i 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.959
 old are like chewing gum that 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.849
 they have lost the taste of strawberry but it is not 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.289
 not true at all 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.430
 some people will never be old and 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.430
 my uncle is one of them 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.870
 this is my uncle when giulio cesare 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.289
 the object being fed to the lions is not 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.910
 so called good I noticed so in 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.530
 quickly that lions do not even lived 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.940
 leaving and even now they are 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.960
 looking rather look good and vi 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.060
 I give an example 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.930
 hey presto 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.389
 off the fastest of the light and to the little 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.580
 worse just like that but without the wheels 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.380
 we must give the face to say ronchi e 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.030
 it's not over yet this is the bass 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.100
 which is adjusted in the five hundred because 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.680
 old where all had broken true and how 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.240
 certainly not breaking all that Clovis 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.630
 we could only leave it for a minute 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.680
 he did fu a glass ago was a vase 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:07.560
 traffic name was just a king 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.090
 bungling you expect there is more 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.889
 look at this is the suit that my uncle 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.990
 wears to set off to conquer the 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.280
 moon with the papalla and super spaceship 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.740
 so strafigo no dear I believe in short 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.510
 I would say that yours today is enough 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.760
 research was very interesting of course but 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.010
 a bit fanciful a bit like everyone 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.840
 I on the other hand like you want me to 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.800
 stop here but I haven't talked about yet 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:37.710
 pac a slip 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:39.330
 it is not right now I just want you 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.490
 you said you would talk about a 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.950
 old and instead tell a lot of 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.960
 nonsense worse for you I'm sorry 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.690
 my dear but I will be forced to give you a 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.550
 bad vote idagini to tell him 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.410
 we'll show you 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.419
 the apocalypse I have it here as it will be 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.190
 so lady will realize if we 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.039
 let's talk about stupid things 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.780
 now she is happy, here we are 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.180
 finally this is the little slip that 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.340
 what I told you a patented system in 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.350
 paired with von braun my dear lady 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.280
 inventor of the ray I taught him 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.539
 all of me 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.539
 make way that is 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.020
 much 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.020
 he has now left 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.890
 thank you thank you very much for 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.080
 his visit 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.030
 I don't know if this can be defined as one 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.000
 good research but I repeat that it was 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.440
 certainly imaginative and so but 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.390
 however twitter 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.100
 I think it's time you learned the 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.530
 difference that exists between the true 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.960
 story that is taught to you at school and 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.160
 the stories uncle told you about you 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.620
 heard what you said 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.210
 teacher and then there was that time 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.860
 with the captain surface we have 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.840
 prayed the soup the great boss of the 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.700
 space for this reason we have taken 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.800
 a shower of stroke laws but 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.600
 fortunately I had my anti suit 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.250
 crypto and I could react by making a 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.250
 fire an entire planet
