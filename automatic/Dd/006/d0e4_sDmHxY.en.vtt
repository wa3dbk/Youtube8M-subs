little faster you want to get it to cook
a<00:01:00.120> little<00:01:00.329> faster<00:01:01.730> just<00:01:02.730> hit<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> tiny

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
a little faster just hit it with a tiny

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.469 
a little faster just hit it with a tiny
bit<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> salt<00:01:04.790> salt<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> bring<00:01:06.299> out

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
bit of salt salt is going to bring out

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
bit of salt salt is going to bring out
all<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.960> sugars<00:01:07.290> now<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.619> sounds<00:01:07.890> sort

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
all of the sugars now that sounds sort

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
all of the sugars now that sounds sort
of<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.670> oxymoron<00:01:08.939> doesn't<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.659> salts

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of like an oxymoron doesn't it salts

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810

going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> bring<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> sugar<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.580> indeed

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
going to bring out the sugar but indeed

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
going to bring out the sugar but indeed
that's<00:01:12.030> exactly<00:01:12.450> what's<00:01:12.689> happening<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.560> salt

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that's exactly what's happening the salt

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
that's exactly what's happening the salt
is<00:01:14.040> allowing<00:01:14.490> these<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.820> weep<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.390> bit

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
is allowing these to weep a little bit

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
is allowing these to weep a little bit
when<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:15.810> weep<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> sugars

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
when they weep a little bit the sugars

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.530 
when they weep a little bit the sugars
come<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> allow<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
come out and that's going to allow a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.240 
come out and that's going to allow a
little<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.049> caramelization<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:22.250> that's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
little bit of caramelization and that's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.490 
little bit of caramelization and that's
the<00:01:23.430> sound<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> hear<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:25.040> great<00:01:26.040> sizzle
