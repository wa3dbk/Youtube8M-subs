00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
someone posted a question about

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.180 
someone posted a question about
ketogenic<00:00:18.230> diets<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.740> they're<00:00:18.860> asking<00:00:19.100> me

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
ketogenic diets and they're asking me

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.890 
ketogenic diets and they're asking me
what<00:00:19.369> my<00:00:19.400> opinion<00:00:19.520> is<00:00:20.029> specifically<00:00:20.660> for

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
what my opinion is specifically for

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.500 
what my opinion is specifically for
women<00:00:21.080> that<00:00:21.380> are<00:00:21.440> pre<00:00:21.860> menopausal<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:22.910> so

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
women that are pre menopausal and so

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.900 
women that are pre menopausal and so
what<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:24.350> thought<00:00:24.530> today<00:00:24.770> is<00:00:24.830> I<00:00:24.980> talk<00:00:25.220> more

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
what I thought today is I talk more

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.700 
what I thought today is I talk more
about<00:00:25.970> women<00:00:26.720> in<00:00:26.840> general<00:00:26.990> perhaps<00:00:27.530> women

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
about women in general perhaps women

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.880 
about women in general perhaps women
that<00:00:27.950> are<00:00:28.040> over<00:00:28.250> 35<00:00:28.550> or<00:00:28.910> even<00:00:28.970> over<00:00:29.420> 40<00:00:29.900> when

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
that are over 35 or even over 40 when

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.679 
that are over 35 or even over 40 when
they're<00:00:31.280> sort<00:00:31.520> of<00:00:31.580> getting<00:00:32.119> at<00:00:32.239> that<00:00:32.270> point

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
they're sort of getting at that point

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.630 
they're sort of getting at that point
where<00:00:32.960> things<00:00:33.230> are<00:00:33.440> starting<00:00:33.649> to<00:00:33.829> slow<00:00:34.039> down

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
where things are starting to slow down

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.369 
where things are starting to slow down
you<00:00:35.090> know<00:00:35.210> either<00:00:35.390> they're<00:00:35.719> they're<00:00:36.050> dealing

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
you know either they're they're dealing

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.310 
you know either they're they're dealing
with<00:00:36.910> tablets<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.059> slowing<00:00:38.360> down<00:00:38.390> or<00:00:38.870> weight

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
with tablets and slowing down or weight

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.900 
with tablets and slowing down or weight
gain<00:00:39.620> or<00:00:39.650> they're<00:00:40.040> seeing<00:00:40.250> it's<00:00:40.400> difficult<00:00:40.820> to

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
gain or they're seeing it's difficult to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.479 
gain or they're seeing it's difficult to
lose<00:00:41.570> weight<00:00:41.630> or<00:00:42.290> they're<00:00:42.920> seeing<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:43.340> there

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
lose weight or they're seeing that there

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.010 
lose weight or they're seeing that there
are<00:00:43.610> hormones<00:00:43.940> are<00:00:44.060> starting<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.390> draw<00:00:44.630> up<00:00:44.810> or

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
are hormones are starting to draw up or

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.860 
are hormones are starting to draw up or
they're<00:00:45.470> getting<00:00:45.590> insulin<00:00:46.280> resistant<00:00:46.880> having

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
they're getting insulin resistant having

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.160 
they're getting insulin resistant having
sugar<00:00:48.050> issues<00:00:48.470> things<00:00:48.680> like<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:50.170> what

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
sugar issues things like that and what

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.139 
sugar issues things like that and what
do<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.350> think<00:00:51.380> of<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.680> ketogenic<00:00:52.250> diet<00:00:52.550> in

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
do I think of a ketogenic diet in

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.150 
do I think of a ketogenic diet in
relation<00:00:53.630> to<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:53.930> pretty<00:00:54.770> much<00:00:54.860> first<00:00:55.070> of

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
relation to that pretty much first of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.200 
relation to that pretty much first of
all<00:00:55.220> for<00:00:55.460> those<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.730> don't<00:00:55.850> know<00:00:55.970> what<00:00:56.149> a

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
all for those that don't know what a

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.060 
all for those that don't know what a
ketogenic<00:00:56.540> diet<00:00:56.989> is<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.410> what<00:00:57.500> I'm<00:00:57.590> talking

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
ketogenic diet is and what I'm talking

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.310 
ketogenic diet is and what I'm talking
about<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:58.969> pretty<00:00:59.090> much<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.510> super<00:00:59.840> super

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
about it's pretty much a super super

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.979 
about it's pretty much a super super
super<00:01:00.860> low<00:01:01.550> carbohydrate<00:01:02.149> diet<00:01:02.360> it's<00:01:02.630> it's<00:01:02.899> a

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
super low carbohydrate diet it's it's a

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.219 
super low carbohydrate diet it's it's a
diet<00:01:03.290> that's<00:01:03.590> about<00:01:03.950> I<00:01:04.369> would<00:01:05.299> say<00:01:05.420> maximum<00:01:05.930> 50

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
diet that's about I would say maximum 50

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.590 
diet that's about I would say maximum 50
grams<00:01:06.469> of<00:01:06.770> carbs<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:07.189> day<00:01:07.219> so<00:01:07.909> it's<00:01:08.030> very<00:01:08.270> low<00:01:08.479> in

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
grams of carbs a day so it's very low in

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.300 
grams of carbs a day so it's very low in
carbohydrates<00:01:09.200> just<00:01:09.619> for<00:01:09.799> someone<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.159> know

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
carbohydrates just for someone to know

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.209 
carbohydrates just for someone to know
what<00:01:10.640> 50<00:01:11.390> grams<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.780> carbohydrates<00:01:12.439> is<00:01:12.649> that

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
what 50 grams of carbohydrates is that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.669 
what 50 grams of carbohydrates is that
would<00:01:13.399> be<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.670> equivalent<00:01:13.969> to<00:01:14.329> two<00:01:14.569> apples<00:01:15.079> so

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
would be the equivalent to two apples so

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.980 
would be the equivalent to two apples so
someone<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.280> having<00:01:16.490> only<00:01:17.299> 50<00:01:17.600> grams<00:01:17.810> of

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
someone is having only 50 grams of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.830 
someone is having only 50 grams of
carbohydrates<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.889> day<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.579> usually<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.630> diet

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
carbohydrates a day and usually the diet

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.679 
carbohydrates a day and usually the diet
is<00:01:21.350> pretty<00:01:22.189> much<00:01:22.369> mostly<00:01:22.789> animal<00:01:23.270> meets

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
is pretty much mostly animal meets

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.510 
is pretty much mostly animal meets
animal<00:01:24.109> products<00:01:24.529> it's<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.740> very<00:01:24.979> high<00:01:25.249> fat

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
animal products it's a very high fat

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.429 
animal products it's a very high fat
diet<00:01:25.819> and<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.179> very<00:01:26.539> very<00:01:26.779> very<00:01:27.109> low

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
diet and a very very very low

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.919 
diet and a very very very low
carbohydrate<00:01:28.399> diet<00:01:28.609> and<00:01:28.909> somewhere<00:01:29.749> in<00:01:29.840> the

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
carbohydrate diet and somewhere in the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.469 
carbohydrate diet and somewhere in the
middle<00:01:29.959> with<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.409> protein<00:01:30.859> and<00:01:31.299> pretty<00:01:32.299> much

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
middle with the protein and pretty much

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.749 
middle with the protein and pretty much
our<00:01:33.049> bodies<00:01:33.579> normally<00:01:34.579> use<00:01:35.479> our<00:01:36.759> glucose

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
our bodies normally use our glucose

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.480 
our bodies normally use our glucose
stores<00:01:38.119> or<00:01:38.450> sugar<00:01:38.990> or<00:01:39.020> carbohydrates<00:01:39.859> stores

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
stores or sugar or carbohydrates stores

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.609 
stores or sugar or carbohydrates stores
for<00:01:40.729> fuel<00:01:40.969> but<00:01:41.509> when<00:01:41.749> you're<00:01:42.020> putting<00:01:42.529> your

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
for fuel but when you're putting your

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.190 
for fuel but when you're putting your
body<00:01:42.649> into<00:01:43.039> ketosis<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:44.090> eating<00:01:44.599> a<00:01:44.689> very<00:01:44.899> low

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
body into ketosis and eating a very low

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.379 
body into ketosis and eating a very low
low<00:01:45.469> carbohydrate<00:01:46.099> diet<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.579> that<00:01:47.119> it

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
low carbohydrate diet is that it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.539 
low carbohydrate diet is that it
eventually<00:01:47.630> forces<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.439> body<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:49.310> start

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
eventually forces the body to start

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.699 
eventually forces the body to start
burning<00:01:49.759> fat<00:01:49.969> as<00:01:50.539> fuel<00:01:50.719> because<00:01:50.810> it's<00:01:51.469> run<00:01:51.679> out

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
burning fat as fuel because it's run out

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.149 
burning fat as fuel because it's run out
of<00:01:52.099> the<00:01:52.639> the<00:01:52.969> carbohydrate<00:01:53.569> stores<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.349> so

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
of the the carbohydrate stores and so

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.339 
of the the carbohydrate stores and so
this<00:01:55.609> is<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.819> way<00:01:56.029> for<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.329> lot<00:01:56.749> of<00:01:56.810> people<00:01:57.109> to

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
this is a way for a lot of people to

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.559 
this is a way for a lot of people to
jump<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.829> start<00:01:58.099> their<00:01:58.219> metabolism<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.209> start

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
jump to start their metabolism to start

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.349 
jump to start their metabolism to start
losing<00:01:59.810> weight<00:02:00.020> rapidly<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:01.130> for<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.149> lot<00:02:02.270> of

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
losing weight rapidly and for a lot of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.840 
losing weight rapidly and for a lot of
people<00:02:02.539> that<00:02:02.599> have<00:02:02.840> any<00:02:03.020> kind<00:02:03.319> of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
people that have any kind of

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.149 
people that have any kind of
resistance<00:02:04.330> or<00:02:04.479> sugar<00:02:04.689> issues<00:02:05.159> this

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
resistance or sugar issues this

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.920 
resistance or sugar issues this
direction<00:02:06.790> of<00:02:06.880> going<00:02:07.180> into<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.540> lower

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
direction of going into a lower

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.260 
direction of going into a lower
carbohydrate<00:02:08.410> diet<00:02:08.979> can<00:02:09.729> really<00:02:09.970> help<00:02:10.090> to

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
carbohydrate diet can really help to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.600 
carbohydrate diet can really help to
balance<00:02:10.390> their<00:02:11.170> body<00:02:11.380> out<00:02:11.620> now<00:02:12.069> what<00:02:12.430> do<00:02:12.520> I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
balance their body out now what do I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.570 
balance their body out now what do I
think<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.000> ketogenic<00:02:13.630> diet<00:02:13.959> though

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
think of a ketogenic diet though

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.090 
think of a ketogenic diet though
ketogenic<00:02:15.580> diet<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.300> extremely<00:02:16.900> low<00:02:17.230> in

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
ketogenic diet is so extremely low in

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.770 
ketogenic diet is so extremely low in
carbohydrate<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.850> find<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.239> too<00:02:19.450> low<00:02:19.600> I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
carbohydrate so I find it's too low I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.540 
carbohydrate so I find it's too low I
find<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.140> like<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> crash<00:02:20.950> diet<00:02:21.220> and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
find that like as a crash diet and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.040 
find that like as a crash diet and
something<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:21.940> want<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.150> do<00:02:22.270> for<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.480> few<00:02:22.540> days<00:02:22.840> to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
something I want to do for a few days to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.380 
something I want to do for a few days to
sort<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.319> jumpstart<00:02:23.920> things<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.700> don't<00:02:25.000> see

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
sort of jumpstart things and I don't see

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.870 
sort of jumpstart things and I don't see
a<00:02:25.420> problem<00:02:25.660> with<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.110> because<00:02:26.440> even<00:02:26.920> even<00:02:27.670> a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
a problem with that because even even a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.260 
a problem with that because even even a
water<00:02:28.209> fast<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.870> actually<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> ketogenic<00:02:29.890> diet

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
water fast is actually a ketogenic diet

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.180 
water fast is actually a ketogenic diet
but<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.540> do<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.959> over<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.260> long-term<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
but to do that over the long-term I

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.199 
but to do that over the long-term I
think<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.060> too<00:02:34.239> low<00:02:34.480> in<00:02:35.069> carbohydrates<00:02:36.069> and

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
think it's too low in carbohydrates and

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.570 
think it's too low in carbohydrates and
I<00:02:37.209> think<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.720> if<00:02:37.840> someone<00:02:38.680> were<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> go<00:02:39.160> up<00:02:39.190> to

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
I think that if someone were to go up to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.630 
I think that if someone were to go up to
at<00:02:39.700> least<00:02:39.819> 100<00:02:40.569> carbs<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.350> day<00:02:41.530> or<00:02:42.069> even<00:02:42.430> maybe

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
at least 100 carbs a day or even maybe

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.900 
at least 100 carbs a day or even maybe
120<00:02:43.420> or<00:02:43.540> 150<00:02:44.140> you're<00:02:44.739> still<00:02:45.040> at<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.610> low

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
120 or 150 you're still at a low

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.449 
120 or 150 you're still at a low
carbohydrate<00:02:46.569> diet<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.590> it's<00:02:47.860> not<00:02:47.950> as<00:02:48.250> low<00:02:48.430> as

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
carbohydrate diet but it's not as low as

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.449 
carbohydrate diet but it's not as low as
50<00:02:49.090> 50<00:02:49.569> is<00:02:49.600> really<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.290> low<00:02:50.470> low<00:02:51.010> you

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
50 50 is really like the low low you

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.770 
50 50 is really like the low low you
know<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:52.030> like<00:02:52.330> if<00:02:52.450> you're<00:02:52.600> just

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
know it's really like if you're just

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.930 
know it's really like if you're just
eating<00:02:52.989> 50<00:02:53.500> or<00:02:53.590> less<00:02:53.650> grams<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.370> carbs<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.760> day

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
eating 50 or less grams of carbs a day

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.850 
eating 50 or less grams of carbs a day
you're<00:02:55.480> pretty<00:02:55.750> much<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:55.959> eating<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.560> lot<00:02:56.739> of

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
you're pretty much just eating a lot of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.850 
you're pretty much just eating a lot of
me<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.190> lot<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.340> fats<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.120> very<00:02:58.860> few

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
me it's a lot of fats and a very few

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.970 
me it's a lot of fats and a very few
vegetables<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.750> know<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
vegetables that's it you know and the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.070 
vegetables that's it you know and the
problem<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.910> our<00:03:03.940> bodies<00:03:04.390> adapt<00:03:04.840> to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
problem is is that our bodies adapt to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.360 
problem is is that our bodies adapt to
whatever<00:03:05.260> we're<00:03:05.590> doing<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.130> you're<00:03:06.250> doing

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
whatever we're doing and if you're doing

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.550 
whatever we're doing and if you're doing
something<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.000> extreme<00:03:07.420> like<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.870> then<00:03:08.440> your

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
something so extreme like that then your

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.350 
something so extreme like that then your
body<00:03:08.769> eventually<00:03:09.280> starts<00:03:09.579> adapting<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.209> that

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
body eventually starts adapting to that

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.720 
body eventually starts adapting to that
and<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.900> becomes<00:03:11.230> harder<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.650> harder<00:03:11.799> to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
and then it becomes harder and harder to

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.759 
and then it becomes harder and harder to
get<00:03:13.090> more<00:03:13.269> results<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.260> even<00:03:14.410> stick

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
get more results on it and to even stick

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.560 
get more results on it and to even stick
on<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.700> sometimes<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.209> find<00:03:16.420> it's

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
on it and so sometimes I find it's

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.720 
on it and so sometimes I find it's
better<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:17.380> be<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.530> little<00:03:17.769> bit<00:03:17.950> more<00:03:18.100> moderate

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
better to be a little bit more moderate

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.539 
better to be a little bit more moderate
we<00:03:18.970> don't<00:03:19.150> need<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.780> extreme<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:21.459> you

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
we don't need to be so extreme that you

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.729 
we don't need to be so extreme that you
can<00:03:21.700> still<00:03:22.000> be<00:03:22.030> on<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> low<00:03:22.720> carbohydrate<00:03:23.380> diet

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
can still be on a low carbohydrate diet

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.500 
can still be on a low carbohydrate diet
but<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.430> allowing<00:03:24.700> yourself<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.180> little<00:03:25.329> bit

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
but just allowing yourself a little bit

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.910 
but just allowing yourself a little bit
more<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:26.049> I<00:03:26.170> find<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:26.560> you're<00:03:26.680> allowing

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
more and I find if you're allowing

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860 
more and I find if you're allowing
yourself<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.579> 100<00:03:28.000> grams<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.390> carbs<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.840> day

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
yourself like 100 grams of carbs a day

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.170 
yourself like 100 grams of carbs a day
you've<00:03:29.500> way<00:03:29.829> more<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.280> choose<00:03:30.489> from<00:03:30.549> there's<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
you've way more to choose from there's a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.210 
you've way more to choose from there's a
much<00:03:31.540> more<00:03:31.570> variety<00:03:32.019> in<00:03:32.440> your<00:03:32.470> diet<00:03:32.859> and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
much more variety in your diet and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.880

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.600 
run into the issue of losing bone mass
and<00:04:28.260> we<00:04:28.380> don't<00:04:28.560> want<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.370> we

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
and we don't want that that we

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.730 
and we don't want that that we
definitely<00:04:30.030> don't<00:04:30.180> want<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.050> it's

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
definitely don't want and so it's

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.410 
definitely don't want and so it's
important<00:04:32.280> that's<00:04:32.610> why<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.880> find<00:04:33.240> it's

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
important that's why I find it's

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.230 
important that's why I find it's
important<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.110> go<00:04:34.950> up<00:04:35.130> more<00:04:35.370> than<00:04:35.670> 50<00:04:36.000> grams

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
important to go up more than 50 grams

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.180 
important to go up more than 50 grams
100<00:04:36.720> grams<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.440> carbs<00:04:37.710> would<00:04:37.860> be<00:04:37.980> much<00:04:38.160> better

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
100 grams of carbs would be much better

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.550 
100 grams of carbs would be much better
because<00:04:38.670> you'd<00:04:39.300> be<00:04:39.420> able<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.780> have<00:04:40.290> more

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
because you'd be able to have more

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.470 
because you'd be able to have more
vegetables<00:04:41.040> in<00:04:41.160> your<00:04:41.250> diet<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:42.090> more<00:04:42.300> variety

low-carb<00:04:58.500> diet<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.010> be<00:04:59.820> having<00:05:00.320> broth

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
low-carb diet is to be having broth

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.680 
low-carb diet is to be having broth
especially<00:05:02.100> bone<00:05:02.310> broth<00:05:02.610> into<00:05:03.060> their<00:05:03.210> diet<00:05:03.419> to

especially bone broth into their diet to

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.110 
especially bone broth into their diet to
bring<00:05:04.320> in<00:05:04.500> more<00:05:04.710> minerals<00:05:05.190> because<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.910> lot<00:05:06.090> of

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
bring in more minerals because a lot of

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.330 
bring in more minerals because a lot of
times<00:05:06.480> they're<00:05:07.020> getting<00:05:07.290> all<00:05:07.560> that<00:05:07.710> fat<00:05:08.010> and

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
times they're getting all that fat and

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.220 
times they're getting all that fat and
the<00:05:08.400> protein<00:05:08.430> from<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.030> meats<00:05:09.300> but<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:10.080> might

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
the protein from the meats but it might

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.630 
the protein from the meats but it might
be<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.380> little<00:05:10.620> bit<00:05:10.740> low<00:05:10.860> in<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.100> minerals<00:05:11.430> and

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
be a little bit low in the minerals and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.430 
be a little bit low in the minerals and
that<00:05:11.760> they<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.210> get<00:05:12.390> from<00:05:12.750> having<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.290> bone

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
that they can get from having the bone

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.830 
that they can get from having the bone
broth<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.010> then<00:05:14.490> also<00:05:14.669> having<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.419> lot<00:05:15.660> of
