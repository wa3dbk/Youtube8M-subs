00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
just like so let's go to pick it out

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.130 

so<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.140> going<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.380> start<00:02:35.680> from<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.920> bottom

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
so just going to start from the bottom

so just going to start from the bottom
okay<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.950> right<00:02:42.190> good<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:43.420> your<00:02:43.900> thumb<00:02:44.050> at<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
okay all right good so your thumb at the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.910 
okay all right good so your thumb at the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
top after bending half of it down go

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.630 
top after bending half of it down go
ahead<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.660> pool<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:49.960> underneath<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:54.520> it
