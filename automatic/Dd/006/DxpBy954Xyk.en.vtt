00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
purpose of this but I can only speculate

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.430 
purpose of this but I can only speculate
that<00:01:19.500> it'll<00:01:20.250> increase<00:01:20.580> power<00:01:21.330> swerve<00:01:21.869> control

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
that it'll increase power swerve control

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.160 
that it'll increase power swerve control
and<00:01:22.860> maybe<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:24.119> help<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.539> cold<00:01:24.869> climate

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and maybe also help in the cold climate

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.160 
and maybe also help in the cold climate
in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> South<00:01:25.740> African<00:01:26.220> winter<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:27.690> ball<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
in the South African winter this ball is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.400 
in the South African winter this ball is
very<00:01:28.200> very<00:01:28.800> responsive<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:29.810> over<00:01:30.810> inflated<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
very very responsive I over inflated the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.889 
very very responsive I over inflated the
ball<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.710> first<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.970> still<00:01:33.300> did<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.509> feel

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
ball at first and it still did not feel

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.590 
ball at first and it still did not feel
hard<00:01:34.380> when<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.770> striking<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> mean

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
hard when I was striking it what I mean

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.680 
hard when I was striking it what I mean
is<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.929> materials<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> casing<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
is the materials and the casing and the

the ball coming off your foot it's like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.370 
the ball coming off your foot it's like
hitting<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> sweet<00:01:47.190> spot<00:01:47.460> every<00:01:47.880> time<00:01:48.380> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
hitting the sweet spot every time this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.800 
hitting the sweet spot every time this
seams<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> ball<00:01:50.220> are<00:01:51.209> also<00:01:51.539> close

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
seams on the ball are also close

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.400 
seams on the ball are also close
together<00:01:52.310> closer<00:01:53.310> than<00:01:53.580> before<00:01:54.289> there<00:01:55.289> is

together closer than before there is

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.139 
together closer than before there is
very<00:01:55.649> little<00:01:55.860> gap<00:01:56.160> in<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.429> seams<00:01:56.759> which<00:01:56.940> made

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
very little gap in the seams which made

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.779 
very little gap in the seams which made
it<00:01:57.270> hard<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.569> count<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.050> panel's<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.670> way

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
it hard to count the panel's the way

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.330 
it hard to count the panel's the way
that<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> panels<00:02:00.450> are<00:02:00.599> designed<00:02:01.160> make<00:02:02.160> the
