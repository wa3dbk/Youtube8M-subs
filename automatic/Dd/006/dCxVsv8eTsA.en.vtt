very neat so that is how you use vinyl
as<00:06:13.350> a<00:06:13.380> resist<00:06:13.919> because<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.880> paint<00:06:15.150> stays<00:06:15.630> on

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
as a resist because the paint stays on

the vinyl and when you pull it off it

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.330 
the vinyl and when you pull it off it
reveals<00:06:18.570> the<00:06:18.810> color<00:06:19.020> underneath<00:06:19.260> so<00:06:20.130> you<00:06:20.220> can
