digits here there is a wide range of
digits<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
digits really but the one that I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.950 
digits really but the one that I
recommend<00:01:49.770> mostly<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.729> nine<00:01:50.909> ten<00:01:51.240> because

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
recommend mostly is at nine ten because

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.499 
recommend mostly is at nine ten because
you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.850> it's<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> best<00:01:54.240> one

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you can actually it's the best one

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.780 
you can actually it's the best one
