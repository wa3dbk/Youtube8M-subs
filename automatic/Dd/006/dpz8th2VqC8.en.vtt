first memory of playing it was actually

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.789 
first memory of playing it was actually
in<00:04:07.239> school<00:04:07.569> when<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.049> friend<00:04:08.349> of<00:04:08.470> mine<00:04:08.650> had

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
in school when a friend of mine had

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.740 
in school when a friend of mine had
brought<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.310> game<00:04:09.459> I'm<00:04:09.699> not<00:04:10.180> sure<00:04:10.239> why<00:04:10.569> he

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
brought in the game I'm not sure why he

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.599 
brought in the game I'm not sure why he
was<00:04:10.840> allowed<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.169> bring<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.769> but<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.250> think

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
was allowed to bring it in but I think

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.920 
was allowed to bring it in but I think
because<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.090> game<00:04:13.269> had<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> number<00:04:13.750> of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
because the game had a number of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.110 
because the game had a number of
real-world<00:04:14.260> locations<00:04:14.699> that<00:04:15.699> it<00:04:15.849> would<00:04:16.000> help

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
real-world locations that it would help

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.729 
real-world locations that it would help
us<00:04:16.359> with<00:04:16.510> geography<00:04:16.810> or<00:04:17.169> something<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.680> that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739
