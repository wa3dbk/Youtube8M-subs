and<00:01:30.430> was<00:01:30.520> patient<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.080> obviously<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.200> paid

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
and was patient and obviously it paid

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.929 
and was patient and obviously it paid
off<00:01:32.409> for<00:01:32.560> us<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.920> win<00:01:33.100> but<00:01:33.340> that's<00:01:33.790> probably

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
off for us to win but that's probably

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.010 
off for us to win but that's probably
there's<00:01:34.210> been<00:01:34.330> nights<00:01:34.510> where<00:01:34.570> it's<00:01:34.750> cost<00:01:34.930> me

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
until right at the checkered flag and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.420 
until right at the checkered flag and
you<00:01:59.020> were<00:01:59.140> being<00:01:59.350> really<00:01:59.650> patient<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.189> your

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
you were being really patient with your

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.340 
you were being really patient with your
tire<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.060> start<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.540> I<00:02:01.720> thought<00:02:02.170> for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
tire on the start and I thought for

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.660 
tire on the start and I thought for
surely<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.680> had<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:02.950> but<00:02:03.070> we<00:02:03.159> think<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:03.430> had<00:02:03.549> at

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
surely you had it but we think we had at

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.219 
surely you had it but we think we had at
least<00:02:03.790> five<00:02:04.030> blown<00:02:04.270> tires<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.750> unfortunately

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
least five blown tires and unfortunately

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.800 
least five blown tires and unfortunately
you're<00:02:05.500> one<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.770> them<00:02:05.920> yeah<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.329> last

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
you're one of them yeah just the last

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.389 
you're one of them yeah just the last
couple<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.319> restarts<00:02:08.769> air<00:02:08.920> was<00:02:09.129> shaking

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
couple of restarts air was shaking

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.420 
couple of restarts air was shaking
really<00:02:09.519> bad<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.099> could<00:02:12.250> tell<00:02:12.400> that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
really bad and there you could tell that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.309 
really bad and there you could tell that
it<00:02:12.580> was<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:13.000> was<00:02:13.090> getting<00:02:13.360> slick<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
it was it was getting slick and it

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.540 
it was it was getting slick and it
wasn't<00:02:14.530> really<00:02:14.680> stick<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.860> as<00:02:15.010> well<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.370> was

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
wasn't really stick it as well as it was

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.250 
wasn't really stick it as well as it was
and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.380 
and
the<00:02:16.530> last<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.250> last<00:02:17.400> corner<00:02:17.700> coming<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the last the last corner coming for the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.670 
the last the last corner coming for the
checkered<00:02:18.540> he<00:02:18.689> just<00:02:18.870> kind<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.080> eased<00:02:19.260> up<00:02:19.500> off

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
checkered he just kind of eased up off

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.110 
checkered he just kind of eased up off
the<00:02:19.799> corner<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.549> wouldn't<00:02:20.760> stay<00:02:20.879> down

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
the corner and really wouldn't stay down

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.240 
the corner and really wouldn't stay down
where<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.299> wanted<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:21.780> Donna<00:02:22.739> got<00:02:22.890> by<00:02:23.040> it's

where I wanted it and Donna got by it's

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.740 
where I wanted it and Donna got by it's
just<00:02:23.400> one<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.549> those<00:02:23.610> things<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.629> know

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750

just one of those things that you know
it<00:02:24.950> eases<00:02:25.950> were<00:02:26.069> probably<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.579> best

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
it eases were probably one of the best

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.699 
it eases were probably one of the best
out<00:02:26.939> there<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:28.079> know<00:02:28.170> when<00:02:28.319> he<00:02:28.379> gets<00:02:28.470> by

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
to him but it is a heartbreak to to lead

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.699 
to him but it is a heartbreak to to lead
that<00:02:33.269> many<00:02:33.450> laps<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:33.840> still<00:02:34.230> run<00:02:34.349> second

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
that many laps and still run second

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.309
