00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
some hilarious and it's kind of but it's

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.029 
some hilarious and it's kind of but it's
a<00:00:15.780> little<00:00:15.900> bit<00:00:15.990> discouraging<00:00:16.590> though<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.010> uh

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
a little bit discouraging though that uh

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.830 
a little bit discouraging though that uh
people<00:00:17.910> watch<00:00:18.060> me<00:00:18.270> only<00:00:18.449> because<00:00:18.690> they

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
people watch me only because they

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.080

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
little bit discouraging I guess that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.590 
little bit discouraging I guess that
means<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> little<00:00:24.269> bit<00:00:24.390> less

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
means I'm just a little bit less

interesting than chicken sex but so
anyway<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.109> decided<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.560> look<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.859> Google<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
anyway I decided to look on Google and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.679 
anyway I decided to look on Google and
see<00:00:29.429> how<00:00:29.580> chickens<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> cuz<00:00:30.599> I've

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.269 
see how chickens actually do it cuz I've
often<00:00:30.869> wondered<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.500> chickens<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.130> it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
often wondered how chickens do it

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.069 
often wondered how chickens do it
because<00:00:32.550> well<00:00:32.850> well<00:00:33.210> maybe<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.510> often<00:00:33.930> but

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
because well well maybe not often but

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
because well well maybe not often but
sometimes<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> anyway<00:00:35.820> here's<00:00:36.180> how<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> goes

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
sometimes so anyway here's how it goes

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
sometimes so anyway here's how it goes
the<00:00:37.350> well<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:38.129> start<00:00:38.370> off<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> barnyard

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the well they start off in the barnyard

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.389 
the well they start off in the barnyard
and<00:00:39.750> there's<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.140> five<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:40.680> six<00:00:40.710> hands<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and there's like five or six hands to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.530 
and there's like five or six hands to
each<00:00:41.579> rooster<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> mean<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
each rooster I mean it's like a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.319 
each rooster I mean it's like a
polygamist<00:00:43.079> compound<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.829> places<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
polygamist compound in places and so the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.700 
polygamist compound in places and so the
rooster<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.840> gets<00:00:45.989> his<00:00:46.110> pick<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> any<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
rooster really gets his pick of any of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
rooster really gets his pick of any of
the<00:00:46.770> hens<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.129> wants<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.000> he<00:00:48.120> starts<00:00:48.450> out

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the hens he wants and so he starts out

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.529 
the hens he wants and so he starts out
he<00:00:48.899> will<00:00:49.500> find<00:00:49.680> him<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> hand<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:51.059> he'll

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
he will find him a hand and then he'll

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.819 
he will find him a hand and then he'll
do<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:52.050> dance<00:00:52.230> around<00:00:52.559> her<00:00:52.680> stuff

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829

then the next day she lays eggs and then

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.370 
then the next day she lays eggs and then
she<00:01:20.670> sets<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.780> she<00:01:21.930> has<00:01:22.080> little
