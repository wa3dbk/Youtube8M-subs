00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
building the raid array is building you

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:08.120 
building the raid array is building you

see<00:07:13.440> now<00:07:13.620> it's<00:07:13.860> at<00:07:14.010> 21%

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.200 
see now it's at 21%

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.050 
see now it's at 21%
I'll<00:07:16.200> just<00:07:16.350> up<00:07:16.530> arrow<00:07:16.950> reissue<00:07:17.550> the<00:07:17.760> command

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
I'll just up arrow reissue the command

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.770 
I'll just up arrow reissue the command
you<00:07:18.210> can<00:07:18.330> see<00:07:18.570> it's<00:07:18.870> building<00:07:19.290> okay<00:07:20.190> so<00:07:20.780> if

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
you can see it's building okay so if

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.290 
you can see it's building okay so if

time booting on first boot it's probably

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.210 
time booting on first boot it's probably
because<00:07:29.790> the<00:07:30.270> raid<00:07:30.510> 1<00:07:30.810> mirror<00:07:31.260> it<00:07:31.410> takes<00:07:32.100> a
