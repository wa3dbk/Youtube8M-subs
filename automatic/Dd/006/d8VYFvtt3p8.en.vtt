00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.760
 so how did you discover the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.880
 photograph by chance I was not 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.630
 specially attracted more than that by the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 photography when I was younger 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.199
 but one for my 18 years actually have 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.760
 offered a compact device as in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.350
 work for everyone to make 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 holiday photos to photos 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.699
 memories but very quickly I took a taste 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.010
 to do my own stories to do 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.130
 small stagings and wanting 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.750
 go beyond the memory and so I 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.309
 between 10 ghoulam and it really came 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.899
 by chance in my life if I had 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.160
 offered a violin I enter a blue du 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.230
 purple could you explain to us 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.450
 your profession your passions in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.780
 a few words so the photograph 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.920
 I alternate with my studies of philosophy 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.300
 so that's not at all what I 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610
 full-time practice even if there is 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.480
 some me or I do that and 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.280
 others where the keys over at all 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.280
 it's really an alternating book 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 I took a few hands recently to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.290
 a bit of the photo is an experience 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.340
 rewarding but that made me surrender 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.409
 account I did not want to do 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.659
 that it brought me more to do 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.720
 something else next and so concretely 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.149
 right now the fault to the French the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.190
 half of my life I'm doing projects 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.200
 professionals or staff but have 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.119
 all the facts of things who who 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.149
 I'm interested it's quite varied it's not going 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.360
 of order for musicians 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.820
 for individuals of the fair marriage 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.500
 of the sale of prints the illustration 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.500
 good a little bit of everything 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.789
 what is your feeling about the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.200
 photograph as a whole the skin 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.179
 of finance have together it starts to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.539
 have a sacred sacred history 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.310
 diversity I 'm especially going to 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.399
 feeling in general it's a medium 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990
 in which I returned his two 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.280
 sensibilities that speak to me but it's 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.850
 extremely varied as we go from 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.420
 photo journalism war the photo 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.450
 is not created going through do not know 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.979
 not surreal staging ago 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.420
 really everything and I'm sensitive 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.709
 absolutely any approach of 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.049
 moments that it is justified and that she 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.570
 is pretty much under control and over the world 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.880
 the photo is really difficult 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.010
 but as everyone needs a little 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.549
 fight to survive 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.549
 but as everywhere 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.209
 how much does this turn take you 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.609
 to finalize a photo project and in this 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.840
 which concerns a single picture so for 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:36.050
 a photo project it usually depends on 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.180
 two months 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.860
 it depends on the complexity of the project in 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.450
 did I did a series that I managed 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.860
 to do in three days but was there that 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.070
 five photos she was passively 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.290
 feasible and I did the series that 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.700
 asked me several months two to six 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.800
 month there right now I'm doing in a 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.300
 time-consuming series 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.560
 because I know I'll be at this 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.630
 moment with animals and it has me 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.790
 necessarily it is necessary to be the authorizations 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.780
 on the sierra disassembling them either 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.190
 it's a name much more 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.140
 of organization they have to make a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.940
 photo it's going to take a lot of time to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.720
 preparation and in all that can be me 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:13.280
 take a year and for a photo it's 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.870
 much faster in general after 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.460
 everything really depends on the complexity of 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.320
 the picture here is a very heavy editing 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.580
 inevitably it takes me more time to 6 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.650
 and a photo that the game I like in 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.840
 the immediate because the moment is pretty 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.940
 it's inevitably going to be faster but 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.020
 say on average a quarter of an hour a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.880
 half hour of session and we retouch 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.140
 photo trap but it can please 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.850
 much longer if it's a montage 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.780
 can quickly reach 2.3 to see 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.130
 6 am I will not say what is your 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.890
 Artistic current 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.110
 can you tell us more then in 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.660
 I'm not sure he has 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.920
 another name is finally the picture is 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.450
 still interesting as an art he 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.310
 there are plenty of people who hate plenty of 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.610
 things and that do not necessarily have yet 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.590
 I category names I either 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.209
 the multiple names for that to be the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.300
 already plastician photography in the sense 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.140
 where is not the day na'vi cebada photo 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.020
 animal 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.880
 it's the fault of the creative coder and 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.350
 after that it is often said that my photos are 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.970
 udc good and this is not a common 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.080
 but you'll summarize pretty well 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.840
 can say that in the verve of 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.160
 surrealism because it's not going to really 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.320
 staged at the idea it's not 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.600
 happy to transcribe the real that the 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.490
 commits 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.370
 and received is rather to show what 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.900
 that we have in our head in this is the 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.100
 vein of surrealism now she's me 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.870
 seems that there is this photographic genre 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.370
 that he would have massed widespread deserved 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.570
 to have another name of your own 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.630
 it's not surrealism skin using 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.930
 from which medium to broadcast your works and 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.080
 under what conditions the two 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.460
 main supports create an internet 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.250
 so the virtual support and that's 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.780
 mostly where the pictures your 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.370
 fight because that's still 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.550
 more pictures on the canvas than printed 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.610
 concretely so on my website on 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.780
 facebook on all networks like that 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.900
 and after that it falls from his chair in the air 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.680
 but clean and if not I print them for 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.480
 exhibitions 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.770
 which is still France has 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.110
 frequently but it's still not 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.670
 neither is it less - 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.080
 dedication say that on the internet his 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.480
 mower - necessarily because it is necessary 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.310
 physically move so enough means 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:26.560
 in which condition that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.820
 the pope says no to the envy when jean 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.260
 victor an exhibition with I have 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:35.350
 the opportunity I adele and on the internet 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.120
 it's easy I go from a photo 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.170
 turn or not 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.150
 what is the easiest way to 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.430
 spread your wings which is the one who has 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.040
 the most returns meets to allow 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.300
 like and more precisely so we do 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.770
 facebook it works great arguments 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.240
 because the titleholder and the 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.720
 photo it was in fashion so it's not 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.830
 badly but why why is this 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.090
 walk but must simply because 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.500
 that on the internet everyone has access 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.960
 while exposure you have to move there 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.370
 you have to go there you have to be at 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.570
 current as the exposure to gold on 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.220
 internet it can fall on us except 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.140
 that we have chosen that it happens 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.370
 necessarily and if people decide to 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.020
 sharing they can do it then in 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.730
 real life to face an exposure not 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.290
 take the picture where he shared around 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:19.330
 of self it does not work what do you think 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.080
 of the future of photography with the 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.080
 internet development 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.560
 I think that has already changed a lot 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.180
 many things 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.350
 I, I, it's hard enough for me 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.520
 me to situate myself like that because I have 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.330
 never known to the photo without 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.720
 know internet 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.490
 so for me it was a collection 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.169
 logical to develop my photography 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.370
 in internet development now that 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.979
 aware that for those who were not 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.600
 not on the internet originally and who 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.030
 was a photographer for a long time that has 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.750
 had to change a lot of things 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.880
 concretely I do not really know what 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.200
 it can change finally I think it's 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.810
 a way to get noticed that it's 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.640
 a way to create a follow-up on his 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.500
 work that people see there can 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.720
 to be informed easily is a way 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.810
 broadcast 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.070
 I think it's going to make it easier 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.940
 hard work that's why he 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.320
 there are many more fees the andes 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.250
 worry that works in agency is 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.060
 a lot easier to get 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.050
 notice all alone on the internet then 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.340
 calmly the agencies they were doing 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.240
 any communication work that 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.190
 someone you can not come all 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.360
 only 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.110
 and so is the internet able to bring 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.340
 to the dissemination of photography 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.520
 begin to multiply broadcasts 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.990
 that's fine if the small label 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.240
 internet i think i will never be 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.960
 made known during this so simple that 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.340
 it 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.840
 I posted my photos at the beginning it was 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.310
 really just to have returns 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.020
 because I did not have too much that he is 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.280
 shown and internet there are plenty of people 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.979
 like those of at least one person 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.660
 who will be interested and but I would have 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.370
 never reached in the cinematheque 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.960
 internet I would never have gone to see any 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.830

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.960
