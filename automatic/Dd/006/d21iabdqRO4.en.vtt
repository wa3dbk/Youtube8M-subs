00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.730 
building a structure for the home page
we'll<00:00:16.109> make<00:00:16.680> an<00:00:16.830> info<00:00:17.130> below<00:00:17.449> it<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.740> quite

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
we'll make an info below it is quite

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.109 
we'll make an info below it is quite
sturdy<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.730> simple<00:00:21.060> design<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.680> lids

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
sturdy it's a simple design and the lids

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.349 
sturdy it's a simple design and the lids
can<00:00:24.119> either<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.570> down<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:27.000> soon<00:00:27.060> as

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
can either be down or up and as soon as

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.769 
can either be down or up and as soon as
you<00:00:28.189> just<00:00:29.189> touch<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.150> little<00:00:30.420> bit<00:00:30.570> from

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you just touch them a little bit from

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.220 
you just touch them a little bit from
the<00:00:31.199> front<00:00:31.470> they<00:00:32.309> click<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:34.020> means

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the front they click up so that means

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.569 
the front they click up so that means
that<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> trailer<00:00:35.070> back<00:00:35.280> there's

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that if you have a trailer back there's

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.619 
that if you have a trailer back there's
good<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.500> container<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.530> top<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
good a container on top of it

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.639 
good a container on top of it
then<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:39.870> truck<00:00:41.180> just<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.440> we<00:00:43.440> end

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
then you have your truck just a we end

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
then you have your truck just a we end
of<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.980> truck<00:00:46.579> then<00:00:47.579> when<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> pull<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
of a truck then when you pull it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.040 
of a truck then when you pull it
forwards<00:00:48.840> okay<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:50.129> next<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.899> an

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
forwards okay the next go up so it's an

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.600 
forwards okay the next go up so it's an
extremely<00:00:52.440> simple<00:00:52.559> making<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.489> can

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
extremely simple making this but you can

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.630 
extremely simple making this but you can
see<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.789> again<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> legs<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.480> down<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.949> shark

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
see it again the legs are down the shark

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.520 
see it again the legs are down the shark
comes<00:00:56.850> in<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:01.250> pull<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> goes<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.809> easily

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
comes in and pull and it goes up easily

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
comes in and pull and it goes up easily
and<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.119> means<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.540> drive

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and that's it that means you can drive

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.920 
and that's it that means you can drive
around<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> manually

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
around with it and you have to manually

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.820 
around with it and you have to manually
take<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> off<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:12.409> in<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
take it off like this so in all of the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.109 
take it off like this so in all of the
videos<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> present<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
videos I'm going to present the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.370 
videos I'm going to present the
mechanism<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.810> makes<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.229> trench<00:01:16.500> work<00:01:16.740> yes

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
mechanism that makes the trench work yes

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
mechanism that makes the trench work yes
for<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> first<00:01:19.650> training<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.909> small

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
for the first training a really small

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.080 
for the first training a really small
mock-up<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.430> what's<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.939> on

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
mock-up so you can see what's going on

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.039 
mock-up so you can see what's going on
this<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.360> leg<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.810> down<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.630> just

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this is the leg going down and it's just

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.410 
this is the leg going down and it's just
a<00:01:31.820> spring<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.600> rather<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.320> air<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:36.240> likes

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
a spring or rather it's air and it likes

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.350 
a spring or rather it's air and it likes
elastic<00:01:37.079> bands<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.979> from<00:01:38.600> this<00:01:41.119> thing<00:01:42.119> up

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
elastic bands going from this thing up

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.380 
elastic bands going from this thing up
here<00:01:42.630> down<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> I've<00:01:44.189> been<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
here down to I've been down there and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.380 
here down to I've been down there and
this<00:01:48.390> fence<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.829> pull<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> leg<00:01:51.060> down

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this fence is going to pull the leg down

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.560 
this fence is going to pull the leg down
when<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.380> position<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
when it's in this position up here and

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.399 
when it's in this position up here and
it's<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.869> pull<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.380> leg<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.729> it's

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
it's going to pull the leg up when it's

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.340 
it's going to pull the leg up when it's
turning<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> other<00:01:58.619> way<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.079> really

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
turning the other way so it's really

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.389 
turning the other way so it's really
just<00:02:02.810> making<00:02:03.810> sure<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.259> when<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.950> not<00:02:05.250> in

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
just making sure that when it's not in

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.940 
just making sure that when it's not in
the<00:02:05.549> neutral<00:02:05.909> position<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.479> here

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the neutral position right here

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
the neutral position right here
then<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.129> under<00:02:08.520> force<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.910> way<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
then it's under force this way on the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.440 
then it's under force this way on the
other<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.220> it's<00:02:11.220> extremely<00:02:12.060> simple<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
other and it's extremely simple to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.650 
other and it's extremely simple to
pelvis

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
pelvis

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.730 
pelvis
and<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.050> works<00:02:14.320> really<00:02:14.680> well<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:16.470> that's<00:02:17.470> it's

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and it works really well so that's it's

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.140 
and it works really well so that's it's
for<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:19.090> first<00:02:19.300> container<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:20.970> simple

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
for the first container is simple

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.300 
for the first container is simple
it's<00:02:22.450> fun<00:02:22.660> playing<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.380> best<00:02:24.010> building

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
it's fun playing it and best building

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.400 
it's fun playing it and best building
structure<00:02:24.730> for<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.300> its<00:02:25.480> users<00:02:25.780> grabbing

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
structure for it and its users grabbing

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.080 
structure for it and its users grabbing
a<00:02:26.440> few<00:02:27.060> number<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> past<00:02:28.390> like<00:02:28.660> 300<00:02:29.470> or<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
a few number of past like 300 or so and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.280 
a few number of past like 300 or so and
that's<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:32.110> flowing<00:02:32.530> from<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.800> first<00:02:33.040> pass
