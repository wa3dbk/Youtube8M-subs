00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.690
 hello today i will tell about one 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.509
 very useful feature in some 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.470
 cases that are on lg g2 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.619
 Going to the settings and going to the tab 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.439
 display 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.519
 This function is located at the very bottom of the map. 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.660
 image format and for what 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.860
 it serves let's see for example y 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.510
 I have this application like you 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.040
 see it is not adapted for 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.129
 full hd resolution 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.960
 not here the text is almost invisible and he 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 no way coming 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.489
 that is, I can't read it if we 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.110
 move the format adjustment 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 images put a tick here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.730
 turn off the language run again 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 application we see that she became 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 much closer and we read the same texts 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.070
 it works in games like an example 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.110
 go around galaxy on fire 2 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.140
 This game is not adapted for full hd 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 and so text is the talk of everyone 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.210
 characters remain dreams even here myself 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.640
 logo as you see it is very small 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.740
 Now there will be a screen saver for me 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.560
 able to focus the camera so that's how 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.259
 you see very small buttons here 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.290
 klikin how to click it on them but you can 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.840
 this agree is inconvenient but for us there is 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.080
 format correction function 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.979
 images find galaxy on fire 2 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.729
 put a tick here and run again 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.729
 galaxy on fire 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.880
 as you see already and pleases become larger 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.430
 and the game itself adapting to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.860
 resolution 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.340
 as you can see already the buttons are much closer and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 all this that is allows you to play with 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.980
 there is such a big comfort 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.410
 functions i don't know if on others 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.260
 Novak devices what we have here 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.840
 I was very pleased because I 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.410
 just love the game galaxy on fire 2 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.920
 and very sad that it is not adapted 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.650
 serve under the display can ooze 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.790
 we adapt but for 10 inches I have only 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.959
 5 general, thank you all for seeing my 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.959
 review use new features yet
