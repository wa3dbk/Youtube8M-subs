00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.460
 hello to everyone so today we get 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.830
 found for the back to school 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.650
 so in fact it's a series for this 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.770
 back in 2014 and I will talk to you 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.539
 from my experience with the internate so 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.059
 it's a bit when my testimony can 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.950
 Stop harder it is true that when 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.480
 all do you know anyone with his 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.430
 terraces that can be really it's 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.850
 really scary that's why I 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.610
 decided to help you with the hectare so we 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.289
 will start with three years ago so 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.079
 me if I made my comeback in a 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.730
 new high school and a jam to ea means 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.379
 it was very difficult because we are 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.230
 I was afraid of my adaptation 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.370
 the family was not with me he had 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.789
 many constraints 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.140
 facing that so these high schools were far 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.010
 from home so I did not have too much 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.089
 choice for swimming to reassure 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.979
 nobody knows anyone 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.070
 so we all come to the internat and we 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.600
 is a little lost because for the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.659
 others also that it is we are missing in 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.770
 usually back in the pool 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.960
 incarna in home 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.080
 he gives appointment a few days 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.050
 before so before going back to high school 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.420
 So it is to sleep one night 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.130
 take his bearings to the internat and 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.560
 when you arrive in your man with 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.090
 girls you do not know I 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.450
 think these movies have all said go 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.820
 you 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.469
 come see you since that's how I 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.890
 say nobody knows anyone so that 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.979
 reassures to see that challenges in the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.619
 room and lo and behold 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.390
 knowledge and so it was already seeing 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.149
 six points me personally the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.920
 logistics is pretty shy about her so 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.569
 I was a little afraid of not succeeding 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.509
 make me friends but eventually that 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.880
 was really all alone that's it 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.549
 do it right from the start already borrows 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.469
 but then we see it already 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.679
 maybe not the friends we're going to have 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.330
 afterwards but already 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.069
 knowledge so it's really not 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.000
 wrong 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.630
 so there are advantages and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.069
 disadvantages for the internate so after 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.079
 that was my personal opinion it's 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.269
 my and testimonials so everyone is 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.010
 different but here I want to do you 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.579
 hang a testimony for you have you 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.260
 also if you worry about extender already 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.360
 here are the disadvantages is that in 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.160
 having family and that's really 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.410
 very difficult when we are close to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.000
 this one the analysts are pretty 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.280
 happy to get away but it's true 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.160
 that when we are close to the family and 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.680
 that we have always been used to being in 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.600
 present with them it may turn out 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.540
 difficult so it's true that at the beginning 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.160
 adaptation is quite difficult does it 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.590
 not to have had my sister next to me 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.799
 my parents my grandparents 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.360
 it was quite difficult and yet he 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.860
 We have to 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.110
 adapt so that's why the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.330
 friends within iron at that you will see 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.490
 throughout these years of internat 6 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.090
 it's been two hours to go there 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.520
 that friends are much closer 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.280
 that friends we see every day 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.170
 left without being interned actually in 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.550
 creating a kind of link but really 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.360
 very close since we are constantly 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.490
 with them in their room talk to them 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.959
 life by making life happily with 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.209
 time you may have now because 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.690
 that living permanently with 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.350
 a person we will when we know it 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.020
 all too well and there may be tension 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.270
 certain certain tension is enough 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.160
 weighing in the end I know that afterwards 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.420
 three years 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.880
 it was starting to be difficult the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.380
 third year after here are the two 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.870
 first data are the poems I 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.850
 even think the first one especially so 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.650
 that's what I advise you for that 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.840
 to avoid all these tensions the fact 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.400
 to be constantly with the hands versa 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.560
 it's doing activities outside 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.520
 of one it's really escaped you 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.250
 find a way out 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.200
 having your head constantly in 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.290
 my friend is in the same boarding school and 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.480
 it can be pretty 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.430
 binding but especially escape 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.620
 also to activities as you wish and 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.280
 organize it's very unlikely for 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.380
 the internals 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.150
 they often had activities on 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.549
 Wednesday afternoon so especially at 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.340
 comfortable here I can advise you it's going 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.890
 you release that you will feel 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.360
 less imprisoned in with this internship 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.490
 with high school etc 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.530
 so here I went to think that I 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.600
 can you bring after b after that 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.130
 it has to depend on the people it 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.560
 will need some adaptation time maybe 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.740
 more or less slow but you will see 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.450
 it's something you know it's 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.970
 an experience that must be done because 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.970
 that is all that is not does not 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.730
 the internet is not at table but I 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.250
 think if you do not have you do not 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.410
 the choice if these voices against your full 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.320
 Frankly go for it anyway because 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.810
 when you see that we made 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.640
 friendships that are not the same 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.030
 than those we make with friends 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.250
 we see every day every day 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.680
 without being his little sleepy with them 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.110
 without being brushing your teeth as soon as 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.800
 think it's different so it's 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.020
 something to do 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.430
 so I think of veyrassi that I come 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.910
 from below what an internet brings 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.290
 many things including maturity 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.780
 it makes me gain a lot of maturity 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.350
 because you have to manage things 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.970
 you 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.690
 like going home you have to do 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.980
 suitcases an internet flour of 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.980
 realism had to manage your time for 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.140
 you joy to go concede 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.850
 parents will touch all this is actually 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.000
 you gain a lot of responsibilities 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.910
 it changes me a lot and a good so 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.740
 it's really a very good thing 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.110
 maturity responsibility independence 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.970
 you are going to see how good it is moving everything 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.110
 change to good you'll see that can not 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.880
 I ask you will not tell you but 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.630
 really had to change you became more 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.700
 mature etc 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.560
 but that's also the facts of 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.740
 Internat is a good thing 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.370
 so I hope I have answered your 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.100
 questionings 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.750
 if you have questions about a 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.410
