00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
I just thought this would be a really

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
I just thought this would be a really
great<00:00:36.270> layering<00:00:36.660> piece<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> fall<00:00:38.100> time

great layering piece for the fall time

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.660 
great layering piece for the fall time
and<00:00:38.960> or<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.020> wearing<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.100> an<00:00:41.250> open<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and or just wearing it as an open it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.350 
and or just wearing it as an open it
with<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> black<00:00:42.420> bra<00:00:42.719> underneath<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.360> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
with like a black bra underneath and it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.299 
with like a black bra underneath and it
actually<00:00:45.570> provides<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.890> amount<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
actually provides a good amount of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.790 
actually provides a good amount of
warmth<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.180> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> good<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.379> it's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
warmth so which is good because it's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.229
