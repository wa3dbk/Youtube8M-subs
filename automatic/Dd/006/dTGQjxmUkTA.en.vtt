00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:14.350
 Strangely, I have gangrene 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.789
 So my motor is wrong and me 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.789
 so I have practically everyone 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.369
 step into dizziness 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.589
 when I should go to the pattern to the bunch 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.029
 is so upside down and could own one 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.029
 walk normally 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:38.360
 it conveys stability of the mediated 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.070
 balance it conveys security in the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.620
 situation and agility where 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.040
 we want you to have my husband yes 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.050
 Know what he has to do for me 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.930
 relieve and I have to know what I am 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.530
 have to do to help him and who the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.780
 cooperation because that is very important 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.930
 I used to have a weird problem 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.989
 had me then I find myself begging 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.949
 turn around and thus much less 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.170
 problems 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.909
 I have found a possibility now 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.380
 like me with the transfer in one 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.380
 Wheelchair can simplify 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.259
 progress for me 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.960
 even the one who maybe now 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 all handicaps united yes that still has 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.450
 resources that you are old 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.800
 to feel alternative to your own body 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.510
 that a movement suddenly 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.430
 becomes easy to self-runner 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.350
 if you organize it a little differently 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.350
 the direction looks and all that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.290
 then successes really do that together 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.940
 impressive it is also in motivation 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.009
 not just like that 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.450
 but always somehow accept 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.090
 to stay on the ball 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.460
 you do not learn something god thank you 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.420
 it happens and then you have to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.420
 function
