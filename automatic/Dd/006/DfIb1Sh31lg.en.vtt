 accompanying in this video and the truth 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.829
 I'm very happy because I had 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:15.190
 very much desire to make this video in 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:17.420
 particular because if it's a raffle and 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.540
 before opening this channel I already had 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.910
 I thought about doing this draw since I went to 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.760

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.580

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.040

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.900
 of the brushes I was going to give them and 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.140
 well, taking advantage of the fact that I opened the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.180
 channel that I followed with the videos and apart 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.700
