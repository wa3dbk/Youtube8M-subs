00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.559
 this we are going to teach today how is the 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:13.190
 procedure to put in time the 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:16.369
 cherry arauca engine 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.699
 this bait car stopped to avoid the 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.520
 compression stage because the party the 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.099
 Time belt and bent valves 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.890
 well the procedure is as follows 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.259
 to put it in time we look for 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 we put all the pistons that they want 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.960
 aligned to the middle of the cylinder 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.870
 there we can place them so that the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.660
 car this time from this engine before 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.650
 to put the compression cap on 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650
 we mark 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.969
 Crankshaft flywheel can observe the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 Crankshaft flywheel has a mark 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.600
 white dial at three in the afternoon 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.760
 there goes the crankshaft wedge that is that 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.379
 is the center of the crankshaft always has 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.149
 to be looking towards three of the 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.270
 late you already know that the disc is 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.060
 halfway through its way 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 upward 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 then let's look at the arts of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.390
 down the engine has on this side here 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.770
 as you can observe has a 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.969
 plug 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.820
 this stopper on rocks 17 mm 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:30.840
 I have here this screw the threads 17 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.340
 millimeters placed it where 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 the plug goes 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.979
 what is the purpose of this screw 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.929
 this screw locks the crankshaft for 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.119
 that does not move then with that 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.490
 we avoid from crankshaft to move us 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.280
 when we are going to show the strap of the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.709
 time he leaves it and cold and the crankshaft 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.870
 there is not going to move there we begin to 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:57.080
 assemble all this part of the engine 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.110
 we already have the afternoon compression installed 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.360
 we have assembled the cams are already 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.980
 installed the two cams 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.350
 we did we put the strap of the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.450
 time but we let the flyers are 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.780
 loose is loose until we put in 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 position the cams the cams in the part 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.300
 exact back have some marks are 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.170
 some grooves then if you 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.170
 can observe 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.670
 they have a slot that we're going to do with 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.480
 those slots we're going to place the new ones 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.750
 in position 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.270
 to 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.160
 it is clear that of the time I light with a 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.160
 key and placed a platen 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.450
 placed a protein here 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.860
 and then with the same key I position 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.860
 this other way 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.099
 lack 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.720
 there are the double bases are in 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.100
 position there they are not going to move and then 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.740
 run it 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.830
 squeezing 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.300
 and the steering wheel bolts already in 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.880
 that position is clear are times 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.110
 you should always notice that the tongue 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.620
 It has some brands 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.270
 and here are this brand should be in 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.760
 the whole massera center has a 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.940
 arrow that indicates here and is the same has 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.890
 an arrow that indicates in this position 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.890
 from there is the time of the car 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.310
 we did the work of the belt of 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.090
 time we're going to start the motor that's going 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.400
 very often 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 there you have a motor on 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.810
 completely even 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.250
 and working perfectly fine from this 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.799
 work game that needs to be done to 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.150
 put the strap on the time he wants 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.150
 now thank you very much
