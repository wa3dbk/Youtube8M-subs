00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 the works of section 2 of the metro 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.649
 they are advanced in more than 80 by 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.649
 percent let's see how it goes 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.100
 and the last eight beams that form 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.050
 part of the more than two thousand that have 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.480
 placed all along the way 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.660
 of section 2 of train line 1 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.240
 electrical beams that are part of 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.950
 the presbyter teacher station and that unites 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.250
 turn the lime fence with the 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.950
 Augustine measure 30 meters and weigh 50 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.079
 tons with these works the second 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.410
 subway route of Lima a total of 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.300
 12.4 kilometers is in an 81 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.130
 percent list we have the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.379
 divides the work into civil works and 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.170
 electromechanical works civil works 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.329
 is what you see are works that we have 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.640
 more or less they are an advance of 95 by 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.530
 hundred and the electromechanical works that 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.320
 are the works that allow the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.379
 operation of those of the meters are 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.510
 works that are more or less 45 by 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.609
 hundred percent advance to this is also added 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.860
 the progress in the placement of those who 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.940
 undoubtedly they are the biggest bridges in 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.800
 the capital 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.810
 the rhyme bridge that has been built 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.880
 over the talkative river will be ready in 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.740
 two weeks and will be inaugurated by the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.050
 own minister of transport and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.650
 communications while the bridge 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.800
 about via 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.260
 and it will be ready in October we have the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.140
 rhyme bridge that is a bridge of 240 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.050
 meters and we have the huÃ¡scar bridge that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.420
 is what we see there that is a bridge of 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.670
 274 meters also this area is an area 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.470
 that will be covered by the river where 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.500
 we are already leaving everything prepared for 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.060
 to leave as we found it already 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.910
 defenses are being prepared 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.800
 riparian areas in the river areas las 10 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.440
 stations are also almost 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.200
 lists the advance is 73 percent 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.390
 as is the case of the last station 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.800
 ballobar located in the avenues heroes 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 of cenepa with heroes of the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.900
 independence in san juan de lurigancho 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.830
 this is the area where where when the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.680
 trains 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.190
 At the end of the day they finish their service 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.610
 they park in this area 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.910
 wait for the service the next day or 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.950
 in some case to be able to pass from a 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.260
 lane to another at the end of the season 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.270
 We also knew the maneuver yard 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.400
 where trains wait for their next 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.340
 exit and maintenance is performed 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.390
 minor all this will be put to the test in 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.390
 April of next year 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.550
 in April of next year they have 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.510
 advance even the dates for the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.330
 delivery of section 2 of line 1 of the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.290
 Metro de Lima which is a fantastic work 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:48.080
 then comes line 2 that goes from this to 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.080
 west we will wait in install
