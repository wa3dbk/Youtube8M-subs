00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.620 

it's<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.320> better<00:02:03.530> look<00:02:03.740> at<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:05.509> this

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
it's a better look at it here and this

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.179 
it's a better look at it here and this
has<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:05.869> been<00:02:05.899> about<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.740> year<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.070> half

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
has have been about a year and a half

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.020 
has have been about a year and a half
into<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.989> it<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.259> holding<00:02:09.560> up<00:02:09.890> fairly<00:02:10.880> well

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
into it and it is holding up fairly well

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
into it and it is holding up fairly well
there<00:02:11.360> are<00:02:11.540> some<00:02:11.630> spots<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.080> need<00:02:12.140> touched

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
there are some spots that need touched

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.740 
there are some spots that need touched
up<00:02:12.739> if<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.790> look<00:02:13.970> right<00:02:14.120> here<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.599> see

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
up if you look right here you can see

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.530 
up if you look right here you can see
through<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.849> it's<00:02:16.849> just<00:02:17.090> right<00:02:17.270> up<00:02:17.420> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
through that it's just right up and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.330 
through that it's just right up and
shrank<00:02:17.810> over<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.380> past<00:02:18.590> year<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.950> half<00:02:18.980> so

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
shrank over the past year and a half so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.270 
shrank over the past year and a half so
I<00:02:19.370> will<00:02:19.730> need<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:19.970> hit<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.269> again<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:21.280> you

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
I will need to hit that again but you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.920 
I will need to hit that again but you
can<00:02:22.430> see<00:02:22.670> behind<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.239> some<00:02:23.390> people<00:02:23.480> had<00:02:23.690> asked

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
can see behind it some people had asked

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.540 
can see behind it some people had asked
about<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.290> method<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.010> can't<00:02:25.250> really<00:02:25.370> see

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
about the method you can't really see

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.360 
about the method you can't really see
too<00:02:25.700> well<00:02:25.730> there<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.150> here<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:27.370> it's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
too well there but here you can it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.780 
too well there but here you can it's
like<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:29.110> hardware<00:02:30.110> cloth<00:02:30.349> we<00:02:30.650> put<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:30.950> behind

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
like a hardware cloth we put in behind

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.390 
like a hardware cloth we put in behind
it<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.239> kind<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.480> hold<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:34.099> can<00:02:34.220> see

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
it to kind of hold it and you can see

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.470 
it to kind of hold it and you can see
kind<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> mixture<00:02:35.090> here

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
kind of the mixture here

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.509 
kind of the mixture here
it's<00:02:36.019> basically<00:02:36.850> straw<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.180> clay<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.019> mud

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
it's basically straw and clay and mud

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.650 
it's basically straw and clay and mud
that<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.610> mixed<00:02:40.819> up<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.330> packed<00:02:41.630> in<00:02:41.870> there<00:02:43.660> but

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that we mixed up and packed in there but

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.500 
that we mixed up and packed in there but
it<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.110> pretty<00:02:45.350> good<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:47.299> worked

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
it is a pretty good it's it's worked

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.630 
it is a pretty good it's it's worked
really<00:02:47.600> well<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.019> held<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.290> really<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:49.430> for

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
really well it's held up really well for

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.479 
really well it's held up really well for
free<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:49.910> would<00:02:50.090> maybe<00:02:51.080> if<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.590> intend<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.100> ever

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
free I would maybe if I intend to ever

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.100 
free I would maybe if I intend to ever
do<00:02:52.760> anything<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.239> this<00:02:53.390> cabin<00:02:53.780> more<00:02:53.959> than

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
do anything with this cabin more than

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.720 
do anything with this cabin more than
just<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:55.190> know<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.310> fun<00:02:55.549> exercise<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:57.730> would

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
just you know a fun exercise I would

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.890 
just you know a fun exercise I would
like<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.940> build<00:02:59.090> another<00:02:59.330> one<00:02:59.510> maybe<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.810> little

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
like to build another one maybe a little

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.470 
like to build another one maybe a little
bit<00:03:00.110> larger<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.650> little<00:03:00.860> bit<00:03:00.950> more

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
bit larger and a little bit more

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.990 
bit larger and a little bit more
well-built<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:04.040> think<00:03:04.280> Portland<00:03:04.549> cement

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
well-built but I think Portland cement

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.870 
well-built but I think Portland cement
might<00:03:05.180> be<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.660> better<00:03:06.080> way<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.350> go<00:03:06.880> with

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
might be a better way to go with

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.130 
might be a better way to go with
something<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:08.209> this<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:08.930> was<00:03:09.109> just

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
something like this but this was just

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.110 
something like this but this was just
something<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.680> do<00:03:10.220> real<00:03:10.400> quick<00:03:10.579> for<00:03:10.730> fun<00:03:10.970> it's

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
something to do real quick for fun it's

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.390 
something to do real quick for fun it's
just<00:03:11.329> kind<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.709> real<00:03:12.890> quick<00:03:13.070> part<00:03:13.280> it's

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
just kind of the real quick part it's

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.060 
just kind of the real quick part it's
definitely<00:03:13.760> gone<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.560> people<00:03:15.829> that<00:03:15.950> were

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
definitely gone the people that were

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.599 
definitely gone the people that were
concerned<00:03:16.640> with<00:03:16.730> they're<00:03:17.359> not<00:03:17.390> being<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.810> door

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
better very good angle but there will be

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.009 
better very good angle but there will be
a<00:03:24.709> door<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.250> here<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.120> see<00:03:26.239> these
