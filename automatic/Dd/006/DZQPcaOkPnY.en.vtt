00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:09.519
 and I think this is the tip of everything 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.809
 the case bankia and you have to remember that 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.810
 the amounts that have been given to these 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.510
 cards is the 0.01 of the total money 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.220
 public that has cost this country the 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.900
 bank rescue to be remembered 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.539
 that is not only from the boxes but that 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.360
 it has also benefited the great 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.210
 banks and I think you have to overcome the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.190
 debate and to overcome the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.619
 housepainter debate and we must begin 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.480
 to analyze in depth what it means 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.370
 what has happened in bankia and what has 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.979
 past in bankia means that it has 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.229
 legalized in this country corruption and 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:43.449
 that the political leaders have done 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:46.269
 laws in the service of thieves 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.789
 financial institutions that are supporting 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.710
 the citizenship cuts in salaries 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.420
 the cuts in public rights the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.559
 rights the cuts in rights 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.379
 fundamental 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.909
 the absolutely scandalous cost of 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.559
 rescue of all entities 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.260
 that has not only been the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.670
 boxes Pablo married said that what he has 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.650
 broken and what has come down are 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.300
 savings banks and he knows that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.220
 is in the popular party and because he knows 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.840
 of money that's a lie 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.610
 the Spanish financial system was in 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.530
 bankruptcy and remains bankrupt and the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.360
 political decisions what they do is 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.520
 drop the weakest part of the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.960
 system that was also the only part 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 that guaranteed as you said well 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.740
 a minimum conception of public banking 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.900
 that could have allowed us to keep the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.030
 financing families to SMEs 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.800
 and something very important of what is not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.360
 speaks and is all the dismantling of 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.210
 the social work of caja madrid that has 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.000
 closed in madrid libraries schools 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.280
 of adult nursery schools therefore 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.900
 the problem of the economic situation does not 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.460
 is the problem of the boxes 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.650
 economic situation is a problem of the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.690
 financial situation as a whole what 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 means and you have to say I'm going to be 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.040
 brief and it has to be said that what now 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.990
 we are doing is to drop the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.810
 boxes spend the money of all 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.550
 Spaniards to rescue them and in exchange for 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.229
 that once they are clean they are 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.330
 split between the bbva and the santander 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.619
 so that they continue to make money at the expense of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.420
 of the misery of washing and building that 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.700
 people can not trust a government 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.590
 that after the whole process of 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.300
 maintenance of the public box and of not 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.440
 demand from those of us who are giving money 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.620
 public money that open the tap of the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.310
 allow the current president of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.290
 bankia earn 500 thousand euros which is seven 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.720
 times what the president of the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.970
 government this is no longer a matter of 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.470
 Trust is not a matter of 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.930
 Trust is a matter of separating 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.640
 clearly who is willing to be 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.810
 at the service of the financiers and who 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.810
 will be at the service of the good
