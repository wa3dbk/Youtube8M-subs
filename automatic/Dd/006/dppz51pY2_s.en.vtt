00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
between my character which came into the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.459 
between my character which came into the
show<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.629> had<00:00:39.960> been<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> show<00:00:40.320> for

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
show and I had been on the show for

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
show and I had been on the show for
three<00:00:40.530> episodes<00:00:41.100> without<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.700> being<00:00:41.969> revealed

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
three episodes without it being revealed

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.840 
three episodes without it being revealed
that<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.660> character<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.050> gay<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that the character was gay and so I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
that the character was gay and so I
never<00:00:45.090> played<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.780> any<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.379> way<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:47.430> know

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
never played it any which way you know

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
never played it any which way you know
gay<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:47.850> straight<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.379> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
gay or straight and I think that when it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
gay or straight and I think that when it
turned<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.160> my<00:00:50.250> character<00:00:50.520> was<00:00:50.670> gay<00:00:50.940> for

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
turned out that my character was gay for

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.290 
turned out that my character was gay for
me<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.680> sort<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.940> said<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> Sean

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
me it was sort of like I said to Sean

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.569 
me it was sort of like I said to Sean
that<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> keep<00:00:56.039> playing<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that but I just want to keep playing the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
that but I just want to keep playing the
character<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> same<00:00:57.239> way<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> don't

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
character the same way you know I don't

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.510 
character the same way you know I don't
think<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:58.800> should<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.129> anything

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
think that there should be anything

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
think that there should be anything
about<00:00:59.730> her<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.989> immediately

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
about her that is that would immediately

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
about her that is that would immediately
sort<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.920> say<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.340> you're<00:01:02.520> gay<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:02.760> straight

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
sort of say like you're gay or straight

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
sort of say like you're gay or straight
and<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.409> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and I think that it because I think it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.870 
and I think that it because I think it's
a<00:01:04.589> greater<00:01:04.769> lesson<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> greater

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
a greater lesson I think it's a greater

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
a greater lesson I think it's a greater
um<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> greater<00:01:07.860> story<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> tell

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
um I think it's a greater story to tell

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.590 
um I think it's a greater story to tell
which<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> can't<00:01:09.240> judge<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> book<00:01:09.540> by

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
which is that you can't judge a book by

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
which is that you can't judge a book by
its<00:01:09.840> cover<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> lots<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.520> things<00:01:11.729> come
