00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
halos in the fog lights also both HIDs

halos in the fog lights also both HIDs
that<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.830> installed<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.370> fog<00:02:18.550> lights

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
that I installed in the fog lights

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.310

they're<00:02:19.390> telling<00:02:19.720> me<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:19.990> needs<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> be

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
they're telling me that it needs to be

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.680 
they're telling me that it needs to be
removed<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.950> heat<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:22.060> actually

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
removed because the heat can actually

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.840 
removed because the heat can actually
damage<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.290> halos<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.680> they<00:02:23.920> won't<00:02:24.130> warranty

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
damage the halos and they won't warranty

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.980 
damage the halos and they won't warranty
the<00:02:25.000> halos<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:28.360> gonna<00:02:28.510> figure<00:02:28.690> out<00:02:28.870> what

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
the halos so I'm gonna figure out what
