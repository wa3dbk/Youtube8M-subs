 2007 2013 the program is divided into 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.240
 two lines of intervention aimed at 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.000
 promote city regeneration

 line 7.2 centers through interventions 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.030
 of contrast to degradation and abandonment 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.799

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.110
 Effective urban regeneration provides for the

 social participation so that 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.830
 inhabitants play an active role 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.720
 contributing to the drafting of the projects

 and taking care of the spaces 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.310
 requalified the integration of 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.070

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.810
 recovery of areas for me at least to date 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.030
 there are 470 projects admitted to 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:11.150

 many public spaces and squares streets 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.590
 parks and water front markets were 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.380
 returned to the inhabitants as places of 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.250
 relationship and socialization are 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.500
 important not only to improve 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.630
 the quality of life of those who live there but 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.570
 also to attract new populations and 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.670
