00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.400
 the right to exercise control and do not have 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.550
 i don't know know any time from right 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.360
 which is more or less with the internet in general 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.610
 laws if 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.510
 reads as it should understand that 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.000
 police law 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.700
 one of the criteria of your activity 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.650
 is public opinion this is one of 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.330
 criteria yes and here it is directly about 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.249
 opinion forms a person 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.909
 woman yes yes yes but 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.709
 qualitative we precisely on remark 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.229
 sure on citizens you should always 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:31.009
 character vadim what where in what 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.399
 direction going to leave but while I 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.239
 here 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:38.489
 voronezh are moving back the gift you need it 

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:39.559
 Our luxury was not strings to me 

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:41.569
 roll away 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.939
 general social movements 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:48.449
 directly to this movement 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:51.439
 decided to show how it works yes no really 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.610
 shows we are not shown how we work 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:56.489
 consider how a policeman works 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.549
 because when Sasha is often not yours 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:01.319
 the work is very difficult but it's complicated 

00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:03.389
 the dream is that they are not always respected 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.989
 administrative regulations 180 and order 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:10.649
 and I judge hard and deviate from it 

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:13.069
 almost 99 percent here we are 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:19.109
 The percentages here are these percentages and just 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:21.749
 our this public opinion you can 

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:24.989
 put something like I am not well done and 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:26.699
 only here I can say well done god forbid 

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:27.089
 so it was so we went Vadim 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.979
 canola 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:36.419
 but I can find out who spoke sedale 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:38.899
 sidorenko rf submit clearly but all 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.549
 good luck and good service too 

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:45.529
 public opinion about us unequivocally 

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:45.529
 good yes by 5 points to 5
