okay now we're going to do cheeks you
change<00:00:05.500> your<00:00:05.710> program<00:00:05.920> the<00:00:06.400> little<00:00:06.640> program

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.269 
change your program the little program

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.840 
change your program the little program
button<00:00:07.630> push<00:00:07.899> it<00:00:08.050> until<00:00:08.200> you<00:00:08.980> see<00:00:09.280> the<00:00:09.640> face

again<00:00:14.740> dip<00:00:15.339> into<00:00:15.549> your<00:00:15.700> conductive<00:00:16.270> fluid<00:00:16.360> I

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
again dip into your conductive fluid I

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.150 
again dip into your conductive fluid I
like<00:00:16.780> to<00:00:16.900> tap<00:00:17.080> a<00:00:17.110> little<00:00:17.500> bit<00:00:17.620> makes<00:00:17.860> a<00:00:17.950> beep

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
like to tap a little bit makes a beep

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.320 
like to tap a little bit makes a beep
and<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:20.289> start<00:00:20.680> on<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:20.859> face<00:00:21.130> by<00:00:21.460> shortening

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
and I start on the face by shortening

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.450 
and I start on the face by shortening
this<00:00:22.570> muscle<00:00:22.990> from<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.230> inside<00:00:24.039> of<00:00:24.189> the<00:00:24.279> nose

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
this muscle from the inside of the nose

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.720 
this muscle from the inside of the nose
to<00:00:24.789> right<00:00:25.000> under<00:00:25.359> the<00:00:25.480> eye<00:00:25.510> and<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:27.160> again<00:00:27.460> is

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
to right under the eye and this again is

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.269 
to right under the eye and this again is
ten<00:00:28.000> seconds<00:00:28.420> but<00:00:29.259> remember<00:00:29.769> if<00:00:29.890> you<00:00:30.039> want<00:00:30.220> to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
ten seconds but remember if you want to

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.560 
ten seconds but remember if you want to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
it will be very ten seconds but if you

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.100 
it will be very ten seconds but if you
don't<00:00:37.059> want<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.360> beep<00:00:37.510> you<00:00:37.540> can<00:00:37.809> turn<00:00:37.930> that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
don't want the beep you can turn that

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.889 
don't want the beep you can turn that
beep<00:00:38.320> off

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.600 

okay<00:00:46.649> dip<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.870> conductive<00:00:48.870> fluid<00:00:49.610> now

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
okay dip into more conductive fluid now

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.280 
okay dip into more conductive fluid now
I'm<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> build<00:00:51.180> my<00:00:51.449> cheeks<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.140> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.710 

okay<00:01:31.050> that's<00:01:31.289> ten<00:01:31.470> seconds<00:01:32.330> more<00:01:33.330> conductive

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
okay that's ten seconds more conductive

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469 
okay that's ten seconds more conductive
fluid<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> move<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.429> a<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.729> bit<00:01:36.060> about

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
fluid now I move down a little bit about

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.139 
fluid now I move down a little bit about
an<00:01:36.720> inch<00:01:37.560> lower<00:01:37.890> than<00:01:38.159> where<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.460> were<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
an inch lower than where we were and the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.300 
an inch lower than where we were and the
same<00:01:39.420> thing<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.899> lift<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.440> can<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:40.950> how

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
same thing I lift here can you see how

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.440 
same thing I lift here can you see how
I'm<00:01:41.399> lifting<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.179> muscle<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I'm lifting that muscle and the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
I'm lifting that muscle and the
microcurrent<00:01:46.289> is<00:01:46.860> stimulating<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.610> muscle

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
microcurrent is stimulating that muscle

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.520 
microcurrent is stimulating that muscle
to<00:01:48.270> actually<00:01:48.840> lift<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:50.810> again<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.289> spend

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
to actually lift it again you can spend

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.809 
to actually lift it again you can spend
as<00:01:52.590> much<00:01:52.709> time<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.099> want<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.489> we<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.789> a

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
as much time as you want but we have a

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:00.290 
as much time as you want but we have a
program<00:01:54.239> for<00:01:54.450> ten<00:01:54.630> seconds<00:01:57.619> okay<00:01:59.119> now<00:02:00.119> again

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
program for ten seconds okay now again

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.419 
program for ten seconds okay now again
the<00:02:00.869> third<00:02:01.110> spot<00:02:01.440> is<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.979> little<00:02:02.250> lower

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
the third spot is just a little lower

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.979 
the third spot is just a little lower
about<00:02:02.729> another<00:02:03.030> inch<00:02:03.239> from<00:02:03.450> where<00:02:03.599> we<00:02:03.750> were

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
about another inch from where we were

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.050 
about another inch from where we were
can<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:04.890> see<00:02:05.039> we're<00:02:05.220> going<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.610> around<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
can you see we're going all around that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.020 
can you see we're going all around that
muscle<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:08.959> ten<00:02:09.959> seconds<00:02:10.410> here<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:11.430> longer

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
muscle there ten seconds here or longer

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.070 
muscle there ten seconds here or longer
whatever<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.569> want
