00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
jamming here at the stand basically he's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.620

card<00:01:48.840> into<00:01:49.139> one<00:01:49.289> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> channels<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.859> the

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
card into one of the channels of the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.830 
card into one of the channels of the
mixer<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.609> meaning<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:50.999> can<00:01:51.149> send<00:01:51.419> stuff<00:01:51.659> he's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
mixer so meaning we can send stuff he's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.499 
mixer so meaning we can send stuff he's
doing<00:01:52.020> into<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.349> rmx<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.069> I<00:01:53.099> can<00:01:53.849> scratch<00:01:54.119> over

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
doing into the rmx or I can scratch over

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.419 
doing into the rmx or I can scratch over
his<00:01:54.779> beats<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.259> he's<00:01:55.380> making<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:56.189> kind<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
his beats that he's making we kind of

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.519 
his beats that he's making we kind of
take<00:01:56.609> it<00:01:56.819> in<00:01:57.029> interns<00:01:57.539> like<00:01:57.810> who<00:01:57.929> initiates<00:01:58.409> it

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:58.529 
take it in interns like who initiates it

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:00.529 
take it in interns like who initiates it
so<00:01:58.709> maybe<00:01:58.829> I'll<00:01:59.099> start<00:01:59.700> beat<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.209> get<00:02:00.359> some

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
so maybe I'll start beat and get some

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.719 
so maybe I'll start beat and get some
kind<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.749> groove<00:02:00.959> up<00:02:01.169> on<00:02:01.289> Ableton<00:02:01.709> Live<00:02:01.859> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
kind of groove up on Ableton Live and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.279 
kind of groove up on Ableton Live and
then<00:02:02.880> he'll<00:02:03.029> start<00:02:03.299> bending<00:02:03.989> start

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
then he'll start bending start

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.469 
then he'll start bending start
scratching<00:02:04.529> along<00:02:04.919> to<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.119> finding

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
scratching along to it kind of finding

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.120 
scratching along to it kind of finding
the<00:02:06.539> tempo<00:02:06.959> or<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.439> might<00:02:07.709> work<00:02:07.859> the<00:02:07.979> other<00:02:08.039> way

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
the tempo or I might work the other way

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.040

what our program allows you to do is cut
holes<00:03:57.640> in<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.209> can<00:03:58.480> see<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.780> relevant

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
holes in it so you can see the relevant

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.590 
holes in it so you can see the relevant

the way that the dry/wet controls so

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.880 
the way that the dry/wet controls so
that's<00:05:24.250> as<00:05:24.430> class<00:05:24.700> extends<00:05:25.240> right<00:05:25.900> it's<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.710> dry

that's as class extends right it's a dry
wet<00:05:27.070> mix<00:05:27.340> there's<00:05:27.789> also<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.090> hybrid<00:05:28.510> mode<00:05:28.690> which

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
wet mix there's also a hybrid mode which

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.860 
wet mix there's also a hybrid mode which
combines<00:05:29.289> it<00:05:29.470> too<00:05:29.729> so<00:05:30.729> if<00:05:31.240> you're<00:05:31.419> in<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.660> dub
