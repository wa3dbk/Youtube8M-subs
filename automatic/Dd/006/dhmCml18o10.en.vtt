effectively<00:00:49.250> we've<00:00:49.430> got<00:00:49.580> eight<00:00:49.730> channels<00:00:50.210> in

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
effectively we've got eight channels in

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.299 
effectively we've got eight channels in
a<00:00:50.480> 2u<00:00:50.809> chassis<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.980> you've<00:00:52.129> got<00:00:52.370> eight<00:00:53.269> XLR<00:00:54.019> or

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
a 2u chassis so you've got eight XLR or

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.890 
a 2u chassis so you've got eight XLR or
TRS<00:00:55.309> jack<00:00:55.550> inputs<00:00:56.000> on<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.210> back<00:00:56.300> which<00:00:56.629> can<00:00:56.809> be

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
TRS jack inputs on the back which can be

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.290 
TRS jack inputs on the back which can be
either<00:00:57.050> Mike<00:00:57.379> line<00:00:57.710> or<00:00:58.010> mic<00:00:58.610> level<00:00:58.970> or<00:00:59.090> line

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.140 
either Mike line or mic level or line
level<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.800> going<00:01:01.400> here<00:01:01.580> you've<00:01:01.760> got<00:01:01.790> basically

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
level so going here you've got basically

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.439 
level so going here you've got basically
the<00:01:02.809> input<00:01:03.199> gain<00:01:03.470> which<00:01:03.979> is<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.250> step<00:01:04.790> 25<00:01:05.210> DB

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
the input gain which is a step 25 DB

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.280 
the input gain which is a step 25 DB
steps<00:01:06.190> coming<00:01:07.190> down<00:01:07.520> we<00:01:07.970> have<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.150> minus<00:01:08.450> 30<00:01:08.840> DB

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
steps coming down we have a minus 30 DB

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.830 
steps coming down we have a minus 30 DB
pad<00:01:09.560> which<00:01:10.220> can<00:01:10.460> also<00:01:10.610> be<00:01:10.790> mic<00:01:11.150> level<00:01:11.510> or<00:01:11.630> line

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
pad which can also be mic level or line

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.039 
pad which can also be mic level or line
level<00:01:12.130> we<00:01:13.130> have<00:01:13.159> phantom<00:01:13.790> power<00:01:14.000> we<00:01:14.810> have<00:01:15.020> a

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
level we have phantom power we have a

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.289 
level we have phantom power we have a
phase<00:01:15.380> reverse<00:01:15.860> where<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.850> high<00:01:17.060> pass

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
phase reverse where you have a high pass

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.020 
phase reverse where you have a high pass
filter<00:01:17.780> which<00:01:18.229> cuts<00:01:18.530> off<00:01:18.710> about<00:01:18.979> 120<00:01:19.820> Hertz

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
filter which cuts off about 120 Hertz

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.780 
filter which cuts off about 120 Hertz
you<00:01:20.420> we<00:01:21.140> have<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.290> mute<00:01:21.560> switch<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
you we have a mute switch then the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.609 
you we have a mute switch then the
output<00:01:22.820> level<00:01:23.540> which<00:01:23.930> controls<00:01:24.440> that

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
output level which controls that

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.890 
output level which controls that
individual<00:01:25.159> channel<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:26.150> channel<00:01:26.750> has

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
individual channel and that channel has

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.960 
individual channel and that channel has
then<00:01:27.110> an<00:01:27.229> XLR<00:01:27.650> output<00:01:28.070> as<00:01:28.190> well<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:28.940> can

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
then an XLR output as well so you can

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.330 
then an XLR output as well so you can
effectively<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.930> out<00:01:30.020> quite<00:01:30.590> simple<00:01:31.010> all

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
effectively in and out quite simple all

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.969 
effectively in and out quite simple all
late<00:01:31.609> channels<00:01:32.030> are<00:01:32.149> all<00:01:32.270> exactly<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.810> same

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
late channels are all exactly the same

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.620 
late channels are all exactly the same
then<00:01:33.979> on<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.280> end<00:01:34.430> we<00:01:34.789> have<00:01:35.000> basically<00:01:35.329> a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
then on the end we have basically a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.560 
then on the end we have basically a
monitoring<00:01:36.200> section<00:01:36.520> which<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:37.549> mono<00:01:37.939> so

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
monitoring section which is mono so

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.170 
monitoring section which is mono so
again<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:38.869> have<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.049> monitoring<00:01:39.560> level<00:01:39.950> there

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
again we have a monitoring level there

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.749 
again we have a monitoring level there
we<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.359> a<00:01:41.390> monitor<00:01:42.219> basically<00:01:43.219> selector

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
we have a monitor basically selector

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.490 
we have a monitor basically selector
switch<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:44.570> select<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.049> channel<00:01:45.259> you

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
switch so you select the channel you

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.459 
switch so you select the channel you
want<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.740> monitor<00:01:46.100> 128<00:01:47.090> pick<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.259> then

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
want to monitor 128 pick that and then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.840 
want to monitor 128 pick that and then
you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.740> listen<00:01:48.920> through<00:01:49.070> headphones<00:01:49.460> we

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
you can listen through headphones we

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.980 
you can listen through headphones we
also<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.509> an<00:01:51.439> 8-channel<00:01:52.009> task<00:01:52.340> myd88<00:01:53.240> d-sub

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
also have an 8-channel task myd88 d-sub

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.660 
also have an 8-channel task myd88 d-sub
on<00:01:54.109> the<00:01:54.200> back<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:54.859> can<00:01:55.009> send<00:01:55.280> all<00:01:55.490> eight

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
on the back so you can send all eight

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.550 
on the back so you can send all eight
channels<00:01:56.119> for<00:01:56.270> monitoring<00:01:56.659> purposes<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:57.530> a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
channels for monitoring purposes to a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.980 
channels for monitoring purposes to a
console<00:01:58.249> or<00:01:58.880> some<00:01:59.299> kind<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.539> monitoring

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
console or some kind of monitoring

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.349 
console or some kind of monitoring
device<00:02:01.659> altering<00:02:02.659> metering<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.829> here

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
device altering metering is here

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.029 
device altering metering is here

basically green yellow and red showing
the<00:02:07.130> DB<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:07.789> we<00:02:07.909> go<00:02:08.090> from<00:02:08.119> about<00:02:08.990> minus<00:02:09.470> 42

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
the DB so we go from about minus 42

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.580 
the DB so we go from about minus 42
what's<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:10.670> about<00:02:10.819> plus<00:02:11.090> 16<00:02:11.590> you've

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
what's that about plus 16 you've

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.040 
what's that about plus 16 you've
typically<00:02:13.069> got<00:02:13.250> about<00:02:13.400> 24<00:02:13.910> DB<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.450> headroom<00:02:14.810> on

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
typically got about 24 DB of headroom on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.740 
typically got about 24 DB of headroom on
the<00:02:15.410> mic<00:02:15.590> pre's<00:02:15.890> we're<00:02:16.880> also<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.480> have

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the mic pre's we're also going to have

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.710 
the mic pre's we're also going to have
eight<00:02:18.350> channels<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.010> di<00:02:19.190> on<00:02:19.610> there<00:02:20.210> as<00:02:20.390> well<00:02:20.569> we

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
eight channels of di on there as well we

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.420 
eight channels of di on there as well we
