in<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.740> different<00:02:42.040> missiles<00:02:43.710> well<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:44.770> was

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
in the different missiles well I was

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.840 
in the different missiles well I was
kind<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.100> hoping<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.370> could<00:02:45.430> pull<00:02:45.700> these

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850

missiles<00:02:46.180> off<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.540> stick<00:02:46.720> them<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:46.930> him<00:02:47.170> but

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
missiles off and stick them on him but

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.490 
missiles off and stick them on him but
like<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:48.010> colors<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.490> don't<00:02:48.790> match<00:02:49.000> at<00:02:49.240> all

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
like the colors just don't match at all

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.230 
like the colors just don't match at all
as<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:50.710> see<00:02:50.860> it's<00:02:51.010> black<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> lot

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
as you can see it's black and it's a lot

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.180 
as you can see it's black and it's a lot
darker<00:02:52.360> but<00:02:53.290> these<00:02:53.410> look<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.650> lot<00:02:53.800> better<00:02:53.980> in

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190
