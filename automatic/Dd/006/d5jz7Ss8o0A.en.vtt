 with the aim of promoting 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 family cohabitation among their 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.100
 members and their pets this end of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.850
 week the perroton 2013 was performed in the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.850
 arch park 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.330
 one of the winners was Alberto who 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.169

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.620
 allowed to be ordered and win the 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.870
 3 km race 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.050
 It was not much because I've been 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.720
 training like on weekends 10 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.690
 kilometers and then 32 cases 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.850
 Well I think that's why 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.370
 where they train and give you education and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.080
 level and you fernanda together with your dog 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.210
 brum or won the first place in the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.210
 female modality in 3 km 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.440
 well in fact the whole week goes to 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.379
 run 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.309
 because sometimes it comes to run like a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.470
 hour 30 minutes you already stop 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.259
 They were able to enjoy other activities 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.390
 that encouraged coexistence and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.520
 respect for animals for all one 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.009
 coexistence to enjoy with the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.090
 family and the special member we are 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.830

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.539
