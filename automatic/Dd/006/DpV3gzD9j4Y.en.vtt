8900 be this one the newer ones compared

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.770 
8900 be this one the newer ones compared
to<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> last<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.529> unboxed<00:00:32.540> now<00:00:33.540> as

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
to the last one that we unboxed now as

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.260 
to the last one that we unboxed now as
it<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.170> only<00:00:34.350> case<00:00:34.559> again<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.340> also<00:00:35.730> 200

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it has only case again this is also 200

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.220 
it has only case again this is also 200
meters<00:00:36.690> water-resistant<00:00:37.790> here's<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> case

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
meters water-resistant here's the case

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.060 
meters water-resistant here's the case
side<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.620> there's<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> warranty<00:00:43.070> then

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
side the case there's the warranty then

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.990 
side the case there's the warranty then
there's<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> instruction<00:00:45.180> manual<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.910> then

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
there's the instruction manual and then

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900 
there's the instruction manual and then
there's<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.570> watch<00:00:48.840> itself<00:00:49.850> now<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
there's this the watch itself now the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
there's this the watch itself now the
watch<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> solar<00:00:51.660> powered<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.469> why

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
watch is solar powered so that's why

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
watch is solar powered so that's why
there's<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.969> shows<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> solar

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
there's this here this shows the solar

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.459 
there's this here this shows the solar
powered<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> moon<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.879> tide<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:58.260> date

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
powered do is the moon the tide the date

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.369 
powered do is the moon the tide the date
of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> week<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.820> date<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> month<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
month and the time now for the light

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.539 
month and the time now for the light
there's<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> auto<00:01:04.799> light<00:01:05.040> feature<00:01:05.250> which

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
there's the auto light feature which

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
there's the auto light feature which
means<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> face<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.080> watchwords

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
means that when you face the watchwords

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 
means that when you face the watchwords
you<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.010> lights<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.369> automatically<00:01:09.060> plus

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you it lights up automatically plus

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
you it lights up automatically plus
there's<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.770> could<00:01:10.950> change<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.430> three

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
there's you could change it for three

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
there's you could change it for three
seconds<00:01:12.030> lighting<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.479> or<00:01:12.689> five<00:01:12.960> seconds<00:01:13.409> now

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
seconds lighting up or five seconds now

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.520 
seconds lighting up or five seconds now
let's<00:01:14.760> look<00:01:14.880> throw<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.540> modes<00:01:15.750> there's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
let's look throw out the modes there's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.120 
let's look throw out the modes there's
the<00:01:16.680> tide<00:01:17.570> there's<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.810> moon<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> can

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the tide there's the moon so you can

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
the tide there's the moon so you can
just<00:01:20.280> change<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.780> for<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> signing<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
just change it for the signing of the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.149 
just change it for the signing of the
moon<00:01:22.500> tide<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.369> 48<00:01:24.060> different<00:01:24.299> countries

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
moon tide there's 48 different countries

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
moon tide there's 48 different countries
so<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> time<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> 48<00:01:27.479> different

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so you get the time of 48 different

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
so you get the time of 48 different
countries<00:01:28.700> then<00:01:29.700> there's<00:01:29.909> an<00:01:30.090> alarm<00:01:31.369> there's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
countries then there's an alarm there's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.999 
countries then there's an alarm there's
another<00:01:32.610> alarm<00:01:33.049> there's<00:01:34.049> four<00:01:34.350> arms<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.740> total

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
another alarm there's four arms in total

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.480 
another alarm there's four arms in total
with<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> snooze<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:37.829> signal<00:01:38.220> per<00:01:38.400> hour

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
with the snooze and a signal per hour

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
with the snooze and a signal per hour
which<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.909> could<00:01:39.060> change<00:01:39.299> 2<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> 15

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
which you could change 2 out of 15

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.950 
which you could change 2 out of 15
minutes<00:01:40.619> 45<00:01:41.070> minutes<00:01:41.130> 30<00:01:41.670> minutes<00:01:42.030> then

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
minutes 45 minutes 30 minutes then

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.060 
minutes 45 minutes 30 minutes then
there's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> stopwatch<00:01:43.880> there's<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> timer<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
there's a stopwatch there's a timer and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.719 
there's a stopwatch there's a timer and
then<00:01:47.070> there's<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.240> Atlantic<00:01:48.810> sign<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
then there's the Atlantic sign with the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
then there's the Atlantic sign with the
time<00:01:50.970> showing<00:01:51.810> again<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
time showing again so this is back to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.770 
time showing again so this is back to
the<00:01:52.860> regular<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.399> does<00:01:53.970> different<00:01:54.509> times

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the regular one and does different times

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.899 
the regular one and does different times
so<00:01:55.380> let's<00:01:55.530> say<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
so let's say you're back to the this is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
so let's say you're back to the this is
the<00:01:56.969> regular<00:01:57.299> mode<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> regular<00:01:58.560> mode<00:01:58.740> has

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the regular mode so the regular mode has

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.069 
the regular mode so the regular mode has
like<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.640> different<00:02:00.270> beep<00:02:00.450> than<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> other

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
like a different beep than the other

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.459 
like a different beep than the other
ones

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
ones

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.429 
ones
you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.979> also<00:02:02.070> mute<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.640> watch<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.439> then

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
