that<00:01:41.850> good<00:01:41.880> there's<00:01:42.450> no<00:01:42.600> real<00:01:42.840> instructions

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that good there's no real instructions

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.100 
that good there's no real instructions
with<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.979> oh<00:01:44.189> wait<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
with it oh wait there are I know you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.600 
with it oh wait there are I know you
guys<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.320> probably<00:01:46.350> thinking<00:01:46.710> why<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> need

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
guys are probably thinking why you need

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
guys are probably thinking why you need
instructions<00:01:48.180> i'm<00:01:48.360> sure<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> can't<00:01:48.960> go

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
instructions i'm sure this can't go

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.380 
instructions i'm sure this can't go
wrong<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.040> never<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.399> yes<00:01:51.180> i<00:01:51.360> think

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
wrong but you never know yes i think

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.910 
wrong but you never know yes i think
it's<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> mascara<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.649> use<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it's just a mascara and you just use it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.319 
it's just a mascara and you just use it
as<00:01:53.009> mascara<00:01:53.430> i'm<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.759> sure<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> need<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
as mascara i'm not sure if you need to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
as mascara i'm not sure if you need to
curl<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.540> lashes<00:01:54.689> first<00:01:55.140> i<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:56.189> curlers

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
curl your lashes first i have curlers

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.160 
curl your lashes first i have curlers
just<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.850> case<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.390> don't<00:01:57.630> ever<00:01:57.840> call<00:01:58.020> my

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
just in case but i don't ever call my

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.359 
just in case but i don't ever call my
lashes<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.560> i'm<00:01:58.619> probably<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
lashes so i'm probably not going to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.219 
lashes so i'm probably not going to
because<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.210> give<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.600> skewed

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because in that would give a skewed

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.380 
because in that would give a skewed
result<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.310> little<00:02:02.520> sneak<00:02:02.759> peek<00:02:02.969> before<00:02:03.000> i

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
result so little sneak peek before i

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
result so little sneak peek before i
start<00:02:03.869> applying<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.380> mascara<00:02:04.439> I've<00:02:04.950> actually

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
picked two different ones one high end

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.040 
picked two different ones one high end
which<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.670> benefit<00:02:09.030> roller<00:02:09.179> lash<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.720> one

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
which is the benefit roller lash and one

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.370 
which is the benefit roller lash and one
cheaper<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:10.979> which<00:02:11.160> I've<00:02:11.340> compared

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
cheaper one which I've compared

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.130 
cheaper one which I've compared

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
this video and we can do that nowadays

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.500 
this video and we can do that nowadays
so<00:02:28.880> it's<00:02:29.180> likely<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.600> my<00:02:29.660> video<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.200> 3<00:02:30.740> 2<00:02:31.280> 1<00:02:31.940> so

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
so it's likely on my video in 3 2 1 so

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.070 
so it's likely on my video in 3 2 1 so
I've<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:33.050> zoomed<00:02:33.410> into<00:02:33.650> my<00:02:33.890> eye<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:35.080> thought

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
I've just zoomed into my eye and thought

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.690 
I've just zoomed into my eye and thought
it'd<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.290> easier<00:02:36.410> if<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.740> guys<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
it'd be easier if you guys to see the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.310 
it'd be easier if you guys to see the
brush<00:02:38.000> too<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:38.600> I'll<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:38.720> put<00:02:38.960> in<00:02:39.050> its<00:02:39.200> my

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.790 
brush too so I'll just put in its my
face<00:02:39.560> for<00:02:39.800> contrast<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:41.200> curved<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:42.470> most

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800

I'm going to put on the Maybelline lash

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.080 
I'm going to put on the Maybelline lash
sensational<00:03:24.040> lash<00:03:25.040> multiplying<00:03:25.580> scorer<00:03:25.970> just

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
sensational lash multiplying scorer just

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.210 
sensational lash multiplying scorer just
to<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.600> how<00:03:26.720> they<00:03:26.840> compare<00:03:26.960> but<00:03:27.710> I've<00:03:27.860> kind<00:03:28.130> of

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
to see how they compare but I've kind of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.740 
to see how they compare but I've kind of
knew<00:03:28.400> they<00:03:28.640> both<00:03:28.670> came<00:03:28.970> out<00:03:29.120> at<00:03:29.210> the<00:03:29.240> same<00:03:29.480> time

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
knew they both came out at the same time

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.520 
knew they both came out at the same time
and<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.860> think<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.600> be<00:03:32.600> honest<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.020> brushes<00:03:33.380> are

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
and I think to be honest the brushes are

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.900 
and I think to be honest the brushes are
actually<00:03:33.800> quite<00:03:33.920> similar<00:03:34.010> as<00:03:34.430> well<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:34.760> this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
actually quite similar as well so this

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.120 
actually quite similar as well so this
has<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> curved<00:03:35.390> wand<00:03:35.630> brush<00:03:36.530> wand<00:03:36.800> whatever

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
has a curved wand brush wand whatever

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.060 
has a curved wand brush wand whatever
and<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.850> does<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.660> they<00:03:39.110> are<00:03:39.290> quite<00:03:39.620> similar

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.530 

so<00:03:43.070> again<00:03:43.280> shin<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.700> same<00:03:43.850> thing<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.270> think<00:03:44.450> I'm

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
so again shin the same thing I think I'm

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.430 
so again shin the same thing I think I'm
going<00:03:44.690> with<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:44.959> side<00:03:45.260> first<00:03:45.560> just<00:03:46.370> for<00:03:47.440> ease

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
going with this side first just for ease

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.510 
going with this side first just for ease
or<00:03:49.070> who<00:03:49.760> knows<00:03:49.820> why<00:03:53.440> well<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.530> they<00:03:54.890> do<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.190> kind

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
or who knows why well I they do it kind

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.520 
or who knows why well I they do it kind
of<00:03:55.640> similar<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.630> was<00:03:56.930> like<00:03:57.140> eight

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
of similar and this was like eight

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.240 
of similar and this was like eight
pounds<00:03:58.330> but<00:03:59.330> let's<00:03:59.510> continue<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:03.440> these<00:04:04.100> are

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
pounds but let's continue and these are

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.180 
pounds but let's continue and these are
the<00:04:04.310> results<00:04:04.820> over<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.740> little<00:04:06.740> game<00:04:06.980> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
the results over the little game I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.850 
the results over the little game I
played<00:04:07.430> earlier<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.780> was<00:04:09.350> actually<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
played earlier on so I was actually the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.860 
played earlier on so I was actually the
cheaper<00:04:10.190> Maybelline<00:04:10.580> mascara<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.240> B<00:04:11.510> was<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
cheaper Maybelline mascara and B was the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.690 
cheaper Maybelline mascara and B was the
benefit<00:04:12.230> roller<00:04:12.380> lash<00:04:12.530> I<00:04:12.980> think<00:04:13.520> they<00:04:13.580> look

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
benefit roller lash I think they look

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.090 
benefit roller lash I think they look
pretty<00:04:13.730> similar<00:04:14.120> almost<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.050> same<00:04:15.230> if

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
pretty similar almost the same if

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.310 
pretty similar almost the same if
anything<00:04:16.580> I<00:04:16.760> think<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:17.180> prefer<00:04:17.330> that<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.109> lash

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
anything I think I prefer that the lash

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.780 
anything I think I prefer that the lash
sensational<00:04:18.470> gives<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.100> bit<00:04:19.220> more<00:04:19.340> volume<00:04:19.489> as

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
sensational gives a bit more volume as

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.960 
sensational gives a bit more volume as
well<00:04:19.820> my<00:04:20.540> verdict<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.080> this<00:04:21.290> is

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
well my verdict of this is

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.000 
well my verdict of this is
torn<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.810> think<00:04:24.050> it's<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.530> really<00:04:24.740> nice

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
torn so I think it's a really nice

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.850 
torn so I think it's a really nice
mascara<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:25.990> applied<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.200> my<00:04:27.290> lashes<00:04:27.500> it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
mascara and applied to my lashes it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.380 
mascara and applied to my lashes it
looks<00:04:28.190> really<00:04:28.430> nice<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:29.000> gives<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.270> nice

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
looks really nice and it gives a nice

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.320 
looks really nice and it gives a nice
curl<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.230> gives<00:04:30.440> length<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:32.120> just

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
curl and it gives length and it just

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330 
curl and it gives length and it just
makes<00:04:32.480> me<00:04:32.600> look<00:04:32.780> nice<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.350> naturally<00:04:34.130> nice

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
makes me look nice and naturally nice

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.020 
makes me look nice and naturally nice
like<00:04:34.730> separated<00:04:35.540> curled<00:04:35.950> but<00:04:37.000> when<00:04:38.000> I

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
like separated curled but when I

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.700 
like separated curled but when I
compared<00:04:38.480> it<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.720> matar<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.320> different

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
compared it to a matar a different

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.650 
compared it to a matar a different
mascara<00:04:40.010> which<00:04:40.310> claims<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:41.030> say<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.450> same

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
mascara which claims to say the same

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.240 
mascara which claims to say the same
things<00:04:41.990> for<00:04:42.440> half<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.920> price<00:04:43.180> that's<00:04:44.180> when<00:04:45.250> my

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
things for half the price that's when my

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.310 
things for half the price that's when my
mind<00:04:46.460> was<00:04:46.850> confused<00:04:47.330> because<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:48.230> other

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
mind was confused because the other

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.900 
mind was confused because the other
mascara<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:48.950> tried<00:04:49.220> which<00:04:49.430> was<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.730> maybe

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
mascara that I tried which was the maybe

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.090 
mascara that I tried which was the maybe
lash<00:04:50.300> sensational<00:04:50.450> gave<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.500> same<00:04:51.740> effect

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
lash sensational gave this same effect

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.410 
lash sensational gave this same effect
and<00:04:52.340> for<00:04:53.530> half<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.770> price<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:55.250> would<00:04:55.490> say<00:04:55.700> so<00:04:55.940> if

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
and for half the price I would say so if

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.660 
and for half the price I would say so if
you<00:04:56.720> want<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.930> budget<00:04:57.350> then<00:04:58.070> I<00:04:58.340> would<00:04:58.490> probably

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
you want a budget then I would probably

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.210 
you want a budget then I would probably
get<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.090> mainland<00:04:59.600> one<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.410> if<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:00.920> want<00:05:01.070> to

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
get the mainland one and if you want to

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.530 
get the mainland one and if you want to
splash<00:05:01.430> out<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:01.820> want<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.030> nice<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.360> scar

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.760 
splash out and you want a nice and scar

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.340 
and then go for the benefit roller lash
but<00:05:04.220> I<00:05:04.570> probably<00:05:05.570> won't<00:05:05.780> be<00:05:06.020> buying<00:05:06.170> the
