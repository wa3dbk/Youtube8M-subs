hey PB are 51 here I'm going to be doing

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.530 
hey PB are 51 here I'm going to be doing
around<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.509> my<00:00:06.629> new<00:00:06.810> engine<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.259> just<00:00:07.470> built<00:00:07.649> but

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
around in my new engine I just built but

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.400 
around in my new engine I just built but
before<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.690> i'm<00:00:09.809> going<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.019> show<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.230> it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
before that i'm going to show you how it

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.509 
before that i'm going to show you how it
works<00:00:11.509> but<00:00:12.509> also<00:00:12.690> i'm<00:00:13.530> announcing<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.280> i'm

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
works but also i'm announcing that i'm

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.120 
works but also i'm announcing that i'm
going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.759> do<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.150> new<00:00:15.360> video<00:00:15.660> every<00:00:15.870> week<00:00:16.170> so

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
going to do a new video every week so

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.720 
going to do a new video every week so
that'll<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.699> pretty<00:00:17.850> cool<00:00:18.350> alright<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> i'm

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
that'll be pretty cool alright so i'm

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.460 
that'll be pretty cool alright so i'm
going<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.090> put<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.390> air<00:00:21.510> compressor<00:00:22.020> nozzle

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
going to put the air compressor nozzle

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
going to put the air compressor nozzle
through<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.550> hole<00:00:24.410> this<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:26.000> right<00:00:27.000> there

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
through that hole this one right there

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.850 
through that hole this one right there
and<00:00:28.160> basically<00:00:30.890> they'll<00:00:32.809> go<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and basically they'll go up and then the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100 
and basically they'll go up and then the
air<00:00:35.010> compressor<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.270> air<00:00:36.420> will<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:36.809> flow

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
air compressor the air will go flow

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.209 
air compressor the air will go flow
through<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> chamber<00:00:40.219> force

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
through that and into the chamber force

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.670 
through that and into the chamber force
the<00:00:41.430> piston<00:00:41.790> down<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.200> gets<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the piston down and then one gets to the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.850 
the piston down and then one gets to the
bottom<00:00:43.879> this<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.120> goes<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.870> closes<00:00:46.710> it

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
bottom this one goes down and closes it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.660 
bottom this one goes down and closes it
and<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.430> pushes<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.910> air<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:50.280> also

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and it pushes the air up and it also

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
and it pushes the air up and it also
allows<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.360> extra<00:00:51.750> air<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.410> flow

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
allows the extra air in there to flow

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.189 
allows the extra air in there to flow
out<00:00:52.739> these<00:00:53.070> tubes<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:56.449> then<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.780> force<00:00:58.020> from

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
out these tubes and then the force from

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.819 
out these tubes and then the force from
it<00:00:58.850> just<00:00:59.850> keeps<00:01:00.629> turning<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.140> flywheel<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
it just keeps turning this flywheel and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.009 
it just keeps turning this flywheel and
I<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.160> down<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.600> brings<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.989> back

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I have down there and it brings it back

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.510 
I have down there and it brings it back
up<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:05.820> where<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.390> cycle<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.520> keeps

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
up to where the cycle just keeps

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.200 
up to where the cycle just keeps
repeating<00:01:08.760> itself<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.640> managed<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> get

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
repeating itself so and I managed to get

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.950 
repeating itself so and I managed to get
some<00:01:12.540> pretty<00:01:13.020> good<00:01:13.229> speed<00:01:13.560> off<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.960> really

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
some pretty good speed off at and really

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890 
some pretty good speed off at and really
good<00:01:16.110> torque<00:01:16.820> but<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:18.330> i<00:01:18.360> run<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.689> i<00:01:18.750> have

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
good torque but when i run it i have

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
good torque but when i run it i have
these<00:01:19.110> covers<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.549> else<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:21.030> won't<00:01:21.150> work

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
these covers on or else they won't work

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.200 
these covers on or else they won't work
i<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.900> took<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.530> show<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> i'm

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
i just took one off to show you so i'm

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
i just took one off to show you so i'm
going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> use<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> commodore<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
going to use this to commodore to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to use this to commodore to
measure<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> speed<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> yeah<00:01:29.040> let's<00:01:29.250> go<00:01:29.400> run

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
measure the speed so yeah let's go run

00:01:29.610 --> 00:03:00.010 
measure the speed so yeah let's go run
it

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.009 

okay<00:03:01.020> well<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.470> was<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.800> engine<00:03:02.129> um<00:03:03.019> next

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
okay well that was the engine um next

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.309 
okay well that was the engine um next
week<00:03:04.140> I'll<00:03:04.349> have<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.890> four<00:03:05.099> stroke<00:03:05.459> out<00:03:05.700> or<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
week I'll have the four stroke out or a

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.070 
week I'll have the four stroke out or a
four-stroke<00:03:07.319> update<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.390> i'll<00:03:09.390> also<00:03:09.420> post

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
four-stroke update and i'll also post

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.550 
four-stroke update and i'll also post
another<00:03:10.379> video<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:11.099> I<00:03:11.879> have<00:03:12.720> more<00:03:12.930> upgrades<00:03:13.379> on

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
another video if I have more upgrades on
