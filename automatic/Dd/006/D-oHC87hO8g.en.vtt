00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.420
 today room and those in the final battle and in particular pay attention to the right one 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.399
 scene of the accident after the start in March this year 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.090
 and there always starts with tar too cold because we have two sides to ours 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.869
 Map 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.160
 it is when we speak a church we are always going to leave the path to the 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
 from the point after the mieden increased 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 and then we go the other side of the map more 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.239
 and then we are actually going to do the same 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.490
 the tower some newspapers as the tour will be the ek in very strong and am we going 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.230
 here the city is more expensive and we don't go any smaller than it actually is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.230
 always work in those two pieces 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.420
 after the red card 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 parker separate flat piece to have the requirement 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 what a very important day 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 now I have it lying very nicely in pieces 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.230
 He has been selling with two hands getting wet and two in hand in the fight 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.760
 to have 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.670
 and nobody who actually avoids everything anymore 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 and then pick it up and then it came to could no one sat 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 first piece is sponsor but sept 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.420
 again the same principle we always give way 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 from the outside to the inside 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.440
 and then come to the man himself 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.680
 very important we always have our nude talent here last year 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 the seam is a very nice flat 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.460
 because it is a double piece and that is always very dangerous to call then 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.470
 to know women on the other side and here anp the corner though we usually have 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.900
 also unfolds 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.159
 worries that nicely go with a team of our shirt 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 on the side of our meal 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.229
 and here again beautiful in drenthe 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.329
 the other time just the salad 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.680
 and that there are separate pieces that are more beautiful than one 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.180
 let it depend that there also falls his prey can not see again 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 come 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.010
 and if our men appear and then we can state the body 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:36.519
 from our shirt you are working on a battle patching with those buttons we are going 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.499
 first on the inside 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.189
 stronger than we can totally have you go over it and we should not sit 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.469
 as later 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.469
 the study the emergency is continuing 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.359
 and what is also very important now is to make a false fold in that again 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.700
 we have our entertainment time 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.769
 and then a few members of us always look 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.469
 in such a way that we do not act ourselves if the ironed documents did 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.739
 and the piece with the buttons that I have done there later 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.609
 to be on the other hand, I don't have to do anything anymore 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.009
 and then the guy is up and then we can make the choice of the shirt on 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.919
 to clear the coat rack if we can of course also do the folds as well 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.849
 we are now going to hang it on a coat rack 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.849
 so we're going to attach the buttons 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 I can put the rack and also in between 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:45.079
 and we don't let Breda tie the knots all one by little 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.079
 and so we continue to the bottom 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.359
 and our and this place
