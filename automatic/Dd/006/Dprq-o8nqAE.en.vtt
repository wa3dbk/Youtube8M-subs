00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900 
Callie was about is a fit and well man
so<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.320> put<00:00:40.530> them<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> got<00:00:41.520> into<00:00:41.640> run

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
so we put them on there and got into run

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.810 
so we put them on there and got into run
fast<00:00:42.809> along<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.890> some<00:00:44.100> interval

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
fast along with you some interval

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
fast along with you some interval
protocols<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.600> allowed<00:00:46.140> us<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.350> increase

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
protocols that allowed us to increase

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
protocols that allowed us to increase
his<00:00:47.340> running<00:00:47.730> speed<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.120> maintain<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
his running speed and maintain that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.869 
his running speed and maintain that
running<00:00:48.899> speed<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.590> he<00:00:49.680> ran<00:00:49.829> faster<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
running speed so he ran faster and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
running speed so he ran faster and
maintained<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.600> longer<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:52.410> taking<00:00:52.649> his

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
maintained it for longer by taking his

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
maintained it for longer by taking his
body<00:00:53.100> weight<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.879> about<00:00:54.059> eighty<00:00:54.329> percent

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
body weight down to about eighty percent

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
body weight down to about eighty percent
of<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.260> normally<00:00:55.820> increasing<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
of what it is normally increasing the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
of what it is normally increasing the
running<00:00:57.120> speed<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> maintaining<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
running speed and maintaining that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
running speed and maintaining that
running<00:00:58.379> speed<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> prolonged<00:00:59.399> period<00:00:59.460> of

running speed for a prolonged period of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.709 
running speed for a prolonged period of
time<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:03.239> hell<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> we

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
time and then just for the hell of it we

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.179 
time and then just for the hell of it we
took<00:01:03.870> him<00:01:03.989> load<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.769> twenty

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
took him load down to about twenty

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190 
took him load down to about twenty
percent<00:01:05.479> just<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.689> experience<00:01:07.020> what

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
percent just so we can experience what

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
percent just so we can experience what
it's<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.250> twenty

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's like to have all of your twenty

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.640 
it's like to have all of your twenty
percent<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.299> body<00:01:09.360> weight<00:01:09.689> experience

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
percent of your body weight experience

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
percent of your body weight experience
in<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.460> experimented<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> jumping

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
in there experimented with the jumping

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
in there experimented with the jumping
so<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.710> use<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> tan<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.250> miles<00:01:14.460> an<00:01:14.610> hour<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so we can use a tan or miles an hour and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.780 
so we can use a tan or miles an hour and
jump<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.229> experiment<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.070> mechanics<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
jump and experiment with mechanics to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.230 
jump and experiment with mechanics to
spirit<00:01:18.150> sparing<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.689> landings<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:21.150> to

spirit sparing with landings and just to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870 
spirit sparing with landings and just to
discover<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.500> correct<00:01:23.070> mechanics<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
discover the correct mechanics and the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
discover the correct mechanics and the
correct<00:01:24.210> way<00:01:24.420> correct<00:01:24.930> technique<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:26.009> jump

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
correct way correct technique to jump

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.230 
correct way correct technique to jump
and<00:01:26.549> land<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.200> been<00:01:28.500> ever

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
and land that we have been ever

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.330 
and land that we have been ever
was<00:01:29.900> actually<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.530> think<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:30.799> was<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.920> first

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
was actually I think it was the first

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.639 
was actually I think it was the first
black<00:01:31.670> man<00:01:31.880> on<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.149> moon<00:01:32.380> Thank<00:01:33.380> You<00:01:33.500> Man

it's suddenly felt like really really
heavy<00:02:04.819> so<00:02:05.690> he<00:02:06.289> should<00:02:06.770> be<00:02:07.009> back<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.660> fifty

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
heavy so he should be back to fifty

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.380 
heavy so he should be back to fifty
percent<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.590> my<00:02:09.739> body<00:02:09.920> weight<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:11.239> would

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
percent of my body weight and I would

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.699 
percent of my body weight and I would
like<00:02:11.540> literally<00:02:12.170> feeling<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.650> was

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
like literally feeling that it was

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.940 
like literally feeling that it was
flying<00:02:13.269> with<00:02:14.269> Kirby<00:02:14.720> what<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:14.989> did<00:02:15.170> because

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
flying with Kirby what we did because

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.220 
flying with Kirby what we did because
the<00:02:16.220> moment<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.850> unable<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.330> run<00:02:17.540> has<00:02:18.170> been

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
the moment is unable to run has been

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.289 
the moment is unable to run has been
told<00:02:18.500> he<00:02:18.620> come<00:02:18.799> shouldn't<00:02:19.730> run<00:02:19.850> ever<00:02:20.000> again

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
told he come shouldn't run ever again

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.449 
told he come shouldn't run ever again
what<00:02:21.140> were<00:02:21.230> able<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.560> do<00:02:21.799> with<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> G<00:02:22.190> trainer

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
what were able to do with the G trainer

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.710 
what were able to do with the G trainer
was<00:02:22.610> taking<00:02:22.880> his<00:02:23.000> body<00:02:23.180> weight<00:02:23.330> initially

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
was taking his body weight initially

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.990 
was taking his body weight initially
down<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.140> half<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.250> was<00:02:25.280> he<00:02:25.700> was<00:02:25.790> able

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
down to half of what it was he was able

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.199 
down to half of what it was he was able
to<00:02:26.180> maintain<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.660> run<00:02:26.930> for<00:02:27.440> 5<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.769> 10<00:02:27.799> minutes

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
to maintain a run for 5 to 10 minutes

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.539 
to maintain a run for 5 to 10 minutes
that<00:02:29.209> 50<00:02:29.599> cent<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.870> his<00:02:29.900> body<00:02:30.170> weight<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.560> think

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
that 50 cent of his body weight I think

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.340 
that 50 cent of his body weight I think
you<00:02:31.610> spoke<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.970> him<00:02:32.030> already<00:02:32.120> hopefully<00:02:33.080> told

you spoke to him already hopefully told

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.069 
you spoke to him already hopefully told
you<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.910> experience<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.600> one<00:02:35.750> felt

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
you that that experience is one felt

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.289 
you that that experience is one felt

that program and also hopefully with
kirby<00:02:53.930> introduced<00:02:54.700> normal<00:02:55.700> running<00:02:55.910> back<00:02:56.570> to

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
kirby introduced normal running back to

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.920 
kirby introduced normal running back to
him<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.650> see<00:02:57.980> how<00:02:58.220> far<00:02:58.250> we<00:02:58.549> can<00:02:58.700> go<00:02:59.030> back

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
him and see how far we can go back

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.750 
him and see how far we can go back
towards<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.410> hundred<00:03:00.680> percent<00:03:00.769> kind<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:01.609> some

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
towards a hundred percent kind of some

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.550 
towards a hundred percent kind of some
of<00:03:01.850> his<00:03:01.910> body<00:03:02.150> weight<00:03:02.319> hopefully<00:03:03.319> we<00:03:03.410> can

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
of his body weight hopefully we can

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.059 
of his body weight hopefully we can
achieve<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:04.150> my<00:03:05.150> go<00:03:06.140> on<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.410> gravity

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
achieve that my go on the gravity

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.449 
achieve that my go on the gravity
machine<00:03:07.280> was<00:03:07.910> slightly<00:03:08.299> different<00:03:08.720> Kali's

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
machine was slightly different Kali's

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.699 
machine was slightly different Kali's
because<00:03:10.459> Callie<00:03:11.390> was<00:03:11.660> training<00:03:12.380> more<00:03:12.530> for

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
because Callie was training more for

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.259 
because Callie was training more for
performance<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.670> increase<00:03:13.910> performance

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
performance and to increase performance

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
presets on the machine that we can use

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.830 
presets on the machine that we can use
to<00:03:19.940> increase<00:03:20.450> performance

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840

movement<00:03:32.040> back<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.430> my<00:03:32.700> ankle<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.590> eventually

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
movement back in my ankle so eventually

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.589 
movement back in my ankle so eventually
i'll<00:03:35.220> be<00:03:35.400> able<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.670> start<00:03:35.879> free<00:03:36.090> running<00:03:36.300> full

and<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> different<00:03:46.230> intervals<00:03:46.650> work<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.430> at

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
and the different intervals work in at

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.520 
and the different intervals work in at

and then during the rest periods taking
a<00:03:52.830> bit<00:03:52.980> more<00:03:53.129> body<00:03:53.310> weight<00:03:53.549> off<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.690> still

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840

a bit more body weight off so it's still
is<00:03:55.049> actually<00:03:55.319> resting<00:03:55.739> at<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> target<00:03:56.760> speed
