I usually start in one corner place my

I usually start in one corner place my

bodywork of the car using a reasonable
amount<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.539> force<00:00:24.810> I'll<00:00:25.080> then<00:00:25.230> work<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.500> way

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
amount of force I'll then work my way

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290 
amount of force I'll then work my way
all<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.250> around<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.670> edge<00:00:26.760> until<00:00:27.029> I've

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
all the way around the edge until I've

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.029 
all the way around the edge until I've
completely<00:00:27.720> remove<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> grille<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
completely remove the grille and that

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.230 
completely remove the grille and that
probably<00:00:29.279> looks<00:00:29.369> quite<00:00:29.609> easy<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> video

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
probably looks quite easy in the video

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.640 
probably looks quite easy in the video
there<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.449> that's<00:00:30.660> purely<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.140> my<00:00:31.439> crow

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
there but that's purely because my crow

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
there but that's purely because my crow
has<00:00:31.769> been<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.160> off<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> few<00:00:32.579> times<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
has been on and off a few times the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.880 
has been on and off a few times the
first<00:00:33.780> time<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> come<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.770> may

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
first time you come to do this you may

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.049 
first time you come to do this you may
find<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> does<00:00:35.489> require<00:00:35.610> additional

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
find that it does require additional

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.400 
find that it does require additional
force<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> grille<00:00:37.110> removed

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
force to get that grille removed

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.229 
force to get that grille removed
anything<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.460> say<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> reassure<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
anything I can say to reassure you is

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.459 
anything I can say to reassure you is
it's<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.510> lot<00:00:39.660> stronger<00:00:39.840> than<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> looks<00:00:40.290> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
it's a lot stronger than it looks so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's a lot stronger than it looks so
don't<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.800> afraid<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.129> breaking<00:00:41.250> anything<00:00:41.760> now

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
don't be afraid of breaking anything now

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.000 
don't be afraid of breaking anything now
I<00:00:42.540> usually<00:00:42.719> find<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> easiest<00:00:43.440> start<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I usually find it easiest start with the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
I usually find it easiest start with the
bottom<00:00:44.309> edge<00:00:44.489> first

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
bottom edge first

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.580 
bottom edge first
so<00:00:45.239> looking<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.809> photo<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.379> you'll

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
bottom edge of the grille now it's a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
bottom edge of the grille now it's a
pretty<00:01:44.100> similar<00:01:44.460> story<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.909> top<00:01:45.119> you've<00:01:45.299> got<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
pretty similar story up top you've got a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
pretty similar story up top you've got a
row<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> hooks<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> need<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> lip

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
row of hooks that you need to get a lip

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
row of hooks that you need to get a lip
over<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:48.090> there's<00:01:48.210> four<00:01:48.420> tabs<00:01:48.720> as

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
over and I think there's four tabs as

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
over and I think there's four tabs as
well<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> need<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.439> line<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.619> my<00:01:50.000> best

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
well that you need to line up my best

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
well that you need to line up my best
advice<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> tabs<00:01:52.470> all<00:01:52.710> lined<00:01:52.950> up

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
advice is to get the tabs all lined up

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.740 
advice is to get the tabs all lined up
first<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.180> pushing<00:01:54.450> back

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
first and then go about pushing back

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.080
