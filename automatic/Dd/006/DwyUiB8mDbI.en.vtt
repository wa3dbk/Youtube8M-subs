00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.400
 resident evil revelations 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.560
 for those who had not followed a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.600
 little bit history is a game that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 was released at the base on 3ds 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 it was an episode she was 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.710
 really put forward because it was 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.570
 a real thiolat network with a super 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.300
 realization for the 3ds and ademe a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.390
 decided to make a publishing town that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.850
 so is actually a hd7 reportage of this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.079
 nomadic episode with the program 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.690
 obviously a graphical improvement 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.670
 but also some small additions for 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:01:00.129
 justify a little ironing at the cashier 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:02.829
 for those who would then have for 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.390
 quickly go back on what is a 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.860
 resident evil revelations it's true that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.220
 it's an episode that is a little stand 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.380
 alone 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.299
 at the level of history there is really 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.509
 no need to have made the others 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.640
 episodes to understand what he 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.229
 this is just two 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600
 main characters who are jill and 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.929
 chris seduces the crises that are on a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.460
 boat 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.090
 so after I let you guess 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.950
 how can it end but it's 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.810
 really an episode that are trying to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.360
 return to the sources 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.310
 it's a quieter episode 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.319
 plays a lot more on survival the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.049
 ammunition search including 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.640
 all the passages with jill but there are 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.229
 also an entire equity component then 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.959
 the game is seen in the third person 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.530
 with a view a little shoulder camera 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:49.750
 this is a game that is quite long indeed 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.680
 finished it is cut in the way of a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.030
 TV series there really are chapters 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.409
 which are pillars that are carved 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.100
 in two or three episodes each time 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.020
 and it's really telling with the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 previously in resident evil 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.369
 revelations he really went for 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.600
 the laptops at the base but by the way 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.850
 on home consoles 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.530
 it's not really very embarrassing 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.330
 just have to just love that the game is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:22.200
 a little more carved than games 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:24.959
 traditional on support of that capcom has 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.470
 promised a lot of improvements for this 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.510
 episode 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.209
 at the level of realization already it is 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.480
 really convincing even if it's not 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.560
 at the level of what can be done 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.340
 traditionally on consoles 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.160
 current 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.830
 it's still pretty enough for a 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.269
 porting games that were on on 3ds 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.209
 at the base it must be said that the game of 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.790
 base was already quite pretty and we 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.500
 some few effects here and there that 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.200
 have been added in 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.490
 the textures took a little bit of high have 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.470
 taken a little consistency from others 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.090
 definitions especially about us two of 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.210
 characters that sort of thing in term 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.610
 of content it's true that the game has been 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:07.170
 mainly improve at the level of 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.440
 commando mode that proposes to do that 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.850
 make them parts of 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.710
 places we've already visited in the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.600
 main campaign with goals 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.770
 additional friends who have 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.100
 levels that can be smaller and 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.440
 bigger 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.980
 and there they added mainly 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.900
 characters in addition to the weapons in addition to it 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.210
 there is also a difficulty mode 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.250
 additional funds for the campaign 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.290
 which is called the way to do it and who 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.230
 is aptly named because the 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.000
 friends are super resistant and we stay 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.620
 very quickly 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.600
 the grip was a little 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.600
 relaxed compared to the 3ds version 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.410
 unfortunately not everything is rosy in 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.600
 this portage we can even say that there is 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.940
 some dark spots especially in 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.320
 already terms of loading time that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.450
 were already present we'll say on the 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.800
 on the 3ds version and that were not 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.720
 corrected we find ourselves this day with 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.550
 passages where there are doors that puts 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.020
 Milan to open because they are in 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.210
 load the next area and on 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.250
 the wii version or one that has the benefit of 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.430
 offer the game only on the 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.910
 gamepad is also a small function of 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.709
 gadgets 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.780
 lio pour me to leave messages 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.090
 kind of things for those who love 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.250
 play well in coop in the commando mode 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.950
 it's only online gaming then 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.530
 than on 3ds we could play in 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.000
 local with by connecting consoles there 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.950
 there is no ya no split screen 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.200
 for those who do not have the patience 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.540
 to wait until the price of the game drops 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.210
 the fact that at the exit they are 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.910
 available at 50 euros on average 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.010
 console and it's still expensive for 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.690
 a game that came out already is a little 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.690
 moment and that is in addition a portage 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.050
 based on the radiation level was a 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.910
 good game on 3ds 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.250
 they remain on consoles 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.250
 it is true that from this point of view 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.930
 it does not change there was an effort of fact 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.850
 graphically it's true that the 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.300
 portage is rather quality in terms 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.610
 of achievement does not sit at the level of 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.880
 what can we expect on 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.360
 the current ones but for a portage it is 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.949
 really clean 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.430
 there are just a few small worries 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.439
 techniques and some stuff that we do not 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.539
 been corrected or that we could 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.610
 expect to see in a portage 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:28.120
 compass was added more than 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.539
 content but we will say that the coating 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.069
 general and not always at the level of 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.909
 options including and not always 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.909
 fabulous
