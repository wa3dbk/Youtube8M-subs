it hits it curves upward instead of goes

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.680 
it hits it curves upward instead of goes
out<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.710> down<00:00:58.860> where<00:00:59.700> or<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.329> some

big kiddie pool you can put the bamboo

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
big kiddie pool you can put the bamboo
Annette<00:01:04.680> it'll<00:01:04.949> contain<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.399> and<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.910> it<00:01:06.119> comes

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
Annette it'll contain it and as it comes

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.930 
Annette it'll contain it and as it comes
over<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.810> cut<00:01:06.930> those<00:01:07.110> pieces<00:01:07.140> off<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.280> the
