00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
then what you'll do is you'll take your

first<00:00:40.920> color<00:00:41.360> whatever<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.629> might<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:45.140> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
first color whatever that might be and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.010 
first color whatever that might be and
just<00:00:46.350> rip<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> very<00:00:47.670> close<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.149> water<00:00:48.420> onto

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020

just rip it very close to the water onto
the<00:00:49.410> water<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:50.250> you'd<00:00:50.370> rip<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:50.730> too<00:00:51.000> high

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the water if you'd rip it from too high

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.410 
the water if you'd rip it from too high
up<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.370> call<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> blob<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.270> will

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
up it will just call the blob that will

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.340 
up it will just call the blob that will
float<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> bottom<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:59.629> each<00:01:00.629> brand<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
float to the bottom and each brand of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.680 
float to the bottom and each brand of
nail<00:01:01.530> polish<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.949> different<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> doesn't

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
nail polish is different so it doesn't

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.350 
nail polish is different so it doesn't
spread<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.110> shake<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:05.240> and<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
spread to shake it a little and it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.590 
spread to shake it a little and it
should<00:01:06.540> spread<00:01:10.549> some<00:01:11.549> colors<00:01:11.909> read<00:01:12.240> more<00:01:12.479> than

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
should spread some colors read more than

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.469 
should spread some colors read more than
others<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.939> overall<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.460> too<00:01:17.729> hard<00:01:20.479> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
others but overall it's not too hard you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.039 
others but overall it's not too hard you
can<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.780> many<00:01:21.869> colors<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> want

skin and the tape will pick up most of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.340 
skin and the tape will pick up most of
it<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.220> won't<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.459> too<00:02:47.489> hard<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
it so it won't be too hard so you just
