00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 here is my show reminds me that she 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.410
 It was closed so here are the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.770
 careers in depression and careers 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.109
 more right and upside down is the same 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.520
 so I put 12 stitches in the needle 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.650
 you may realize that this is a needle 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.109
 smaller and then we got a bar more 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.230
 other video working fine 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.480
 with six and a half then there are 12 points and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 I'll start, I said I have. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.350
 preference for tricolor for two 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.489
 clinics so knitting step by step knitting 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:48.410
 behind if I make two socks are 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.410
 66 step to line in front 2 knits 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 our line back and I'm repeating 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.219
 This until the end of my career so 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.250
 if we had to write the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.539
 recipe would be 2 knits two socks until 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 career end 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.760
 here it is different from the video of the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.210
 by an agent goes 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 to turn the job inside out 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 It's just that we're going to have people. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.170
 will have the beginning of the career well 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.430
 so then this career is going 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 also start with two knits so go 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 give that problem of having to know 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.380
 where I'm so normal again 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.200
 because the wrong side gave right to the right 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.960
 I will give you an important tip is to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.509
 Do it both ways to be cool. 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.979
 cool do you have an even number of points 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.259
 exactly because it is 22 that you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.340
 work there it looks better in the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.439
 sewing becomes more perfect and with 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.840
 People know how to sew someone straight. 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.049
 knows where the beginning and end of the piece 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.530
 so I did it right and once you 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.969
 back in the first row 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.520
 and then we have this result that is the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.460
 of bar bugres people wire white light 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.860
 white on my first right 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.180
 I think it's very quiet if you 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.180
 to understand the pure barrÃ£o 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.620
 after people 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.980
 simply 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.040
 kiss 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.200
 You do not have this video, we wait. 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.650
 that the title advance in the ranking and 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.230
 complete it important just take the gas there 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.230
 then the day where positive bars
