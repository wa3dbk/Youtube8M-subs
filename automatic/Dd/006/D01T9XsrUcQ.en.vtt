I've<00:00:54.210> learned<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.660> defending<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.289> everything

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I've learned is defending is everything

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
I've learned is defending is everything
it's<00:00:56.010> most<00:00:56.309> most<00:00:56.730> interesting<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it's most most interesting I think and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
it's most most interesting I think and
secondly<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.680> knows<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.250> much<00:00:59.550> more

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
secondly that knows a much more

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
secondly that knows a much more
interesting<00:01:00.210> than<00:01:00.239> yeses<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
interesting than yeses and those are the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
interesting than yeses and those are the
two<00:01:01.949> things<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.719> operate<00:01:03.719> with

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
two things that I think I operate with

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
two things that I think I operate with
on<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> daily<00:01:04.350> basis

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
on a daily basis

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.600 
on a daily basis
don't<00:01:07.260> feel<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> there's<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.980> way<00:01:08.160> to<00:01:08.190> do<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
don't feel that there's a way to do it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.590 
don't feel that there's a way to do it
and<00:01:08.730> you're<00:01:08.790> wrong<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.300> do<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and you're wrong if you do it a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
and you're wrong if you do it a
different<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.410> only<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
different way the only right way is the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
different way the only right way is the
way<00:01:11.580> that's<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> way

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
way that's right for you make it the way

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
way that's right for you make it the way
you<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.620> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.770> yes<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.820> thoughts<00:01:15.150> are

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you want it to be yes these thoughts are

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
you want it to be yes these thoughts are
essentially<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.960> combination<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.680> lessons

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
essentially a combination of lessons

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.680 
essentially a combination of lessons
that<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.670> learn<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:17.880> doing<00:01:18.210> things<00:01:18.360> wrong

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
that we learn from doing things wrong

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.900 
that we learn from doing things wrong
and<00:01:18.930> screwing<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.490> also<00:01:20.700> some

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
and screwing up and then also some

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.810 
and screwing up and then also some
things<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.480> brighter<00:01:22.050> people<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.650> are

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
things that brighter people that are

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.460 
things that brighter people that are
told<00:01:23.820> us<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.150> think<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.870> drivers<00:01:25.260> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
told us I think they are the drivers of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
told us I think they are the drivers of
where<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.070> principal<00:01:26.490> amount<00:01:26.550> of<00:01:26.700> success<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
where the principal amount of success of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.680 
where the principal amount of success of
innocent<00:01:28.260> came<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:29.120> obviously<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.479> most

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
innocent came from obviously the most

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.200 
innocent came from obviously the most
important<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.160> enjoy<00:01:32.550> it<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:33.000> have

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
important thing is to enjoy it to have

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.200 
important thing is to enjoy it to have
