00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello everyone with you galaxy him 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.069
 continue to play stronghold crusader 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.210
 2 training company the second chapter let's say 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.540
 so lion heart 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.940
 mission 1 the first blood of carl and richard 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 arrived on the holy land and in a hurry to win 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.369
 victory he sends the army to the nearest 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.710
 city ​​and instructs you to quickly deliver 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.260
 him under his banners 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.640
 need to destroy the enemy lord and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.279
 we are only 8 days old 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
 we can actually lose if 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.969
 lose our whole army card here 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.559
 Of course I do not know why I draw such 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.530
 at least to the very fortress painted 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.329
 let's count the catapult tips 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.390
 much more effective at breaking walls 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 compared to ordinary soldiers 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.719
 beware of soldiers in white clothes 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.390
 near the vat of water they can me 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.579
 conduct a rotating attack in which 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.489
 damage will be done to the entire squad next to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.120
 him as soon as you have made a hole in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.070
 wall immediately head to Claude 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.409
 the soldiers standing next to the walls will 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 throwing spears at archers on the wall is good 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:16.409
 I don't think we need to throw 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:20.119
 spears archers and capable as i think 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.860
 you have enough to overcome these walls 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:27.180
 okay now we will try the complexity of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 we are difficult I hope you can 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.549
 to see how the complexity of the changed here 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.670
 yes now it was somewhere it was possible if not 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.670
 am wrong 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.220
 So here is the complexity is difficult I will give us 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.070
 you can read the tips again and all 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:53.320
 instruct go well I got it 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.720
 what is the difference in our complexity 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.700
 smaller catapults on average 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 difficulty here was 4 catapult if 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:13.170
 I'm not mistaken but I can of course be wrong 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:17.380
 so the catapult is good there of course but 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.090
 but but let's try these vats 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.959
 with water and these guys here 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.390
 beat and so on the area let's 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.670
 try to continue here the wall or 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.550
 maybe this 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.160
 let's get into this position 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.010
 these will be control 2 here too 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.420
 go so far here gang motive here 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.340
 all power is just 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.980
 swordsmen of our crusaders who 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.630
 pretty well armored from them 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.130
 not bad enough attack at them 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.810
 good mosque but of course about him 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.810
 pretty slow and pretty 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.640
 Slow is a problem let's 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.130
 try to smash this wall 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.790
 try to smash this wall yes here 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:14.549
 more enemy archers have already become 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.549
 in my opinion it’s difficult 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.690
 and they beat not weakly so not weakly well 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.950
 almost hit 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:30.280
 oh well at least it was demolished we need 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.010
 make a pass here first thing 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.780
 smash this wall so that our fighters 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.250
 Could pass so about broke as far as I 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.820
 I understand and maybe our guys can already go 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.570
 attack on rates so let's go like this 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.800
 here is first in Colomo slowly pokachto 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:00.470
 let's go to catapult me on the middle 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:06.440
 complexity did not break so fast bolin I 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.980
 I do not even know how we can not 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.800
 somehow tell you faster fools 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.800
 run-run 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.030
 probably not ran let's see what 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.400
 it will probably not be worth the swordsmen 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.680
 as if for our ears 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.860
 the militias let them still protect 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:33.150
 swordsman 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:37.740
 I think let's go let's go 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.740
 the most important thing is that the swordsmen survive 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:49.510
 so try try somehow them 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.010
 protect as many swordsmen as possible 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.010
 survived and got to the lord 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.890
 let's go hiking already 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.890
 See our militia even got 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.800
 well , what's this here 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.800
 guard tones there don't even know how 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.810
 how to call this warrior pretty 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.990
 armored guys like that 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.550
 similar to our swordsman not even 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.680
 reacted to the fact that we are already here 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.580
 climbed on the wall and bottom on the walls 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.890
 john danna 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.919
 on the gift of john on the very and just beat 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.750
 the enemy lord is fine excellent in 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.290
 principle, we quite simply won 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.150
 we went and crushed in the future we do not 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.390
 it will be so easy to win such 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.390
 missions 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.900
 well okay 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.110
 the next mission was completed on a difficult 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.729
 Difficulties drove on the next series 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.220
 of course so far guys i'm with you 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.820
 say goodbye to everyone thanks for watching everyone 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.840
 until 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.840
 see you in the next series
