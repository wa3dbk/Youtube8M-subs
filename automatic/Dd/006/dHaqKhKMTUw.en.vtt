00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.040
 July 2 Iris Knef calls Bernd Appel 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.639
 and I want to show you a little tool that must end deep 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.849
 is hidden 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.099
 This tool can be the state or moss activities 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.010
 record it can document this and it can be a neighbor or 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.519
 create zip file 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.929
 This tool can be found if you are using as a city 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.519
 Jörn a search bar Diekmann recorder with Karl 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.780
 then there are already steps to reproduce a problem 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.859
 record 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.280
 also the way i did that we also originally was the Erika in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.999
 Yemen 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:40.829
 Clients a partner 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.110
 Imprint etc etc because I wanted to know what that is 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.990
 then she has the little group each fast 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.320
 When I point out States away with me everything has me too 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.730
 several times at Knickel I start this time 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.670
 Meanwhile 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.270
 Machnig 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 in training in the picture v 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 WTS is now 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000
 no matter 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 the children get that one sees how the 2 0 works 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 maybe not directly percent jetpack 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 because the judge 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.860
 Trademarks acts 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.860
 her tormentor becomes the record of the chair for 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.240
 then of course he wants to know in the next window of me where the grabbed 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.510
 File should be stored 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.760
 I may now like that 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.270
 you do not go 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.370
 Glarus for example 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.730
 Memory is allowed 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.630
 there is now the ready-packed file sometimes too 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 the criticism was advised 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.980
 each part of the third division is also double 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.920
 Niedernwöhren once you have risen you can not only pose a problem 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.040
 Touré also announced everything 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040
 just a bit 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.260
 11 11 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.849
 Here you can already see the first picture 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.249
 He describes what I have made mine 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.619
 and he marks the always going out colored here for example one ate 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 that goes loud picture by picture Luhr 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.219
 by the time I percent 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.219
 have changed 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.839
 Now once again a detailed overview of the whole desktop 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.839
 Activities and exports 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.680
 a bit more detailed than the barrel of the pictures in the was to see 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.789
 you can form with an opinion 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.289
 I am about 11 5% or very handy if you just quickly someone in the 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:55.299
 I want to show you then I can see the practitioner Taiji 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:57.629
 stood everywhere 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.229
 in the e-mail or him 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.639
 For example, you want to know more about the size of the packed file 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.179
 is to give revenue right click on the 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:08.659
 Norbert Hein 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.689
 Pictures a strong 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.790
 We can look at the cost of the wedge salvaged here 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.090
 okay that was it so far from me thank you first beat 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.990
 and of course
