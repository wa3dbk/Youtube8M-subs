pretty<00:02:05.440> self-explanatory<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:07.510> this<00:02:08.380> thing

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
pretty self-explanatory to this thing

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.980 
pretty self-explanatory to this thing
pretty<00:02:10.780> heavy<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:12.540> could<00:02:13.540> do<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> lot<00:02:13.960> of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
pretty heavy so you could do a lot of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.580 
pretty heavy so you could do a lot of
damage<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.580> end<00:02:15.670> time<00:02:15.910> weapon<00:02:16.590> you

would<00:02:19.480> certainly<00:02:19.810> be<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.470> very<00:02:21.430> devastating

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
would certainly be a very devastating

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.420 
would certainly be a very devastating
tool<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.720> have<00:02:22.930> for<00:02:23.530> stopping<00:02:23.980> zombies

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
this thing and so it's a little rustic

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.690 
this thing and so it's a little rustic
but<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.230> throw<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.590> thing<00:02:32.650> also<00:02:33.040> so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
but I like to throw this thing also so

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.790

I'd like to demonstrate the very very

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.850 
I'd like to demonstrate the very very
penetrating<00:02:39.480> power<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.080> spike<00:02:41.530> on<00:02:41.800> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
back of this thing the weight of this

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.690 
back of this thing the weight of this
hammer<00:02:43.750> head<00:02:44.020> just<00:02:44.320> really<00:02:44.830> arrives<00:02:45.340> at<00:02:45.580> the

hammer head just really arrives at the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.650 
hammer head just really arrives at the
end<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.970> could<00:02:46.180> destroy<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:47.230> good<00:02:47.860> block<00:02:48.190> and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
end you could destroy a good block and
