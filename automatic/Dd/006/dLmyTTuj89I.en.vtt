let's think it over this first thing
this<00:05:29.180> is<00:05:29.270> a<00:05:29.479> problem<00:05:30.050> oh<00:05:30.169> there<00:05:30.440> we<00:05:30.530> go<00:05:30.560> not<00:05:30.830> a

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
this is a problem oh there we go not a

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.070 
this is a problem oh there we go not a
problem<00:05:31.250> anymore

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
problem anymore

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.510 
problem anymore
just<00:05:33.080> give<00:05:33.200> me<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.440> checkpoint<00:05:33.620> there<00:05:34.430> we

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
just give me to the checkpoint there we

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.980 
just give me to the checkpoint there we
go<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:34.760> don't<00:05:34.940> care<00:05:35.060> if<00:05:35.150> I<00:05:35.180> flip<00:05:35.660> over<00:05:35.780> the

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
go I don't care if I flip over the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.600 
go I don't care if I flip over the
checkpoint<00:05:36.380> that's<00:05:36.889> not<00:05:37.039> gonna<00:05:37.190> work

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
checkpoint that's not gonna work

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.610 
checkpoint that's not gonna work
that's<00:05:38.300> not<00:05:38.539> gonna<00:05:38.690> work<00:05:38.810> either<00:05:39.050> I<00:05:39.169> like<00:05:39.470> it

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
that's not gonna work either I like it

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.140 
that's not gonna work either I like it
when<00:05:39.740> I<00:05:39.770> just<00:05:40.010> fall<00:05:40.250> when<00:05:40.520> I'm<00:05:40.610> just<00:05:40.789> trying<00:05:40.850> to

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
when I just fall when I'm just trying to

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.350 
when I just fall when I'm just trying to
go<00:05:41.950> like<00:05:42.950> just<00:05:43.100> give<00:05:43.400> me<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.520> flat<00:05:43.820> map<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:44.270> I'll

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
go like just give me a flat map and I'll

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.879 
go like just give me a flat map and I'll
probably<00:05:44.720> fail<00:05:45.110> on<00:05:45.350> it<00:05:45.470> a<00:05:45.560> whole<00:05:45.710> by<00:05:45.860> the

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
probably fail on it a whole by the

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.320 
probably fail on it a whole by the
checkpoint<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:46.639> pull<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.940> trigger<00:05:47.090> and

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
checkpoint and you pull the trigger and

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.940 
checkpoint and you pull the trigger and
then<00:05:47.600> you<00:05:47.660> just<00:05:47.870> kind<00:05:47.990> of<00:05:48.080> just<00:05:48.200> fall<00:05:48.710> on<00:05:48.860> your

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
then you just kind of just fall on your
