00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.600
 we want to look at each other now 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.630
 rename filenames of images 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.730
 But first filenames in the organizer 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.900
 to get displayed we need this 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.800
 first a burn 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.300
 this is done via view and then 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.619
 filenames if they still are 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.109
 do not display it is a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.000
 zoom level if we move further into the 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.400
 Zooming into it will be us 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.750
 someday also here the filename 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.190
 presented with the filename img 14 82 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.350
 maybe not so much 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.420
 That's why we want the pictures 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.180
 Just rename this one should 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.969
 necessarily in the organizer of elements do 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.980
 since the organizer renamed files 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.450
 note this has the advantage above all 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.460
 that if you go to a later 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.280
 time the same pictures again 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.710
 imported then organizer notes that it 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.930
 Duplicate is and will be 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.570
 then do not import respectively 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.579
 give an appropriate message if 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.820
 you get the files outside of the original 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.220
 So call in finer under mac 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.259
 or in the explorer under windows then can 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.539
 The organizer can no longer determine 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.970
 that it is duplicate and 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.979
 The pictures are imported twice as 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.009
 we can see these pictures are here 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.810
 all already correctly renamed in portugal 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.509
 I will now have these pictures here 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.539
 select and rename them as well 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.630
 I go to the menu file and 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.420
 select rename here then 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.369
 opens a new dialog box where I am 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.390
 now you have to enter the new name and 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.130
 I will not do that now 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.789
 Portugal just take it 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.789
 nazar 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.760
 we can see then the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.680
 renamed images accordingly 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.320
 the nice thing is that we are now in 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.060
 organizer search for the file name 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.910
 so if i can get into that up here 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.250
 search field go in and now to nasa- 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.730
 search and I need only naz too 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.410
 tap 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.840
 then we will only have the pictures 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.360
 the information is displayed in the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.460
 filenames or in the meter details 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.440
 Include all pictures again 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.350
 i just delete it 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.320
 the search inquiry or I click 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.780
 back to the button, too 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.420
 date and time of a file leaves 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.030
 change if so for example date 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.010
 and time in the camera wrong 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.440
 have been specified or not at all 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.400
 then you can define these 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.180
 later in the pictures still 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.610
 to adjust 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.780
 I 'll just take a picture 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.820
 you can also get several pictures 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.430
 select then one goes over edit 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.330
 and world here then date and time 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.010
 change out now we have the option one 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.380
 certain time and a specific one 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.940
 date define date and time of 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.690
 file to choose or another 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.060
 time zone 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.850
 I click ok and have now here 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.170
 the possibility of the date and the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.060
 time to edit 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.830
 In this case I do not want that 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.230
 year of the month or day 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.700
 but only the time the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.070
 time is at 14 03 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.060
 and I just want to set the time 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.530
 change the time 1322 so I change 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.110
 here the time 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.090
 and if I click ok now 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.640
 course, the picture moves forward 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.569
 because we have sorted here by the latest 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.220
 and there the first two pictures here from 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.860
 Of course these are 1322 now 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.319
 also indicated at the very front the display in the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.319
 Of course organizer depends on it 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.730
 where sorted by here namely after 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.980
 latest after oldest and after the import 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.970
 stack that is when the files 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.530
 were imported 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.740
 as we have seen 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.930
 Changes to the filename and the 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.390
 time in the organizer no problem 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.700
 One should only make these changes in the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.040
 make organizer and not in 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.430
 external tools since the organizer 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.890
 Thus, the survey has continued and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.460
 you do not accidentally duplicate 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.460
 imported
