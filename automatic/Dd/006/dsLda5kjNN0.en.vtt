decided to take a look at I decided to
I've<00:00:24.869> had<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> while<00:00:26.090> it<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.210> given<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
I've had it for a while it was given to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.980 
I've had it for a while it was given to
me<00:00:27.960> I'm<00:00:28.320> not<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> mention<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:30.359> name<00:00:30.660> or

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
me I'm not going to mention the name or

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.870 
me I'm not going to mention the name or
the<00:00:31.019> brand<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.619> not<00:00:31.769> even<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.219> sure<00:00:32.369> if

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the brand I'm not even really sure if

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.290 
the brand I'm not even really sure if
they're<00:00:33.090> still<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.540> business<00:00:34.160> but<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.610> wanted

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
they're still in business but I I wanted

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.130 
they're still in business but I I wanted
just<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> use<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.899> because<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.930> actually

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
just to use it and because I actually

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.250 
just to use it and because I actually
needed<00:00:40.950> another<00:00:41.520> sprouter<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.629> handy

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
needed another sprouter and it was handy

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.740 
needed another sprouter and it was handy
and<00:00:43.670> even<00:00:44.670> though<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> don't<00:00:44.910> endorse<00:00:45.390> this

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and even though I don't endorse this

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
and even though I don't endorse this
sprouter<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> thought<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> was

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sprouter you know I thought it was

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.729 
sprouter you know I thought it was
pretty<00:00:47.430> good<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.440> some

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
pretty good but there are some

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.220 
pretty good but there are some
limitations<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:51.090> sprouter<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.870> let<00:00:52.110> me

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
limitations to this sprouter and let me

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.830 
limitations to this sprouter and let me
show<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.520> what<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.789> are<00:00:53.820> Liv<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.449> mean<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
show you what they are Liv I mean you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
show you what they are Liv I mean you
can<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> look<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.190> wheat<00:00:56.640> grass<00:00:56.910> I'm

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
can take a look at the wheat grass I'm

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.439 
can take a look at the wheat grass I'm
testing<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.579> see

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
testing over here you can actually see

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.799 
testing over here you can actually see
that<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:00.809> using<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.770> codes<00:01:02.420> for<00:01:03.420> these

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that I'm using the codes for these

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.609 
that I'm using the codes for these
different<00:01:04.379> types<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.939> grasses<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.619> seeds

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
different types of grasses and seeds

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.940 
different types of grasses and seeds
because<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:09.180> testing<00:01:09.810> everything<00:01:10.260> before<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because I'm testing everything before I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.789 
because I'm testing everything before I
put<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:11.970> package<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> sell<00:01:13.320> them<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
put them in my package and sell them to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.570 
put them in my package and sell them to
you<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:15.950> actually<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> seeds<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.400> doing

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you so actually the seeds are doing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.280 
you so actually the seeds are doing
pretty<00:01:17.820> well<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.479> wheat<00:01:18.689> grass<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.020> doing

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
pretty well this wheat grass is doing

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.340 
pretty well this wheat grass is doing
great<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.009> far<00:01:20.040> there's<00:01:20.610> no<00:01:20.759> mold<00:01:21.090> these<00:01:21.900> peas

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
great so far there's no mold these peas

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
great so far there's no mold these peas
are<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.100> great<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.909> here's<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
are going to be great but here's the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.800 
are going to be great but here's the
problem<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.259> sprouter<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
problem with this sprouter and this is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.840 
problem with this sprouter and this is
unfortunately<00:01:27.810> sadly<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.740> problem<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
unfortunately sadly the problem with a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.359 
unfortunately sadly the problem with a
lot<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.390> commercial<00:01:30.930> sprout<00:01:31.409> errs<00:01:31.590> out<00:01:31.920> there

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
lot of commercial sprout errs out there

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.289 
lot of commercial sprout errs out there
is<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.600> they're<00:01:33.780> not<00:01:33.930> designed<00:01:34.700> well<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
is that they're not designed well and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.819 
is that they're not designed well and
now<00:01:36.509> take<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> look<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.409> wheat<00:01:37.650> grass

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
now take a look at this the wheat grass

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.330 
now take a look at this the wheat grass
is<00:01:38.220> already<00:01:38.450> above<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.200> edge<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
is already above the edge of the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
is already above the edge of the
sprouter<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.299> pea<00:01:42.479> shoots<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.869> actually

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
sprouter and the pea shoots are actually

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.530 
sprouter and the pea shoots are actually
going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.619> longer<00:01:44.070> than<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.180> wheat<00:01:45.360> grass

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
going to get longer than the wheat grass

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.510 
going to get longer than the wheat grass
eventually<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.619> grow<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:46.979> 10<00:01:47.280> inches

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
eventually they grow about 10 inches

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.240 
eventually they grow about 10 inches
tall<00:01:47.909> wheat<00:01:48.659> grass<00:01:48.869> grows<00:01:49.229> 8<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> 10<00:01:49.920> inches

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
tall wheat grass grows 8 to 10 inches

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.810 
tall wheat grass grows 8 to 10 inches
tall

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
tall

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.319 
tall
so<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:52.049> there's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.500> cover<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.850> this

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so this there's a cover on here and this

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.100 
so this there's a cover on here and this
cover<00:01:55.009> although<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.840> fit

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
cover although it will you know fit

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.789 
cover although it will you know fit
nicely<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
nicely or like this is just not going to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.520 
nicely or like this is just not going to
cut<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.570> wheat<00:02:03.750> grass<00:02:03.930> grows

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
cut it when the wheat grass grows

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.059 
cut it when the wheat grass grows
because<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.969> already<00:02:06.540> above<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
because it's it's already above the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.260 
because it's it's already above the
cover<00:02:08.340> line<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.520> it's<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.790> not<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.209> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
cover line so it's just not going to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.100 
cover line so it's just not going to
work<00:02:12.480> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
work on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.220 
work on
in<00:02:13.440> terms<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.950> height<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.490> also<00:02:14.960> we've<00:02:15.960> got

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
in terms of height but also we've got

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.560 
in terms of height but also we've got
the<00:02:16.440> roots<00:02:16.740> on<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> bottom<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
the roots on the bottom now and the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.250 
the roots on the bottom now and the
roots<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:21.240> form<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.020> can't

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
roots have a little form and you can't

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.430 
roots have a little form and you can't
just<00:02:22.440> put<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.250> roots<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.600> table<00:02:25.170> you've

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
just put the roots on the table you've

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680 
just put the roots on the table you've
got<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.800> put<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.190> into<00:02:26.760> something<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.630> they

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
got to put it into something and they

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.290 
got to put it into something and they
give<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.380> little<00:02:28.710> tight<00:02:29.520> thing<00:02:29.550> here

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
give you this little tight thing here

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.450 
give you this little tight thing here
and<00:02:30.450> there's<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:30.870> no<00:02:31.200> room<00:02:31.920> for<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.340> roots

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
and there's really no room for the roots

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.520 
and there's really no room for the roots
to<00:02:32.640> grow<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.240> roots<00:02:33.450> are<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.440> be

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
to grow so the roots are going to be

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.210 
to grow so the roots are going to be
quite<00:02:34.980> smashed<00:02:35.970> over<00:02:36.540> there<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.860> not

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
quite smashed over there and that's not

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.840 
quite smashed over there and that's not
going<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.640> work<00:02:38.840> well<00:02:39.840> at<00:02:40.170> all<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.760> these

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
going to work well at all so in these

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.150 
going to work well at all so in these
roots<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.480> squished<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.830> can't

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
roots going to be squished and you can't

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.660 
roots going to be squished and you can't
get<00:02:44.460> growth<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.600> top<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.440> you're<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.550> to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
get growth on the top if you're going to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.000 
get growth on the top if you're going to
squish<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.300> roots<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.200> bottom<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.930> sadly

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
squish the roots on the bottom so sadly

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.850 
squish the roots on the bottom so sadly
another<00:02:53.010> poorly<00:02:53.700> designed<00:02:54.630> sprouter<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.710> by

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
another poorly designed sprouter and by

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
another poorly designed sprouter and by
and<00:02:56.130> by<00:02:56.760> looking<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.600> contrast<00:02:58.730> I'll<00:02:59.730> bring

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
and by looking in contrast I'll bring

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.110 
and by looking in contrast I'll bring
over<00:03:00.030> my<00:03:00.300> fresh<00:03:00.600> life<00:03:00.870> sprouter<00:03:01.710> here<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.550> you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
over my fresh life sprouter here and you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.560 
over my fresh life sprouter here and you
can<00:03:03.360> see<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.680> know<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.190> have<00:03:05.550> lots<00:03:06.300> of

can see you know that we have lots of

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.930 
can see you know that we have lots of
rooms<00:03:06.870> for<00:03:07.020> roots<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.160> come<00:03:08.370> out<00:03:08.520> you've<00:03:08.760> got

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
rooms for roots to come out you've got

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180 
rooms for roots to come out you've got
this<00:03:09.180> area<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.960> you've<00:03:10.380> got<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.830> depth

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
this area here you've got this depth

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.120 
this area here you've got this depth
over<00:03:11.610> here<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.120> you've<00:03:12.630> got<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.170> another<00:03:13.650> two

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
over here so you've got like another two

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.640 
over here so you've got like another two
inches<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:15.120> that's<00:03:15.810> about<00:03:15.960> two<00:03:16.350> inches

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
inches really that's about two inches

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.930 
inches really that's about two inches
total<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.670> root<00:03:18.120> depth<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.989> when<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.040> put<00:03:20.790> it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
total of root depth and when you put it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.750 
total of root depth and when you put it
into<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.530> fresh<00:03:22.530> life<00:03:22.800> sprouter<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:26.489> can

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
into the fresh life sprouter you can

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.970 
into the fresh life sprouter you can
watch<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.239> we<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.570> case<00:03:27.750> wheatgrass<00:03:28.260> you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
watch the we in this case wheatgrass you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.650 
watch the we in this case wheatgrass you
can<00:03:29.160> watch<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.550> wheat<00:03:29.760> grass<00:03:29.910> roots<00:03:30.270> really

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
can watch the wheat grass roots really

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.840 
can watch the wheat grass roots really
grow<00:03:31.080> out<00:03:31.290> because<00:03:31.950> they<00:03:32.130> can<00:03:32.250> go<00:03:32.400> all<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.820> way

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
grow out because they can go all the way

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.970 
grow out because they can go all the way
down<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:35.400> very<00:03:36.890> important<00:03:37.890> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
down in there so it's very important to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.479 
down in there so it's very important to
have<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.640> properly<00:03:39.540> designed<00:03:40.110> sprouter<00:03:40.980> and

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
have a properly designed sprouter and

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.650 
have a properly designed sprouter and
that's<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:43.190> for<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.760> wanted<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.360> tell<00:03:45.540> you
