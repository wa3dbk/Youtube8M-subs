00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
far as Scoville units I might be off a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400 
far as Scoville units I might be off a
little<00:00:38.910> bit<00:00:39.210> by<00:00:39.390> saying<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.230> it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
little bit by saying this but it's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.819 
little bit by saying this but it's
anywhere<00:00:40.829> between<00:00:41.270> 1.75<00:00:42.270> million<00:00:43.260> two

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
anywhere between 1.75 million two

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.299 
anywhere between 1.75 million two
million<00:00:44.100> Scoville<00:00:44.789> units<00:00:45.920> which<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.070> about

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
million Scoville units which is about

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.040 
million Scoville units which is about
like<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> hundred<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.510> two<00:00:48.539> hundred<00:00:48.690> times

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
like a hundred to two hundred times

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.240 
like a hundred to two hundred times
hotter<00:00:49.320> than<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.590> habanero<00:00:49.890> ah<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.980> them

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
hotter than a habanero ah so I have them

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
hotter than a habanero ah so I have them
and<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> eat<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and I'm going to eat one and I see a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.950 
and I'm going to eat one and I see a
bunch<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:56.579> English<00:00:57.000> kids<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.539> YouTube

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
bunch of little English kids on YouTube

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.340 
bunch of little English kids on YouTube
eating<00:00:58.440> them<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.670> think<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.899> handle<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
eating them so I think I can handle it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.630 
eating them so I think I can handle it
better<00:01:01.530> than<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> probably

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
better than them but this is probably

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.020 
better than them but this is probably
the<00:01:02.760> dumbest<00:01:03.180> thing<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.860> I've<00:01:05.010> done<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the dumbest thing that I've done in a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.090 
the dumbest thing that I've done in a
long<00:01:06.060> long<00:01:06.600> time<00:01:06.659> um<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.680> make<00:01:10.680> hot<00:01:10.860> sauce
