00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.230 
that on put a couple of handfuls more
soil<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.820> join<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
soil in here here just to join up the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
soil in here here just to join up the
trays<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.750> spread<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.590> join<00:01:59.009> up

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
trays to spread that out so just join up

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.249 
trays to spread that out so just join up
the<00:01:59.159> trays<00:01:59.460> oh<00:01:59.759> yeah<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:00.960> some<00:02:01.110> food

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the trays oh yeah then you get some food

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.649 
the trays oh yeah then you get some food
scraps<00:02:01.590> thin<00:02:01.979> layers<00:02:02.250> regularly<00:02:02.820> again<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
scraps thin layers regularly again you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.330 
scraps thin layers regularly again you
add<00:02:03.780> some<00:02:04.020> soil<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.439> top<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.770> reason<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
add some soil on top the reason for this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.910 
add some soil on top the reason for this
is<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:06.270> worms<00:02:06.719> don't<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.649> teeth<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
is because worms don't have teeth and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979 
is because worms don't have teeth and
they<00:02:08.160> take<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.520> some<00:02:08.759> soil<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.509> grind<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
they take in some soil and they grind I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.690 
they take in some soil and they grind I
didn't<00:02:10.200> think<00:02:10.319> all<00:02:10.500> they<00:02:10.619> gives<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.950> okay<00:02:11.520> okay

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
didn't think all they gives it okay okay

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.370 
didn't think all they gives it okay okay
so<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.330> their<00:02:12.450> teeth<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.870> little<00:02:13.110> bit<00:02:13.230> more

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
so this is their teeth a little bit more

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.800 
so this is their teeth a little bit more
water<00:02:13.530> okay<00:02:14.310> put<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> blanket<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:15.600> what

can buy these commercial ones make sure

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.840

air<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.650> move<00:02:19.800> through<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.190> okay<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.520> want<00:02:20.790> to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
air can move through it okay you want to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.490 
air can move through it okay you want to

and other things like that if it starts
to<00:02:53.010> smell<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.580> telling<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.000> there's<00:02:54.150> not

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
to smell it's telling you there's not

to smell it's telling you there's not
enough<00:02:54.450> air<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.840> there<00:02:54.990> so<00:02:55.020> you're<00:02:55.290> probably

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
enough air in there so you're probably

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.680 
enough air in there so you're probably
put<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.010> too<00:02:56.220> much<00:02:56.400> food<00:02:56.670> compared<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> what

put in too much food compared to what

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.840 
put in too much food compared to what
the<00:02:57.780> worms<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.080> eat<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.410> stop<00:02:59.160> feeding<00:02:59.640> it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
the worms can eat and stop feeding it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.100 
the worms can eat and stop feeding it
for<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> week<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.630> it'll<00:03:00.750> come<00:03:00.900> good

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110

question Kosta it'll take a couple of
months<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.160> get<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.460> point<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.390> let<00:03:09.570> me

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
months to get to that point so let me

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.300 
months to get to that point so let me
take<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.930> over<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.170> one<00:03:10.290> that's<00:03:10.530> already<00:03:10.860> full

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
take you over to one that's already full

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.730 
take you over to one that's already full
most<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.300> worms<00:03:12.510> now<00:03:13.170> will<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.560> moved

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
most of the worms now will have moved

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.460 
most of the worms now will have moved
out<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.850> home<00:03:15.300> tray<00:03:15.540> up<00:03:15.780> into<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.230> top

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
out of that home tray up into this top

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.320 
out of that home tray up into this top
tray<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.040> lift<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.370> whole<00:03:17.640> top<00:03:17.940> tray<00:03:18.180> off

tray so you lift this whole top tray off

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.260 
tray so you lift this whole top tray off
most<00:03:19.200> your<00:03:19.380> worms<00:03:19.560> will<00:03:19.770> be<00:03:19.890> there<00:03:20.100> oh<00:03:20.250> look<00:03:21.150> at

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
most your worms will be there oh look at
