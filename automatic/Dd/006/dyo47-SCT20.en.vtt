watching them and it's an actually a bit
more<00:03:49.870> challenging<00:03:50.109> than<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.769> is<00:03:50.889> in<00:03:51.040> dragon

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
more challenging than it is in dragon

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.530 
more challenging than it is in dragon
city<00:03:51.670> because<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:53.290> actually<00:03:53.530> do<00:03:53.889> have<00:03:53.920> to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
work on leveling them up so that you can

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.940 
work on leveling them up so that you can
give<00:03:57.940> them<00:03:58.060> certain<00:03:58.420> moves<00:03:58.690> because<00:03:59.109> it's<00:03:59.769> not

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
give them certain moves because it's not

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.830 
give them certain moves because it's not
just<00:04:00.190> oh<00:04:00.250> let's<00:04:00.760> just<00:04:00.850> train<00:04:01.239> them<00:04:01.450> for<00:04:01.750> this

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
just oh let's just train them for this

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.960 
just oh let's just train them for this
so<00:04:02.049> then<00:04:02.170> they<00:04:02.260> stop<00:04:02.500> their<00:04:02.829> their<00:04:03.280> moves<00:04:03.609> keep

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
so then they stop their their moves keep

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.819 
so then they stop their their moves keep
evolving<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.720> more<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.019> train<00:04:05.290> them<00:04:05.530> and

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
evolving the more you train them and

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.729 
evolving the more you train them and
that's<00:04:06.069> what's<00:04:06.310> really<00:04:06.370> cool<00:04:06.579> about<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.209> oh
