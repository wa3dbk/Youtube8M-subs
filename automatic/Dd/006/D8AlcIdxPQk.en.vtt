00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.590
 LBBW will be presented to you by Piotr on the buildings and industry 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 Services 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.009
 The Mellon remains Andreas Wagner and his coaching team were allowed once again 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.700
 to celebrate a victory as well 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.920
 the Baruther fans it was an enormously important victory namely one against one 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.020
 Opponent of a direct competitor in Cape Town's martial arts 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.819
 for himself a natural supporter of the game 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.610
 to La Virgen del we unfortunately had defeats 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.539
 but of course immensely important wanted 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.370
 The federal government is supposed to win the game this time, the BBC had in particular 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.800
 Moments sometimes luck 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 Simoncelli's threesome came with the final siren 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.450
 or just that can be with the once again strong the legitimate of 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.850
 BBC kept the pressure 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.650
 to win 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.480
 Armin Rohnen went for the SG LVB final we knew it would be tough 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 we will know 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.660
 they're just down there as well as us and we have to win that's why we all have 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.670
 We worked together in the field and that's why we won 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.440
 what should that bring 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.500
 one of the best on this evening Markus Binder 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.760
 17 points 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.620
 three out of four threes hit his overall casting rate 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.630
 and 75 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.410
 It looked as if his mother was visiting him at the moment 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.860
 lend support to him loudly as the rest also held 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.930
 Per cent it was nice to have my mother here so could here 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.740
 show that we can win 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 just as convincing pop as new Kenny was 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 safe from a distance 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.910
 and from the free-throw line his yield 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.490
 he was an asset 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.729
 al Baker made a good game today that also gave them trouble 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.140
 first weeks Ospelt normal 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.600
 but I defended well even for what was hit 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.410
 once the lead of almost always tight 20 points was 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.950
 a bit tighter but the BBC countered with this team in this crucial 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.029
 Moment priority 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.749
 even if there is no move 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.909
 Nuzzolo Gelabert fancied winning here 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.290
 To very good starter gave again and was allowed but weak phases 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.400
 second breath so well got around once again turned up a mess 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.029
 no case, especially not unnatural ours stands and the 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.209
 last games 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.419
 Othello had been more important for Marstall but only made good games 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.790
 There was even one or the other highlight 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.790
 That's a bit of hope for the derby against Canada 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.219
 Of course, as it is very clear that is trying on everything else 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.689
 to keep the player on easy 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.760
 AR Schaffens Werder was already to worry and when the Mussumer lent times 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.069
 maybe in Bayreuth silver is rare all are already hot on it every few 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.669
 around the corner, according to the Derby is we have to but on the game 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.430
 It will only be a tough nut to crack if we all go to the limit 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.430
 we have a chance to see it 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.730
 I have to face the WBC against Baumberg 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.299
 without playing Koko Archibong he pulled a muscle injury too Intercell 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.959
 Men is a question mark but not behind the fans against Bamberg again 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.879
 give everything 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.769
 Piotrowski buildings and industrial services 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.269
 we realize everything is one
