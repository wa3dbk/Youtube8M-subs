been seen on a lot of Samsung devices
themselves<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:26.099> fine<00:00:26.340> tip<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
themselves so a really fine tip which is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.300 
themselves so a really fine tip which is
the<00:00:27.060> main<00:00:27.269> advantage<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> c-pen<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:29.130> not

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the main advantage of the c-pen it's not

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
the main advantage of the c-pen it's not
got<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> big<00:00:29.820> fat<00:00:30.150> capacitive<00:00:30.660> tip<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.990> know

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
got the big fat capacitive tip you know

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
got the big fat capacitive tip you know
is<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> capacitive<00:00:31.800> tip<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.430> thin

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
is a capacitive tip but it's really thin

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.970 
is a capacitive tip but it's really thin
which<00:00:33.120> helps<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.809> much<00:00:34.050> more<00:00:34.230> precise

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
which helps you get a much more precise

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.930 
which helps you get a much more precise
and<00:00:35.329> accurate<00:00:36.500> grip<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> screen<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.790> it's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
and accurate grip on the screen now it's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.790 
and accurate grip on the screen now it's
also<00:00:39.090> quite<00:00:39.540> weighted<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.110> well<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.710> it's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
also quite weighted as well so it's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
also quite weighted as well so it's
really<00:00:41.040> comfortable<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.790> use<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.149> hold<00:00:42.719> it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
really comfortable to use and hold it's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.319 
really comfortable to use and hold it's
not<00:00:43.350> too<00:00:43.559> heavy<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.760> things<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
not too heavy but you know things that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.000 
not too heavy but you know things that
are<00:00:45.390> too<00:00:45.510> light<00:00:45.660> might<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.620> easy<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
are too light might not be as easy to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
are too light might not be as easy to
use<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.399> screen<00:00:47.730> I'm<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> show<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
use on screen I'm going to show you a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.600 
use on screen I'm going to show you a
bit<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.950> really<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> go<00:00:50.489> into

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
bit now I'm really not going to go into

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.760 
bit now I'm really not going to go into
too<00:00:50.730> much<00:00:50.760> detail<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.140> sure<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.590> see

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
too much detail but I'm sure you can see

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.069 
too much detail but I'm sure you can see
from<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:53.789> easy<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
from here just how easy it is to use and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.049 
from here just how easy it is to use and
how<00:00:55.110> accurate<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> mean<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.550> standing<00:00:56.910> up

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
how accurate is I mean I'm standing up

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.760 
how accurate is I mean I'm standing up
so<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:58.109> trickier<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> write

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
so it can be a bit trickier to write

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
so it can be a bit trickier to write
anyway<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> go<00:01:00.210> into<00:01:00.359> S<00:01:00.480> Memo

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
anyway but I'm going to go into S Memo

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.609 
anyway but I'm going to go into S Memo
and<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:02.010> drawing<00:01:02.460> mode<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.409> there

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and into drawing mode so that's on there

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590 
and into drawing mode so that's on there
and<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.790> anything<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> draw<00:01:06.330> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and I'm really got anything to draw so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.100 
and I'm really got anything to draw so
I'll<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.460> suffer<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:12.110> if

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
I'll just you know suffer right so if

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.190 
I'll just you know suffer right so if
you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> read<00:01:13.650> my<00:01:13.799> handwriting<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:15.020> hope<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you can read my handwriting I hope you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.090 
you can read my handwriting I hope you
can<00:01:16.409> anyway<00:01:17.119> I'm<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.229> neatest<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.890> hand

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
can anyway I'm not the neatest of hand

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.710 
can anyway I'm not the neatest of hand
writers<00:01:20.780> by<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> long<00:01:22.110> shot<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.390> I'm<00:01:27.479> sure<00:01:27.630> you

writers by a long shot so I'm sure you
can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.380> accurate<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:30.270> stylus<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
can see just how accurate this stylus is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.630 
can see just how accurate this stylus is
especially<00:01:31.680> compared<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.340> ones

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
especially compared to the other ones

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149 
especially compared to the other ones
you<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> ones<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> big<00:01:34.159> bulky

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you know the ones with the big bulky

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
you know the ones with the big bulky
tips<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.150> can't<00:01:36.329> get<00:01:36.420> into<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
tips you really can't get into the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.609 
tips you really can't get into the
corners<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.110> you're<00:01:37.200> putting<00:01:37.409> things<00:01:37.500> like

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
corners if you're putting things like

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
corners if you're putting things like
Draw<00:01:37.920> Something<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.579> things<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.600> you

really can't get into the corners I know
that's<00:01:41.939> an<00:01:42.060> old<00:01:42.150> app<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:43.829> you
