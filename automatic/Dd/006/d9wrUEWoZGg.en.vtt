 job interview I would not like that

 your hair influenced your status 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.479
 encouragement so my advice for that day is 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.030
 that your hair is very clean and 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.860
 well polished and I will teach you how 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.560
 girls we have a gift kit 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.539
 padrÃ­simo including a bag one 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.039
 kerchief 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.450
 an iron or a clip also brushes 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.260
 terrific things that I know you 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.810
 you want so 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.810
 at the end so you know how to earn the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.890
 present this work we are going to carry 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.500
 our hair very well combed very 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.240
 well polished and today we're going to learn to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.680
 how to iron them correctly 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.510
 many times you think that your hair is already 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.840
 is completely ready and you go out in the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.970
 street and in two hours it is too little you should 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.710
 of paying a lot of attention the one 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.870
 temperature you have your iron and 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.110
 recognize what kind of hair we have if 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.150
 Your hair is very thin or it is already very 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.880
 processed the temperature of your iron 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.440
 should be the average temperature but if 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.660
 your hair is bone where you can 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.540
 increase a little bit more apply your 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.720
 hair a protector 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.430
 we separate our hair 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.700
 it is very important that the combs 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.510
 and here is the trick you must spend very 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 well the iron slowly through the country 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.400
 slide gently because it is preferable 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.400
 that you rarely pass the iron and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.020
 end make a small movement 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.150
 inside so that the tips take shape 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.970
 if you use extensions of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.630
 I suggest that you 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.590
 plates apart if they catch very well and 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.730
 the plates remember in the end to be that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.730
 inward movement 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.650
 this our hair is perfectly 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.840
 smooth I know that maybe some of you 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.670
 they were seeing in the mirror was going to have 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.370
 some little horses that is so common that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.890
 badly ported that's because of the static 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.760
 for very easy to disappear the trick is 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.530
 on how we're going to apply the spray and it's 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.310
 the following way we are going to put in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.310
 our hand 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.840
 we are slowly 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.660
 I'm looking at my nails and that's what 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.819
 remember that it is very important that 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.010
 your job interview take your 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.950
 hands in perfect condition a 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.590
 light colored enamel will never be seen 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.730
 badly very successful and enjoy this 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.730
