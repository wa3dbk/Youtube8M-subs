and you don't need to do that though so
what<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.990> papas<00:02:01.500> guys<00:02:01.740> and

what you do is you get to papas guys and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.380 
what you do is you get to papas guys and
you<00:02:02.130> attach<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.580> together<00:02:02.730> by<00:02:03.120> Crouch

you attach them together by Crouch

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
you attach them together by Crouch
placing<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.620> out<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> comparative<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
placing and get out and comparative and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.780 
placing and get out and comparative and
face<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.230> that<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.190> then

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
face out like this and that is it then

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.010 
face out like this and that is it then
you<00:02:08.880> get<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> block<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.540> choice<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.960> you

you get out the block of choice that you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.490 
you get out the block of choice that you
want<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> duplicate<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.520> boat<00:02:12.500> door

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
want to duplicate it can be a boat door

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.990 
want to duplicate it can be a boat door

sorry now you can see the competitive

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.470 
sorry now you can see the competitive
flash<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.100> go<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.550> compare<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.360> is

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
flash there we go I compare it is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.570 
flash there we go I compare it is
flashing<00:02:27.720> away<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:28.830> that's<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.220> guys<00:02:29.370> who

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
flashing away so now that's it guys who

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.420 
flashing away so now that's it guys who
step<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:30.209> never<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.110> said

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
step in and out never like I said

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.070 
step in and out never like I said
forever<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.850> takes<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.150> really<00:02:33.420> long<00:02:33.570> time<00:02:33.720> it's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
forever it takes a really long time it's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.170 
forever it takes a really long time it's
probably<00:02:34.320> not<00:02:34.500> worth<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.520> trouble<00:02:35.790> actually

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
probably not worth the trouble actually

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.020 
probably not worth the trouble actually
but<00:02:36.690> um<00:02:37.010> if<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.190> guys<00:02:38.400> are<00:02:38.580> clever<00:02:38.760> enough<00:02:38.850> you

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
but um if you guys are clever enough you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.910 
but um if you guys are clever enough you
could<00:02:39.300> probably<00:02:39.510> figure<00:02:39.870> out<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> system<00:02:40.560> where

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
could probably figure out a system where

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.949 
could probably figure out a system where
you<00:02:41.010> could<00:02:41.160> make<00:02:41.340> hundreds<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.060> them<00:02:42.270> and

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
you could make hundreds of them and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.600 
you could make hundreds of them and
every<00:02:43.410> time<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.010> out<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.160> another

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
every time you go in and out of another

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.040 
every time you go in and out of another
an<00:02:44.880> extra<00:02:45.240> block<00:02:45.420> could<00:02:45.600> be<00:02:45.690> popped<00:02:45.900> out

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
an extra block could be popped out

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.960 
an extra block could be popped out
through<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.320> hopper<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.890> dispenser<00:02:47.370> into<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
through a hopper and a dispenser into a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.360 
through a hopper and a dispenser into a
chess<00:02:48.240> which<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.260> grow<00:02:49.350> over<00:02:49.709> time<00:02:49.740> so

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
chess which can grow over time so

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.300 
chess which can grow over time so
there's<00:02:50.580> something<00:02:50.820> unlike<00:02:51.090> work<00:02:51.240> on<00:02:51.420> guys<00:02:52.310> so

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
there's something unlike work on guys so

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.500 
there's something unlike work on guys so
let's<00:02:53.459> go<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.820> out<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.910> few<00:02:54.120> times<00:02:54.270> I'll

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
let's go in and out a few times I'll

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.510 
let's go in and out a few times I'll
fast<00:02:54.720> for<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.080> I'll<00:02:55.140> show<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.290> guys<00:02:58.520> okay

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
fast for it and I'll show you guys okay

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.250 
fast for it and I'll show you guys okay
it<00:02:59.640> finally<00:03:00.000> worked<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.390> did<00:03:00.630> realize<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
it finally worked I did realize it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
it finally worked I did realize it
actually<00:03:01.410> works<00:03:01.860> there<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.400> go<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.670> too<00:03:02.910> now

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
actually works there we go this too now

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.509 
actually works there we go this too now
guys<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.690> found<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.560> glitch<00:03:04.860> actually<00:03:05.310> works

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
guys I found this glitch actually works

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.040 
guys I found this glitch actually works
a<00:03:05.670> lot<00:03:05.820> better<00:03:05.880> when<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.480> more<00:03:06.840> than<00:03:06.900> one

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
a lot better when you have more than one

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.170 
a lot better when you have more than one
friend<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.980> world<00:03:08.130> for<00:03:08.489> some<00:03:08.700> reason<00:03:09.060> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
friend in the world for some reason it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.630 
friend in the world for some reason it
has<00:03:09.360> something<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.959> do<00:03:10.110> with<00:03:10.260> lag<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.430> there's

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
has something to do with lag so there's

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.699 
has something to do with lag so there's
a<00:03:11.700> heads<00:03:12.269> up<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:12.600> there<00:03:12.780> guys<00:03:12.989> if<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.530> can

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
a heads up right there guys if you can

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.040 
a heads up right there guys if you can
lag<00:03:13.950> out<00:03:14.100> your<00:03:14.250> world<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.640> purpose<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.900> could

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
lag out your world on purpose you could

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.210 
lag out your world on purpose you could
probably<00:03:16.200> get<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.650> work<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.950> little<00:03:17.070> bit

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
probably get this to work a little bit

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.160 
probably get this to work a little bit
easier<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.570> there<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.750> go<00:03:18.780> that's<00:03:18.959> been

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
easier so there you go that's been

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.540 
easier so there you go that's been
difficult<00:03:19.290> I've<00:03:19.620> got<00:03:19.800> one<00:03:19.920> over<00:03:20.040> here<00:03:20.190> I've

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
difficult I've got one over here I've

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.890 
difficult I've got one over here I've
made<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> fuel<00:03:21.030> from<00:03:21.120> walls<00:03:21.390> waiting<00:03:21.660> because

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
made a fuel from walls waiting because

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.470 
made a fuel from walls waiting because
guys<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.560> does<00:03:22.769> take<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> very<00:03:23.430> long<00:03:23.489> time<00:03:23.880> but

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
guys this does take a very long time but

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150 
guys this does take a very long time but
anyway<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.110> duplication<00:03:25.769> glitch<00:03:25.800> and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
anyway that's the duplication glitch and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.850 
anyway that's the duplication glitch and
the<00:03:26.519> fuel<00:03:26.880> lava<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.080> sick<00:03:28.410> too<00:03:28.590> by<00:03:28.830> the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
the fuel lava that is sick too by the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.949 
the fuel lava that is sick too by the
way<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.100> guys<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:30.300> could<00:03:30.420> have<00:03:30.510> infinite

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
way you guys you could have infinite

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.780
