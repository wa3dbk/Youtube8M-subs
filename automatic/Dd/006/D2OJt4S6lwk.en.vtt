is<00:02:12.750> my<00:02:12.930> filter<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> replace<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.709> with<00:02:17.420> with<00:02:18.420> my

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
is my filter and replace it with with my

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:28.920 
is my filter and replace it with with my
new<00:02:18.780> one

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:41.080 

they<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:29.990> give<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.440> new<00:02:31.160> o-ring<00:02:39.490> so<00:02:40.490> if<00:02:40.850> this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
they do give you a new o-ring so if this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.720 
they do give you a new o-ring so if this
one's<00:02:41.300> cracked<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:43.130> might<00:02:43.310> want<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.550> replace

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
one's cracked you might want to replace

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.650 
one's cracked you might want to replace
it<00:02:45.520> looks<00:02:46.520> fine<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> me<00:02:49.210> some<00:02:50.210> people<00:02:50.240> would

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
it looks fine to me some people would

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.590 
it looks fine to me some people would
say<00:02:50.870> go<00:02:51.410> ahead<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.740> end<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.580> replace<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.300> but

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
say go ahead and end and replace it but

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:31.100 
say go ahead and end and replace it but
I<00:02:56.650> think<00:02:57.650> we'll<00:02:57.830> leave<00:02:58.040> it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.270 

and<00:03:32.110> we<00:03:32.320> don't<00:03:32.440> want<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.620> go<00:03:32.680> too<00:03:32.740> tight<00:03:33.100> with

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and we don't want to go too tight with

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.110 
and we don't want to go too tight with
it<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.560> that's<00:03:35.740> all<00:03:35.950> done<00:03:36.190> now<00:03:36.430> we<00:03:36.490> go<00:03:36.700> down<00:03:36.730> and

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
it so that's all done now we go down and

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.710 
it so that's all done now we go down and
we<00:03:37.540> can<00:03:37.690> check<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.110> see<00:03:38.400> our<00:03:39.400> oils<00:03:39.940> draining

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.840 

so<00:03:43.720> we<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:43.990> see<00:03:44.170> here<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:45.370> oil<00:03:45.580> is<00:03:45.700> just

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
so we can see here that the oil is just

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.790 
so we can see here that the oil is just
dripping<00:03:46.270> out<00:03:46.570> so<00:03:47.410> I'm<00:03:47.500> going<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.650> go<00:03:47.740> ahead

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
dripping out so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:47.800 --> 00:04:11.880 
dripping out so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:48.010> put<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.910> plug<00:03:49.120> back<00:03:49.150> in

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.500 

right<00:04:12.890> now<00:04:13.040> we're<00:04:13.129> going<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.280> go<00:04:13.400> up<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.790> put

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
right now we're going to go up and put

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.189 
right now we're going to go up and put
the<00:04:14.690> four<00:04:15.230> quarts<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.650> oil<00:04:15.799> in<00:04:19.510> put<00:04:20.510> my<00:04:20.540> four

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
the four quarts of oil in put my four

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.280 
the four quarts of oil in put my four
quarts<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.650> oil<00:04:21.829> in<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.330> five<00:04:23.570> gallon<00:04:23.810> jug

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
quarts of oil in and a five gallon jug

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:50.140 
quarts of oil in and a five gallon jug
so<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:26.030> make<00:04:26.180> sure<00:04:26.449> I'm<00:04:26.810> steady<00:04:27.680> with<00:04:27.830> my<00:04:27.979> hand

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.310 

then<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.450> should<00:04:51.600> do<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:51.810> I'll<00:04:51.900> try<00:04:52.140> that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:15.760 

check<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.530> oil

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.120
