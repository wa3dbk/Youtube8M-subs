00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:09.790
 Handmade bridge in KitaAsagawa of Hachioji river has created a swollen local residents in yesterday's typhoon No. 18 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.900
 It was washed away 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.100
 But there seems to be a complicated situation at the end 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.620
 It is report of Tsukagoshi reporter 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.780
 It is said that it has been passed down from the Edo period on the Kitter slope flowing in Hachioji city 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.770
 Beneath it takes small bridge named flow Bridge 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.770
 That yesterday 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.010
 I'm waiting 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.010
 Hmm 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.950
 There was 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 and t 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:53.070
 Usually, the water level is low and the flow is moderate, but one day after the typhoon passed 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:00.600
 I still feel a lot of water today and the flow is a little quicker 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.970
 And by saying that yesterday water has increased to this area, due to the rapid increase of water 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.230
 Here 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:12.460
 The bridge built by the residents has been washed away 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:19.260
 I am now because say buy one village sheets when there is a bridge here is a 2-minute multiplied by the sword a 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:22.060
 How to wait would do OmoteTakeshi Masaru tax increase today that there would be no chopsticks you come in with a color 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:28.890
 There is no hiding in my memory 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:34.620
 8 has been washed away every time the river has risen , and nearby residents have been restored 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:41.550
 On the other hand South Tama western construction office that manages the skin 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:46.980
 If you want to build a bridge on the battlefield, it is necessary to apply for a private use permission , and the bridge that has not been formalized 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:53.090
 We ask the residents for removal because they are not recognized 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:02:00.740
 It is residents of the Ohata district, north of the river, who use the flow bridge 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:04.250
 Immediately upstream have Ryo Kitaohashi it takes in, but toward the city, such as the east side of the 8-character station 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.759
 It has been used since ancient times to become a detour 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:16.470
 It is the habit of the residents to go through the flow bridge 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:19.590
 Residents have requested that they build a solid bridge in this area, but the city breaks the flow bridge paint north 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.769
 Ya that the distance between you there is only 400m 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.750
 At this stage, the rebuilding work of the Matsuebashi Bridge, which is about 2 km downstream, has not been completed. 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.480
 I do not think of building a new bridge 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.190
 You are good 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 But new while against the investigation and the whole city of road planning and traffic conditions in the vicinity of the future 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.950
 I would like to consider whether to make a bridge 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.360
 While the width of the flow bridge was riding a bicycle at about no one m 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:58.800
 To cross it and to you that are from time to time some people fall into the river 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.970
 However, there are not many residents who use this bridge in favor of convenience Hachioji City has a new bridge 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.190
 When it comes to 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:11.220
 In order to be a large bridge like the bridge north 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.220
 It is not possible to make a decision whether to construct or not to construct immediately as sufficient consideration is required.
