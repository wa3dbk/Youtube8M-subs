00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello good afternoon guys another exercise 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.600
 about arithmetic progressions in which 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.120
 they tell us that we calculate the sum of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.960
 all the numbers of two figures 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.050
 that are multiples of 3 good 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.599
 if it is a sum 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.829
 remember that the sum of the n terms 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.920
 of a progression was equal to a half 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.660
 of the first plus the last 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.520
 by the number of terms 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.320
 but good 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.760
 it happens that here they give us no data 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.070
 which is the first or which is the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.590
 last since it will have to be seen 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.390
 and they tell us that they are two figures first 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.390
 two digit number is 10 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.989
 on 11 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.490
 the 12 so on until the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.880
 last one is 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.070
 99 will have to find 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 those of the first numbers which is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.159
 multiple of 3 and of the last ones 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.149
 multiple of 3 so 10 is multiple 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.549
 of 3 not because 3 x 39 is not exact on 11 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.380
 either but 12 if it is a multiple of 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.380
 interista 12 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.600
 is a multiple of 3 because if the 12 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:34.819
 between 34 then 12 is ours to its 1 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.960
 first term of a number two 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.119
 multiples of 3 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.220
 we follow and we obviously give ourselves 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.290
 account to follow that 99 which is the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 last two digit number is also 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.240
 divisible by 3 is a multiple of 3 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.250
 is a multiple of 3 because 99 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.250
 between 3 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.680
 so our to his penis 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.119
 it will be equal to 99 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.000
 well we already have 2 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.420
 of the two unknowns we have two us 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.550
 it remains n as we calculate n good if 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 we know that the last number 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:28.380
 was his penis is well of the general term 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.870
 one more in one 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.379
 by d 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.360
 that we know we know about each other because if 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.720
 it has to be multiples of 3 means 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.710
 that will go three by three 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.720
 12 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.420
 the 15 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.770
 18 all are multiples of 3 then 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.770
 our d equals 3 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.120
 I 'm not going to calculate the number of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.099
 terms to replace it here 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.970
 how we do it as we know the last 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.970
 what is 99 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.530
 it will be the same as the first one we know 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.090
 also what is 12 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:16.040
 + n 1 and sample that is equal to 3 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.810
 99 12 if we pass this here 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.260
 99 - 12 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.260
 nine minus two are 79 minus 18 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.640
 87 is the same 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:43.500
 in -1 by three and this is 3 by n csn 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.830
 minus three and three colors minus three if 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.830
 this is negative I can pass it here 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.830
 adding up 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.240
 87 3 is the same 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.850
 to 13 n 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.850
 87 +3 how much is 90 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.530
 yes cleared n 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.160
 the 3 is multiplying the n will pass 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.160
 dividing 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.960
 90 between 3 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.960
 It does not matter 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.870
 3 for 39 to 30 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.870
 then we have 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.860
 30 terms 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.860
 I already have everything and I have almost 1 to its n 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:43.060
 and the n I can then calculate the sum 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:45.760
 that we were supporting that rise is the same 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.800
 to a medium 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.009
 d 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.590
 in turn how much is worth 112 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:05:01.050
 more to your penis how much is 99 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.050
 how much is n 30 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:10.319
 and this is 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.319
 s up is equal 30 between 215 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:23.300
 for 12 more 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:23.300
 99 12 99 are 12 109 111 true 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.730
 9 and 2 are 11 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.990
 do not forget it's 11 I'm 19 in 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:41.060
 medicine 11 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:45.170
 and 115 by 11 are 111 by 15 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.170
 112 for 15 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.720
 555 111 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.980
 56 61 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.980
 and our end result will be 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.639
 660 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.120
 and these are what add the 30 numbers 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.190
 multiples of 3 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.320
 in the series you have understood it truth 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.340
 it's easy considering sometimes 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:18.490
 they can confuse the statements but 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.380
 good if we had asked for numbers 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.010
 three figures 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.490
 multiples of 3 then we should start 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.490
 by 100 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.830
 the 101 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.830
 102 103 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.850
 104 and go see which are multiples of 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:46.420
 and I think 102 is 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:51.040
 because 102 between 3 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:53.260
 3 x 3 9 10 11 12 34 then this would be 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.200
 our first number and the last 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.460
 evident 20 is 999 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.560
 so centered do not be afraid 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.050
 Interesting things well and you will have to 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.720
 they come out easy with the two air formulas 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.760
 waths up 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.040
 they have to serve all the exercises 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.220
 Okay, guys, see you in the 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.220
 light
