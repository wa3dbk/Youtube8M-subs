00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 ah 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.140
 Speak there, guys, how are you? 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.100
 Who speaks, welcome. 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.110
 my channel 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.910
 This is my first video I bring. 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.800
 for you today a gameplay of call of 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.869
 duty black ops 2 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.489
 I'm not so well because it does little 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.660
 time I bought the game a little time 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.430
 What am I playing? 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.260
 however I am evolving according to the time 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.780
 It was happening and I'm posting more videos. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.149
 you will see my progress in the game 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.420
 today I will address a subject that 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.810
 many gamers do not know but it's one thing 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.160
 which interferes a lot in the gameplay 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.130
 especially games like this like 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.210
 call of duty black ops 2 that requires a lot 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.690
 which is the response time and the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.430
 input leg on monitors and tvs 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.369
 I'll explain the difference between 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.700
 the two and how they can interfere 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.130
 positively or negatively on your 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.840
 game and as I am no technical people 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.710
 I will not use too much language 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.540
 technical 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.520
 I'll use an easier language 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.920
 more accessible so that everyone can 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.539
 follow up let's go then 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.329
 First let's talk about the time of 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.390
 answer the response time it is 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.310
 informed in all the TV manuals and 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.049
 monitors you find out there 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.090
 unlike the slight input that we 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.179
 Let's wake up later then the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.969
 answer is the time when the tv set 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.179
 delay to make the image change 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.609
 to fit the image for example in the 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.829
 transition from a very clear image to 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.450
 me for a very dark image 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.270
 the pixel has to make a very 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.789
 then the response time is 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.600
 average the time when pixel does this 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.630
 change 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.100
 or there is a moving image 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 I can use as an example a race 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.729
 formula 1 sometimes has those 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.819
 cameras that stand still and the cars 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.369
 They pass very quickly the smaller 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.280
 the TV response time will show 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.530
 that image more accurately and without 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.080
 leave that effect that many call 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.830
 of ghost effect or the car 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.090
 He spent the pixels that were behind the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.490
 where the car passed 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.240
 sometimes it takes a while to get back in 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.310
 natural color or skin color 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.020
 it is in the color of the grass whatever the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.700
 image behind the car 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.580
 this is practically imperceptible for the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.860
 most people but we gamers are 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.440
 more demanding in relation to the image 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.460
 so many realize these minimums 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.560
 Details 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.560
 Now you must be wondering what 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.080
 that this involves the gameplay 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.600
 Good people, in fact, nothing is more to it. 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.210
 image quality, especially in 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.930
 games where you have very fast images 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.340
 sudden changes in color or brightness 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.600
 just that 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.510
 now the input leg this yes interferes 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.790
 much in gameplay and usually this 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.970
 data is not provided by manufacturers. 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.710
 of monitors and tvs is very difficult for you 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.440
 find you normally find 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.500
 these data in tests that are done by 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.240
 specialized sites and t-130 let's talk 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.490
 What is the input leg? 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.460
 lego input is the delay in which the 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.150
 monitors and TVs suffer to process the 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:31.500
 image and display it in full screen 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.330
 or your monitor receives an image 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.980
 your monitor or your TV receives a 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.770
 picture of your computer 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.590
 this image it must be processed to 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.890
 then shown on the screen 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.470
 This delay calls input leg. 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.110
 the delay of this processing normally 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.750
 tvs have a longer delay because tv 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.210
 has another type image treatment 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 gay office he these tvs that have 120 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.260
 hertz smoothness of movement smoothness 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.740
 edges that Eddie's Mutim and so 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.020
 go 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.670
 that is to give all of treatment in the 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.770
 image the image has to be processed 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.350
 to be launched on the screen and the 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.750
 monitors not monitors only receive the 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.780
 and the image is displayed on the screen. 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.630
 just as she came some have another one 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.549
 treatment but nothing too complex 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.590
 now what does this interfere in 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.170
 gameplay imagines that you are 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.030
 playing a game like this call of duty 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.370
 black ops 2 or any other game of 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.860
 first person shooter and you stay 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.530
 face to face with the enemy 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.500
 you are seeing it therefore he 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.629
 also seeing you if his monitor 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.590
 have a much better input leg than the 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.050
 your 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.250
 He'll see you first, the image of him. 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.780
 going to be processed first is going to be 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.610
 released on the first screen 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.599
 consequently it will have the first 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.610
 it then we are talking about some 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.740
 milliseconds may not seem like anything but 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.060
 in games that requires much reflexes 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.370
 fast 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.379
 that makes a difference that is why 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.969
 majority of people who 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:07.729
 computer in lcd and plasma led tvs 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:10.819
 especially those that have 128 240 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.919
 Hertz usually does not do well in this game. 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.960
 because you should even process image 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.779
 put those pictures to the most 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.659
 picture becomes smoother and this image is 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:22.610
 launched in screen the person is dead, nor 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.199
 saw what happened, it's natural, I 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.599
 I 'm not generalizing 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.669
 there are guys there that have almost 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.639
 about humans and even with this small 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.750
 delay that TVs have in relation to 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.000
 monitors 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.879
 they usually do well in the game but 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.900
 for most this does a lot 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.580
 difference 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.379
 Now, this truth, that I am. 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.969
 saying that most TV's 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.750
 in fact the vast majority of surfaces 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:50.419
 have a broader input than the voter is 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.159
 an almost absolute truth but not 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.120
 absolute has time monitor tyreke 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.139
 terrible and has tvs that have continuous gui 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.569
 very good 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.020
 now the opposite of what I said now 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:07.219
 It's also true some gamers usually 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:10.729
 connect video games on monitors and then they 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:15.469
 have a small advantage over those who 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:17.120
 usually play their consoles on tvs 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.060
 if you want you can even 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.969
 take a test to see if this is 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:27.589
 perceptible to you or not enough 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:29.930
 Turn on the computer on a TV and it worked badly 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:32.389
 if you make quick movements with the mouse 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.250
 and pay close attention to focus well 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.650
 in the context of the mouse 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.899
 there you go and turn the computer on 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.639
 monitor and does the same thing 

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:42.370
 you will realize that the response of the 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.390
 mouse on most monitors 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.240
 it will be faster 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.350
 and most TVs will have a 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.750
 small leg 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.510
 this light that you see with the pointer 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.970
 the mouse is reduced to all images 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.950
 which are displayed on tv 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.650
 so this is unfortunately people to see 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.570
 the input leg of the tv monitors you 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.680
 You do not have to do enough research for 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.960
 tests 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.910
 I hope this has helped you 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.370
 especially those that usually occur 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.920
 in this type of game can be by 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.300
 cause of your monitor and your tv and I 'm 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.280
 seeing that the time of the video is ending 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.350
 people, that 's it, I'm staying for 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.360
 here thank you very much for having attended 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.920
 to the video and hope this video has 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.240
 helped you 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.560
 any doubt can leave the 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.820
 comments that I'll try to answer 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.040
 to all 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.440
 If you liked the video, leave that 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.840
 I like the one who helps the hell out of 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.330
 dissemination and enroll in the channel to 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.220
 accompanying the evolution of the 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.990
 there are several pictures that I still want 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.190
 put into practice and I'm sure you 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.280
 they will like 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.760
 This is it we are well into the next 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.760
 and I went
