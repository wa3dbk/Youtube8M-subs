ahead versus gamut I don't know who
wants<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> take<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.010> first<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
wants to take it first one I think I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.890 
wants to take it first one I think I
will<00:00:22.340> first<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.640> think<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> men<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.420> pig

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
will first of all I think the men in pig

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.870 
will first of all I think the men in pig
face<00:00:25.109> went<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.800> our<00:00:25.949> favor<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.730> lot

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
face went in our favor like a lot

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
face went in our favor like a lot
because<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.510> had<00:00:27.720> everything<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.320> wanted<00:00:28.470> for

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
because we had everything we wanted for

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.160 
because we had everything we wanted for
the<00:00:29.010> game<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.670> got<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.000> short<00:00:30.840> ranged

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the game and they got like short ranged

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.680 
the game and they got like short ranged
champions<00:00:31.260> against<00:00:31.980> our<00:00:32.070> poke<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.520> stuff<00:00:32.820> but

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
champions against our poke and stuff but

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.830 
champions against our poke and stuff but
besides<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.850> like<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.690> they

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
besides that I think like the thing they

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
besides that I think like the thing they
had<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> best<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.860> bottling<00:00:38.219> matchup

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
had the best was the bottling matchup

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.889 
had the best was the bottling matchup
where<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.850> had<00:00:38.940> Greivis<00:00:39.270> again<00:00:39.420> jinx<00:00:39.750> they

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
where they had Greivis again jinx they

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.510 
where they had Greivis again jinx they
could<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.200> used<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.469> lot<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.340> some

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
could have used a lot but for some

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.340 
could have used a lot but for some
reason<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.910> swap<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> lane<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.660> they'll

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
reason they swap the lane and they'll

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.979 
reason they swap the lane and they'll
let<00:00:43.920> jinx<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> hyper<00:00:44.969> carry<00:00:45.270> free<00:00:45.570> farm<00:00:45.780> for

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
let jinx and hyper carry free farm for

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.330 
let jinx and hyper carry free farm for
the<00:00:46.050> rest<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> game<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the rest of the game I think that was a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.389 
the rest of the game I think that was a
huge<00:00:48.149> mistake<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.840> let<00:00:49.289> me<00:00:49.399> like

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
huge mistake from them that let me like

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.670 
huge mistake from them that let me like
be<00:00:50.690> more<00:00:51.690> useful<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> game<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.469> should

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
be more useful in the game that I should

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
be more useful in the game that I should
have<00:00:52.800> been<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.550> certainly<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> massive

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
have been that certainly was a massive

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.479 
have been that certainly was a massive
factor<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.260> game<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.829> live<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.250> in

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
factor in this game but we live up in

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.720 
factor in this game but we live up in
the<00:00:56.610> top<00:00:56.850> lane<00:00:57.059> galio<00:00:57.960> against<00:00:58.829> Alistair

that they had no no range I saw that it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.450 
that they had no no range I saw that it
was<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.380> big<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.890> true<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.000> star<00:01:18.960> now

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460

was out big it's true that I star now
analysis<00:01:20.460> i<00:01:20.580> would<00:01:20.729> counter<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.750> doesn't

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
analysis i would counter but it doesn't

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
analysis i would counter but it doesn't
matter<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.740> value<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.700> re<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.090> would<00:01:24.270> be

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
matter because a value is re we would be

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.320 
matter because a value is re we would be
with<00:01:24.750> dings<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.830> example<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.670> follow-up<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
with dings for example for follow-up I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
with dings for example for follow-up I
mean<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.689> q1<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.500> low<00:01:28.770> photo<00:01:29.340> photo<00:01:29.700> photo

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.980

with<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> e<00:01:30.650> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> movie<00:01:32.280> speed<00:01:32.579> bonus<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.960> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
with the e on the movie speed bonus so I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
with the e on the movie speed bonus so I
think<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.619> play<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:35.850> yeah

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
think that we play it really well yeah

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.060 
think that we play it really well yeah
because<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.110> obviously<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> pick<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because like obviously if you pick a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
because like obviously if you pick a
Gallio<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> first<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.150> about

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
Gallio the first thing you think about

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
Gallio the first thing you think about
is<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.930> ultimate<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.829> negated<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.729> for

pretty far ahead you said you think that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.040 
pretty far ahead you said you think that
was<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> big<00:03:30.269> mistake<00:03:30.420> from<00:03:30.690> him<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:30.989> past

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
was a big mistake from him in the past

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.810 
was a big mistake from him in the past
I've<00:03:31.380> also<00:03:31.560> heard<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.980> say<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.220> can't<00:03:32.700> remember

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
I've also heard you say I can't remember

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.520 
I've also heard you say I can't remember
which<00:03:33.000> game<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.330> was<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.110> felt<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
which game it was that you felt that the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.199 
which game it was that you felt that the
enemy<00:03:34.769> team<00:03:34.920> was<00:03:35.070> being<00:03:35.220> overconfident<00:03:35.760> when

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
enemy team was being overconfident when

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.060 
enemy team was being overconfident when
we're<00:03:36.360> playing<00:03:36.480> versus<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.709> feel<00:03:37.890> in

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
we're playing versus you do you feel in

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.860 
we're playing versus you do you feel in
general<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:38.610> something<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.090> teams<00:03:39.540> tend

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
general that's something that teams tend

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600 
general that's something that teams tend
to<00:03:40.050> do<00:03:40.200> when<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.620> definitely<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.400> something

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
to do when you definitely have something

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.660 
to do when you definitely have something
to<00:03:41.850> show<00:03:42.620> hmm<00:03:43.620> i<00:03:43.890> don't<00:03:44.670> know<00:03:44.790> maybe<00:03:44.940> they

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
to show hmm i don't know maybe they

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.130 
to show hmm i don't know maybe they
underestimate<00:03:47.670> us<00:03:48.060> as<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.299> team<00:03:48.390> many<00:03:48.959> times

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
underestimate us as a team many times

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.890 
underestimate us as a team many times
but<00:03:49.380> in<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.070> game<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.310> particular<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.760> think

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
but in this game in particular I think

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.050 
but in this game in particular I think
what<00:03:51.900> they<00:03:52.049> underestimated<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:53.060> galios

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
what they underestimated is galios

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.090 
what they underestimated is galios
ability<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> clear<00:03:54.989> wave<00:03:55.170> because<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.830> don't

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
ability to a clear wave because I don't

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.740 
ability to a clear wave because I don't
think<00:03:56.130> they<00:03:56.310> expected<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:56.940> so

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
think they expected it to be so

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.539 
think they expected it to be so
efficient<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:58.530> safe<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:58.950> they<00:03:59.130> link<00:03:59.340> up

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
efficient and so safe like they link up

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.550 
efficient and so safe like they link up
probably<00:04:00.299> thinking<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.660> dive<00:04:00.930> galia<00:04:01.350> or

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
probably thinking to dive galia or

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.100 
probably thinking to dive galia or
something<00:04:01.950> like<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.390> in<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> end<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.900> didn't

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
something like that in the end it didn't

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.930 
something like that in the end it didn't
work<00:04:04.200> for<00:04:04.230> them<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.650> think<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.489> broadens<00:04:05.760> what

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
work for them I think that broadens what

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.940 
work for them I think that broadens what
that<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.299> could<00:04:06.570> be<00:04:06.750> easy<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.350> buy<00:04:07.590> one<00:04:07.799> because

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
that I could be easy to buy one because

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.910 
that I could be easy to buy one because
I<00:04:08.220> have<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.670> secret<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.720> bit<00:04:10.019> wave<00:04:10.260> by<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.769> right

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
I have a secret a bit wave by the right

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.449 
I have a secret a bit wave by the right

did in a convincing game to take a step
back<00:04:23.550> away<00:04:23.729> from<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.150> game<00:04:24.360> will<00:04:24.620> we<00:04:25.620> spoken

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
for me in the game it's easy because I

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:37.219 
for me in the game it's easy because I
don't<00:04:35.340> think<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.639> there<00:04:35.879> is<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.930> don't

don't think that there is the I don't

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.839 
don't think that there is the I don't
see<00:04:37.289> that<00:04:37.379> you<00:04:37.500> have<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.770> know<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:37.919> lot<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.280> speak

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
see that you have to know a lot to speak

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.879 
see that you have to know a lot to speak
in<00:04:38.970> English<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.289> game<00:04:40.470> it's<00:04:40.710> true<00:04:41.069> that<00:04:41.270> on

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
in English in the game it's true that on

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.950 
in English in the game it's true that on
out<00:04:43.889> of<00:04:44.159> the<00:04:44.280> game<00:04:44.400> it's<00:04:44.639> harder<00:04:45.240> but<00:04:45.659> i<00:04:45.720> think

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
out of the game it's harder but i think

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.170 
out of the game it's harder but i think
it's<00:04:46.169> been<00:04:46.500> good<00:04:46.680> for<00:04:46.889> us<00:04:47.039> because<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.970> don't

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
it's been good for us because we don't

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.700 
it's been good for us because we don't
talk<00:04:48.419> about<00:04:48.659> anything<00:04:48.930> we<00:04:49.289> just<00:04:49.319> talk<00:04:49.680> about

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
talk about anything we just talk about

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.339 
talk about anything we just talk about
the<00:04:50.069> important<00:04:50.490> things<00:04:50.669> because<00:04:50.960> for<00:04:51.960> us<00:04:51.990> it's

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
the important things because for us it's

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.100 
the important things because for us it's
not<00:04:52.379> so<00:04:52.680> easy<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:53.039> talk<00:04:53.159> in<00:04:53.370> English<00:04:53.639> like

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
not so easy to talk in English like

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.629 
not so easy to talk in English like
stupid<00:04:55.110> things<00:04:55.409> so<00:04:55.590> then<00:04:55.830> we<00:04:56.039> just<00:04:56.430> ate<00:04:56.610> a

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
stupid things so then we just ate a

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.240 
stupid things so then we just ate a
portal<00:04:57.180> now<00:04:57.330> it's<00:04:58.050> even<00:04:58.199> better<00:04:58.590> what<00:04:59.159> about

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
portal now it's even better what about

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.279 
portal now it's even better what about
the<00:04:59.490> team<00:04:59.669> building<00:05:00.090> though<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.479> then<00:05:00.900> the

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
the team building though and then the
