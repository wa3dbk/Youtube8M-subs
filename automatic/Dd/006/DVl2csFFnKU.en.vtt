about<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> mechanics<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> game<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:34.170> think

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
about the mechanics of the game I think

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.430 
about the mechanics of the game I think
the<00:00:34.500> mechanics<00:00:35.120> it's<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.450> good<00:00:36.750> i'm<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the mechanics it's pretty good i'm the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.920 
the mechanics it's pretty good i'm the
pet<00:00:37.920> when<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> say<00:00:38.850> mechanics<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.660> mean

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pet when I say mechanics I mean

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.030 
pet when I say mechanics I mean
movements<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.600> actual<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.469> way<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> gain

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
movements and the actual the way to gain

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840 
movements and the actual the way to gain
looks<00:00:45.110> some<00:00:46.110> people<00:00:46.500> run<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.520> shit

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
looks some people run like they got shit

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
looks some people run like they got shit
in<00:00:47.879> their<00:00:48.090> pants<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.680> got<00:00:49.860> their

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
in their pants when when they got their

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.600 
in their pants when when they got their
night<00:00:50.309> file<00:00:50.610> stuff<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:52.489> think<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
night file stuff like that but think the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.979 
night file stuff like that but think the
movements<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> game<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.079> pretty<00:00:55.350> good<00:00:56.989> but

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
movements of the game is pretty good but

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
movements of the game is pretty good but
like<00:00:58.230> I've<00:00:58.410> been<00:00:58.559> saying<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.820> game

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
like I've been saying I think the game

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.190 
like I've been saying I think the game
is<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:01.109> too<00:01:01.350> fast<00:01:03.080> for<00:01:04.080> peer-to-peer<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
is a little too fast for peer-to-peer I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.789 
is a little too fast for peer-to-peer I

close like that I think there should be
wait<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.450> respawn<00:02:14.640> until<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.670> leave<00:02:17.280> hmm<00:02:18.280> think

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
wait to respawn until I leave hmm think

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.500 
wait to respawn until I leave hmm think
