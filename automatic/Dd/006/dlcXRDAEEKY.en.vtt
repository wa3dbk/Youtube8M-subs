14 15 but since this dice tonight has 12
numbers<00:01:05.740> 13<00:01:06.160> 14<00:01:06.460> 15<00:01:06.610> can't<00:01:07.030> be<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.840> can't<00:01:07.870> roll

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
numbers 13 14 15 can't be you can't roll

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.260 
numbers 13 14 15 can't be you can't roll
that<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.980> what<00:01:09.160> I'll<00:01:09.280> do<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.460> if<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:09.910> bet<00:01:10.150> the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
that so what I'll do is if I bet the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.870 
that so what I'll do is if I bet the
first<00:01:10.510> at<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.810> dice<00:01:10.990> rolls<00:01:11.290> 1<00:01:11.530> 2<00:01:11.770> or<00:01:11.980> 3<00:01:12.369> i'll

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
first at the dice rolls 1 2 or 3 i'll

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.910 
first at the dice rolls 1 2 or 3 i'll
roll<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> dice<00:01:13.390> again<00:01:13.420> if<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.050> adds<00:01:14.229> up<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.440> 13

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
roll the dice again if it adds up to 13

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.280 
roll the dice again if it adds up to 13
14<00:01:15.310> 15<00:01:15.550> won't<00:01:16.060> be<00:01:16.150> one<00:01:16.270> of<00:01:16.390> those<00:01:16.479> three<00:01:16.720> if<00:01:17.020> not

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
14 15 won't be one of those three if not

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.620 
14 15 won't be one of those three if not
it<00:01:17.860> adds<00:01:18.100> up<00:01:18.220> anything<00:01:18.460> but<00:01:18.729> 13<00:01:19.119> 14<00:01:19.420> or<00:01:19.540> 15

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
it adds up anything but 13 14 or 15

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.960 
it adds up anything but 13 14 or 15
we'll<00:01:20.020> go<00:01:20.110> back<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.650> two<00:01:20.800> or<00:01:20.950> three<00:01:21.160> so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
we'll go back to one two or three so

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.130 
we'll go back to one two or three so
here<00:01:22.119> we<00:01:22.150> go<00:01:22.240> but<00:01:22.510> if<00:01:22.600> it's<00:01:22.690> not<00:01:22.810> one<00:01:22.930> two<00:01:23.050> or

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
here we go but if it's not one two or

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.350 
here we go but if it's not one two or
three<00:01:23.320> it<00:01:23.380> doesn't<00:01:23.619> matter<00:01:23.740> anyway<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:25.270> we

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
three it doesn't matter anyway here we

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.000 
three it doesn't matter anyway here we
go<00:01:27.300> five<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:29.140> once<00:01:29.350> that's<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.680> bottom<00:01:29.979> line

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
go five so once that's the bottom line

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.410 
go five so once that's the bottom line
on<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.280> left-hand<00:01:30.580> side<00:01:30.760> now<00:01:31.090> let's<00:01:31.270> make

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
on the left-hand side now let's make

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
on the left-hand side now let's make
sure<00:01:31.479> it's<00:01:31.720> even<00:01:32.110> if<00:01:32.500> not<00:01:33.060> rolling<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.210> again

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
sure it's even if not rolling in again

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.520 
sure it's even if not rolling in again
nope<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.130> was<00:01:36.280> 23<00:01:37.050> no<00:01:38.050> you<00:01:38.200> can<00:01:38.290> move<00:01:38.410> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
nope that was 23 no you can move the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.830 
nope that was 23 no you can move the
head<00:01:38.680> right<00:01:38.920> now<00:01:38.950> there's<00:01:39.250> only<00:01:39.310> 14<00:01:39.790> boxes<00:01:40.000> so

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
head right now there's only 14 boxes so

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.480 
head right now there's only 14 boxes so
now<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.110> has<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.290> roll<00:01:41.530> one<00:01:41.740> or<00:01:41.890> two<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.250> get<00:01:42.369> the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
now it has to roll one or two to get the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.000 
now it has to roll one or two to get the
second<00:01:42.820> rule<00:01:44.340> now<00:01:45.340> it's<00:01:45.520> one<00:01:45.670> two<00:01:45.760> three<00:01:45.940> four

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
second rule now it's one two three four

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.780 
second rule now it's one two three four
actually<00:01:48.010> we're<00:01:48.100> going<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.280> move<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.730> over

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
actually we're going to move it over

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.500 
actually we're going to move it over
once<00:01:49.060> now<00:01:49.270> it's<00:01:49.360> 1<00:01:49.480> 2<00:01:49.510> 3<00:01:49.630> 4<00:01:49.990> 5<00:01:50.440> 6<00:01:50.920> 7<00:01:51.070> 8<00:01:51.250> 9<00:01:51.280> 10<00:01:51.700> 11<00:01:52.120> 12

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
once now it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.220 
once now it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13<00:01:52.540> 14<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:54.040> we<00:01:54.130> go<00:01:56.220> three<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.730> one<00:01:58.720> two<00:01:58.930> three

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
13 14 here we go three so one two three
