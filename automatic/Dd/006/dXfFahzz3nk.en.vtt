00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
correct age size because they're going

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.429 
correct age size because they're going
to<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> cage<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.280> most<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> day<00:01:12.439> so

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to be in the cage for most of the day so

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.929 
to be in the cage for most of the day so
you<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.100> need<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.549> sure<00:01:14.760> that's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you just really need to make sure that's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.240 
you just really need to make sure that's
the<00:01:15.689> correct<00:01:16.140> size<00:01:18.680> another<00:01:19.680> thing<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.130> can

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the correct size another thing you can

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
the correct size another thing you can
do<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.210> upper<00:01:21.600> levels<00:01:22.159> like<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
do is to have upper levels like if you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.810 
do is to have upper levels like if you
had<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> hutch<00:01:25.320> then<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.280> good<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.700> with

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
had a hutch then are we good to get with

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660 
had a hutch then are we good to get with
up<00:01:27.060> enough<00:01:27.360> upper<00:01:27.840> level<00:01:28.280> even<00:01:29.280> though<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
up enough upper level even though in the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700 
up enough upper level even though in the
older<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.119> struggle<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.530> had<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
older they can struggle and if you had a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
older they can struggle and if you had a
CNC<00:01:32.280> code<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.850> thicken<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.420> level

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
CNC code you could thicken up a level

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
CNC code you could thicken up a level
this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.470> good<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.310> run<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this is good because they can run up and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.780 
this is good because they can run up and
down<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> ramp<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.250> second

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
down the ramp and if you have a second

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.370 
down the ramp and if you have a second
level<00:01:38.909> another<00:01:39.509> benefit<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> can

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
level another benefit is that you can

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
level another benefit is that you can
make<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.610> into<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> kitchen<00:01:42.390> area<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
make it into a kitchen area so the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.840 
make it into a kitchen area so the
bigger<00:01:43.799> bottom<00:01:44.700> level<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.899> act<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.950> big

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
bigger bottom level can act as a big

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.380 
bigger bottom level can act as a big
that<00:01:48.270> cos<00:01:48.479> Phi<00:01:48.689> /<00:01:49.049> play<00:01:49.350> area<00:01:50.000> I'm<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.210> going

that cos Phi / play area I'm now going

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.940 
that cos Phi / play area I'm now going
to<00:01:51.509> talk<00:01:51.659> about<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> do's<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.680> try<00:01:52.890> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
time and this is when you put them in a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.660 
time and this is when you put them in a
