00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 I got a hard rod on 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.960
 currently tough design 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.210
 but I still strengthen this construction with me 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.790
 again in hand or somewhere with you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.570
 any available means in this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.330
 coin case i'm pasting them in between 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.980
 fingers and I get a design 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.980
 it turned out to be brass knuckles 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.750
 hand touches no prints 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 no fingers and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 by this improvised brass knuckles we 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 hit the zones and points 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.020
 active lesion we can beat so we 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.149
 can so beat further we threw away 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:52.910
 we have a coin newspaper according to 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:58.079
 physics every subject has its mass 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 has its own configuration and properties 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.470
 subject according to this 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:12.979
 any subject it can be or heavy 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.979
 or light item it can be 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:23.990
 flat object it can be convex 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:30.190
 he has his configuration has his 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.750
 diameter and properties of this item 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.110
 help you use it in melee 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.369
 the battle 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.930
 In addition, it is important to know that the application 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.369
 melee combat items 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.330
 The fixtures means are subdivided into 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:52.039
 self defense weapon 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 attack weapon when applied to 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:01.009
 as a weapon of attack we are subject 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.960
 use as improvised weapon 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:08.119
 and use the application distance 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.600
 a distance of six ten steps is 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.459
 distance by which we fly 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:24.470
 object throwing stones 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:30.410
 shelf ax sharpening any object 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:37.190
 household use of the same plug if 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:42.500
 we throw a stone or throw objects we throw 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:46.640
 tableware a plate or 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:51.049
 darting horizontally from 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.989
 hips I throw out or throw in the face or 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.470
 I throw in the legs of the oncoming or in any 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:02.390
 some other part or vertical 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.959
 the plane then rushes from the ear gone 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.959
 attack 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.540
 This section is throwing cold weapons 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.000
 throwing knives throwing sharpening when we 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.010
 by balancing the subject identified 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.739
 center of mass and throw 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.630
 or throw back grip at a distance 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:39.300
 5 6 steps and this item makes the floor 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.430
 turnover and stuck or whale with near 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.519
 distance from close range is 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.400
 three to four steps accordingly 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.410
 we use that sharp object or 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.350
 dumb thing 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.480
 if the subject is a blunt heavy object we 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.440
 hit with it 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.060
 like a blunt object at a distance if 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.060
 the subject of sharp that
