I<00:01:31.009> just<00:01:31.159> put<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.430> here<00:01:31.580> for<00:01:31.909> a<00:01:31.939> second<00:01:32.299> this

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
I just put it here for a second this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.730 
I just put it here for a second this
particular<00:01:32.810> scene<00:01:33.140> isn't<00:01:33.380> necessarily

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
particular scene isn't necessarily

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.109 
particular scene isn't necessarily
relevant<00:01:33.890> it's<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.280> fact<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.820> want<00:01:35.060> to

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
relevant it's the fact that I want to

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.730 
relevant it's the fact that I want to
talk<00:01:35.210> about<00:01:35.270> stuff<00:01:35.540> we've<00:01:35.690> seen<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.080> far<00:01:36.110> now

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
talk about stuff we've seen so far now

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.050 
talk about stuff we've seen so far now
right<00:01:36.920> now<00:01:37.040> we've<00:01:37.190> seen<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.400> lots<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.880> new

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
right now we've seen a lots of new

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.430 
right now we've seen a lots of new
environments<00:01:38.600> as<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.810> remember<00:01:39.140> if<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.320> look

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
environments as you remember if you look

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.980 
environments as you remember if you look
back<00:01:39.560> at<00:01:39.710> say<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.950> 2013<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.850> 2014<00:01:41.360> gameplay

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
back at say the 2013 and 2014 gameplay

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.539 
back at say the 2013 and 2014 gameplay
trailers<00:01:42.320> we<00:01:42.890> saw<00:01:43.009> some<00:01:43.040> very<00:01:43.340> similar

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
trailers we saw some very similar

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.620 
trailers we saw some very similar
environments<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.149> what<00:01:44.270> not<00:01:44.390> but<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:44.570> is

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
environments of what not but this is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.870 
environments of what not but this is
clearly<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.049> very<00:01:45.470> new<00:01:45.830> setting<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:46.490> we<00:01:46.580> do<00:01:46.729> know

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
clearly a very new setting so we do know

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.270 
clearly a very new setting so we do know
that<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.210> division<00:01:47.539> has<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.720> very<00:01:48.080> vast<00:01:48.500> map<00:01:48.830> so

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
that the division has a very vast map so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.469 
that the division has a very vast map so
this<00:01:49.369> clearly<00:01:49.460> goes<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.850> show<00:01:50.030> some<00:01:50.330> new

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
this clearly goes to show some new

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.320 
this clearly goes to show some new
locations<00:01:50.930> we've<00:01:51.080> never<00:01:51.289> seen<00:01:51.530> before<00:01:52.090> one<00:01:53.090> by

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
locations we've never seen before one by

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.300 
locations we've never seen before one by
one<00:01:53.360> we<00:01:53.960> began<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.440> fuck<00:01:54.680> this<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:54.920> here<00:01:55.130> for

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
one we began to fuck this one here for

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.499 
one we began to fuck this one here for
example<00:01:55.369> where<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:55.880> see<00:01:56.060> what<00:01:56.240> looks<00:01:56.390> like

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
example where you see what looks like

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.940 
example where you see what looks like
the<00:01:56.810> agents<00:01:57.200> or<00:01:57.289> at<00:01:57.350> least<00:01:57.470> one<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.649> them<00:01:57.800> looks

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
the agents or at least one of them looks

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649 
the agents or at least one of them looks
like<00:01:58.069> an<00:01:58.159> agent<00:01:58.429> inside<00:01:58.909> what<00:01:59.479> I<00:01:59.509> would

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
like an agent inside what I would

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.059 
like an agent inside what I would
imagine<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.229> some<00:02:00.440> sort<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:00.649> like<00:02:00.770> sports

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
imagine is some sort of like sports

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.109 
imagine is some sort of like sports
arena<00:02:01.399> but<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:01.550> was<00:02:01.670> obviously<00:02:01.909> looking

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
arena but I was obviously looking

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.520 
arena but I was obviously looking
extremely<00:02:02.330> cold<00:02:02.750> maybe<00:02:03.050> it's<00:02:03.200> like<00:02:03.259> an<00:02:03.380> ice

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
extremely cold maybe it's like an ice

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.169 
extremely cold maybe it's like an ice
rink<00:02:03.770> or<00:02:04.009> something<00:02:04.280> like<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.399> it's

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
rink or something like that it's

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:06.249 
rink or something like that it's
obviously<00:02:05.420> been<00:02:05.569> turned<00:02:05.720> into<00:02:05.899> either<00:02:06.110> a

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
obviously been turned into either a

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.020 
obviously been turned into either a
storage<00:02:06.590> warehouse<00:02:06.979> or<00:02:07.460> potentially<00:02:07.880> some

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
storage warehouse or potentially some

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.400 
storage warehouse or potentially some
sort<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:08.239> stronghold<00:02:08.690> for<00:02:08.899> maybe<00:02:09.110> one<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
sort of stronghold for maybe one of the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.930 
sort of stronghold for maybe one of the
factions<00:02:09.619> by<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.160> way<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.369> imagine<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.789> will

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
factions by the way I imagine this will

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.190 
factions by the way I imagine this will
play<00:02:11.060> out<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.300> what<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.420> story<00:02:11.720> misinform

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
play out and what a story misinform

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.130 
play out and what a story misinform
people<00:02:13.390> started<00:02:14.390> winner<00:02:14.600> moves<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.959> next

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
people started winner moves the next

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.600 
people started winner moves the next
section<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.769> clearly<00:02:15.860> see<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.400> is

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
section and you can clearly see this is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.699 
section and you can clearly see this is
a<00:02:16.640> shopping<00:02:17.030> district<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.510> fire<00:02:17.870> clearly<00:02:18.590> see

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
a shopping district on fire clearly see

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.809 
a shopping district on fire clearly see
it's<00:02:18.799> obviously<00:02:19.040> got<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.190> Christmas<00:02:19.430> setting

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
it's obviously got the Christmas setting

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.039 
it's obviously got the Christmas setting
cuz<00:02:19.940> you've<00:02:20.030> got<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.180> balls<00:02:20.510> hanging<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.959> all

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
cuz you've got the balls hanging and all

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.390 
cuz you've got the balls hanging and all
the<00:02:21.140> lights<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.560> do<00:02:21.709> know<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.069> division

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the lights we do know that the division

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.280 
the lights we do know that the division
is<00:02:22.580> set<00:02:22.790> during<00:02:23.090> Christmas<00:02:23.510> time<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.840> this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
is set during Christmas time and this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.660 
is set during Christmas time and this
obviously<00:02:24.590> again<00:02:24.830> goes<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.160> illustrate<00:02:25.489> not

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
obviously again goes to illustrate not

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.030 
obviously again goes to illustrate not
only<00:02:25.850> new<00:02:26.000> locations<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.959> also<00:02:27.140> interiors<00:02:27.890> of

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
only new locations but also interiors of

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.080 
only new locations but also interiors of
different<00:02:28.310> locations<00:02:28.670> as<00:02:28.730> well<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.970> mean

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
different locations as well I mean

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.160 
different locations as well I mean
obviously<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.450> goes<00:02:29.540> without<00:02:29.780> saying<00:02:29.840> we'll

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
obviously it goes without saying we'll

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.750 
obviously it goes without saying we'll
be<00:02:30.260> going<00:02:30.440> inside<00:02:30.650> buildings<00:02:31.010> it's<00:02:31.489> just<00:02:31.640> nice

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
be going inside buildings it's just nice

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.069 
be going inside buildings it's just nice
to<00:02:31.790> kind<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.090> get<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.420> look<00:02:32.600> at<00:02:32.750> some<00:02:32.900> different

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
to kind of get a look at some different

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.400 
to kind of get a look at some different
season<00:02:33.530> or<00:02:33.650> did<00:02:33.829> tearing<00:02:34.250> each<00:02:34.430> other<00:02:34.700> apart

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
season or did tearing each other apart

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.509 
season or did tearing each other apart
now<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.560> right<00:02:36.739> here<00:02:36.799> if<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:37.100> pause<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.400> for<00:02:37.430> a

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
now this right here if we pause it for a

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.069 
now this right here if we pause it for a
second<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.209> looks<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:38.630> one<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.989> the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
second this looks like one of the

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.210 
second this looks like one of the
cleaners<00:02:39.380> however<00:02:39.709> there<00:02:39.829> is<00:02:39.920> something<00:02:40.190> very

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
cleaners however there is something very

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.440 
cleaners however there is something very
interesting<00:02:40.579> pertaining<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.239> factions

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
interesting pertaining to the factions

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.150 
interesting pertaining to the factions
which<00:02:42.049> I'll<00:02:42.170> talk<00:02:42.260> about<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:42.859> bit<00:02:43.010> more

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
which I'll talk about a little bit more

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.099 
which I'll talk about a little bit more
in<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.430> trailer<00:02:43.670> in<00:02:43.850> just<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.060> second<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:44.540> for

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
in the trailer in just a second but for

sticky mine or something of that vein

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.590 
sticky mine or something of that vein

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
basically she fires off his gun and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.210 
basically she fires off his gun and
sticks<00:04:06.810> on<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.050> enemy<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.500> then<00:04:07.650> explodes

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
sticks on the enemy and then explodes

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.520 
sticks on the enemy and then explodes
pretty<00:04:08.940> damn<00:04:09.240> cool<00:04:09.510> my<00:04:09.720> legs<00:04:09.959> we<00:04:10.260> led<00:04:12.530> then

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
pretty damn cool my legs we led then

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.660 
pretty damn cool my legs we led then
again<00:04:13.620> here<00:04:13.950> we<00:04:13.980> get<00:04:14.190> another<00:04:14.310> look<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.610> a

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
again here we get another look at a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.250 
again here we get another look at a
different<00:04:15.150> agent<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.780> i<00:04:15.840> think<00:04:16.019> this<00:04:16.080> is<00:04:16.140> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
different agent and i think this is the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.240 
different agent and i think this is the
thing<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.620> trailer<00:04:16.830> is<00:04:16.950> trying<00:04:17.160> to

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
thing the trailer is trying to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.530 
thing the trailer is trying to
illustrate<00:04:17.340> i<00:04:17.700> think<00:04:17.940> at<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.150> point<00:04:18.239> we're

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
illustrate i think at this point we're

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.000 
illustrate i think at this point we're
actually<00:04:18.690> starting<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.140> get<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.380> see<00:04:19.560> some

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
actually starting to get to see some

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.380 
actually starting to get to see some
player<00:04:20.250> variation<00:04:20.850> we<00:04:21.030> saw<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> female

character there and then we get to see a
black<00:04:23.220> agent<00:04:23.580> now<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.970> little<00:04:24.690> bit<00:04:24.780> later

you remember the typically the agent new
players<00:04:58.569> always<00:04:59.020> tended<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.620> have<00:04:59.710> say<00:04:59.919> like<00:05:00.069> a

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
players always tended to have say like a

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.439 
players always tended to have say like a
recurring<00:05:00.490> theme<00:05:00.699> or<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:00.970> current<00:05:01.180> kind<00:05:01.389> of

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
recurring theme or a current kind of

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.149 
recurring theme or a current kind of
appearance<00:05:01.720> but<00:05:02.349> in<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.530> one<00:05:02.590> he's<00:05:02.949> clearly

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
appearance but in this one he's clearly

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.950 
appearance but in this one he's clearly
got<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.370> beard<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.729> much<00:05:03.879> thicker<00:05:04.150> beard<00:05:04.449> and<00:05:04.659> his

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
got a beard a much thicker beard and his

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.270 
got a beard a much thicker beard and his
face<00:05:05.199> structure<00:05:05.440> looks<00:05:05.740> slightly<00:05:05.919> different

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
face structure looks slightly different

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.350 
face structure looks slightly different
he's<00:05:06.430> kind<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.610> got<00:05:06.759> that<00:05:06.849> sort<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.060> max<00:05:07.270> payne

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
he's kind of got that sort of max payne

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.689 
he's kind of got that sort of max payne
look<00:05:07.629> to<00:05:07.720> him<00:05:07.840> but<00:05:08.349> anyway<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.889> point<00:05:09.009> is<00:05:09.190> he

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
look to him but anyway the point is he

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.399 
look to him but anyway the point is he
is<00:05:09.849> clearly<00:05:10.090> different<00:05:10.389> again<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.229> right<00:05:11.379> now

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
is clearly different again so right now

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.899 
is clearly different again so right now
in<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.740> trailer<00:05:11.979> we've<00:05:12.099> already<00:05:12.280> seen<00:05:12.550> three

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
in the trailer we've already seen three

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.700 
in the trailer we've already seen three
distinctly<00:05:13.569> different<00:05:13.599> agents<00:05:14.169> all<00:05:14.349> of<00:05:14.560> whom

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
distinctly different agents all of whom

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.020 
distinctly different agents all of whom
are<00:05:14.860> being<00:05:15.069> taken<00:05:15.220> control<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.580> in<00:05:15.849> that

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
are being taken control of in that

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.670 
are being taken control of in that
particular<00:05:16.180> scene<00:05:16.599> so<00:05:17.169> obviously<00:05:17.409> this<00:05:17.500> goes

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
particular scene so obviously this goes

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.930 
particular scene so obviously this goes
to<00:05:17.800> illustrate<00:05:18.159> some<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.639> different

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
to illustrate some of the different

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.820 
to illustrate some of the different
character<00:05:19.240> customization<00:05:19.539> options<00:05:20.199> you<00:05:20.710> may

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
character customization options you may

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.499 
character customization options you may
remember<00:05:21.009> just<00:05:21.400> before<00:05:21.490> e3<00:05:21.789> in<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.180> community

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509

QA<00:05:22.719> we<00:05:23.229> got<00:05:23.379> a<00:05:23.409> quick<00:05:23.590> look<00:05:23.770> at<00:05:23.949> how<00:05:24.069> some<00:05:24.250> of

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
QA we got a quick look at how some of

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.740 
QA we got a quick look at how some of
the<00:05:24.400> actual<00:05:24.610> clothing<00:05:24.849> customization<00:05:25.539> works

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
the actual clothing customization works

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.659 
the actual clothing customization works
in<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.050> use<00:05:26.199> of<00:05:26.229> like<00:05:26.530> layered<00:05:26.800> system<00:05:27.039> but

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
in the use of like layered system but

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.520 
in the use of like layered system but
now<00:05:27.819> we<00:05:28.180> start<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.479> get<00:05:28.569> to<00:05:28.690> see<00:05:28.870> what<00:05:29.349> some<00:05:29.500> of

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
now we start to get to see what some of

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.020 
now we start to get to see what some of
the<00:05:29.650> actual<00:05:29.889> character<00:05:30.310> customization<00:05:30.639> will

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
the actual character customization will

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.350 
the actual character customization will
look<00:05:31.150> like<00:05:33.000> we<00:05:34.000> are<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.560> division<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:37.180> in

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
look like we are the division and in

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.610 
look like we are the division and in
here<00:05:37.509> we<00:05:37.569> see<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.900> three<00:05:38.080> agents<00:05:38.379> come

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
here we see the three agents come

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.869 
here we see the three agents come
together<00:05:38.919> all<00:05:39.310> of<00:05:39.520> whom<00:05:39.669> we've<00:05:39.789> obviously

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
together all of whom we've obviously

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.219 
together all of whom we've obviously
seen<00:05:40.090> in<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.690> trailer<00:05:40.900> but<00:05:41.110> they're

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
seen in the trailer but they're

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.480 
seen in the trailer but they're
obviously<00:05:41.440> now<00:05:41.590> assembling<00:05:42.099> as<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.430> team<00:05:44.490> we

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
obviously now assembling as a team we

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.820 
obviously now assembling as a team we
don't<00:05:45.639> know<00:05:45.729> how<00:05:45.879> many<00:05:45.940> of<00:05:46.150> us<00:05:46.270> there<00:05:46.330> are

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
don't know how many of us there are

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.260 
don't know how many of us there are
next<00:05:48.830> up<00:05:48.980> this<00:05:49.400> this<00:05:49.790> is<00:05:49.970> pretty<00:05:50.120> interesting

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
next up this this is pretty interesting

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.490 
next up this this is pretty interesting
if<00:05:50.780> you<00:05:50.870> remember<00:05:51.080> at<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:51.200> beginning<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.440> a

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
if you remember at the beginning of a

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.050 
if you remember at the beginning of a
trailer<00:05:51.740> we<00:05:51.890> saw<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.130> cleaners<00:05:52.520> however<00:05:52.850> we

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
trailer we saw the cleaners however we

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.670 
trailer we saw the cleaners however we
do<00:05:53.210> know<00:05:53.390> that<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:53.840> division<00:05:54.140> will<00:05:54.470> feature

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
do know that the division will feature

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.070 
do know that the division will feature
multiple<00:05:55.130> different<00:05:55.700> factions<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:56.570> this

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
multiple different factions and this

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.810 
multiple different factions and this
right<00:05:57.410> here<00:05:57.440> I<00:05:57.770> would<00:05:57.980> imagine<00:05:58.220> obviously<00:05:58.790> I

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
right here I would imagine obviously I

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.160 
right here I would imagine obviously I
don't<00:05:58.940> have<00:05:59.090> any<00:05:59.210> confirmation<00:05:59.420> just<00:05:59.810> yet<00:05:59.960> but

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
don't have any confirmation just yet but

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.900 
don't have any confirmation just yet but
I<00:06:00.260> would<00:06:00.380> imagine<00:06:00.470> this<00:06:01.100> is<00:06:01.250> another<00:06:01.550> faction

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
I would imagine this is another faction

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.370 
I would imagine this is another faction
they<00:06:02.270> look<00:06:02.390> distinctly<00:06:02.810> different<00:06:03.050> to<00:06:03.320> the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
they look distinctly different to the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.840 
they look distinctly different to the
cleaners<00:06:03.590> they've<00:06:04.220> got<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> lot<00:06:04.460> more<00:06:04.520> sort<00:06:04.820> of

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
cleaners they've got a lot more sort of

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.460 
cleaners they've got a lot more sort of
body<00:06:05.030> armor<00:06:05.210> but<00:06:05.720> they've<00:06:05.840> also<00:06:05.990> got<00:06:06.230> orange

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
body armor but they've also got orange

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.320 
body armor but they've also got orange
trousers<00:06:06.860> and<00:06:07.040> orange<00:06:07.220> jumpsuits<00:06:07.700> so<00:06:08.210> it

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
trousers and orange jumpsuits so it

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.580 
trousers and orange jumpsuits so it
could<00:06:08.510> well<00:06:08.660> indicate<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.080> they<00:06:09.260> are<00:06:09.290> maybe

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
could well indicate that they are maybe

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.080 
could well indicate that they are maybe
say<00:06:09.830> prison<00:06:10.040> inmates<00:06:10.430> that<00:06:10.520> broke<00:06:10.760> out<00:06:10.880> and

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
say prison inmates that broke out and

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.950 
say prison inmates that broke out and
I've<00:06:11.150> sort<00:06:11.330> of<00:06:11.390> form<00:06:11.600> their<00:06:11.720> own<00:06:11.750> like

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
I've sort of form their own like

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.450 
I've sort of form their own like
alliance<00:06:12.320> or<00:06:12.440> whatnot<00:06:12.650> but<00:06:12.980> I<00:06:13.040> think<00:06:13.280> this<00:06:13.400> is

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
alliance or whatnot but I think this is

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.610 
alliance or whatnot but I think this is
definitely<00:06:13.700> a<00:06:13.940> look<00:06:14.090> at<00:06:14.510> a<00:06:14.630> second<00:06:15.080> faction<00:06:15.320> or

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
definitely a look at a second faction or

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.080 
definitely a look at a second faction or
what<00:06:16.010> it<00:06:16.100> will<00:06:16.250> take<00:06:16.280> to<00:06:16.730> save<00:06:17.090> what<00:06:17.330> remains

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
what it will take to save what remains

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.810 
what it will take to save what remains
but<00:06:20.090> there<00:06:20.210> was<00:06:20.240> one<00:06:20.330> thing<00:06:20.570> we<00:06:21.169> do<00:06:21.410> know<00:06:21.820> and

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
but there was one thing we do know and

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.130 
but there was one thing we do know and
again<00:06:23.060> you<00:06:23.210> get<00:06:23.390> another<00:06:23.570> look<00:06:23.660> at<00:06:23.750> them<00:06:23.900> here

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
again you get another look at them here

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.780 
again you get another look at them here
three<00:06:24.590> of<00:06:24.650> them<00:06:24.710> this<00:06:24.800> time<00:06:25.010> and<00:06:25.280> those<00:06:25.460> orange

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
three of them this time and those orange

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.730 
three of them this time and those orange
jumpsuits<00:06:26.180> do<00:06:26.360> really<00:06:26.720> stand<00:06:26.960> out

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.820 

there<00:06:33.740> cannot<00:06:34.130> be<00:06:34.190> any<00:06:34.580> hope<00:06:34.820> for<00:06:35.090> tomorrow<00:06:35.830> if

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
there cannot be any hope for tomorrow if

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.190 
there cannot be any hope for tomorrow if
we<00:06:36.890> don't<00:06:37.220> fight<00:06:37.790> for<00:06:38.210> today<00:06:38.540> here<00:06:38.960> we<00:06:39.080> get

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
we don't fight for today here we get

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.330 
we don't fight for today here we get
another<00:06:39.320> look<00:06:39.410> at<00:06:39.530> the<00:06:39.620> seeker<00:06:39.890> mine<00:06:40.040> which<00:06:40.190> we

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
another look at the seeker mine which we

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.800 
another look at the seeker mine which we
have<00:06:40.460> seen<00:06:40.640> before<00:06:41.000> first<00:06:41.480> time<00:06:41.600> we<00:06:41.690> ever<00:06:41.720> saw

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
have seen before first time we ever saw

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.780 
have seen before first time we ever saw
this<00:06:42.020> was<00:06:42.200> in<00:06:42.290> the<00:06:42.320> 2013<00:06:43.160> gameplay<00:06:43.310> trailer

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
this was in the 2013 gameplay trailer

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.160 
this was in the 2013 gameplay trailer
you<00:06:44.150> lay<00:06:44.240> on<00:06:44.270> the<00:06:44.450> ground<00:06:44.600> and<00:06:44.870> it<00:06:44.990> rolls

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
you lay on the ground and it rolls

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.290 
you lay on the ground and it rolls
towards<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.470> enemy<00:06:45.710> and<00:06:45.920> then<00:06:46.070> explodes<00:06:46.460> also

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
towards the enemy and then explodes also

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.220 
towards the enemy and then explodes also
if<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.390> look<00:06:47.540> on<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.690> left<00:06:47.720> it<00:06:47.990> looks<00:06:48.110> like

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
if you look on the left it looks like

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.720 
if you look on the left it looks like
there's<00:06:48.380> another<00:06:48.440> one<00:06:48.740> of<00:06:48.800> those<00:06:48.890> guys<00:06:49.070> but

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
there's another one of those guys but

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.650 
there's another one of those guys but
this<00:06:49.820> time<00:06:49.970> we're<00:06:50.150> wearing<00:06:50.300> what<00:06:50.450> looks<00:06:50.600> like

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
this time we're wearing what looks like

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.130 
this time we're wearing what looks like
a<00:06:50.780> bomb<00:06:51.110> disposal<00:06:51.350> suited<00:06:51.890> longer<00:06:52.930> and<00:06:53.930> then

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
a bomb disposal suited longer and then

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.540 
a bomb disposal suited longer and then
the<00:06:54.230> trailer<00:06:54.530> just<00:06:54.770> wraps<00:06:54.950> up<00:06:55.100> with<00:06:55.340> an<00:06:55.430> epic

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
the trailer just wraps up with an epic

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.190 
the trailer just wraps up with an epic
sort<00:06:55.820> of<00:06:55.880> combat<00:06:56.120> scene<00:06:56.330> where<00:06:56.810> the<00:06:56.900> agents

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
sort of combat scene where the agents

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.150 
sort of combat scene where the agents
are<00:06:57.260> obviously<00:06:57.470> fighting<00:06:57.770> off<00:06:57.830> against<00:06:58.070> this

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
are obviously fighting off against this

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.040 
are obviously fighting off against this
new<00:06:58.310> faction<00:06:58.730> and<00:06:58.880> that<00:06:59.390> is<00:06:59.630> pretty<00:06:59.840> much<00:06:59.990> it

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
new faction and that is pretty much it

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.230 
new faction and that is pretty much it
now<00:07:01.040> I<00:07:01.070> am<00:07:01.250> aware<00:07:01.490> that<00:07:01.700> I<00:07:01.820> may<00:07:02.000> well<00:07:02.150> have
