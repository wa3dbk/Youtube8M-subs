00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.099
 on what from such a city library 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.009
 in style with us now 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.319
 so now of course I would say 

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.759
 so we say 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.929
 the percentage log they all appear 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.130
 Bolgradsky clothes 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.099
 so in new for 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.599
 Ukrainian offices have expenses that is if 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.010
 some rules 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.590
 and despite which matches the purchased 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.780
 customers come there Kokshetau minister id 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.830
 expense than I can not there someone is something here 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.580
 one thing i want to be individual 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.400
 but the activity yes we find somehow 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.540
 way to emphasize individuality and in 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.840
 this is a set 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 on installation give us on board 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.590
 Kokoyta support I want to say hard 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.320
 appearance posts 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.890
 that is, even as something without going beyond 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.290
 expenses are all possibilities to do 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.580
 mass guessing some sort of new texture that is 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.780
 this will not be removed clip access to the internal 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.240
 MP decade who do not 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.320
 Signatures for this ballet are not allowed. 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.430
 less individual subcutting 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.140
 rub correctly 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.930
 using clothes to form 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.110
 defined image 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.350
 have we got such a distance task given 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.730
 customer person like this 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.530
 first of all the spectrum patronage of the client 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.280
 this is about what kind of lifestyle goes 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.420
 here probably to understand psychology 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.130
 human what emotionally 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.380
 there is generally not always clear 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.790
 that man loves everyone and everyone 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.260
 Of course it is very important to create 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.040
 clothes 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.940
 since I think this is primarily a 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.140
 as consumption of the inner world 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.510
 the Taliban they say that sometimes when 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.990
 there is a place to be 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.119
 what kind of person wants to be seen in 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.080
 this or that situation 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.100
 but on this basis you can pick up 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.180
 and the color of what is actually 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.520
 saying I'm probably pushing the first 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 turn 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 already under this color delays Kokoity 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.119
 Forum and already work 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.210
 linear solution pushing from everything 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.399
 still external human data 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.789
 we know for sure what that exists 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:12.719
 delusion 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.469
 these prejudices towards creating your 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.579
 image in offside than we most often 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:17.739
 faced 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.250
 if such things were well, of course there is 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190
 there are customers who come 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.290
 they say you know i love neckline 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.339
 only to row 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.989
 and everything related to consent 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.469
 nothing round or soft I don't want 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.169
 it concerns there all there let's say 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.539
 places here are circles in the fabric 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.599
 we immediately atkarska snow we will note it 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.679
 only angle 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.819
 so much that trap happens 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:40.819
 husband even 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.369
 what a cute charming 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.069
 incomprehensible to me 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.669
 why are people used to 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:46.789
 walk 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.439
 just like that 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.829
 I think in principle we all look at ourselves 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.479
 critically mirror 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.639
 and here 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.989
 you can like something more who less but 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.030
 understand this why does she even come from 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:02:59.400
 is coming 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.189
 sometimes very complicated 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.389
 Polotsk summer I try maybe 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.709
 of those than confidently persuade 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:06.879
 them all the same 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.590
 if you see something in this person 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.350
 of course 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.619
 of course but 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.269
 how much practice has shown cramped to say 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.559
 sales if through the port or through how 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.809
 what kind of resentment clinton was looking for but 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.829
 end of the world contented 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.390
 surprised that m 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.630
 managed to change the style and how they are new 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.549
 feels 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.540
 choosing clothes for the city seems to me 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.099
 many are faced with very 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.430
 contradictory 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.410
 task on the one hand really want 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.289
 emphasize individuality 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.989
 some kind of zest in itself 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.709
 the other side of June wants to look like 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.589
 so but all that can be bright is pretentious 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.509
 that's how it fits i just 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.739
 I will parallel shows one more 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.579
 fear before the collection this is a political scientist 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.729
 equal struck that very gentle rope 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.660
 still Chizhevskogo feminine 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.580
 how is it how to emphasize and be 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.540
 one side is bright on the other side to 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.609
 don't look honorable 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.249
 but I think that now it is probably very 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.049
 hard to do but crossed out 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.040
 Nashi is true 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.289
 We accept almost everyone 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.429
 But the more so in the city later the year 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.169
 completely different people of different images 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.569
 of life so I think you can have 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.779
 completely different styles 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.609
 production I think that when choosing clothes 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.449
 must be guided 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.899
 your feelings and your clothes 

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:25.270
 of residence 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.340
 I am very pleased 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.410
 so tell their customers let go 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.449
 orders 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.960
 habitual black colors gray let's say 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.330
 so not markin 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.629
 namely on something more tender 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.229
 critics cream color of their places 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.249
 first let's say orange is relevant 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.209
 something is not very optimistic 

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:44.879
 life-affirming color 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.629
 system anyway 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.509
 and from the beginning, and the need of man 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.999
 in color and then color also affects our 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.819
 psychology 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.580
 all the same if the person 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.560
 comfortable clothing is at the top of the corner 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.319
 Salafis that for the city it is also 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.530
 important task that the clothes were 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.639
 convenient before us had some kind of it 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.439
 trousers 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.650
 you know what is shorter 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.169
 and this is when the first thing you want another 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.130
 the parties still want to ii some 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.620
 elegance from how to combine 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.880
 by the way i think that he 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.490
 maybe before us there was no such 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.080
 variety of stores and brands 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.640
 who provided what 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.670
 the hopes of their collections are completely different 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.419
 the sphere 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.270
 now all the same agree prices 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.409
 find good clothes 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.269
 any style is practically not 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:31.319
 Samed you a lot of time big 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.180
 labor 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.509
 that all the same the market is growing and Russia 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.690
 getting so fashionable enough 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.800
 country 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.139
 but nevertheless we again happen lira 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.159
 what because of the wrong clothes 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.060
 human 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.060
 accept no as he would like it 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:51.690
 as usual 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.300
 it turns out 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.319
 but surely 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.400
 and what needs to be changed in this situation 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.650
 I think you need to change the operas 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.699
 concept is man itself because the most 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.050
 comic case 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.900
 probably 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.169
 clothing and appearance and it turns out those 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.710
 people someone might be chasing after 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.580
 what goals does the brand 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.590
 realizing that it was like this on the covers 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.039
 fashion magazines and perhaps what if i 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.710
 I will also look stylish and 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.669
 fashionable 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.310
 although a person may be less than the degree 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.960
 realize who he is and what he intends to give 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.189
 his 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:22.999
 and here I think it's no 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.219
 psychological it can be a problem 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.949
 it may be too rude a word 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.150
 for this 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.059
 the situation is still 

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:32.199
 but the percentage 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.100
 in an hour I think that 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.100
 any absurd nicknames can be 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.270
 named simply style and nobody any 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.520
 individualities 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.470
 that is great when the woman gave up 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.129
 long dresses fao 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.459
 it became clear that the most important thing 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:49.510
 European hairstyle 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.610
 just now 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.839
 that toyota is like a woman 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.460
 urban area 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.810
 so you don't say 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.849
 literally here are a few words 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:59.289
 war is really a medal 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:02.479
 because I personally love the hairpin and this 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.559
 never such an environment no 

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.180
 no graphics for me 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.809
 probably get something else here 

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:10.689
 it really should 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:12.839
 be comfortable area in winter unfortunately 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:14.569
 based on our climate it should
