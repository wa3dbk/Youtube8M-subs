00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.729
 let's prepare butter cookies 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.250
 the ingredients we need are 200 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.940
 grams of common wheat flour 60 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.309
 grams of cornstarch 175 grams of 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.160
 butter at room temperature 80 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.130
 grams of icing sugar or powder a yolk 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.849
 vanilla essence egg a pinch 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.089
 of salt and to decorate jam sugar 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.630
 glas or vanilla frosting powder and 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.150
 red or pink coloring and let's start 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.690
 putting in the bowl of our blender 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.660
 with the shovel knead the butter 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.850
 room temperature with sugar 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.980
 although we can make this mixture with 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 a normal rod mixer or 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.780
 even with some hand rods 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.140
 perfectly 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.600
 we make the mixture let's beat up 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.329
 that the two ingredients are well 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.760
 mixed 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.699
 we add the yolk 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.890
 and we're going to put a little essence 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.159
 in this case to be concentrated only 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.229
 It will take a few drops of vanilla 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.020
 course although if you want you can use 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.060
 the other taste of orange or lemon 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.170
 for example 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 we stop the machine and we are going to add 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.619
 directly all the cornstarch and all the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.619
 wheat flour 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.460
 we also put a pinch of salt 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.200
 and then we'll mix everything very well 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.800
 rather low power so it does not come out 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.070
 the flour fired 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.550
 but for a very short time as soon as 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.890
 let's see that we get a mixture of rose and 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.980
 that the flour is already all well mixed 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.470
 with the butter we stopped the machine not 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.930
 It is convenient to knead this mixture too 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.140
 because otherwise cookies will tend to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.770
 deform in the oven 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.440
 we mix all the mixture well 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.090
 we take a transparent fill and we go 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.390
 to compact 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.700
 to let it rest in the fridge at 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.700
 less an hour or two hours 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.440
 as you see with the help of the film I 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.430
 compact rectangle shape and the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.430
 I keep in the fridge 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.130
 if you want you can also compact the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.140
 a little more stretched so that then no 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.940
 it costs you to stretch it a lot, what happens is 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.850
 that I do not usually have much space in 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.340
 the fridge 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.260
 Once the time has passed, we are going to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.750
 stretch because now it will be much more 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.270
 manageable and we have to stretch it with 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.730
 help from a little bit of flour never 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.360
 icing sugar if we use icing sugar for 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.610
 stretch it this will melt and it will make 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.020
 the dough sticks more on our sheet 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.590
 oven 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.680
 we are going to extend with a thickness of about 3 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.020
 millimeters and with the short pasta that in 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.060
 Here we have chosen to heart and 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.240
 that we are going to thematize them for san 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.570
 valentine we make all the hearts that 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.970
 we can in the mass we are placing them 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.160
 in our oven paper and with a 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.950
 heart a little smaller we are going to 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.520
 go poking holes in the cookies that 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.520
 we already had 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.870
 to do as a kind of cover 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.640
 for the cookies the little hearts 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.430
 little ones that we have left 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.650
 putting also on the baking paper and 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.819
 the oven we have to have hot to 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.849
 180 degrees it will take to bake about 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.769
 10 or 12 minutes but if you do like me 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.299
 that you have mixed the two 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.579
 kinds of cookies you will have to 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.129
 control what are the caps of 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.840
 heritage do not burn us before so 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.000
 as soon as we see that they take a 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.180
 little bit of color we open the oven and the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.450
 we take out and we'll finish baking the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.239
 rest quietly you can also 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.269
 make a single lid tray you're 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.599
 and others or the cookie base 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.459
 the truth will be more organized as you see 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.310
 now with a little jam 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.830
 fill without reaching the edges 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.220
 and place the caps of cookies 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.250
 over we'll finally sprinkle it 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.470
 with a little icing sugar without any 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.560
 since, although it falls through 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.680
 on top of the jam it absorbs it and 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.440
 in addition, it is dried beforehand so that 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.950
 then we can keep them at least one 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.990
 week in a can 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.950
 so do not worry if the jam 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.980
 it stains as it will also disappear 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.400
 we have taken a little bit of glaze from 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.830
 vanilla already bought and we've had it 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.320
 with a little red 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.120
 because for little hearts 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.960
 that had come out of us when doing the 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.289
 cover 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.449
 we take advantage of them by bathing 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.430
 You can also use white chocolate or 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.710
 dark chocolate or chocolate that you 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.960
 like and it goes without saying that these 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.749
 cookies you can give them the shape that 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.020
 you want you can use essences from others 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:28.270
 flavors to give them another touch us 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.550
 we propose this idea in case you want 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.849
 prepare yourselves to your lover or 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.430
 in love in the next valentine the 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.439
 do as you do, I'm sure of 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.569
 that you are going to love because really 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:42.569
 that are delicious
