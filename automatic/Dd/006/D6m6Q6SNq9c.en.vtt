00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
spinning his wheels with what everybody

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.790 
spinning his wheels with what everybody
backward<00:04:38.240> yeah<00:04:39.240> this<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.720> been<00:04:39.930> going<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.470> for

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
backward yeah this is been going on for

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.240 
backward yeah this is been going on for
two<00:04:40.980> days

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
two days

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.100 
two days
this<00:04:41.580> whole<00:04:44.240> spinning<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.420> wheels<00:04:45.630> was<00:04:45.840> on

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
this whole spinning of the wheels was on

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.850 
this whole spinning of the wheels was on
and<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.440> forth<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.980> guess<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:48.530> guess<00:04:49.530> this<00:04:49.740> is

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
and so forth I guess I guess this is

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.250 
and so forth I guess I guess this is
really<00:04:49.890> when<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.340> need<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.520> Volkswagen<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.260> guys

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
really when you need a Volkswagen a guys

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.830 
really when you need a Volkswagen a guys
I<00:04:52.410> think<00:04:52.620> they've<00:04:52.710> done<00:04:52.890> with<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.840> tire

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
I think they've done with the tire

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.750 
I think they've done with the tire
spinning<00:04:55.170> out<00:04:55.380> there<00:04:55.590> for<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> while

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
spinning out there for a while

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.340 
spinning out there for a while
sorry<00:04:57.420> about<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:59.330> as<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.480> said<00:05:00.690> I've<00:05:00.900> debated

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
sorry about that as I said I've debated

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.350 
sorry about that as I said I've debated
on<00:05:01.710> whether<00:05:01.770> even<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.430> pups<00:05:02.670> this<00:05:02.850> segment<00:05:03.300> or

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
on whether even to pups this segment or

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.750 
on whether even to pups this segment or
not<00:05:03.510> because<00:05:03.960> of<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:05.040> way<00:05:05.160> I<00:05:05.190> had<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.460> go<00:05:05.580> about

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
not because of the way I had to go about

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.030 
not because of the way I had to go about
it<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.150> was<00:05:06.330> been<00:05:06.480> nicer<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.170> I<00:05:07.200> said<00:05:07.590> if<00:05:07.890> I

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
it it was been nicer like I said if I

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.730 
it it was been nicer like I said if I
could<00:05:08.100> have<00:05:08.970> braced<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.900> know<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.290> don't

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
could have braced it you know I don't

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.220 
could have braced it you know I don't
have<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:11.040> torch<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.730> I<00:05:12.330> got<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.660> thinking<00:05:13.050> out

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
have a torch and I got to thinking out

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.890 
have a torch and I got to thinking out
there<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.980> got<00:05:14.580> thinking<00:05:14.850> about<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.270> the

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
there that I got thinking about the the

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.840 
there that I got thinking about the the
tubers<00:05:16.230> out<00:05:16.410> there<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.740> don't<00:05:17.340> have<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.550> torch

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
tubers out there that don't have a torch

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.880 
tubers out there that don't have a torch
so<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.930> is<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.110> way<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.260> fix<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.650> if<00:05:19.770> you

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
so this is the way to fix it if you

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.530 
so this is the way to fix it if you
don't<00:05:20.070> torture<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.670> can't<00:05:20.910> braise<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.360> it

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
don't torture you can't braise it it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.720 
don't torture you can't braise it it
would<00:05:21.630> have<00:05:21.720> been<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.870> better<00:05:22.110> job<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:23.520> way

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
would have been a better job that way

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.080 
would have been a better job that way
however<00:05:24.410> it<00:05:25.410> didn't<00:05:25.860> have<00:05:25.980> one<00:05:26.190> it's<00:05:26.790> going<00:05:27.030> to

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
however it didn't have one it's going to

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.570 
however it didn't have one it's going to
hold<00:05:27.240> for<00:05:27.390> a<00:05:27.570> few<00:05:27.780> years<00:05:28.190> it's<00:05:29.190> going<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.400> work

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
hold for a few years it's going to work

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.290 
hold for a few years it's going to work
just<00:05:29.610> fine<00:05:29.850> as<00:05:30.270> far<00:05:30.750> as<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.050> exhaust<00:05:31.350> manifold
