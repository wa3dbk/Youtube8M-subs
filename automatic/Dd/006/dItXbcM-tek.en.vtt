00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
another I broke this case so they got me

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.349 
another I broke this case so they got me
to<00:01:56.840> thinking<00:01:57.399> now<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:58.729> time<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.149> go<00:01:59.299> ahead

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
to thinking now is the time to go ahead

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.270 
to thinking now is the time to go ahead
and<00:01:59.630> get<00:01:59.750> one<00:01:59.929> of<00:01:59.960> these<00:02:00.079> Magpul<00:02:00.710> cases<00:02:01.159> and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
and get one of these Magpul cases and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.959 
and get one of these Magpul cases and
i've<00:02:01.369> seen<00:02:01.640> them<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.929> internet<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.969> i

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
i've seen them on the internet and i

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.060 
i've seen them on the internet and i
hadn't<00:02:05.479> seen<00:02:05.539> one<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:05.840> person<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.829> i<00:02:06.859> just

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
hadn't seen one in person so i just

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.650 
hadn't seen one in person so i just
decided<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.579> take<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.909> plunge<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.420> got<00:02:08.539> this

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
decided to take the plunge I got this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.080 
decided to take the plunge I got this
one<00:02:08.840> off<00:02:08.960> eBay<00:02:09.429> for<00:02:10.429> about<00:02:10.840> 10<00:02:11.840> bucks<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.350> think

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
one off eBay for about 10 bucks I think

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.199 
one off eBay for about 10 bucks I think
so<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.239> kind<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.420> hard<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.750> beat<00:02:14.959> because

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
so it's kind of hard to beat because

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.860 
so it's kind of hard to beat because
these<00:02:17.140> things<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:18.040> one<00:02:18.340> was<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.970> can't

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
these things this one was I can't

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.619 
these things this one was I can't
remember<00:02:19.900> about<00:02:20.349> 25<00:02:20.829> bucks<00:02:21.129> or<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.909> these

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
remember about 25 bucks or so and these

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.949 
remember about 25 bucks or so and these
are<00:02:22.840> like<00:02:23.250> 40<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.489> 50<00:02:25.000> actually<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.629> got<00:02:25.840> this

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
are like 40 or 50 actually I got this

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.890 
are like 40 or 50 actually I got this
one<00:02:26.140> IV<00:02:26.439> Bay<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.980> about<00:02:27.599> 30<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.780> think<00:02:29.640> but

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
one IV Bay for about 30 I think but

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.080 
one IV Bay for about 30 I think but
they're<00:02:31.900> pretty<00:02:32.170> expensive<00:02:32.379> if<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.849> want<00:02:34.000> to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
they're pretty expensive if you want to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.740 
they're pretty expensive if you want to
see<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.420> difference<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.959> sizes<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.629> is

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
see the difference in sizes here it is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.830 
see the difference in sizes here it is
with<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.989> thinner<00:02:39.750> commuter<00:02:40.750> case<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.540> here<00:02:43.750> it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
with a thinner commuter case and here it

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.000 
with a thinner commuter case and here it
is<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.109> a<00:02:44.140> defender<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:47.379> that's<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.739> big

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
is with a defender and that's a big

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.470 
is with a defender and that's a big
difference<00:02:50.129> if<00:02:51.129> you<00:02:51.370> want<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.670> case<00:02:52.060> that

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
difference if you want a case that

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.199 
difference if you want a case that
doesn't<00:02:52.870> add<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.049> lot<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.349> bulk<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.950> your<00:02:53.980> phone

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
doesn't add a lot of bulk to your phone

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.059 
doesn't add a lot of bulk to your phone
I'm<00:02:55.209> thinking<00:02:55.659> this<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> way<00:02:56.139> to<00:02:56.200> go<00:02:58.799> as<00:02:59.799> you

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
I'm thinking this is a way to go as you

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.089

similar<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.760> these<00:04:59.880> magazines<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.980> you<00:05:01.980> know

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
similar to these magazines and you know

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.850 
similar to these magazines and you know
of<00:05:02.190> course<00:05:02.240> they're<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.480> hard<00:05:04.140> plastic<00:05:04.470> where

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
of course they're a hard plastic where

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.159 
of course they're a hard plastic where
this<00:05:04.980> is<00:05:05.160> not<00:05:05.340> but<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.690> actual<00:05:07.340> feeling<00:05:09.169> is

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
this is not but the actual feeling is

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.020 
this is not but the actual feeling is
the<00:05:10.380> same<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:12.090> texture<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.850> it's<00:05:14.970> a

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
the same of the texture of it so it's a

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.460 
the same of the texture of it so it's a
really<00:05:15.300> good<00:05:15.450> looking<00:05:15.660> case<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:18.350> got<00:05:19.350> the

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
really good looking case and I got the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.170 
really good looking case and I got the
flat<00:05:19.680> dark<00:05:19.950> earth<00:05:20.130> but<00:05:20.430> there<00:05:20.640> are<00:05:20.760> many

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
flat dark earth but there are many

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.420 
flat dark earth but there are many
colors<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.750> pick<00:05:21.960> from<00:05:22.100> all<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.250> way<00:05:23.400> from

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
colors to pick from all the way from

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.550 
colors to pick from all the way from
black<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:24.270> clear<00:05:24.630> they<00:05:24.990> actually<00:05:25.410> make<00:05:25.530> a

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
black to clear they actually make a

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.880 
black to clear they actually make a
clear<00:05:25.890> case<00:05:26.600> what<00:05:27.600> I<00:05:27.630> wanted<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.080> try<00:05:28.260> this<00:05:28.320> one

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
clear case what I wanted to try this one

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.200 
clear case what I wanted to try this one
and<00:05:30.470> hopefully<00:05:31.470> it'll<00:05:31.680> give<00:05:31.860> me<00:05:32.210> good

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
and hopefully it'll give me good

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.559 
and hopefully it'll give me good
protection<00:05:34.100> and<00:05:37.460> that's<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.640> good<00:05:38.790> look<00:05:38.970> at<00:05:39.180> it

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
protection and that's a good look at it

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.830 
protection and that's a good look at it
thanks<00:05:41.259> for<00:05:41.379> watching<00:05:41.679> guys
