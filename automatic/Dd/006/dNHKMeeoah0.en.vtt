Hello sweet viewwers and welcome to this episode. Today I will prepare Halwa-e-ardi. I hope you all love this recipe of mine.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.900
The ingredients are as follows

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.620
200g All purpose flour

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:29.658
100g Sugar 

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:30.700
100g cooking oil

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:33.788
1 teaspoon cardamom powder

00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.528
Add some flour to see If the oil is hot enough.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.149
Now it is time to add the Flour on Cooking oil.

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:52.385
Keep mixing it and add the flour very gently.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.460
Mix them well.

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:00.447
Until the flour browns or cooks.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.760
As you can see viewers the flour is golden or almost prepared.

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:09.596
I will now add some hot water.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.880
Make sure to cover the pot with the lid because the water will burn your skin.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.636
Also add the sugar later.

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:23.779
Slowly give it a stir.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.980
Now add the sugar.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
Keep mixing them until sugar mixes with the flour.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.945
Lower the heat.

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:04.637
Do not add more water.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960
Keep mixing it.

00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:22.034
Now add the cardamom powder.

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:26.012
Also give it a stir.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:38.933
You can see that it did not stick to the pot.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
Lower the heat level.

00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:54.431
Do this process...5 minutes.

00:02:57.654 --> 00:02:59.654
So the Halwa comes on top the oil.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.980
Then we will know that halwa is ready to serve.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:07.551
Sweet viewers this was my recipe for Halw-e-Ardi.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920
