back<00:02:26.070> bar<00:02:26.340> okay<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.840> stay<00:02:28.050> here<00:02:28.320> after

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
back bar okay we have to stay here after

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.790 
back bar okay we have to stay here after
of<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.640> three<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.270> us<00:02:30.480> go<00:02:30.990> on<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.380> that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
of you and three of us go on that that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.560 
of you and three of us go on that that
side<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.220> practice<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:32.760> across<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.120> station

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
side and practice on across the station

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.820 
side and practice on across the station
okay

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:45.690 

so<00:02:38.830> then<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.370> need<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:44.590> something<00:02:45.250> in

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
so then we need to do something in

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.970 
so then we need to do something in
confidence<00:02:45.970> necessary<00:02:48.240> basic<00:02:49.240> thing

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
confidence necessary basic thing

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:58.260 
confidence necessary basic thing
endotracheal<00:02:50.980> tube<00:02:53.100> come<00:02:54.100> across<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:57.270> it's

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
endotracheal tube come across this it's

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.750 
endotracheal tube come across this it's
a<00:02:58.360> very<00:02:58.390> simple<00:02:58.780> thing<00:02:58.960> don't<00:02:59.490> worry<00:03:00.490> too<00:03:00.730> much

these another important thing having gel
mask<00:05:27.710> llaves<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:29.270> doesn't<00:05:29.660> go<00:05:29.840> into<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.260> lab

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
mask llaves this doesn't go into the lab

mask llaves this doesn't go into the lab
into<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.120> lab<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:33.110> sits<00:05:33.440> outside<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:34.190> ER<00:05:35.530> this

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
into the lab it sits outside the ER this

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.040 
into the lab it sits outside the ER this
is<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.830> time<00:05:37.099> that's<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.789> loving<00:05:38.120> this<00:05:38.780> is
