00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.240
 otherwise you probably think 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.340
 most curious 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.439
 to see mechanical keyboard like this 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.170
 is the rocket iii ripped out of the fire 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 cache pro version that's almost ours 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 flagship directly a few features 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.890
 demonstrate 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.970
 I think most of them are already 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.679
 a bit in the topic of what mechanical 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 keyboards is therefore now 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.300
 probably not from scratch 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.170
 explain what they can and can not do 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.670
 I'll just start so we have 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.129
 For example, a few things that it 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.410
 other for example not there to 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.770
 example, the possibility of that under each 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 key we have led and is with us 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 possible I believe it makes thought 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.600
 sense if you under each button a led 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.989
 has that you also individually 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 can 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 and we have to the case sometimes 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.890
 for demonstration purposes europe things 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 prepared but you can see that in that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.500
 now, for example, just completely 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.780
 classic setup that you just have to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 The WSD buttons are the finished player 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 very interesting you can light that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.530
 whole also exactly vice versa do that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.750
 For example, that one for example 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 So all you were also now to 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.090
 For example, everything is lit except for us 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.829
 as the keys 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.149
 maybe it's not bad either 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.210
 thing but then yes even the finger on it 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.649
 then you see everything else 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.009
 and basically you can 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.319
 actually every kind of macros of 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.700
 You can focus on key bindings 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.990
 So, the keyboard also place there with a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.280
 a few examples made for example here 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.770
 there's something to see 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.880
 a classic word setup for example 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.469
 the corresponding keys overview 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.009
 can give or what is beautiful 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.179
 is our functions as for 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.759
 here is his whole market 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.259
 buttons you have programmed yourself 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.289
 can also illuminate individually 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.739
 and yes, there are many possibilities 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.090
 and sky select barely set limits 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.349
 it is also possible, for example 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.729
 can also be a bit of a few 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.899
 gimmicks, for example, do that then 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.420
 For example, something to show 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.319
 That's what we call ourselves 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.709
 screensaver 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.009
 there it is now that all five 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.509
 seconds since you can see it already 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.530
 randomly approach different buttons 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.910
 That's why it was so easy 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.890
 funny way a screensaver 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.299
 is called before it just times 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.250
 So it's theoretical to show that 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 really possible any kind of 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.299
 you actually play games 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.070
 can actually imagine that too 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.780
 to lay keyboard 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.820
 then find a nice thing that 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.370
 I work for example in the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.900
 Being spiked up becomes so small 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.780
 have grown because if I have the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.470
 twelve keystrokes that is afterglow 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.570
 also very nice 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.520
 for example, you can do it very well 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.920
 demonstrate that that we to 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.870
 example, have no problems 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.490
 ghosting or things like that because I 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.080
 just put my hand on it and 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.670
 you can see all preconceived 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.690
 seamlessly addressed that is not now 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.750
 so that there is nothing more 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.050
 works and that war good 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.820
 impression as with the buttons make 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.740
 can 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.070
 it will also be the keyboard 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.840
 delivered with a sdk that is who 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.250
 So have a little fun with it 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.560
 such things can employ stop also 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.850
 really everything with the keyboard 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.990
 connect what he wants we have one 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.190
 few examples in the trailer already 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.890
 shown so you can because of me 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.270
 the mahner display for example directly 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.740
 put on the f keys that here 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.810
 really down in real time 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.370
 such things or there is shooter 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.740
 For example, with indicator you can 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.790
 then program that really well from 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.960
 the left side shot and then 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.700
 shines accordingly also in real time 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.690
 the left side on so that is 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.860
 all kinds of gimmicks 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.160
 we are very curious what the community 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.290
 So in that case , I think of it 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.200
 So that will be a lot of it 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.520
 so exciting so much for lighting 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.410
 maybe something else technical 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.550
 Lighting is ensured so 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.879
 especially now this lighting 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.349
 single keys we have 22 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.030
 Arm processors of the keyboard installed 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.540
 and of that he is one actually 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.349
 only responsible for the lighting yes that 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.000
 also makes a bit of the 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.360
 difference to the other versions the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.880
 there will come from the keyboard 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:10.170
 We also have shots 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.690
 good 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.930
 and on the other side we have to 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.200
 for example, the usb ports 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.910
 that's a nice thing , for example 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.410
 that is still new at the keyboard 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.150
 For example, we have a new one 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.040
 surface installed 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.330
 that's so small I do not know that 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.490
 you probably can not now so 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.120
 to see exactly that are so small 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.100
 small dots 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 the background is still such a thing 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.050
 a bit yes this a bit one 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.639
 noble optics but you can have no 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.160
 fingerprints based that is 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.690
 of course, a topic and in the case 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.889
 you can fit on here and you would 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.889
 see no fingerprints 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.390
 that is one thing still quite 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.530
 important we work at the keyboard 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.630
 also with the cherry mx switches i can 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.810
 Here is just a taste 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.910
 pull it off 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.770
 maybe you can see that too with the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.370
 here we have, for example, the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.030
 black switches installed in the pro 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.070
 version, it is because we give people 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.150
 the possibility to choose that if 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.410
 not everyone wants me now 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.570
 have black 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.240
 you can actually do that 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.160
 choose before you have the keyboard 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.540
 You can say that to have and indeed 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.120
 I like it with black switches 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.470
 or me this blue or red or 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.150
 brown hair with this 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.140
 selection option that also has 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.650
 in any case it is a special feature 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.270
 already asked different and me 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.520
 think that makes us different too 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.010
 a little bit of it from others in series though 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.570
 usually you have one 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.620
 variant of switches and that wanted 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.150
 we leave a bit open so if 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.230
 someone decides for the electro 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.000
 then he can actually get the 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.010
 grope for his taste, she was 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.230
 also exercise 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.850
 I think 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.420
 I have the most important thing about it 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.420
 tells 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.669
 it will not be too long 

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:58.809
 is she looking forward to buy this 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.429
 the feedback what we then for you 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:02.969
 receive 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:02.969
 that would be from my side
