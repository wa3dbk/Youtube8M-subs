with no belt as you can see here reason

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.520 
with no belt as you can see here reason
for<00:00:48.290> that<00:00:48.379> is<00:00:48.590> deadly<00:00:49.190> far<00:00:50.200> especially<00:00:51.200> with

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
for that is deadly far especially with

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.069 
for that is deadly far especially with
pound<00:00:51.890> plates<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:53.210> weights<00:00:53.450> start<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.899> really

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
pound plates the weights start to really

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.580 
pound plates the weights start to really
eat<00:00:55.010> down<00:00:55.280> towards<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.790> sides<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.600> bar

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
eat down towards the sides and the bar

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.400 
eat down towards the sides and the bar
gets<00:00:57.829> bent<00:00:58.130> severely<00:00:58.640> in<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.940> middle<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.600> it

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
gets bent severely in the middle and it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.959 
gets bent severely in the middle and it
kind<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.710> gives<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.040> false<00:01:01.430> sense<00:01:01.579> of

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
kind of gives you a false sense of

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.260 
kind of gives you a false sense of
strength<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.660> how<00:01:03.590> much<00:01:03.770> weight<00:01:04.040> you're<00:01:04.309> how

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
strength and how much weight you're how

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.889 
strength and how much weight you're how
much<00:01:05.449> weight<00:01:05.660> you're<00:01:05.840> moving<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:07.690> we'd<00:01:08.690> rather

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
much weight you're moving so we'd rather

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.350 
much weight you're moving so we'd rather
use<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> bar<00:01:09.860> that's<00:01:10.040> completely<00:01:10.670> dead<00:01:11.060> that's

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
use a bar that's completely dead that's

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.249 
use a bar that's completely dead that's
got<00:01:11.570> no<00:01:11.780> no<00:01:12.440> whip<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:15.020> way<00:01:15.200> it

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
got no no whip to it and that way it

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.320 
got no no whip to it and that way it
makes<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.740> work<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.130> much<00:01:16.340> more<00:01:16.789> hard<00:01:17.060> wrist

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
makes you work that much more hard wrist

multi-purpose bars they they are thicker

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.250

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
is when you go to pick the weight up

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.479 
is when you go to pick the weight up
should<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.669> similar<00:03:08.669> to<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:11.099> way<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.310> is

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
should be similar to the way it is

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.869 
should be similar to the way it is
throughout<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.939> entire<00:03:12.180> range<00:03:12.419> of<00:03:12.480> motion

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.149 
throughout the entire range of motion
your<00:03:14.879> back<00:03:15.150> shouldn't<00:03:15.629> shouldn't<00:03:16.500> be<00:03:16.650> folding

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
your back shouldn't shouldn't be folding

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.069 
your back shouldn't shouldn't be folding
over<00:03:17.280> too<00:03:17.579> much<00:03:17.760> shouldn't<00:03:18.689> be<00:03:18.750> getting<00:03:18.840> out

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
over too much shouldn't be getting out

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.619 
over too much shouldn't be getting out
too<00:03:19.290> far<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.650> front<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.010> barbell<00:03:20.479> you<00:03:21.479> want

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
too far in front of the barbell you want

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.569 
too far in front of the barbell you want
to<00:03:21.690> try<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.870> turn<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.379> deadlift<00:03:22.889> into<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> hip

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
to try to turn the deadlift into a hip

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.039 
to try to turn the deadlift into a hip
movement<00:03:24.440> so<00:03:25.440> now<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.919> we<00:03:26.040> are<00:03:26.069> doing<00:03:26.370> some

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
movement so now here we are doing some

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.860 
movement so now here we are doing some
basically<00:03:28.049> conventional<00:03:28.769> compensatory

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
basically conventional compensatory

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
lot out of less I guess you could say

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.260 
lot out of less I guess you could say
and<00:04:44.400> maybe<00:04:44.550> that's<00:04:44.759> why<00:04:44.969> I've<00:04:45.150> been

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
and maybe that's why I've been

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.409 
and maybe that's why I've been
successful<00:04:46.009> to<00:04:47.009> some<00:04:47.219> extent<00:04:47.580> at<00:04:47.819> the<00:04:48.030> sport

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
successful to some extent at the sport

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.649 
successful to some extent at the sport
is<00:04:49.190> I've<00:04:50.190> always<00:04:50.370> gotten<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.819> lot<00:04:51.000> out<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.300> doing

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
is I've always gotten a lot out of doing

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.350 
is I've always gotten a lot out of doing
a<00:04:51.750> little<00:04:52.310> I've<00:04:53.310> always<00:04:53.490> gotten<00:04:53.759> a<00:04:53.879> lot<00:04:54.060> out<00:04:54.120> of

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
a little I've always gotten a lot out of

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.689 
a little I've always gotten a lot out of
reducing<00:04:55.319> the<00:04:55.409> weight<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:56.069> doing<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.550> weight

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
reducing the weight and doing the weight

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.659 
reducing the weight and doing the weight
correctly<00:04:57.440> as<00:04:58.440> opposed<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.009> just<00:04:59.039> you<00:04:59.639> know

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
correctly as opposed to just you know

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.800 
correctly as opposed to just you know
going<00:05:00.030> 50<00:05:00.539> 60<00:05:00.990> 70<00:05:01.319> pounds<00:05:01.650> heavier<00:05:01.979> and

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
going 50 60 70 pounds heavier and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.510 
going 50 60 70 pounds heavier and
banging<00:05:03.810> out<00:05:03.900> some<00:05:03.930> crappy<00:05:04.440> version<00:05:04.800> of<00:05:05.129> a

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
banging out some crappy version of a

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.320 
banging out some crappy version of a
deadlift<00:05:05.940> or<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> bench<00:05:06.569> or<00:05:06.750> squat<00:05:08.090> speed<00:05:09.090> work

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
deadlift or a bench or squat speed work

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.170 
deadlift or a bench or squat speed work
has<00:05:09.539> always<00:05:09.719> been<00:05:10.050> pretty<00:05:10.680> good<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:11.009> me<00:05:11.180> but

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
has always been pretty good to me but

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.510 
has always been pretty good to me but
basically<00:05:12.629> you<00:05:13.110> know<00:05:13.199> what<00:05:13.349> we're<00:05:14.009> doing<00:05:14.250> here

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
basically you know what we're doing here

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.580 
basically you know what we're doing here
is<00:05:14.550> we're<00:05:14.699> going<00:05:14.849> heavy<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:16.050> know<00:05:16.080> doing<00:05:16.349> one

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
is we're going heavy you know doing one

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.559 
is we're going heavy you know doing one
heavy<00:05:16.830> set<00:05:17.159> then<00:05:17.909> we're<00:05:18.029> following<00:05:18.419> it<00:05:18.449> up

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
heavy set then we're following it up

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.140 
heavy set then we're following it up
with<00:05:18.629> speed<00:05:19.050> work<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:20.400> amount<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.699> sets<00:05:20.969> we

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
with speed work the amount of sets we

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.300 
with speed work the amount of sets we
get<00:05:21.330> on<00:05:21.449> this<00:05:21.539> day<00:05:21.779> I<00:05:21.810> believe<00:05:22.319> was<00:05:22.680> about<00:05:22.919> six

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
get on this day I believe was about six

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.540 
get on this day I believe was about six
sets<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.669> three<00:05:24.500> maybe<00:05:25.500> seven<00:05:26.009> sets<00:05:26.219> of<00:05:26.340> three

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
sets of three maybe seven sets of three

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.959 
sets of three maybe seven sets of three
or<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.830> see<00:05:28.979> I'm<00:05:29.099> able<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.430> lock<00:05:29.639> him<00:05:29.819> out

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
or so you see I'm able to lock him out

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.659 
or so you see I'm able to lock him out
pretty<00:05:30.210> fast<00:05:30.479> but<00:05:31.430> I'm<00:05:32.430> not<00:05:32.669> not<00:05:33.270> fast<00:05:33.719> enough

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
pretty fast but I'm not not fast enough

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.999 
pretty fast but I'm not not fast enough
in<00:05:35.669> my<00:05:35.909> opinion<00:05:36.060> off<00:05:36.509> the<00:05:36.659> floor<00:05:36.960> good<00:05:37.349> on<00:05:37.440> 500

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
in my opinion off the floor good on 500

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.029 
in my opinion off the floor good on 500
pounds<00:05:38.339> of<00:05:38.400> reusing<00:05:38.930> and<00:05:39.930> also<00:05:40.650> keep<00:05:40.889> in<00:05:40.979> mind

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
pounds of reusing and also keep in mind

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.860 
pounds of reusing and also keep in mind
still<00:05:41.460> got<00:05:41.580> no<00:05:41.669> belt<00:05:41.940> on<00:05:42.120> but<00:05:42.330> we<00:05:42.419> did<00:05:42.629> shift

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
still got no belt on but we did shift

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.839 
still got no belt on but we did shift
over<00:05:43.199> to<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.349> deadlift<00:05:43.740> bar<00:05:43.919> and<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.699> was

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
over to the deadlift bar and that was

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.469 
over to the deadlift bar and that was
kind<00:05:45.060> of<00:05:45.120> more<00:05:45.270> out<00:05:45.449> of<00:05:45.479> convenience<00:05:47.479> this

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
kind of more out of convenience this

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.969 
kind of more out of convenience this
week<00:05:48.719> when<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:48.930> deadlifts<00:05:49.469> that<00:05:49.560> I<00:05:49.650> used<00:05:49.860> a

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
week when I deadlifts that I used a

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.740 
week when I deadlifts that I used a
really<00:05:50.430> shitty<00:05:50.699> bar<00:05:50.940> for<00:05:51.180> speed<00:05:51.389> work<00:05:51.569> and

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
really shitty bar for speed work and

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.889 
really shitty bar for speed work and
holy<00:05:51.930> crap<00:05:52.469> did<00:05:52.650> that<00:05:52.800> hurt

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:56.899 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.449 

doing<00:05:57.899> some<00:05:58.079> repetitions<00:05:58.739> on<00:05:58.859> the<00:05:58.949> speed<00:05:59.219> work

00:05:59.449 --> 00:05:59.459 
doing some repetitions on the speed work

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.039 
doing some repetitions on the speed work
is<00:05:59.669> nice<00:05:59.849> because<00:06:00.119> now<00:06:00.419> you're<00:06:00.599> getting<00:06:00.899> in

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:01.049 
is nice because now you're getting in

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:05.209 
is nice because now you're getting in
more<00:06:01.259> volume<00:06:02.779> and<00:06:03.779> when<00:06:04.649> you<00:06:04.739> get<00:06:04.919> in<00:06:05.069> more

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
more volume and when you get in more

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.389 
more volume and when you get in more
volume<00:06:05.699> and<00:06:05.729> we<00:06:05.909> do<00:06:06.059> repetitions<00:06:06.359> and<00:06:07.019> kind<00:06:07.259> of

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:07.399 
volume and we do repetitions and kind of

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.279 
volume and we do repetitions and kind of
eating<00:06:08.399> green<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:09.179> proper<00:06:09.569> technique<00:06:09.989> into

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
eating green the proper technique into

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.589 
eating green the proper technique into
your<00:06:10.439> head<00:06:10.649> and<00:06:10.889> into<00:06:11.129> your<00:06:11.279> body<00:06:11.539> you're<00:06:12.539> also

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
your head and into your body you're also

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.619 
your head and into your body you're also
when<00:06:15.599> you<00:06:15.689> do<00:06:15.839> repetitions<00:06:16.109> if<00:06:16.919> you<00:06:17.579> get<00:06:18.239> stuck

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
when you do repetitions if you get stuck

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.559 
when you do repetitions if you get stuck
or<00:06:18.659> getting<00:06:19.079> some<00:06:19.259> sort<00:06:19.469> of<00:06:19.529> shitty<00:06:19.799> position

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
or getting some sort of shitty position

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.479 
or getting some sort of shitty position
you<00:06:21.569> can<00:06:21.689> overcome<00:06:22.109> those<00:06:22.529> positions<00:06:22.949> more

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:23.489 
you can overcome those positions more

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:28.219 
you can overcome those positions more
often<00:06:24.319> in<00:06:25.319> a<00:06:25.529> training<00:06:25.829> session<00:06:27.229> through

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
often in a training session through

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.859 
often in a training session through
repetition<00:06:28.619> work<00:06:29.159> than<00:06:29.429> you<00:06:29.459> could<00:06:29.909> if<00:06:30.179> you

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:30.869 
repetition work than you could if you

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:34.159 
repetition work than you could if you
were<00:06:31.199> just<00:06:31.379> doing<00:06:31.849> heavier<00:06:32.849> singles<00:06:33.479> with

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
were just doing heavier singles with

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.869 
were just doing heavier singles with
more<00:06:34.409> weight<00:06:34.589> on<00:06:34.619> the<00:06:34.829> bar<00:06:34.979> yeah<00:06:35.579> I'm<00:06:35.729> doing

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
more weight on the bar yeah I'm doing

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.779 
more weight on the bar yeah I'm doing
some<00:06:36.119> shrug<00:06:36.419> ease<00:06:36.919> and<00:06:37.919> hit<00:06:38.129> myself<00:06:38.309> an<00:06:38.669> ack

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
some shrug ease and hit myself an ack

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.269 
some shrug ease and hit myself an ack
ack<00:06:39.349> these<00:06:40.349> deadlift<00:06:40.829> sessions<00:06:41.159> have<00:06:41.249> been

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:41.279 
ack these deadlift sessions have been

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.369 
ack these deadlift sessions have been
pretty<00:06:41.549> brutal<00:06:41.849> to<00:06:42.089> me<00:06:42.239> lately<00:06:42.449> and<00:06:43.139> getting<00:06:43.349> a

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:43.379 
pretty brutal to me lately and getting a

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:44.929 
pretty brutal to me lately and getting a
little<00:06:43.499> banged<00:06:43.829> up<00:06:44.039> on<00:06:44.249> them<00:06:44.369> so<00:06:44.489> just<00:06:44.519> getting

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:44.939 
little banged up on them so just getting

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.239 
little banged up on them so just getting
through<00:06:45.089> them<00:06:45.299> is<00:06:45.619> sometimes<00:06:46.619> the<00:06:46.769> hard<00:06:46.979> part
