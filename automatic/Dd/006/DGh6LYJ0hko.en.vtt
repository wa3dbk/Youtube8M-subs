what<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.869> call<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.950> guys<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.460> do

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
what we call to see what you guys can do

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
what we call to see what you guys can do
so<00:01:12.150> where<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> would<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.750> that'll<00:01:13.380> be

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so where that would be that'll be

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.870 
so where that would be that'll be
ambitious<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.100> who's<00:01:14.369> gonna<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.640> anywhere

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
ambitious but who's gonna get anywhere

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
ambitious but who's gonna get anywhere
without<00:01:15.180> being<00:01:15.450> ambitious<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
without being ambitious so that is the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
without being ambitious so that is the
gameplay<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.420> nice<00:01:18.570> accuracy<00:01:19.080> an

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
gameplay just a really nice accuracy an

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
gameplay just a really nice accuracy an
interesting<00:01:19.979> thing<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
interesting thing is actually to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
interesting thing is actually to
contrast<00:01:21.180> between<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.540> gameplay<00:01:22.020> when

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
contrast between the gameplay when

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
contrast between the gameplay when
you're<00:01:22.590> watching<00:01:22.740> x<00:01:23.189> play<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.729> when

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you're watching x play and then when

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.340 
you're watching x play and then when
you're<00:01:24.150> watching<00:01:24.299> myself<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.229> he

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
you're watching myself by because he

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
you're watching myself by because he
plays<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.770> much<00:01:25.979> lower<00:01:26.220> sensitivity<00:01:26.460> than

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
plays on a much lower sensitivity than

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
plays on a much lower sensitivity than
me<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> plan<00:01:28.590> 14<00:01:28.979> sensitivity

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
me and you know I plan 14 sensitivity

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.370 
me and you know I plan 14 sensitivity
which<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.360> incredibly<00:01:30.869> difficult

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
which is actually incredibly difficult

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
which is actually incredibly difficult
with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.070> Karma<00:01:32.430> taxes<00:01:32.759> because<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
with the Karma taxes because you have to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
with the Karma taxes because you have to
be<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.689> precise<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.290> these<00:01:34.500> there's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
be really precise with these there's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.490 
be really precise with these there's
quite<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> small<00:01:35.430> hitbox<00:01:36.030> where<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.720> xed<00:01:37.229> plays

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
quite a small hitbox where is xed plays

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020 
quite a small hitbox where is xed plays
on<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> lower<00:01:37.890> sensitivity<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> know

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
on a lower sensitivity and it's you know

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.870 
on a lower sensitivity and it's you know
much<00:01:39.299> easier<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.020> him<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> pick<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:41.040> those<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
much easier for him to pick up those you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.660 
much easier for him to pick up those you
know<00:01:42.030> those<00:01:42.060> sweeping<00:01:42.840> angle<00:01:43.229> throws<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
know those sweeping angle throws and I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
know those sweeping angle throws and I
do<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> plan<00:01:45.210> 14<00:01:45.540> sensitivity<00:01:45.750> because<00:01:46.259> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
do have to plan 14 sensitivity because I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.080 
do have to plan 14 sensitivity because I
don't<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.860> doing<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.280> spinning<00:01:47.700> stuff<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
don't like doing the spinning stuff the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.760 
don't like doing the spinning stuff the
trick<00:01:48.329> shots<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> stuff<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
trick shots that kind of stuff but it is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
trick shots that kind of stuff but it is
really<00:01:50.159> interesting<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> compare<00:01:50.880> both<00:01:51.540> play

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
really interesting to compare both play

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.359 
really interesting to compare both play
styles<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.290> they're<00:01:52.380> both<00:01:52.500> completely<00:01:52.950> valid

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
styles and they're both completely valid

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.700 
styles and they're both completely valid
play<00:01:53.880> styles<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> tell<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:54.990> x2<00:01:55.590> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
play styles and you can tell that x2 is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.499 
play styles and you can tell that x2 is
much<00:01:56.159> more<00:01:56.430> kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.700> reluctant<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.299> run

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
much more kind of reluctant to run

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.060 
much more kind of reluctant to run
straight<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.049> your<00:01:58.079> serum<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.799> moving

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
straight in your serum kind of moving

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
straight in your serum kind of moving
around<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.369> outside<00:01:59.759> occasionally<00:02:00.420> Glenn

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
around the outside occasionally Glenn

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.810 
around the outside occasionally Glenn
counsel<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.469> doorways<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.460> great

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
counsel on but doorways are just great

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
counsel on but doorways are just great
for<00:02:03.090> combat<00:02:03.420> acting<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.409> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
for combat acting as you can see and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.039 
for combat acting as you can see and
again<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.090> kind<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> going<00:02:06.299> straight<00:02:06.750> in

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
again I'm just kind of going straight in

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
again I'm just kind of going straight in
on<00:02:07.140> these<00:02:07.259> guys<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.890> quite<00:02:08.369> unfortunate

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
on these guys actually quite unfortunate

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.669 
on these guys actually quite unfortunate
to<00:02:08.970> pick<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.450> kill<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:09.959> sometimes<00:02:10.530> at

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
to pick up that kill there sometimes at

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.050 
to pick up that kill there sometimes at
that<00:02:10.770> kind<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.009> range<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.819> literally

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that kind of range you can literally

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
that kind of range you can literally
throw<00:02:12.330> axes<00:02:12.810> through<00:02:13.050> people<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.620> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
throw axes through people and you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
throw axes through people and you
see<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> team<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.580> kind<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.030> backed<00:02:15.180> off<00:02:15.420> there

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
see as a team I kind of backed off there

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.690 
see as a team I kind of backed off there
and<00:02:15.870> then<00:02:15.990> X<00:02:16.410> came<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.800> from<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.280> side

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and then X came in from the side

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.699 
and then X came in from the side
sideways<00:02:18.330> angle<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> team

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
sideways angle so you can see the team

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.590 
sideways angle so you can see the team
play<00:02:19.950> elements<00:02:20.340> really<00:02:20.730> come<00:02:21.060> together<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
play elements really come together and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.809 
play elements really come together and
once<00:02:21.750> I've<00:02:22.080> called<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:23.010> orbital<00:02:23.610> vsat

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
once I've called in this orbital vsat

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.270 
once I've called in this orbital vsat
then<00:02:24.600> things<00:02:24.990> were<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.290> only<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> get

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
then things were just only going to get

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.470 
then things were just only going to get
better<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.790> know<00:02:26.910> we've<00:02:27.030> got<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.270> stone

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
better you know we've got the stone

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.570 
better you know we've got the stone
assist<00:02:27.750> going<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:29.220> just<00:02:29.370> had<00:02:29.490> these

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
assist going on and we just had these

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.580 
assist going on and we just had these
guys<00:02:29.790> completely<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:31.020> run<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.500> just

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
guys completely on the run I can just

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.870 
guys completely on the run I can just
throw<00:02:31.680> stones<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.250> where<00:02:32.370> they<00:02:32.490> were<00:02:32.550> just

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
throw stones to where they were just

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.000 
throw stones to where they were just
pick<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.270> those<00:02:33.420> throws<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.350> even<00:02:34.709> when

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
pick up those throws you know even when

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.380 
pick up those throws you know even when
they<00:02:35.160> were<00:02:35.250> spawning<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.760> groups<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.300> could

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
they were spawning in groups that could

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.180 
they were spawning in groups that could
just<00:02:36.570> see<00:02:36.720> where<00:02:36.870> they<00:02:36.959> were<00:02:37.020> drop<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:37.890> guy

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
just see where they were drop that guy

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.979 
just see where they were drop that guy
off<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.370> top<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.760> boat<00:02:38.910> run<00:02:39.480> around<00:02:39.750> pick

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
off the top of the boat run around pick

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.449 
off the top of the boat run around pick
it<00:02:40.110> up<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.590> using<00:02:40.860> cover<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.250> this

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
it up and just using cover like this

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.640 
it up and just using cover like this
dropping<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.880> stands<00:02:42.120> around<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:43.380> you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
dropping the stands around and then you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.020 
dropping the stands around and then you
know<00:02:43.709> even<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.040> i<00:02:44.160> miss<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.580> kilt<00:02:44.790> or<00:02:44.940> what

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
know even if i miss the kilt or what

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.640 
know even if i miss the kilt or what
else<00:02:45.150> could<00:02:45.300> pick<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.569> up<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.110> see<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.410> really

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
else could pick it up you see we really

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.440 
else could pick it up you see we really
kind<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.830> swarm<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.820> spawn<00:02:48.030> points<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
kind of swarm in on the spawn points the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.729 
kind of swarm in on the spawn points the
enemy<00:02:48.660> team<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.080> don't<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.410> happens

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
enemy team really don't know it happens

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.560 
enemy team really don't know it happens

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
map boom everyone's behind him just like

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.979 
map boom everyone's behind him just like
that<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.660> thought<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.900> guys
