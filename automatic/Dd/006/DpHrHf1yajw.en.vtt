00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
particularly because if we wait I don't

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.150 
particularly because if we wait I don't

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
know if them jumping it going now but if

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.660 
know if them jumping it going now but if
we<00:03:50.790> mean<00:03:51.800> we're<00:03:52.800> gonna<00:03:52.950> meet<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.400> winner<00:03:53.580> of
