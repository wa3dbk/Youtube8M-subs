the<00:01:03.960> airlock<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> very<00:01:05.400> good

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the airlock which is a very good

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
the airlock which is a very good
indication<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.510> fermentation<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.590> taking

for<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.640> beer<00:01:21.060> kit<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.460> whole<00:01:23.640> process

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
for this beer kit and the whole process

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.569 
for this beer kit and the whole process
should<00:01:24.420> take<00:01:24.450> about<00:01:25.490> two<00:01:26.490> weeks<00:01:27.140> give<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.170> take

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
should take about two weeks give or take

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
should take about two weeks give or take
and<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.939> what<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.600> point<00:01:30.900> all<00:01:31.079> takes<00:01:31.409> some

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and at what that point all takes some

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
and at what that point all takes some
hydrometer<00:01:32.250> readings<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.270> are

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
hydrometer readings and if there are

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.830 
hydrometer readings and if there are
unchanged<00:01:34.350> over<00:01:34.530> two<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.070> three<00:01:35.189> days<00:01:35.840> I'll

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
unchanged over two or three days I'll

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840 
unchanged over two or three days I'll
look<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.320> moving<00:01:37.530> moving<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> bottling

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
look at moving moving on to the bottling

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.630 
look at moving moving on to the bottling
phase<00:01:39.439> but<00:01:40.439> anyway<00:01:40.829> here's<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.340> quick

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
phase but anyway here's just a quick

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.420 
phase but anyway here's just a quick
video<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.780> fermentation<00:01:43.439> taking<00:01:44.399> place

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
video of the fermentation taking place

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.310 
video of the fermentation taking place
and<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.939> said<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.450> first<00:01:48.869> attempt

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and as I said this is my first attempt

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.850 
and as I said this is my first attempt
so<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.950> interesting<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:51.000> how<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.390> goes

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
so be interesting to see how it all goes

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.469 
so be interesting to see how it all goes
and<00:01:52.860> I'll<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> couple<00:01:53.549> more<00:01:53.670> videos<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and I'll make a couple more videos of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.490 
and I'll make a couple more videos of
the<00:01:55.079> bottling<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.810> finally<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> tasting<00:01:58.380> in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the bottling and finally the tasting in

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.270 
the bottling and finally the tasting in
the<00:01:58.619> weeks<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.920> come<00:01:59.270> thanks
