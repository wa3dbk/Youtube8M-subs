I'm<00:00:23.470> at<00:00:24.420> owner<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:25.570> creator<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:25.990> zero<00:00:26.320> for

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
I'm at owner and creator of zero for

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.330 
I'm at owner and creator of zero for
bikes<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:27.660> basically<00:00:28.660> we<00:00:29.020> produce

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
bikes and basically we produce

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.710 
bikes and basically we produce
custom-made<00:00:30.340> carbon<00:00:30.790> fiber<00:00:31.029> titanium<00:00:31.239> bikes

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
custom-made carbon fiber titanium bikes

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.790 
custom-made carbon fiber titanium bikes
and<00:00:31.989> also<00:00:32.349> specialist<00:00:32.739> bike<00:00:32.950> fitting<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
and also specialist bike fitting the

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.190 
and also specialist bike fitting the
first<00:00:36.070> stage<00:00:36.310> is<00:00:36.730> for<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.270> client<00:00:37.930> to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
first stage is for the client to

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.490 
first stage is for the client to
actually<00:00:38.440> climb<00:00:38.980> under<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.399> fit<00:00:39.610> cycle<00:00:40.059> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
actually climb under the fit cycle and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.810 
actually climb under the fit cycle and
have<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.559> good<00:00:41.739> warm-up<00:00:42.070> session<00:00:42.340> so<00:00:42.640> that

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
have a good warm-up session so that

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.150 
have a good warm-up session so that
they're<00:00:43.570> fully<00:00:43.840> warmed<00:00:44.110> up<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:44.559> over<00:00:44.800> all<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
they're fully warmed up and over all the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.099 
they're fully warmed up and over all the
muscles<00:00:45.489> are<00:00:45.579> all<00:00:45.640> nice<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.059> fully<00:00:46.750> stretched

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
muscles are all nice and fully stretched

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.450 
muscles are all nice and fully stretched
so<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.590> can<00:00:47.679> basically<00:00:47.800> get<00:00:48.070> accurate

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
so you can basically get accurate

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
so you can basically get accurate
results<00:00:50.670> first<00:00:51.670> we<00:00:51.879> check<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.149> saddle

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
results first we check the saddle

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.169 
results first we check the saddle
Heights<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.920> adjust<00:00:54.339> the<00:00:54.760> saddle<00:00:54.940> height

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
Heights and adjust the saddle height

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.819 
Heights and adjust the saddle height
fire<00:00:55.449> checking<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.199> knee<00:00:56.379> bends<00:00:56.769> angle

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.160 

next<00:01:00.609> we<00:01:00.789> need<00:01:00.909> to<00:01:01.030> check<00:01:01.239> how<00:01:01.570> far<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.019> knee

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
next we need to check how far the knee

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.990 
next we need to check how far the knee
is<00:01:02.350> over<00:01:02.499> the<00:01:02.679> pedal<00:01:02.980> this<00:01:03.519> is<00:01:03.670> actually

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
is over the pedal this is actually

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.719 
is over the pedal this is actually
imperative<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:05.170> getting<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.710> very<00:01:06.250> very<00:01:06.549> good

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
imperative to getting a very very good

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.670 
imperative to getting a very very good
triumphant<00:01:07.540> specific<00:01:07.960> fit<00:01:10.200> next<00:01:11.200> we<00:01:11.380> need<00:01:11.530> to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
triumphant specific fit next we need to

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.570 
triumphant specific fit next we need to
check<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.270> adjust<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.869> arm<00:01:14.740> angle<00:01:15.159> we're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
check and adjust the arm angle we're

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.310 
check and adjust the arm angle we're
looking<00:01:15.610> for<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.000> very<00:01:16.210> specific<00:01:16.420> angle<00:01:17.020> for

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
looking for a very specific angle for

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.710 
looking for a very specific angle for
ultimate<00:01:17.950> comfort<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.850> create<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.119> correct

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
ultimate comfort and to create a correct

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.990 
ultimate comfort and to create a correct
torso<00:01:20.140> angle<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.920> follow<00:01:24.159> on<00:01:24.369> we<00:01:24.700> need<00:01:24.850> to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
torso angle to follow on we need to

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.600 
torso angle to follow on we need to
check<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.509> adjust<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.380> hard<00:01:26.860> position<00:01:27.130> on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
check and adjust the hard position on

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.649 
check and adjust the hard position on
the<00:01:27.789> armrest<00:01:28.210> pad

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.289 

finally<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:33.829> need<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.040> make<00:01:34.460> sure<00:01:34.969> that<00:01:35.180> the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
finally we need to make sure that the

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:51.550 
finally we need to make sure that the
elbows<00:01:35.719> are<00:01:35.750> just<00:01:36.170> inside<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.740> hips

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.980 

the<00:01:52.560> client<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.070> test<00:01:53.580> runs<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.120> fits<00:01:54.480> over

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the client now test runs this fits over

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
the client now test runs this fits over
10<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.230> 15<00:01:55.590> minutes<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.220> basically<00:01:56.880> wheel<00:01:57.120> out

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
10 to 15 minutes to basically wheel out

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.960 
10 to 15 minutes to basically wheel out
any<00:01:57.540> issues<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:58.260> may<00:01:58.470> happen

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.639 

this<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.240> final<00:02:06.600> FETs<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.470> just

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
this is the final FETs where we just

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
this is the final FETs where we just
double-check<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.880> measurements<00:02:09.390> are

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
double-check all the measurements are

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.210 
double-check all the measurements are
correct<00:02:09.840> before<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.560> client<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.009> basically

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
correct before the client can basically

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:23.080 
correct before the client can basically
take<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> bike<00:02:11.730> away

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.960 

and<00:02:23.660> now<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.870> bikes<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.379> on<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> road

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and now the bikes out on the road

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.670 
and now the bikes out on the road
hopefully<00:02:25.970> where<00:02:26.209> we'll<00:02:26.480> find<00:02:26.720> faster<00:02:27.410> times

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
hopefully where we'll find faster times

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.800 
hopefully where we'll find faster times
and<00:02:28.010> maybe<00:02:28.489> with<00:02:28.640> any<00:02:28.790> luck<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.209> whew<00:02:29.420> PBS

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and maybe with any luck so whew PBS

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:38.790 
and maybe with any luck so whew PBS
coming<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:30.200> well

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.860 

you
