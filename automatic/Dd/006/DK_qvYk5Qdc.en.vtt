00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.800
 It is important that this acronym means the force of the inter or after 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.799
 transform attacks and transmitted over the internet 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.419
 voip services and grow by leaps and bounds 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.410
 conference - the economy of long distance calls digital look conferred 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.410
 near these dimensions see result 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.369
 here in the digital look we already talked about the voice voice over ip and in the new 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.990
 technology that is changing the way people are talking and using the 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.700
 telephone 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.070
 with the ration for this true revolution is simple 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.690
 one can use the internet to transmit the voice with a microphone attached to the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 computer and with an internet connection everything is ready this year 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 2009 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.180
 occurs that in fact a computer program for wanting to converge to the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.770
 This information is transmitted by the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.360
 computer to the internet to talk to another computer is for free 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.260
 already calling you to a landline or cell phone there you will have to pay 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.750
 there is no way you already know what is correct 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.210
 we come back to the subject to make a comparison 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.960
 Which is better, after all, what are the advantages you have to your 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.470
 willingness to make calls 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.170
 that 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.159
 in digital eye research that you can find in full in our 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 site we did some simulations 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.920
 A very interesting example is how many international 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.530
 Japan 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.770
 more precisely out 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.900
 the difference between a fixed operator for the cut was what translates 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.640
 technical 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.189
 six cents from real to power 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.049
 against two reais and fifty-six cents for fixed telephony 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.680
 It all depends on how it 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.820
 each operator was able to compose their course 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.980
 it can reach the final price 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.800
 the approval is that the indication that we have said that the fourteen of 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.769
 June 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.639
 a contract with the local operator of the vitor body was very good 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.609
 It's possible that I really like the inter on Sunday. 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.609
 he is delivering all the treatment and sanitation 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.029
 the high era was fixed in all brazil she had 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.819
 want to return soon after the landing is to make international agreements are the 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.489
 questions and the room 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.489
 Why did not you speak, said he? 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.389
 Another example 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.689
 now in long-distance calls between Brazilian states the difference in favor 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.839
 from the port and there is also a connection são paulo florianópolis saio por 15 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:53.629
 cents via voip another 60 cents by means of the cheaper fixed telephony 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:57.639
 in all of brazil what happens 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.909
 to practice any citizen setad depending on the season 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.019
 of the operators themselves 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.379
 and conditions 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.290
 regulation of the São Paulo market 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.560
 so there is some kind of competition but the costs 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.649
 higher levels 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.649
 hence the program will have to negotiate with the treatment 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.059
 in the same city, the difference is also in favor of 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:30.829
 of the vote seven cents another 19 cents of fixed telephony 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:38.749
 well even with lower tariffs was innovative voip the user should stay 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:43.609
 they choose to choose the one that is actually more advantageous for their 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:44.579
 profile 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.429
 for you see some now 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.429
 according to the same document the phone goes 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.059
 secretary of the operator 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.549
 you have to have a broadband connection the operator has to have a 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.169
 internet connection ie your home eg the air
