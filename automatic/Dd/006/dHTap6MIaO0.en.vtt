00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.640
 for the companies 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.220
 We intend to get a flow of this work is colored 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.769
 and what happened to the pigs seemed 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.849
 what we are going to demand 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.689
 the malki accompanied by a bribe 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.730
 if it is 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.140
 Spider 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.060
 the whole process 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.250
 Pentecostal church in a little daughter 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.250
 the position in which we are going to proceed 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.160
 to 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.590
 to that kind of society 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.359
 we are not going to do is to try to continue like this 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:51.539
 the ashes 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.440
 your art then let's leave written 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.830
 and if it is done before three hours and all the solutions added is the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.930
 position of the indigenous neighborhood a series of passes we want to learn in addition 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.600
 once again we have the largest casino and the Argentine companies 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.660
 hospitals the general we have got 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.670
 in the south of ecuador municipality 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.750
 will allow us in a way 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.150
 the rojiblancos never forget 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.640
 p walk 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.220
 our moment 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.300
 that's why now 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.050
 circles of the complete workflow is to say lower both things 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.360
 must in a way 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 then we 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.760
 my screen 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.390
 and simply 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 this winter 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.010
 here is choking us that we select and focused 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.460
 the cd of a laptop or even a project 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 in this case it is not an lcd 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.790
 cleaning we found that we have two ways to make pasta mix 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.150
 simple 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.060
 that is going to ask us absolutely nothing the next step is going to be public 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.659
 local 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.689
 the knowledgeable expert on the subject of the big screen 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.989
 no longer leaving he was going to end up generating a profile leaving the system installed 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.909
 the advanced 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.489
 we can basically adjust take into account two things 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.979
 one as I told you 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.619
 the colonel who has the ability to make a reading of the ambient light 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 i at the meeting in the measurement 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:34.140
 when I made my debut 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.969
 but if we want to see it 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.379
 simple way oaxaca 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.929
 at the closing of the bags 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.419
 It is insufficient 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.899
 and yesterday his state showing itself in what position 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.729
 we want to summon the color wheel 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:49.640
 for 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.709
 in that case I walk to the device 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.709
 we do not have the colomo that connected by we serve 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.459
 who noted that we follow the girl 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.479
 finally carlos hogwarts 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.479
 and I'm not saying what the goddess of fertility is going to do 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:18.219
 once calibrated it tells us that we must move obesity again 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.749
 the veracity of the tape in position b 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:24.759
 where parallel 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.889
 mental of the following year 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.799
 barcelona min 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.170
 at all times 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.309
 I mentioned 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.029
 work 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.989
 but they are left-wing has the fly made not only to what is coming 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.840
 once the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.029
 in the measurement of results 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:49.379
 we can do throughout his life 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.579
 go to spend 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.579
 not having them the week 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.959
 in this position 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.290
 given that with his next 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.229
 and he's always telling you 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.049
 we want to place it left me the leather case the color mundi 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.409
 leaving hanging in that position 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.509
 i 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.009
 and one day it takes me 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:11.489
 to proceed to 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.289
 to send the patches include studies of the hadley cleaning center up to date 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.629
 and here is happening all the patches 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:31.379
 Once this process is finished, we will leave the profile installed and we can see 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.490
 in it the before and after to check it 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.590
 the efficiency see 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.009
 from the corro 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.759
 yes what we want to do 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.309
 despite the fact that the person profile 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:47.009
 Well surely we will have all the steps started at all times 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.059
 that's what we do want to create a new profile 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:54.330
 we have limited to say that we want 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.610
 we simply tell him to appreciate my new coach my person to give him a 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.719
 better profile 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.949
 c5n 1 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.159
 afp 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.120
 to meet with gps our profile 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.080
 we are seven 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.020
 intersectorially going to print

 50 passes 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:23.089
 these patients well between the fingers from the world past with the position 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.809
 I said that 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:29.679
 To move it, nothing remained above the level of the strips of 

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:34.330
 spaces vienna 27 seconds already ahead 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.089
 then we must take points in the table to complete the 800 in total 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.699
 i once 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.240
 taking into account the entire drying process 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.330
 the tapes with a paper 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.229
 To return to 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.979
 in a letter in peace 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.229
 once done 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.469
 without vaccinating more will generate a profile 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:00.839
 do not go to valdez by default a decrease of the operating system 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.939
 the specific place where 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.909
 present in the parades and others 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.279
 teacher of that 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.629
 from the opening 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.689
 the works 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.939
 once the room judge the afternoon patches 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.939
 the high that we vary 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.310
 the letter is numbered from 1 to 5 of smith that we start well 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.539
 vienna fringe ap 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:28.379
 the patch 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.339
 le monde mosley plans and the mystic that we move to the second third quarter 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.339
 and so with the rough 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.039
 when we have the poet profiled as the price since they have installed we do not see 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.430
 problem create 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.520
 but it's not the profile 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.339
 finding out the printer profile 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:52.599
 one thing is to have 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.770
 performed the recital and the other is to apply correctly when we go to 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.119
 more activities 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.759
 this we have explained in other farms 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:05.229
 in it we have to take into account several aspects 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.289
 as for example that the management is installed different from the color of the 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.360
 printer since these we have colo colo access as a whole bojan 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.300
 jocular 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.300
 los angeles slow down through a challenge that we have created 

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:20.990
 so that there is no double interpretation of the choir 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.409
 from the most important is 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.430
 They specified that this company vehicle 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.690
 although countries aspects to take into account we made commented is going to be another one of 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.689
 three farms where we are going to review 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:34.979
 exactly 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:40.279
 if we have to select the two with the photoshop model cs4 we want 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.999
 we must select 

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:45.579
 Mara using an intendant profile let's do 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:47.780
 in fact we whatever 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.389
 p the house inside 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:51.520
 the patent among the ladies 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.090
 you can include correctly
