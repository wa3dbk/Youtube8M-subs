00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
phone out way too much to have to deal

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.470 
phone out way too much to have to deal
with<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.030> flap<00:03:15.300> like<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:17.390> honestly<00:03:18.390> I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
with it flap like this and honestly I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.229 
with it flap like this and honestly I
don't<00:03:18.690> use<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.620> calling<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.160> much<00:03:20.370> so

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
don't use it for calling that much so

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.530 
don't use it for calling that much so
this<00:03:21.660> would<00:03:21.810> definitely<00:03:21.900> hinder<00:03:22.440> me<00:03:22.590> um<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:23.730> lot

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
this would definitely hinder me um a lot

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.020 
this would definitely hinder me um a lot
now<00:03:26.060> one<00:03:27.060> thing<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.440> inside<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:29.580> not<00:03:29.790> padded

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
now one thing the inside it's not padded

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.979 
now one thing the inside it's not padded
anything<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.870> just<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.170> plastic<00:03:31.350> um<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:33.030> I'm

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
anything it's just a plastic um so I'm

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.979 
anything it's just a plastic um so I'm
not<00:03:34.290> exactly<00:03:34.440> sure<00:03:34.769> if<00:03:35.489> that's<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> best<00:03:36.750> way

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
not exactly sure if that's the best way

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.890 
not exactly sure if that's the best way
to<00:03:37.050> protect<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.709> screen<00:03:37.950> from<00:03:38.190> scratching<00:03:38.900> so

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
to protect the screen from scratching so

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.370 
to protect the screen from scratching so
far<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.170> haven't<00:03:40.410> had<00:03:40.560> any<00:03:40.739> issues<00:03:41.060> but<00:03:42.170> I'm<00:03:43.170> not

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
far I haven't had any issues but I'm not

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.259 
far I haven't had any issues but I'm not
sure<00:03:43.410> maybe<00:03:43.739> over<00:03:44.010> time<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.790> could

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
sure maybe over time this could

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.490 
sure maybe over time this could
eventually<00:03:47.330> cause<00:03:48.330> some<00:03:48.660> damage<00:03:48.840> now<00:03:49.260> what<00:03:49.470> I

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
eventually cause some damage now what I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.220 
eventually cause some damage now what I
don't<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:50.640> flap<00:03:51.030> here<00:03:51.390> right

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
don't like is that this flap here right

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.470 
don't like is that this flap here right
here<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.739> what<00:03:53.130> connects<00:03:53.430> them<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:54.299> looks

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
here this what connects them it looks

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.120 
here this what connects them it looks
really<00:03:54.630> flimsy<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.260> feel<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.799> could<00:03:55.860> just

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
really flimsy I feel like I could just

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.949 
really flimsy I feel like I could just
if<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.400> twisted<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:57.030> little<00:03:57.180> bit<00:03:57.360> more<00:03:57.510> you

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
if I twisted it a little bit more you

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.400 
if I twisted it a little bit more you
just<00:03:58.290> rip<00:03:58.560> right<00:03:58.920> off<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.400> same<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.000> this

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
just rip right off and same with this

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.259 
just rip right off and same with this
this<00:04:01.410> thing<00:04:01.470> up<00:04:01.830> here<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.160> it's<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.880> mean<00:04:03.239> it's

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
this thing up here it's it's I mean it's

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.509 
this thing up here it's it's I mean it's
pretty<00:04:03.810> flimsy<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:04.860> already<00:04:04.980> slide<00:04:05.340> it

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
pretty flimsy you can already slide it

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.650 
pretty flimsy you can already slide it
around<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.810> feel<00:04:07.049> like<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:09.120> this<00:04:09.480> would

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
around and I feel like this this would

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.740 
around and I feel like this this would
break<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.320> mean<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.070> don't<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.850> feel<00:04:12.660> like

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
break I mean I don't know I feel like

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.630 
break I mean I don't know I feel like
this<00:04:12.959> wouldn't<00:04:13.260> really<00:04:13.500> hold<00:04:13.950> up<00:04:14.190> for<00:04:14.459> very

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
this wouldn't really hold up for very

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.590 
this wouldn't really hold up for very
long<00:04:14.940> um<00:04:16.430> what's<00:04:17.430> what<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:17.970> also<00:04:18.120> don't<00:04:18.390> really

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
long um what's what I also don't really

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.909 
long um what's what I also don't really
like<00:04:18.750> about<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:19.049> case<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.500> when<00:04:19.769> you're

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
like about this case is that when you're

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.190 
like about this case is that when you're
using<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.340> open<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:21.120> pretty<00:04:21.570> much<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:22.169> to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
using it open you pretty much have to

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.630 
using it open you pretty much have to
fold<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.680> back<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.950> be<00:04:26.070> able<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.400> sort

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
fold this back to to be able to sort

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.480

like the phone can like slide around
nothing<00:04:33.490> serious<00:04:33.819> just<00:04:34.300> something<00:04:34.660> that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
nothing serious just something that

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.290 
nothing serious just something that
would<00:04:34.990> kind<00:04:35.259> of<00:04:35.319> bother<00:04:35.590> me<00:04:36.009> and<00:04:36.849> I'm<00:04:36.940> using<00:04:37.090> it

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
would kind of bother me and I'm using it

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.020 
would kind of bother me and I'm using it
besides<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:39.250> know<00:04:39.370> there's<00:04:39.580> really<00:04:42.030> no

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
besides that you know there's really no

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.189 
besides that you know there's really no
other<00:04:43.060> issues<00:04:43.599> with<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.870> case<00:04:44.139> um<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.900> just

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
other issues with the case um it's just

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.460 
other issues with the case um it's just
definitely<00:04:48.009> not<00:04:48.490> something<00:04:49.139> like<00:04:50.139> I<00:04:50.289> said

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
definitely not something like I said

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.499 
definitely not something like I said
that<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.620> would<00:04:50.740> buy<00:04:50.979> um<00:04:51.430> maybe<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.389> would<00:04:52.479> be

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
that I would buy um maybe it would be

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.779 
that I would buy um maybe it would be
nice<00:04:52.690> if<00:04:52.750> they<00:04:53.190> uncovered<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.340> home<00:04:54.550> button

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
nice if they uncovered the home button

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.909 
nice if they uncovered the home button
because<00:04:55.419> at<00:04:55.900> least<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.259> me<00:04:56.349> it's<00:04:56.560> easier<00:04:56.800> to

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
because at least to me it's easier to

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.469 
because at least to me it's easier to
access<00:04:57.069> the<00:04:57.370> home<00:04:57.550> button<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:58.060> power<00:04:58.270> button

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
access the home button the power button

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.689 
access the home button the power button
so<00:04:59.349> say<00:04:59.560> if<00:04:59.650> I<00:04:59.740> were<00:04:59.800> checking<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.310> time<00:05:00.490> or

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
so say if I were checking the time or

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.490 
so say if I were checking the time or
something<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.120> could<00:05:01.330> just<00:05:01.509> tap<00:05:02.110> right<00:05:02.319> here

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
something I could just tap right here

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.930 
something I could just tap right here
yeah<00:05:02.650> that's<00:05:02.919> really<00:05:03.130> all<00:05:03.310> there<00:05:03.340> is<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.819> this

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
yeah that's really all there is to this

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.629 
yeah that's really all there is to this
case<00:05:04.830> if<00:05:05.830> you're<00:05:05.979> one<00:05:06.099> of<00:05:06.130> those<00:05:06.280> people<00:05:06.610> that

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
case if you're one of those people that

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.969 
case if you're one of those people that
only<00:05:06.940> uses<00:05:07.150> your<00:05:07.419> phone<00:05:07.630> for<00:05:07.870> calling<00:05:08.080> then<00:05:08.889> I

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
only uses your phone for calling then I

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.159 
only uses your phone for calling then I
do<00:05:09.039> recommend<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.639> case<00:05:09.909> because<00:05:10.330> it's<00:05:10.750> it's

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
do recommend this case because it's it's

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.790 
do recommend this case because it's it's
a<00:05:11.590> modern<00:05:12.099> take<00:05:12.490> on<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.389> flip<00:05:13.810> look<00:05:14.530> and

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
a modern take on that that flip look and

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.830 
a modern take on that that flip look and
if<00:05:15.639> you<00:05:15.759> do<00:05:15.909> like<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.240> look<00:05:16.389> of<00:05:16.479> this<00:05:16.630> case

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
if you do like the look of this case

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.480 
if you do like the look of this case
like<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.169> back<00:05:17.380> or<00:05:17.710> just<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.979> general<00:05:18.220> design

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
like the back or just the general design

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.420 
like the back or just the general design
but<00:05:19.479> you're<00:05:19.599> not<00:05:19.720> digging<00:05:19.990> the<00:05:20.319> front<00:05:20.860> flap

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
but you're not digging the front flap

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
just without the flip which is a little
