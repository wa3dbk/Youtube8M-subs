 say that you can transmit salmonella to

 sometimes sometimes yes and sometimes not also it is 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.019
 important to know if I'm going to put it 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.150
 bad marine inside the furnace the skin 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.040
 contracts and does not go very well 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.680
 marinated instead if I leave it to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.450
 room temperature the meat relaxes 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.530
 opens the pore and enters perfectly 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.540

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.450
 ok here as there are many lights I go 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.450

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.750

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.440

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.450
 after this I'm going to put it in the oven 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.819
 about 5 minutes because the pan is not going 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.060
