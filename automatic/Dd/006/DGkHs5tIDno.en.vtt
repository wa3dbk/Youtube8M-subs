here<00:00:58.859> today<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.969> create<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.239> fab<00:01:00.480> drawing<00:01:00.840> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
here today is to create a fab drawing so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.630 
here today is to create a fab drawing so
we're<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.129> ahead<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.609> our

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
we're going to go ahead to our

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.750 
we're going to go ahead to our
fabrication<00:01:03.329> drawing<00:01:04.070> palette<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.489> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
fabrication drawing palette and just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.149 
fabrication drawing palette and just
start<00:01:05.970> adding<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> common<00:01:07.159> common

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
start adding some of the common common

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.440 
start adding some of the common common
elements<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.000> fabrication

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
elements that are in a fabrication

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.170 
elements that are in a fabrication
drawing<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:11.189> first<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.549> might<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> drill

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
drawing the first one might be a drill

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.830 
drawing the first one might be a drill
pattern<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:14.040> comes<00:01:14.310> directly<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
pattern and this comes directly from the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620 
pattern and this comes directly from the
CAD<00:01:16.080> system<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.909> probably<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> drill

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
CAD system and we probably want to drill

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.130 
CAD system and we probably want to drill
chart<00:01:18.960> associated<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> again<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
chart associated with that and again it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
chart associated with that and again it
takes<00:01:22.380> its<00:01:22.680> information<00:01:23.310> directly<00:01:23.700> from<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
takes its information directly from the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.990 
takes its information directly from the
CAD<00:01:24.330> system<00:01:25.070> we<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.220> position<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
CAD system we can position this of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
CAD system we can position this of
course<00:01:27.030> any<00:01:27.390> place<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.590> put<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
course any place we want to here put it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.600 
course any place we want to here put it
down<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:30.470> let's<00:01:31.470> pull<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> layer<00:01:32.040> stack<00:01:32.340> up

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
down here let's pull the layer stack up

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.050 
down here let's pull the layer stack up
out<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.960> data<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.380> well<00:01:37.130> okay<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> let<00:01:38.970> me

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
out of that data as well okay and let me

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
out of that data as well okay and let me
zoom<00:01:39.090> into<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> look<00:01:40.890> at

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
zoom into that and just to get a look at

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.980 
zoom into that and just to get a look at
it<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.240> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.659> generic

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it you can see it's kind of a generic

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
it you can see it's kind of a generic
layer<00:01:43.350> stack<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.250> modify<00:01:44.579> these<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
layer stack up you can modify these you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440 
layer stack up you can modify these you
can<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> customize<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> match

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
can you can customize these to match

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.389 
can you can customize these to match
what<00:01:48.840> you're<00:01:48.990> currently<00:01:49.140> doing<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.920> create

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
what you're currently doing or create

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.569 
what you're currently doing or create
new<00:01:50.430> ones<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.049> sample<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
new ones so this is just a sample of the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.980 
new ones so this is just a sample of the
layer<00:01:53.759> stack<00:01:54.000> cups<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.960> a

blind<00:02:08.550> vias

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.069 

the<00:02:12.640> next<00:02:12.879> thing<00:02:13.030> we<00:02:13.150> might<00:02:13.299> add<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:14.049> some

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
the next thing we might add is some

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:20.039 
the next thing we might add is some
fabrication<00:02:14.980> notes<00:02:17.370> okay<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.450> let's<00:02:19.659> zoom<00:02:19.900> in

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
fabrication notes okay and let's zoom in

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.479 
fabrication notes okay and let's zoom in
on<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.349> so<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> can<00:02:20.739> take<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> look<00:02:21.129> at<00:02:21.340> what

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
on that so you can take a look at what

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.599 
on that so you can take a look at what
we're<00:02:21.609> doing<00:02:21.819> with<00:02:21.969> fabrication<00:02:22.450> notes

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
we're doing with fabrication notes

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.830 
we're doing with fabrication notes
fabrication<00:02:24.609> notes<00:02:24.849> or<00:02:25.090> any<00:02:25.299> notes<00:02:25.599> in

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
fabrication notes or any notes in

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.830 
fabrication notes or any notes in
blueprint<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.459> view<00:02:27.819> blueprint<00:02:28.629> as<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
blueprint so you can view blueprint as a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.599 
blueprint so you can view blueprint as a
word<00:02:29.079> processor<00:02:29.859> as<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.099> can<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.400> we've<00:02:30.579> done

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
word processor as you can see we've done

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.880 
word processor as you can see we've done
some<00:02:30.970> spellcheck<00:02:31.510> here<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:32.349> course<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:32.739> can

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
some spellcheck here of course we can

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.530 
some spellcheck here of course we can
add<00:02:33.040> these<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.430> our<00:02:33.459> dictionary<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.090> as<00:02:34.420> you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
add these to our dictionary just as you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.410 
add these to our dictionary just as you
would<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:34.900> any<00:02:35.250> any<00:02:36.250> word<00:02:36.519> processor<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.209> they

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
would in any any word processor and they

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.490 
would in any any word processor and they
won't<00:02:37.599> come<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.930> as<00:02:38.250> potential<00:02:39.250> errors<00:02:40.500> you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
won't come up as potential errors you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.339 
won't come up as potential errors you
can<00:02:41.650> see<00:02:41.889> that<00:02:42.480> pretty<00:02:43.480> standard<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.079> know

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
can see that pretty standard you know

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.199 
can see that pretty standard you know
you<00:02:44.409> can<00:02:44.650> take<00:02:44.799> a<00:02:44.829> note<00:02:45.129> here<00:02:45.579> you<00:02:45.609> can<00:02:45.909> move<00:02:46.090> it

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
you can take a note here you can move it

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.059 
you can take a note here you can move it
up<00:02:46.359> you<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.689> move<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.989> down<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.709> course<00:02:47.920> it

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
up you can move it down and of course it

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.860 
up you can move it down and of course it
automatically<00:02:48.549> read<00:02:48.819> numbers<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.510> you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
automatically read numbers for you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.659 
automatically read numbers for you
you<00:02:50.409> don't<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.829> think<00:02:51.069> about<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> things

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
you don't have to think about the things

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.460 
you don't have to think about the things
if<00:02:51.939> you're<00:02:52.090> doing<00:02:52.329> this<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.659> a<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.200> CAD

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
if you're doing this in a in a CAD

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.159 
if you're doing this in a in a CAD
system<00:02:54.010> where<00:02:54.909> it's<00:02:55.090> unintelligent<00:02:55.870> about

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
system where it's unintelligent about

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.220 
system where it's unintelligent about
you<00:02:56.409> know<00:02:56.530> re<00:02:57.220> numbering<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.060> deleting<00:02:58.900> notes

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
you know re numbering and deleting notes

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.399 
you know re numbering and deleting notes
that<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:01.510> don't<00:03:01.659> make<00:03:01.840> sense<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.290> not

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
that that don't make sense and not

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.129 
that that don't make sense and not
having<00:03:02.560> your<00:03:02.769> numbers<00:03:03.599> update<00:03:04.599> automatically

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
having your numbers update automatically

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.839 
having your numbers update automatically
as<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.349> matter<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.590> fact<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:05.980> can<00:03:06.129> go<00:03:06.220> in<00:03:06.370> here<00:03:06.400> and

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
as a matter of fact I can go in here and

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.330 
as a matter of fact I can go in here and
you<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.530> create<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.590> call<00:03:08.799> out<00:03:09.010> by<00:03:09.159> that

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
you know and create a call out by that

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.129 
you know and create a call out by that
number<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.470> maybe<00:03:11.470> point<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.159> something

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
number and maybe point this to something

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.659 
number and maybe point this to something
maybe<00:03:14.139> we'll<00:03:14.290> take<00:03:14.439> it<00:03:14.590> over<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.950> our<00:03:15.099> to<00:03:15.609> our

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
maybe we'll take it over to our to our

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.789 
maybe we'll take it over to our to our
layer<00:03:15.879> stack<00:03:16.180> up<00:03:16.389> and<00:03:19.319> we'll<00:03:20.319> put<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.470> call

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
layer stack up and we'll put that call

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.430 
layer stack up and we'll put that call
out<00:03:20.829> there<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.519> now<00:03:22.449> you'll<00:03:22.750> notice<00:03:23.139> that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
out there and now you'll notice that

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.770 
out there and now you'll notice that
what<00:03:23.739> I'll<00:03:23.889> do<00:03:24.069> is<00:03:24.250> I'll<00:03:24.400> move<00:03:24.609> this<00:03:24.879> up<00:03:25.599> and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
what I'll do is I'll move this up and

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.550 
what I'll do is I'll move this up and
down<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:26.199> my<00:03:27.419> in<00:03:28.419> my<00:03:28.479> notes<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.169> you<00:03:29.260> notice

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
down in my in my notes and you notice

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.599 
down in my in my notes and you notice
that<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.569> numbering<00:03:31.979> updates<00:03:32.979> automatically

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
that the numbering updates automatically

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.159 
that the numbering updates automatically
for<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.879> something<00:03:34.359> again<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:34.810> don't<00:03:35.049> have

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
for you something again you don't have

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.770 
for you something again you don't have
to<00:03:35.290> worry<00:03:35.530> about<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:36.519> can<00:03:37.090> click<00:03:37.329> on<00:03:37.479> any<00:03:37.659> of

documentation you know basically I'm
linked<00:03:43.209> right<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.139> note<00:03:44.409> and<00:03:44.590> even<00:03:44.769> if

it's on another page I can link directly
to<00:03:47.169> that<00:03:47.409> note<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:52.269> last<00:03:52.449> thing<00:03:52.750> we<00:03:52.900> might

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
to that note the last thing we might

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.009 
to that note the last thing we might
want<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.319> do<00:03:53.500> here<00:03:53.859> with<00:03:54.099> our<00:03:54.479> our<00:03:55.479> fabrication

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
want to do here with our our fabrication

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.479 
want to do here with our our fabrication
drawing<00:03:56.470> we're<00:03:56.650> getting<00:03:56.889> pretty<00:03:57.099> well<00:03:57.250> long

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
drawing we're getting pretty well long

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.640 
drawing we're getting pretty well long
as<00:03:57.519> maybe<00:03:57.879> add<00:03:58.090> some<00:03:58.299> dimensions

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
as maybe add some dimensions

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.589 
as maybe add some dimensions
we'll<00:04:00.129> use<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:00.579> auto<00:04:00.760> dimensioning<00:04:01.359> here

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
we'll use the auto dimensioning here

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.909 
we'll use the auto dimensioning here
just<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.930> show<00:04:02.079> how<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.319> works<00:04:02.709> where<00:04:02.859> you

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
just to show how that works where you

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.390 
just to show how that works where you
basically<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.489> just<00:04:03.699> pull<00:04:03.909> dimensions<00:04:04.359> off

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
basically can just pull dimensions off

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.159 
basically can just pull dimensions off
or<00:04:06.400> we<00:04:06.760> can<00:04:06.909> use<00:04:06.939> datum<00:04:07.419> dimensioning<00:04:07.959> where

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
or we can use datum dimensioning where

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.920 
or we can use datum dimensioning where
we<00:04:08.319> basically<00:04:08.799> add<00:04:08.949> a<00:04:08.979> datum<00:04:09.340> point<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:13.359> I<00:04:13.810> had

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
we basically add a datum point and I had

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.640 
we basically add a datum point and I had
one<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.259> other<00:04:14.290> axis<00:04:14.949> and<00:04:16.289> then<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.409> just

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
one the other axis and then you just

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.339 
one the other axis and then you just
simply<00:04:17.919> drag<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.060> drop<00:04:19.120> dimensions<00:04:19.930> wherever

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
simply drag and drop dimensions wherever

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.940 
simply drag and drop dimensions wherever
you<00:04:20.529> need<00:04:20.739> them

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.750 

and<00:04:23.580> any<00:04:24.210> any<00:04:24.960> outside<00:04:25.620> feature<00:04:25.950> any<00:04:26.400> feature

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
and any any outside feature any feature

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.420 
and any any outside feature any feature
inside<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.390> board<00:04:27.660> basically<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:29.280> can

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
inside the board basically you can

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.090 
inside the board basically you can
simply<00:04:29.760> drag<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.180> drop<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.390> dimension<00:04:31.100> so

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
simply drag and drop a dimension so

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.200 
simply drag and drop a dimension so
there<00:04:32.370> we've<00:04:32.640> quickly<00:04:33.090> created<00:04:33.690> a

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
there we've quickly created a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.760 
there we've quickly created a
fabrication<00:04:36.210> drawing<00:04:36.690> let's<00:04:37.080> zoom<00:04:37.320> out<00:04:37.500> take

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
fabrication drawing let's zoom out take

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.270 
fabrication drawing let's zoom out take
a<00:04:37.800> look<00:04:38.040> at<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.340> here<00:04:39.290> in<00:04:40.290> another<00:04:40.590> video<00:04:41.010> we'll

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
a look at it here in another video we'll

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.820 
a look at it here in another video we'll
talk<00:04:41.400> about<00:04:41.460> how<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.850> can<00:04:42.150> create

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
talk about how you can create

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.260 
talk about how you can create
placeholders<00:04:43.830> for<00:04:43.860> all<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.400> these<00:04:44.550> stack<00:04:45.000> UPS

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
placeholders for all of these stack UPS

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.900 
placeholders for all of these stack UPS
patterns<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.290> drill<00:04:46.470> charts<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.070> then<00:04:47.670> just

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
patterns and drill charts and then just

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.790 
patterns and drill charts and then just
import<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.420> data<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.810> have<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.960> populate

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
import the data and have it populate

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.650 
import the data and have it populate
automatically<00:04:50.310> as<00:04:50.520> opposed<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:50.940> dragging<00:04:51.510> and

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
automatically as opposed to dragging and

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.480 
automatically as opposed to dragging and
dropping<00:04:51.780> but<00:04:52.710> that'll<00:04:52.890> be<00:04:52.980> in<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.100> later<00:04:53.280> video

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
dropping but that'll be in a later video

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.310 
dropping but that'll be in a later video
on<00:04:53.940> blueprint<00:04:54.510> PCB<00:04:54.960> thank<00:04:55.770> you<00:04:55.860> for<00:04:56.010> your<00:04:56.130> time
