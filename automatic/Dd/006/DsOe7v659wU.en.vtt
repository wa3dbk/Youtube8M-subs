00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello what diving training choose 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.400
 the best is the one that will happen 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.679
 with the trainer you appreciate the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.780
 more then you have to know that there is 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.219
 two great diving schools in the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.180
 world 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.550
 the french school the ffs m or the nnpc 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 essentially mentally and the American school 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.090
 not said who is very recognized everywhere 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.789
 in the world 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 what you need to know is that the purpose of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.740
 these two organizations is that you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.750
 find pleasure in diving 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 so whatever your choice you do not 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.780
 will not be disappointed if you wish 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.469
 start with French training 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 this is the French level 1 or the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.420
 20 divers supervised 20 m if you 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 want to choose the organization 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.300
 pale American this is the open 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.989
 water not ten divers framed up 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 18 meters 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.649
 so these two formations are 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.260
 recognize each other since there is 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 equivalences so anyway 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 you will not be disappointed what you need 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 know little difference between school 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.530
 French American school that is bound 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 at their origin the most French school 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.150
 old that was done by 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 sports and military divers so 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 with fairly strong constraints and a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 diving rather engaged ie 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.689
 with a race to the depth and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.360
 no hesitation to the east enough 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.890
 deep to need to do some 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 stops what are called the levels of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 decompression before going back up so the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.820
 French formations without logically 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.479
 especially in the levels after seeing it 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 more demanding, particularly with regard to 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.829
 rescue since you do not have the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.579
 right necessarily to regain the surface 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.450
 no matter how to avoid 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.579
 decompression sickness problems 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 if you do not follow the procedure of 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.049
 go back very precise school 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.610
 american not say she was not born 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.219
 after the war as a French school but 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.140
 rather in the 80's and so she 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.850
 is made with a general public approach 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.750
 it's diving for everyone 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.430
 caricaturing to say at 2 7 seconds 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.020
 seven years or 9 to 999 years the meli 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.429
 principle is to dive the whole 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.320
 world is therefore to dive and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.030
 safe while in school 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.250
 French we accept at level iii by 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.290
 example go up to 60 meters in 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.000
 the weekend economy can not say everything 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.850
 the dives will be up to 30 meters 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.700
 maximum unless you have the specialty 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 deep or there you can the 40 meters 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.420
 but anyway at padiÃ© in 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.940
 limit the risks in 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.920
 making the bearings of the dives forgiveness 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.590
 no-stop cuts it's up to 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.720
 say in the safety curve of any 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.080
 way to start level at school 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.910
 french ffs drowned mp or open 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.450
 water not say you're going to feast 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.190
 you will learn to evolve in 18 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.950
 20 meters back while making fun in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.410
 group accompanied by a guide 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.440
 so here's a little bit to enlighten you on 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.520
 the two big types of training that we 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.890
 find on the market 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.780
 anyway it gives us a lot 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.810
 of pleasure and the best it is still 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.330
 choose a training that doubles the 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.370
 skills but anyway they get 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.340
 recognize each other through 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.650
 agreements 30 personal equivalence 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.000
 I hope to have enlightened you and perhaps 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.000
 see you soon on a pot of honey bread like
