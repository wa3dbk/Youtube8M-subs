00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.810
 review and today there is ashley young in 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.660
 form of a left-back kim 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:56.430
 on the cards 80s overall rating here 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:01:00.640
 780 tempo 84 dribbling 74 78 pass 36 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.820
 56 61 and 70 major middle right foot 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.910
 drive forest has done with 25 bald 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.369
 cost in four games a whole 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.020
 template made so an absolute can 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.540
 yes, let's say look 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.670
 his ingame sets the yes physical 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.250
 further away are quite good as attributes 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.440
 we are for a left wing 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.509
 really nice for a left 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.250
 outside linebacker 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.590
 jack crabb rhyme at this point before 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.790
 Darwin and I can already mine 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.520
 girlfriend say people why was why 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.140
 want to see than in the form of the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.240
 Easter days first with the positive 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.100
 things to be fast with 780 tembo 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.720
 dribbling is really good at 84 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.030
 he can still flank in it will be the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.950
 a template made the offensive 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.390
 Walks are okay too so better 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.979
 had as originally designed 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.600
 his shot is not okay 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.040
 noteworthy or not really 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.360
 got better only a shot apple 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 so that was nothing special 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.930
 and of course the researcher it is therefore 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.630
 for every player the bbl ski team 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.900
 would like to taarabt with all or so is still 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.440
 we'll be fine 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.940
 bad things for this song we 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.970
 and that is my body 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.980
 Strengthen this course with 50 outstanding 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.709
 in Iran is really great 50 degrees 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.269
 stronger than fullback superstate 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.680
 he wins every battle so 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.630
 In general , that's a bit difficult 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.070
 defenders accessories like jews because so 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.440
 to see is always a bit 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.000
 complicated then you can at least at 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.799
 you have to defend then if you do not 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.690
 so much offensive action has the 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.390
 I have a defense action 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.790
 tried at ashley young 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.930
 unfortunately not really a fight in the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.190
 defensive won 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.860
 really not just now 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.020
 weak on the defensive so on 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.709
 bad positional game has no 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.780
 change 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.590
 but that's on the worst party 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.760
 the left defender that only exists 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.310
 the actually also left wing 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.030
 or so is less defending than 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.139
 ashley young 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.969
 so even bronze left wing is waiting 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.769
 which was to the left outside linebacker 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.439
 or to the left defender has 3d 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.849
 fanning more the better too 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.129
 few days so has a few weeks 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.019
 from the war always the resourceful what 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.370
 the fuck parties can also be the type 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.769
 Not at all there are so many alternatives 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.150
 in the bbl i explain my because it 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.889
 my defender in the bbl custom 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.230
 clichy if you have one 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.430
 English defenders were rbpl bains 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.500
 because it is unconditional English 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.879
 defenders of manchester united 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.099
 needs luxor 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.989
 you can just replace it completely 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.129
 and if you think so ok then 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.829
 I just send him in the game 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.730
 left wing that we made too 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.290
 you do not need to do it then you can 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.120
 also his normal card next to 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.459
 it is from normal left wing 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.260
 I needed to change the game and the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.819
 Values ​​are felt no matter what the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.739
 adapted to offensive stuff yes 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.120
 not much would you even be in shape 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.510
 a little better than his in shape now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.849
 here 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.040
 if I have left left 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.629
 in the front, that's why it does not work 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.669
 ashley young in shape to buy whole 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.470
 just more if direct 5.0 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.870
 thumb down does not bring him anything that 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.430
 25 degrees you can also your grandma 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.930
 like to pay him more than eight 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.970
 to make marriage to ashley young 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.709
 I hope that michael video has you 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.849
 like 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.470
 I wish them a nice day the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.879

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.109
