impedance of less than 10 which is

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.140 
impedance of less than 10 which is
obviously<00:00:52.290> very<00:00:52.380> important<00:00:53.040> for<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.400> sensitive

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
obviously very important for a sensitive

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.840 
obviously very important for a sensitive
in<00:00:54.390> years<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.650> addition<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.010> being<00:00:56.610> a

it also has a lot of phone controls so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.340 
it also has a lot of phone controls so
if<00:01:03.149> you're<00:01:03.270> using<00:01:03.480> something<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.019> doesn't

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
if you're using something that doesn't

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.069 
if you're using something that doesn't
have<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:05.220> key<00:01:05.369> controls<00:01:05.759> on<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> cable<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
have my key controls on the cable you

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.810 
have my key controls on the cable you
can<00:01:07.110> take<00:01:07.409> calls<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.520> an

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
my p.m. threes and did drive them to a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.100 
my p.m. threes and did drive them to a
list<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.630> level<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.580> wasn't<00:01:31.480> quite<00:01:31.900> as

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
list of the level but it wasn't quite as

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.040 
list of the level but it wasn't quite as
loud<00:01:32.350> as<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:34.000> might<00:01:34.120> hope<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:34.540> I'm<00:01:34.630> certainly

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
loud as one might hope but I'm certainly

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.350 
loud as one might hope but I'm certainly
on<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.290> on<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.710> in-ear<00:01:36.640> monitors<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.270> would

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
on the on the in-ear monitors it would

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.390 
on the on the in-ear monitors it would
have<00:01:37.480> plenty<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:37.990> juices<00:01:38.800> right<00:01:38.980> now<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.220> said

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
have plenty of juices right now you said

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.820 
have plenty of juices right now you said
10<00:01:39.700> less<00:01:40.240> than<00:01:40.450> 10<00:01:40.630> mile<00:01:40.870> put<00:01:41.050> in<00:01:41.140> place<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.650> 10

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
10 less than 10 mile put in place and 10

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.740 
10 less than 10 mile put in place and 10
Mountain<00:01:42.250> impedance<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.090> has<00:01:43.270> actually

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
Mountain impedance and it has actually

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.460 
Mountain impedance and it has actually
really<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:45.430> we<00:01:45.550> feel<00:01:45.760> like<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:46.150> nice<00:01:47.020> nice

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
really what we feel like a nice nice

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.900 
really what we feel like a nice nice
battery<00:01:47.920> about<00:01:48.100> seven<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.640> eight<00:01:48.700> hours

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
battery about seven to eight hours

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.090 
battery about seven to eight hours
continuous<00:01:49.630> oh<00:01:49.750> cool<00:01:50.050> this<00:01:50.260> listening<00:01:50.740> yeah<00:01:51.070> I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
continuous oh cool this listening yeah I

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.710 
continuous oh cool this listening yeah I
mean<00:01:51.220> seven<00:01:51.640> eight<00:01:51.760> hours<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.240> pretty<00:01:52.450> much

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
mean seven eight hours is pretty much
