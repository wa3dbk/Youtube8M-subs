I<00:00:36.050> want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> commend<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> both<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.040> building

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
I want to commend you both on building

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.479 
I want to commend you both on building
the<00:00:38.489> space<00:00:38.790> bridge<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.239> record<00:00:39.629> time<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> how

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the space bridge in record time so how

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.640 
the space bridge in record time so how
long<00:00:41.760> till<00:00:42.000> were<00:00:42.090> operational<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:43.470> would

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
long till were operational we would

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.009 
long till were operational we would
already<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:44.190> operational<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.239> someone<00:00:45.840> had

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
already be operational if someone had

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.990 
already be operational if someone had
bothered<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.440> recalibrate<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.489> transwarp

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
bothered to recalibrate the transwarp

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840 
bothered to recalibrate the transwarp
mute<00:00:48.360> sequences<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.620> wouldn't<00:00:50.040> have<00:00:50.519> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
mute sequences we wouldn't have to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.540 
mute sequences we wouldn't have to
recalibrate<00:00:51.269> if<00:00:51.860> someone<00:00:52.860> could<00:00:53.129> accept<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
recalibrate if someone could accept the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
recalibrate if someone could accept the
fact<00:00:53.790> that<00:00:53.850> his<00:00:54.030> calculations<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
fact that his calculations for the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
fact that his calculations for the
transwarp<00:00:55.530> field<00:00:55.860> sequencers<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.610> wrong

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
transwarp field sequencers are wrong

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.720 
transwarp field sequencers are wrong
well<00:00:57.480> leave<00:00:57.809> -<00:00:58.410> someone's<00:00:59.100> had<00:00:59.250> let<00:00:59.400> me<00:00:59.519> help

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
well leave - someone's had let me help

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
well leave - someone's had let me help
like<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.000> offered<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.870> could<00:01:01.049> have<00:01:01.170> got<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
like I offered we could have got it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.009 
like I offered we could have got it
right<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:01.890> time

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
right the first time

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
right the first time
no<00:01:04.019> offense<00:01:04.470> sorry<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.370> I<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:06.299> think

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
no offense sorry but I don't think

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
no offense sorry but I don't think
there's<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.049> much<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.500> could<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> help

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there's that much you could do to help

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.910 
there's that much you could do to help
without<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.850> key<00:01:09.090> even<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.290> had<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
without your key even if you had it you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
without your key even if you had it you
don't<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.369> background<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.150> astrophysics

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
don't have a background in astrophysics

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.130 
don't have a background in astrophysics
and<00:01:13.320> quantum<00:01:13.680> electrodynamics<00:01:14.670> yeah<00:01:15.240> even<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and quantum electrodynamics yeah even I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710 
and quantum electrodynamics yeah even I
didn't<00:01:16.500> pick<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.070> space<00:01:17.369> bridge<00:01:17.729> overnight

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
didn't pick up my space bridge overnight

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.859 
didn't pick up my space bridge overnight
well<00:01:19.530> let's<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> savvy<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> work<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
well let's put that savvy to work it's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
well let's put that savvy to work it's
only<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.229> matter<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.590> time<00:01:22.920> until<00:01:22.950> Megatron

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
only a matter of time until Megatron

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.969 
only a matter of time until Megatron
gains<00:01:24.090> control<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.540> omega<00:01:24.960> supreme<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.770> stops

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
gains control of omega supreme and stops

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.330 
gains control of omega supreme and stops
trans<00:01:26.340> warping<00:01:26.790> randomly<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.720> galaxy

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
trans warping randomly around the galaxy

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
trans warping randomly around the galaxy
we<00:01:29.340> need<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.729> find<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.180> before<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.630> happens

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we need to find them before that happens

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.209 
we need to find them before that happens
huh<00:01:32.159> fine<00:01:32.969> I'll<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.840> recalibrate<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> beard

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
huh fine I'll just recalibrate the beard

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.029 
huh fine I'll just recalibrate the beard
sequencers<00:01:35.789> myself<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:37.020> before<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.679> the

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
sequencers myself not before I do the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.730 
sequencers myself not before I do the
calculations<00:01:38.729> myself<00:01:39.359> you<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
calculations myself you think that I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
calculations myself you think that I
cannot<00:01:41.159> isolate<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.700> transwarp<00:01:42.299> frequency

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
cannot isolate a transwarp frequency

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.620 
cannot isolate a transwarp frequency
barrier<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.340> saying<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.450> have

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
barrier I'm just saying you don't have

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:58.279 
barrier I'm just saying you don't have
the<00:01:45.869> same<00:01:46.079> experiences<00:01:56.299> fixed<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.659> was

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
the same experiences fixed it I was

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:06.469 
the same experiences fixed it I was
under<00:01:58.560> great<00:01:58.590> duress<00:01:59.569> no<00:02:00.569> that's<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:01.109> boy<00:02:05.479> now

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
under great duress no that's my boy now

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.790 
under great duress no that's my boy now
that<00:02:06.749> I<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.259> attention

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.740 

sorry<00:02:14.800> how<00:02:15.520> did<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.970> what<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.150> do<00:02:16.450> I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
sorry how did you know what to do I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.059 
sorry how did you know what to do I
don't<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.280> just<00:02:18.910> kind<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.540> did

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.479 

it's<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.280> very<00:02:27.580> simple<00:02:28.090> question<00:02:29.489> something

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
it's a very simple question something

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.220 
it's a very simple question something
even<00:02:30.760> your<00:02:30.970> limited<00:02:31.480> circuits<00:02:31.900> should<00:02:32.110> be

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
even your limited circuits should be

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.250 
even your limited circuits should be
able<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.500> compute<00:02:33.239> where<00:02:34.239> are<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.569> Decepticon
