 latina or the spectacular spiderman in 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.200
 Spain 'is an animated series 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.060
 American based on comics 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.970
 original spider-man 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.040
 created by stan lee and steve ditko although 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.380
 there are also references to other sources 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.330
 of spider-man such as the trilogy 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.090
 film and the comics of ultimate 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.400
 spider-man peter parker starts as a 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.410
 high school student teenager 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.510
 the new show has aspects of anguish 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.310
 teenager in a modern world with 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 modern social tools like 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.930
 mobile phones messaging bar 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.620
 text combined with pseudoscience for 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.989
 create several super villains 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.060
 as the angel said the story is based 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.709
 in the original comics in the comic 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.260
 ultimate and in the movie trilogy 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.659
 of tobey maguire that's why coherence 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.430
 of its history is good for example in 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.409
 the battles peters he manages to 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.150
 beat the villains is not like the 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.790
 typical well- named superhero that 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.670
 destroy everything without forgetting the song of 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.610
 intro that is fucking mother xd but 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.440
 like everything good there is something wrong for me 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.720
 the only flaw is the design of the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.060
 characters makes me childish now me 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.610
 will tell you some curious facts 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.520
 I come with some curious data 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.160
 only 1x of the original idea was to reach 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.310
 the 65 episodes of the spider-man series 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.650
 the animated series and the other one I'm going to 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.530
 say me ball of subnormales xdddd 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.900
 although it is not official the series ended 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.989
 for misunderstandings between marvel song and 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.390
 Walt Disney is believed that the dispute 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.769
 originated by whoever had the rights to 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.769
 character television 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.250
 well I qualify the spectacular 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.890

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.590
