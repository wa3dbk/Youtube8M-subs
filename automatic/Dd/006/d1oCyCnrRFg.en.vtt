00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 just like in the movies sometimes the world 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.180
 of video games has 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.400
 budgets that could feed a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.500
 small nation and sometimes those 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.630
 budgets are spent only on the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.519
 catering because the game ends up being 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.640
 of rubber so today we present 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.640
 this transfer of the worst games more 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.689
 expensive of history put number 5 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.849
 between the matrix 20 for the greens 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.760
 james earl the matrix was a very expensive 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.890
 idea that he intended to unite everything 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.530
 what happened between matrix reloaded and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 matrix revolutions but counted from the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 will smith woman character 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 sadly wash us a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 toothpicks in the eye and shake it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.460
 for all sides would not only make the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.680
 game look better but the character 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.489
 would react better than if we did not see the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.570
 joystick same our number 4 and pippin 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.260
 reloaded 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.410
 million dollars although apt managed 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.540
 the same premise of 7 to 5 years online 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.430
 before its launch not only to the day 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.710
 today nobody understands what they spent 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.900
 50 million since it looked like 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.610
 any other game and not only that but 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.770
 that unless we were inside 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.500
 specific missions our shots do not 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.170
 They hurt a few players who 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.350
 they anticipated to buy it the indifference is 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.990
 the best bulletproof vest good in 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.600
 reality put number 3 says baker 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.880
 also at 50 million dollars this 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.979
 is the pegasus was the intent of a thousand white 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.350
 to join the gta wave but in the 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.210
 the most festive city in the world where 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.729
 you could go to the casino already 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.509
 In addition to distributing lead alone 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.460
 because yes because then it's worse than 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.830
 cost the same simply because those 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.930
 50 million was the entire budget of 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.610
 said company and ended up breaking before 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.610
 can not even finish it 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.630
 what a bad place number 2 add up to 60 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.210
 green millions this title to play 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.060
 began its development in 99 and I see 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.310
 pass the 1 the 2 and the 3 until 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.400
 finally ended up coming out on xbox 360 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.770
 similar to a devil but cybernetic if 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.960
 the devil would have been to the fire is believed 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.790
 that the 60 million were spent on all 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.890
 the times that were reprinted 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.640
 changing covers and saw how 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:30.880
 except the toner is very expensive our 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.400
 number one wise in soo 366 million 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.430
 Dollars 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.560
 Cool 6-3 became a milestone in the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.480
 world of video games at the time 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.549
 that in order to run he needed 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.189
 borrow the computer from the 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.930
 nasa however when the game came to 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.480
 the consoles we could see that their 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.209
 beautiful graphics hid something worse 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.099
 that a horrible personality is saying 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.769
 a horrible game with aliens that we 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.840
 they were neither challenging anyone anything 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.840
 wallet kills perfect beau
