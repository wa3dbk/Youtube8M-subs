00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
mark for drilling now or later so the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.179 
mark for drilling now or later so the
template<00:01:17.539> can<00:01:17.719> be<00:01:17.840> used<00:01:18.020> traditionally<00:01:18.740> to

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
template can be used traditionally to

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.179 
template can be used traditionally to
place<00:01:19.820> over<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.329> clay<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.810> cut<00:01:21.170> or<00:01:21.469> you<00:01:21.500> can

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
place over the clay and cut or you can

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.849 
place over the clay and cut or you can
actually<00:01:22.670> roll<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.630> template<00:01:24.020> into<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.590> clay

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
actually roll the template into the clay

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.609 
actually roll the template into the clay
and<00:01:25.130> create<00:01:25.969> a<00:01:26.149> mark<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:27.020> shows<00:01:27.049> where<00:01:27.500> you

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
and create a mark that shows where you

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.190 
and create a mark that shows where you
should<00:01:27.799> cut<00:01:27.979> afterwards<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.969> this<00:01:29.600> allows<00:01:29.929> me

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
should cut afterwards and this allows me

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.039 
should cut afterwards and this allows me
to<00:01:30.229> use<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:31.219> findings<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.759> bales<00:01:32.000> template<00:01:32.570> so

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
to use the findings in bales template so

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.569 
to use the findings in bales template so
that<00:01:33.079> I<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:33.469> create<00:01:33.619> an<00:01:33.979> integrated<00:01:34.640> finding

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
that I can create an integrated finding

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.789 
that I can create an integrated finding
so<00:01:37.579> I<00:01:37.609> make<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.149> impression<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.929> then<00:01:39.469> I<00:01:39.500> cut

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
so I make the impression and then I cut

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.490 
so I make the impression and then I cut
around<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.159> clay<00:01:40.539> remove<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.719> excess<00:01:42.170> and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
around the clay remove the excess and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.739 
around the clay remove the excess and
allow<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.340> dry<00:01:45.850> once<00:01:46.850> your<00:01:47.119> pieces<00:01:47.329> are

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
allow this to dry once your pieces are

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.870 
allow this to dry once your pieces are
dried<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:48.679> you<00:01:48.859> can<00:01:49.039> do<00:01:49.189> whatever<00:01:49.520> type<00:01:49.759> of

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
dried then you can do whatever type of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.999 
dried then you can do whatever type of
refining<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.539> you<00:01:50.659> want<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.960> do<00:01:51.109> and<00:01:51.409> the
