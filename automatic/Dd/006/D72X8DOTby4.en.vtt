00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 until I throw in the sky 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.890
 at least it's up that go 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.019
 the fangs gratitude 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.319
 the saints also expect a gift up there 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.329
 not of the law but of the federation of paulista of soccer 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.460
 in são paulo a helicopter is ready to take off 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.249
 only need to know the destination 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.359
 saints or mogi mirim 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.039
 for the first time the cup will reach through the air I want to the glass with 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.569
 jackets work for this very well 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.059
 No one believed in this badly reinstated team. 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 as a permanent source of inspiration 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.780
 now the fans do not have doubts spread the certainty of the title to who 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.980
 you want to read 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.000
 and heard 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.470
 loose stadium speakers are mute 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.470
 did not report anything about Sao Paulo's victory in Mogi 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 maybe because guess what the saints will not need 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.570
 the crowd felt that the goal was coming 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.100
 and the fan stays in that doubt 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.330
 see I do not see the same amazement eight goals 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.710
 Whomever is cleber santana 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.480
 heart-headed goal 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.180
 swimming sickness also flies 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.620
 the newspaper 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.210
 even with the idol of the fans injured the saints seems predestined to be 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.920
 champion 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.510
 kleber caprichar 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.950
 that even an opponent takes advantage 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.440
 leonardo da portuguesa makes a goal against 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 see from this angle the astonishment of the goalkeeper gléguer 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.190
 reinaldo also does not believe in what he sees 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.640
 can celebrate and in the goal lapa that goal is gone 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 while the Santista does not know civil if cries of emotion 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 on the other side of the grandstand there is already a sad certainty 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.370
 the Portuguese 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.630
 the tears of the fans fall into this endless chasm in which the team sank at 36 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.310
 minutes of the second time the helicopter takes flight in são paulo 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.790
 in the avaí he among the skyscrapers 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.159
 the trophy says goodbye to city symbols 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.919
 He does not have anything else to do in the capital. 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.579
 by right he is from now on the saints soccer club 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 bad weather is the last opponent of the championship 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.120
 the trophy will go down the mountain in Luxembourg will not wait to see 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.060
 He does not have the habit of celebrating alone in the locker room. 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:29.849
 so far 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.849
 21 years of waiting good finish 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.619
 and there comes the flying fish block breaking two taboos at once 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.699
 since 1965 the saints were not champion at home 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.770
 were 41 years of waiting for this epic battle 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.900
 since the days of near football had forgotten that the village belmiro was 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.669
 also 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:59.409
 a large ballroom with screams from the crowd mingles with the noise of the lc 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.909
 welcome the glass
