00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.430 

the<00:00:02.159> purpose<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.760> nitrate<00:00:03.210> test<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.780> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
the purpose of the nitrate test is to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.280 
the purpose of the nitrate test is to
tell<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:04.980> whether<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.670> have<00:00:05.850> bacteria<00:00:06.509> that

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
tell you whether you have bacteria that

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.089 
tell you whether you have bacteria that
are<00:00:07.350> capable<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:08.099> reducing<00:00:08.420> nitrate<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:10.099> so

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
are capable of reducing nitrate and so

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.299 
are capable of reducing nitrate and so
if<00:00:11.309> nitrate<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.120> indeed<00:00:12.660> reduced<00:00:13.139> what<00:00:13.980> occurs

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
if nitrate is indeed reduced what occurs

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.170 
if nitrate is indeed reduced what occurs
is<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.940> nitrate<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.680> converted<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
is that the nitrate is converted to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.130 
is that the nitrate is converted to
nitrite<00:00:19.310> some<00:00:20.310> bacteria<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.119> reduce<00:00:21.449> nitrite

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
nitrite some bacteria can reduce nitrite

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.820 
nitrite some bacteria can reduce nitrite
even<00:00:22.529> further<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.430> produce<00:00:23.820> these<00:00:24.420> things

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
even further to produce these things

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
even further to produce these things
ammonia<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.070> nitrogen<00:00:26.430> gas<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> basically

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
ammonia and nitrogen gas so basically

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.080 
ammonia and nitrogen gas so basically
what<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.099> saying<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.910> have

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
what we're saying here is that you have

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
what we're saying here is that you have
if<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.539> bacteria<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:32.040> capable<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
if you have bacteria that are capable of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.680 
if you have bacteria that are capable of
reducing<00:00:33.210> nitrate<00:00:33.660> any<00:00:34.460> of<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.670> stuff<00:00:35.820> can

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
reducing nitrate any of this stuff can

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.360 
reducing nitrate any of this stuff can
be<00:00:36.750> produced<00:00:37.260> right<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.920> any<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
be produced right so if any of this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.780 
be produced right so if any of this
stuff<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:39.440> in<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.649> tube<00:00:40.920> after<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
stuff is in your tube after the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
stuff is in your tube after the
incubation<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.320> indicates<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
incubation then that indicates that the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.139 
incubation then that indicates that the
nitrate<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:45.300> reduced<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
nitrate was reduced so a kind of the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
nitrate was reduced so a kind of the
trick<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.840> figuring<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.680> whether<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
trick then to figuring out whether the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
trick then to figuring out whether the
nitrate<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.030> fact<00:00:51.239> reduced<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> look

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
nitrate was in fact reduced is to a look

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.459 
nitrate was in fact reduced is to a look
for<00:00:53.399> any<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:54.000> substances<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> test

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
for any of these substances in the test

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.630 
for any of these substances in the test
tube<00:00:55.559> after<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.000> incubation<00:00:57.750> period<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.640> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
tube after the incubation period and so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
tube after the incubation period and so
how<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> how<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> tell

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
how do you do that how do you a tell

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.310 
how do you do that how do you a tell
whether<00:01:01.680> any<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.280> stuff<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.699> produced

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
whether any of this stuff was produced

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
whether any of this stuff was produced
first<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.830> tell<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> how<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.939> see<00:01:06.150> if

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
first of all will tell you how to see if

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.830 
first of all will tell you how to see if
nitrites<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> test<00:01:08.159> tube<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.479> how

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
nitrites are in the test tube and so how

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.580 
nitrites are in the test tube and so how
do<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.020> test<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> presence<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> nitrites

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
do we test for the presence of nitrites

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.929 
do we test for the presence of nitrites
well<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> turns<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.580> stuff

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
well it turns out that we have stuff

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.170 
well it turns out that we have stuff
that<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.869> basically<00:01:16.380> nitrite<00:01:17.070> detectors<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
that are basically nitrite detectors and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780 
that are basically nitrite detectors and
so<00:01:18.360> here's<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.780> we're<00:01:18.900> talking<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.790> if

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
so here's what we're talking about if

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
so here's what we're talking about if
you<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.240> run<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> nitrate<00:01:22.020> test<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you are run a nitrate test on a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350 
you are run a nitrate test on a
bacterium<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.729> other<00:01:23.850> words<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.210> you're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
bacterium in other words if you're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.870 
bacterium in other words if you're
interested<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.020> finding<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.310> bacterium

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
interested in finding out if a bacterium

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480 
interested in finding out if a bacterium
is<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> capable<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.439> reducing<00:01:29.009> nitrate

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
is a is a capable of reducing nitrate

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.200 
is a is a capable of reducing nitrate
what<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:32.000> inoculate<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
what you do is that you inoculate the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
what you do is that you inoculate the
bacterium<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> nitrate<00:01:34.920> broth<00:01:35.220> which<00:01:35.909> has

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
bacterium into a nitrate broth which has

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.039 
bacterium into a nitrate broth which has
nitrates<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.970> after<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.360> incubate<00:01:39.659> this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
nitrates in it after you incubate this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.219 
nitrates in it after you incubate this
tube<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.640> bacteria<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:43.079> into

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
tube if the bacteria that you put into

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.960 
tube if the bacteria that you put into
that<00:01:43.380> tube<00:01:43.740> we're<00:01:43.979> able<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.460> reduce<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that tube we're able to reduce the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.620 
that tube we're able to reduce the
nitrates<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:46.140> form<00:01:46.500> nitrites<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.420> you'd

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
nitrates to form nitrites the way you'd

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
nitrates to form nitrites the way you'd
be<00:01:48.689> able<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.110> visualize<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.369> after

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
be able to visualize that is that after

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.840 
be able to visualize that is that after
this<00:01:50.970> incubation<00:01:51.479> period<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.770> add<00:01:52.950> again

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
this incubation period you add again

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.749 
this incubation period you add again
stuff<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.570> basically<00:01:54.960> serves<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.770> nitrite

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
stuff that basically serves as nitrite

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.300 
stuff that basically serves as nitrite
detectors<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.770> chemicals<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
detectors and the chemicals that

again<00:02:13.379> we<00:02:13.500> said<00:02:13.709> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
again we said that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.309 
again we said that
these<00:02:14.040> things<00:02:14.370> they<00:02:15.120> function<00:02:15.599> as<00:02:15.750> nitrate

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
these things they function as nitrate

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.280 
these things they function as nitrate
detectors<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:18.330> reason<00:02:18.629> why<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> consider

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
detectors and the reason why I consider

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.979 
detectors and the reason why I consider
them<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.800> nitrite<00:02:20.310> attackers<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.269> they

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
them to be nitrite attackers is if they

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.650 
them to be nitrite attackers is if they
are<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.010> tube<00:02:23.220> together<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:23.910> nitrites

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
are in a tube together with nitrites

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660 
are in a tube together with nitrites
then<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.769> ends<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.099> forming<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.790> red<00:02:27.780> color<00:02:28.670> so

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
then it ends up forming a red color so

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.460 
then it ends up forming a red color so
if<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.910> add<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.209> salt<00:02:30.450> vanilla<00:02:30.569> Cassidy<00:02:31.319> and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
if you add the salt vanilla Cassidy and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.339 
if you add the salt vanilla Cassidy and
the<00:02:31.980> alpha<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.370> Apple<00:02:32.819> amine<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:34.170> see<00:02:34.319> a

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
the alpha and Apple amine and you see a

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.130 
the alpha and Apple amine and you see a
red<00:02:34.590> color<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.160> means<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.599> there<00:02:37.110> are

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
red color that means that there are

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.580 
red color that means that there are
nitrites<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.519> tube<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.319> if<00:02:40.319> there<00:02:40.470> are

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
nitrites in the tube and if there are

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.970 
nitrites in the tube and if there are
nitrites<00:02:41.160> no.2<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.989> tube<00:02:43.230> then<00:02:43.830> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
nitrites no.2 in the tube then it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.600 
nitrites no.2 in the tube then it
indicates<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.510> nitrate<00:02:46.260> no3<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.459> was

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
indicates that the nitrate no3 that was

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.759 
indicates that the nitrate no3 that was
there<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.880> begin<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.209> was<00:02:48.989> reduced<00:02:49.380> by<00:02:49.709> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
there to begin with was reduced by the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.650 
there to begin with was reduced by the
bacteria<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> positive

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
bacteria and so this is a positive

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.960 
bacteria and so this is a positive
result<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.500> tells<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:52.860> your<00:02:53.549> bacteria

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
result this tells you that your bacteria

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.229 
result this tells you that your bacteria
are<00:02:54.390> indeed<00:02:54.810> able<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.829> reduce<00:02:56.130> nitrates<00:02:59.239> what

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
are indeed able to reduce nitrates what

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.440 
are indeed able to reduce nitrates what
if<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:01.470> see<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.890> happen<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.329> if

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
if you see this happen and so what if

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.500 
if you see this happen and so what if
you<00:03:04.190> inoculate<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.400> nitrate<00:03:05.849> broth<00:03:06.120> with

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
you inoculate the nitrate broth with

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.979 
you inoculate the nitrate broth with
bacteria<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.739> incubate<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.870> afterwards<00:03:09.870> you

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
bacteria you incubate it afterwards you

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.770 
bacteria you incubate it afterwards you
add<00:03:10.170> those<00:03:10.950> nitrite<00:03:11.610> detectors<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.569> cell

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
add those nitrite detectors the cell

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.110 
add those nitrite detectors the cell
phenolic<00:03:13.349> acid<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.370> alpha<00:03:14.730> an<00:03:14.790> apple

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
phenolic acid and the alpha an apple

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.470 
phenolic acid and the alpha an apple
amine<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.500> no<00:03:16.829> red<00:03:17.040> color<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:18.030> so

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
amine and you see no red color and so

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.009 
amine and you see no red color and so
what<00:03:18.930> would<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.200> indicate<00:03:20.359> well<00:03:21.359> again<00:03:21.720> all

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
what would that indicate well again all

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.500 
what would that indicate well again all
of<00:03:22.049> these<00:03:22.400> these<00:03:23.400> chemicals<00:03:23.970> here<00:03:24.209> what<00:03:24.389> they

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
of these these chemicals here what they

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.120 
of these these chemicals here what they
do<00:03:24.569> is<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.079> serve<00:03:25.380> as<00:03:25.590> nitrite

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
do is that they serve as nitrite

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.819 
do is that they serve as nitrite
detectors<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.209> if<00:03:27.389> they<00:03:27.600> don't<00:03:27.810> produce<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.650> red

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
detectors so if they don't produce a red

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.069 
detectors so if they don't produce a red
color<00:03:29.100> all<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.090> tells<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.660> there<00:03:30.989> is

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
color all it tells you is that there is

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.050 
color all it tells you is that there is
no<00:03:31.459> nitrite<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:33.359> tube<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.940> if

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
no nitrite in that tube and so if

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.420 
no nitrite in that tube and so if
there's<00:03:36.269> no<00:03:36.450> nitrites<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.829> tube<00:03:38.100> that

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
there's no nitrites in this tube that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.240 
there's no nitrites in this tube that
could<00:03:39.389> actually<00:03:39.569> be<00:03:39.810> due<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.230> one<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.920> two

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
could actually be due to one of two

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.550 
could actually be due to one of two
reasons<00:03:41.489> right<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.569> there<00:03:43.260> could<00:03:43.410> be<00:03:43.440> no

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
reasons right so there could be no

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.569 
reasons right so there could be no
nitrites<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.819> tube<00:03:45.060> either<00:03:45.600> because<00:03:46.109> one

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
nitrites in the tube either because one

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.819 
nitrites in the tube either because one
the<00:03:47.579> bacteria<00:03:48.209> were<00:03:48.389> not<00:03:48.569> able<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.989> reduce<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
the bacteria were not able to reduce the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.270 
the bacteria were not able to reduce the
nitrates<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.609> begin<00:03:50.940> with<00:03:51.470> or<00:03:52.470> another<00:03:53.040> reason

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
nitrates to begin with or another reason

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.370 
nitrates to begin with or another reason
why<00:03:53.549> there<00:03:53.790> might<00:03:54.030> not<00:03:54.180> be<00:03:54.239> any<00:03:54.600> nitrites<00:03:55.170> in

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
why there might not be any nitrites in

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.319 
why there might not be any nitrites in
the<00:03:55.500> tube<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.889> that<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.190> bacteria<00:03:56.760> reduced

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
the tube is that the bacteria reduced

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.440 
the tube is that the bacteria reduced
the<00:03:57.510> nitrates<00:03:57.989> but<00:03:58.950> all<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.370> way<00:03:59.459> down<00:03:59.760> to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
the nitrates but all the way down to

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.330 
the nitrates but all the way down to
ammonia<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.170> nitrogen<00:04:01.530> gas<00:04:02.989> so<00:04:04.190> what<00:04:05.190> we're

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
ammonia and nitrogen gas so what we're

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.910 
ammonia and nitrogen gas so what we're
saying<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.639> that<00:04:05.670> there's<00:04:06.000> two<00:04:06.920> possible

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
saying is that there's two possible

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.159 
saying is that there's two possible
again<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:09.000> two<00:04:09.209> reasons<00:04:09.599> why<00:04:09.750> there's<00:04:10.019> no

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
again to two reasons why there's no

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.050 
again to two reasons why there's no
nitrites<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.919> tube<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.639> figure

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
nitrites in the tube and so to figure

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.789 
nitrites in the tube and so to figure
out<00:04:12.239> which<00:04:12.569> one<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.840> those<00:04:13.079> two<00:04:13.380> reasons

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
out which one of those two reasons

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.089 
out which one of those two reasons
caused<00:04:14.639> there<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.660> be<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> lack<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.109> nitrites<00:04:16.829> in

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
caused there to be a lack of nitrites in

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.509 
caused there to be a lack of nitrites in
the<00:04:17.220> tube<00:04:17.459> if<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:19.139> an<00:04:19.500> or<00:04:19.919> red<00:04:20.130> color

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
the tube if you see an or red color

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.550 
the tube if you see an or red color
after<00:04:21.120> adding<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.539> salt<00:04:21.780> vanilla<00:04:21.930> Cassatt

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
after adding the salt vanilla Cassatt

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.440 
after adding the salt vanilla Cassatt
and<00:04:22.740> then<00:04:22.860> alpha<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.729> Absalom<00:04:24.120> eeeem<00:04:24.300> you

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
and then alpha and Absalom eeeem you

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.750 
and then alpha and Absalom eeeem you
have<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.720> do<00:04:24.840> one<00:04:25.169> additional<00:04:25.349> step<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:26.610> let

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
have to do one additional step to let

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.860 
have to do one additional step to let
you<00:04:26.880> know<00:04:27.030> which<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.330> these<00:04:27.570> two

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
you know which of these two

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.370 
you know which of these two
possibilities<00:04:28.620> occurred<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.840> here's<00:04:31.110> what<00:04:31.260> we

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
possibilities occurred so here's what we

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.320 
possibilities occurred so here's what we
mean<00:04:31.560> by<00:04:31.620> that

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
mean by that

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.080 
mean by that
so<00:04:33.330> again<00:04:33.660> if<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.470> inoculate<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> nitrate<00:04:35.760> tube

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
so again if you inoculate a nitrate tube

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.719 
so again if you inoculate a nitrate tube
and<00:04:36.389> then<00:04:37.199> after<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.650> incubation<00:04:38.310> period

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
and then after that incubation period

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.060 
and then after that incubation period
you<00:04:38.910> add<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.360> salt<00:04:39.570> vanilla<00:04:39.810> Kassadin<00:04:40.740> alpha

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
you add the salt vanilla Kassadin alpha

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.820 
you add the salt vanilla Kassadin alpha
naphtha<00:04:41.400> limine<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.790> see<00:04:41.940> no<00:04:42.090> red<00:04:42.300> color<00:04:42.540> that

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
naphtha limine you see no red color that

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.000 
naphtha limine you see no red color that
could<00:04:43.830> be<00:04:43.889> because<00:04:44.850> either<00:04:45.210> one<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:46.410> bacteria

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
could be because either one the bacteria

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.040 
could be because either one the bacteria
weren't<00:04:47.340> able<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.760> reduce<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.419> nitrates<00:04:48.870> in

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
weren't able to reduce the nitrates in

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.050 
weren't able to reduce the nitrates in
the<00:04:49.139> tube<00:04:49.350> right<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:50.040> everything<00:04:50.490> in<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.850> tube

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
the tube right so everything in the tube

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.159 
the tube right so everything in the tube
is<00:04:51.240> still<00:04:51.419> in<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.660> form<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.139> nitrate<00:04:53.090> or<00:04:54.169> it

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
is still in the form of nitrate or it

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.810 
is still in the form of nitrate or it
could<00:04:55.500> be<00:04:55.680> because<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.720> bacteria<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.260> you

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
could be because the bacteria that you

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.909 
could be because the bacteria that you
inoculated<00:04:59.820> the<00:04:59.910> tube<00:05:00.090> with<00:05:00.740> reduce<00:05:01.740> the

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
inoculated the tube with reduce the

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.640 
inoculated the tube with reduce the
nitrates<00:05:02.430> all<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:03.270> way<00:05:03.389> down<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:04.020> ammonia<00:05:04.500> and

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
nitrates all the way down to ammonia and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.730 
nitrates all the way down to ammonia and
nitrogen<00:05:04.949> gas<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.180> they<00:05:06.330> kind<00:05:06.479> of

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
nitrogen gas and so they kind of

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.000 
nitrogen gas and so they kind of
bypassed<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:08.100> nitrite<00:05:08.729> producing<00:05:09.300> stage<00:05:10.010> so

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
bypassed the nitrite producing stage so

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.620 
bypassed the nitrite producing stage so
how<00:05:11.190> do<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.400> know<00:05:11.580> which<00:05:11.850> one<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.090> these<00:05:12.389> two

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
how do you know which one of these two

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.390 
how do you know which one of these two
things<00:05:12.960> occurred<00:05:13.830> then<00:05:14.570> well<00:05:15.570> what<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:15.870> do<00:05:16.020> is

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
things occurred then well what you do is

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.580 
things occurred then well what you do is
you'll<00:05:17.400> be<00:05:17.460> asked<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.120> add<00:05:18.360> some<00:05:18.990> chemicals

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
you'll be asked to add some chemicals

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.290 
you'll be asked to add some chemicals
that<00:05:20.449> function<00:05:21.449> in<00:05:22.100> reducing<00:05:23.100> any<00:05:23.370> remaining

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
that function in reducing any remaining

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.159 
that function in reducing any remaining
nitrates<00:05:24.960> in<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.380> tube<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:27.000> those<00:05:27.630> chemicals

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
nitrates in the tube so those chemicals

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.379 
nitrates in the tube so those chemicals
are<00:05:28.490> this<00:05:29.490> so<00:05:29.669> you're<00:05:29.760> gonna<00:05:29.850> be<00:05:30.000> asked<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.270> add

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
are this so you're gonna be asked to add

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.409 
are this so you're gonna be asked to add
zinc<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.440> hydrochloric<00:05:31.889> acid<00:05:32.610> if<00:05:32.760> you<00:05:33.000> see<00:05:33.210> no

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
zinc and hydrochloric acid if you see no

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.839 
zinc and hydrochloric acid if you see no
initial<00:05:33.990> red<00:05:34.229> color<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.860> again<00:05:35.520> what<00:05:35.700> these

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
initial red color and again what these

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.629 
initial red color and again what these
chemicals<00:05:36.389> do<00:05:36.539> is<00:05:36.720> that<00:05:36.900> they<00:05:37.530> force<00:05:37.950> any

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
chemicals do is that they force any

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.200 
chemicals do is that they force any
remaining<00:05:38.970> nitrates<00:05:39.599> in<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.710> tube<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:42.060> be

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
remaining nitrates in the tube to be

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.020 
remaining nitrates in the tube to be
reduced<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:43.169> form<00:05:44.030> nitrites<00:05:45.590> and<00:05:46.590> so<00:05:47.280> because

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
reduced to form nitrites and so because

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.180 
reduced to form nitrites and so because
in<00:05:48.210> this<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.570> when<00:05:49.260> those<00:05:49.410> nitrites<00:05:49.979> are

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
in this to when those nitrites are

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.370 
in this to when those nitrites are
produced<00:05:50.550> you<00:05:51.210> already<00:05:51.479> previously<00:05:51.870> added

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
produced you already previously added

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.500 
produced you already previously added
the<00:05:52.500> self<00:05:52.740> Anila<00:05:53.130> Cassidy<00:05:53.639> and<00:05:53.789> alpha<00:05:54.450> an

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
the self Anila Cassidy and alpha an

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.270 
the self Anila Cassidy and alpha an
apple<00:05:54.780> amine<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:55.139> serve<00:05:55.560> as<00:05:55.770> nitrite

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
apple amine that serve as nitrite

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.060 
apple amine that serve as nitrite
detectors<00:05:56.820> at<00:05:57.360> this<00:05:57.660> point<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.650> should<00:05:58.680> see<00:05:59.039> a

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
detectors at this point you should see a

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.490 
detectors at this point you should see a
red<00:05:59.280> color<00:05:59.520> because<00:06:00.120> any<00:06:00.449> time<00:06:00.720> nitrites<00:06:01.229> are

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
red color because any time nitrites are

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.680 
red color because any time nitrites are
in<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.160> presence<00:06:02.550> of<00:06:02.669> these<00:06:02.849> two<00:06:03.090> things<00:06:03.360> here

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
in the presence of these two things here

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.810 
in the presence of these two things here
it'll<00:06:04.440> produce<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:05.340> red<00:06:05.550> color<00:06:05.789> so<00:06:07.729> kind<00:06:08.729> of

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
it'll produce that red color so kind of

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.610 
it'll produce that red color so kind of
the<00:06:08.910> bottom<00:06:09.210> line<00:06:09.389> here<00:06:09.690> is<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:09.960> if<00:06:10.199> you<00:06:10.410> see

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
the bottom line here is that if you see

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.270 
the bottom line here is that if you see
a<00:06:10.650> red<00:06:11.010> color<00:06:11.310> only<00:06:12.120> after<00:06:13.020> adding<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:13.979> zinc

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
a red color only after adding the zinc

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.450 
a red color only after adding the zinc
and<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.970> hydrochloric<00:06:15.599> acid<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.949> tells<00:06:17.250> you

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
and the hydrochloric acid that tells you

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.610 
and the hydrochloric acid that tells you
that<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.180> bacteria<00:06:18.750> you<00:06:18.900> put<00:06:19.139> in<00:06:19.229> that<00:06:19.260> tube

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
that the bacteria you put in that tube

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.560 
that the bacteria you put in that tube
are<00:06:19.889> not<00:06:20.639> able<00:06:20.880> to<00:06:21.240> reduce<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:22.349> nitrates<00:06:22.889> and

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
are not able to reduce the nitrates and

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.210 
are not able to reduce the nitrates and
the<00:06:24.570> proof<00:06:24.960> is<00:06:25.169> that<00:06:25.199> is<00:06:25.500> that<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:25.770> only<00:06:25.919> see

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
the proof is that is that you only see

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.800 
the proof is that is that you only see
the<00:06:26.340> red<00:06:26.490> after<00:06:26.729> you<00:06:27.030> add<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.210> zinc<00:06:27.599> in<00:06:27.720> the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
the red after you add the zinc in the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.600 
the red after you add the zinc in the
hydrochloric<00:06:28.380> acid<00:06:28.740> so<00:06:29.070> that<00:06:29.220> tells<00:06:29.430> you<00:06:29.580> that

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
hydrochloric acid so that tells you that

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.600 
hydrochloric acid so that tells you that
it's<00:06:29.970> not<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.300> bacteria<00:06:30.810> that's<00:06:31.650> reduced<00:06:32.430> the

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
it's not the bacteria that's reduced the

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.640 
it's not the bacteria that's reduced the
nitrates<00:06:33.060> it's<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.840> stuff<00:06:34.050> that<00:06:34.260> you<00:06:34.440> added

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
nitrates it's the stuff that you added

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.370 
nitrates it's the stuff that you added
the<00:06:35.070> zinc<00:06:35.340> and<00:06:35.520> the<00:06:35.639> HCL<00:06:36.090> that<00:06:36.690> reduced<00:06:37.110> the

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
the zinc and the HCL that reduced the

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.670 
the zinc and the HCL that reduced the
nitrates

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.400 

if<00:06:41.160> on<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.490> other<00:06:41.610> hand<00:06:41.759> you<00:06:42.120> add<00:06:42.300> the<00:06:43.139> zinc

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
if on the other hand you add the zinc

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.350 
if on the other hand you add the zinc
and<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.710> hydrochloric<00:06:44.340> acid<00:06:44.699> and<00:06:44.880> you<00:06:44.970> see<00:06:45.150> no

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
and the hydrochloric acid and you see no

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.320 
and the hydrochloric acid and you see no
red<00:06:45.570> color<00:06:45.840> even<00:06:46.320> at<00:06:46.889> that<00:06:47.130> point<00:06:47.490> then<00:06:48.120> what

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
red color even at that point then what

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.820 
red color even at that point then what
that<00:06:48.479> tells<00:06:48.690> you<00:06:48.930> is<00:06:48.960> that<00:06:49.289> all<00:06:49.620> there<00:06:49.800> is

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
that tells you is that all there is

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.980 
that tells you is that all there is
known<00:06:50.070> there's<00:06:50.820> no<00:06:50.970> more<00:06:51.150> nitrates<00:06:51.660> in<00:06:51.870> the

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
known there's no more nitrates in the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.200 
known there's no more nitrates in the
tube<00:06:52.220> because<00:06:53.220> there<00:06:53.550> is<00:06:53.639> nothing<00:06:53.970> for<00:06:54.090> the

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
tube because there is nothing for the

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.629 
tube because there is nothing for the
zinc<00:06:54.479> and<00:06:54.630> HCl<00:06:55.020> to<00:06:55.050> reduce<00:06:55.470> there's<00:06:56.460> no

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
zinc and HCl to reduce there's no

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.430 
zinc and HCl to reduce there's no
nitrites<00:06:57.180> in<00:06:57.360> there<00:06:57.479> tube<00:06:57.660> right<00:06:58.139> and<00:06:58.350> you

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
nitrites in there tube right and you

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.689 
nitrites in there tube right and you
figured<00:06:58.740> that<00:06:58.770> out<00:06:58.889> because<00:06:59.160> when<00:06:59.520> you<00:06:59.610> add

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
figured that out because when you add

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.490 
figured that out because when you add
the<00:06:59.940> self<00:07:00.150> Anila<00:07:00.419> Kassadin<00:07:01.020> alpha<00:07:01.380> and

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
the self Anila Kassadin alpha and

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.670 
the self Anila Kassadin alpha and
Absalom<00:07:01.860> mean<00:07:02.160> there<00:07:02.550> is<00:07:02.669> no<00:07:02.850> red<00:07:03.080> so<00:07:04.080> what

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
Absalom mean there is no red so what

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.890 
Absalom mean there is no red so what
that<00:07:04.800> leaves<00:07:05.039> then<00:07:05.310> is<00:07:05.580> that<00:07:05.759> well<00:07:06.060> if<00:07:06.690> you

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
that leaves then is that well if you

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.840 
that leaves then is that well if you
seen<00:07:07.110> or<00:07:07.289> read<00:07:07.410> even<00:07:07.740> after<00:07:08.250> adding<00:07:08.490> the<00:07:08.610> sink

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
seen or read even after adding the sink

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.670 
seen or read even after adding the sink
in<00:07:09.000> the<00:07:09.030> HCl<00:07:09.539> that<00:07:09.780> indicates<00:07:10.410> that<00:07:10.560> the

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
in the HCl that indicates that the

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.219 
in the HCl that indicates that the
bacteria<00:07:11.220> that<00:07:11.250> you<00:07:11.370> put<00:07:11.699> in<00:07:11.789> this<00:07:11.940> tube

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
bacteria that you put in this tube

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.170 
bacteria that you put in this tube
reduce<00:07:13.229> the<00:07:13.440> nitrate<00:07:13.860> all<00:07:14.100> the<00:07:14.340> way<00:07:14.430> down<00:07:14.639> to

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
reduce the nitrate all the way down to

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.710 
reduce the nitrate all the way down to
ammonia<00:07:15.510> and<00:07:15.780> nitrogen<00:07:16.110> gas<00:07:16.970> right<00:07:17.970> so<00:07:18.240> the

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 
ammonia and nitrogen gas right so the

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.050 
ammonia and nitrogen gas right so the
bottom<00:07:19.080> line<00:07:19.110> kind<00:07:19.979> of<00:07:20.130> take-home<00:07:20.430> point<00:07:20.850> for

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
bottom line kind of take-home point for

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.170 
bottom line kind of take-home point for
this<00:07:21.210> tube<00:07:21.389> is<00:07:21.570> that<00:07:21.750> if<00:07:21.960> you<00:07:22.320> add<00:07:22.940> the<00:07:23.940> salt

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
this tube is that if you add the salt

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.600 
this tube is that if you add the salt
vanilla<00:07:24.300> Cassatt<00:07:24.900> alpha<00:07:25.530> naphthalene<00:07:25.860> female

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
vanilla Cassatt alpha naphthalene female

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.050 
vanilla Cassatt alpha naphthalene female
red<00:07:26.960> then<00:07:27.960> you<00:07:28.080> add<00:07:28.199> the<00:07:28.380> zinc<00:07:28.650> HCL<00:07:29.430> you<00:07:29.729> see<00:07:29.910> no

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
red then you add the zinc HCL you see no

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.480 
red then you add the zinc HCL you see no
red<00:07:30.330> that<00:07:31.289> tells<00:07:31.500> you<00:07:31.650> that<00:07:31.770> the<00:07:31.949> bacteria

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
red that tells you that the bacteria

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.210 
red that tells you that the bacteria
that<00:07:32.580> you<00:07:32.639> put<00:07:32.940> into<00:07:33.060> that<00:07:33.270> tube<00:07:33.510> are<00:07:34.220> capable

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 
that you put into that tube are capable

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.610 
that you put into that tube are capable
of<00:07:35.430> reducing<00:07:35.820> the<00:07:36.120> nitrate<00:07:36.510> and<00:07:36.750> they<00:07:37.289> reduce

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
of reducing the nitrate and they reduce

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.170 
of reducing the nitrate and they reduce
it<00:07:37.830> all<00:07:37.979> the<00:07:38.220> way<00:07:38.310> down<00:07:38.490> to<00:07:38.699> ammonia<00:07:38.970> and

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
it all the way down to ammonia and

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.060 
it all the way down to ammonia and
nitrogen<00:07:39.479> gas<00:07:39.660> that's<00:07:40.530> why<00:07:40.680> it<00:07:40.740> remained

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
nitrogen gas that's why it remained

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:47.120 
nitrogen gas that's why it remained
clear<00:07:43.880> so<00:07:44.930> again<00:07:45.930> kind<00:07:46.169> of<00:07:46.289> the<00:07:46.440> explanation

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.130 
clear so again kind of the explanation

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.860 
clear so again kind of the explanation
as<00:07:47.220> far<00:07:47.490> as<00:07:47.610> why<00:07:48.000> you<00:07:48.030> add<00:07:48.270> all<00:07:48.449> this<00:07:48.630> stuff

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:48.870 
as far as why you add all this stuff

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.310 
as far as why you add all this stuff
during<00:07:49.320> a<00:07:49.470> nitrate<00:07:50.010> test
