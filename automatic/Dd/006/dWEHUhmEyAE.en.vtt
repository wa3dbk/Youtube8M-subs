that I built there's the engine body

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.760 
that I built there's the engine body
from<00:00:20.449> autozone<00:00:20.930> for<00:00:21.560> about<00:00:21.740> $50<00:00:23.440> it's<00:00:24.440> got<00:00:24.619> the

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
from autozone for about $50 it's got the

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.630 
from autozone for about $50 it's got the
cone<00:00:25.070> air<00:00:25.279> filter

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640

cone air filter
nice<00:00:28.640> little<00:00:28.880> coupling<00:00:29.359> here<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.670> a<00:00:31.670> six-inch

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
nice little coupling here and a six-inch

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.009 
nice little coupling here and a six-inch
actually<00:00:34.370> it's<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.550> 5<00:00:34.760> inch<00:00:34.969> I<00:00:35.089> believe<00:00:35.390> 5<00:00:35.809> inch

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
actually it's a 5 inch I believe 5 inch

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.579 
actually it's a 5 inch I believe 5 inch
straight<00:00:36.609> pipe<00:00:37.609> in<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.559> 45<00:00:39.559> degree<00:00:39.710> angle<00:00:39.949> pipe

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
straight pipe in a 45 degree angle pipe

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.989 
straight pipe in a 45 degree angle pipe
and<00:00:42.589> there's<00:00:42.859> a<00:00:42.920> little<00:00:43.219> bracket<00:00:43.639> I<00:00:43.699> built

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
and there's a little bracket I built

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.700 
and there's a little bracket I built
myself<00:00:45.639> it<00:00:46.639> was<00:00:46.760> like<00:00:46.909> stays<00:00:47.479> in<00:00:47.659> place<00:00:47.929> pretty

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
myself it was like stays in place pretty

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:57.090 
myself it was like stays in place pretty
nice<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.129> tight<00:00:52.809> it<00:00:53.809> sounds<00:00:54.379> very<00:00:54.949> very<00:00:55.159> nice

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
nice and tight it sounds very very nice

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.819 
nice and tight it sounds very very nice
and<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.190> guess<00:00:58.399> I<00:00:58.579> could<00:00:58.760> feel<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:58.969> little<00:00:59.149> bit<00:00:59.359> of

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
and I guess I could feel a little bit of

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.030 
and I guess I could feel a little bit of
better<00:01:01.269> throttle<00:01:02.269> response<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.109> stuff<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:03.739> I

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
better throttle response and stuff but I

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.700 
better throttle response and stuff but I
mean<00:01:04.610> don't<00:01:05.390> expect<00:01:05.780> too<00:01:05.960> much<00:01:06.110> power<00:01:06.440> if<00:01:06.650> you

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
mean don't expect too much power if you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.640 
mean don't expect too much power if you
make<00:01:06.950> one<00:01:07.090> it's<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.750> know<00:01:08.870> for<00:01:09.410> looks

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
make one it's just you know for looks

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.450
