00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.400 
going to set up his own hazards with
that<00:02:12.080> in<00:02:12.260> mind<00:02:14.200> we're<00:02:15.200> going<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.890> into<00:02:17.410> what

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
that in mind we're going to go into what

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.140 
that in mind we're going to go into what
I<00:02:18.910> think

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
I think

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.600 
I think
manaphy<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.230> good<00:02:21.500> switch<00:02:21.800> because<00:02:22.340> then<00:02:22.520> I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
manaphy is a good switch because then I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.070 
manaphy is a good switch because then I
can<00:02:22.790> put<00:02:22.970> well<00:02:23.330> actually<00:02:23.540> no<00:02:23.840> he<00:02:23.930> has<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
can put well actually no he has a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.850 
can put well actually no he has a
Blissey<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.800> can't<00:02:25.070> do<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:32.470> what<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.710> go

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
Blissey I can't do that so what can I go

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.050 
Blissey I can't do that so what can I go
