00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
the rad and stuff like that start
pumping<00:01:23.159> through<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.150> computer<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
pumping through so the computer is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
pumping through so the computer is
overheating<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.619> bad<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> guys<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
overheating really bad if you guys you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
overheating really bad if you guys you

pretty sure i tweeted out something like

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
pretty sure i tweeted out something like
is<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> bad<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.840> my<00:01:30.990> computers<00:01:31.470> running<00:01:31.710> at

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
is it bad if my computers running at

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.550 
is it bad if my computers running at
like<00:01:32.159> 65<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.329> 70<00:01:33.600> degrees<00:01:33.930> celsius<00:01:34.439> or

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
like 65 or 70 degrees celsius or

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
like 65 or 70 degrees celsius or
something<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> went<00:01:36.720> out

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
something like that and so I went out

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.990 
something like that and so I went out
and<00:01:36.960> got<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> computer<00:01:37.979> guy<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> check<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> out

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and got a computer guy to check it out

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.910 
and got a computer guy to check it out
for<00:01:39.329> me<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.860> he

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
for me and see what was going on and he

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.289 
for me and see what was going on and he
pretty<00:01:41.220> much<00:01:41.310> said<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> read<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
pretty much said what I read on the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.380 
pretty much said what I read on the
internet<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:43.200> pump<00:01:43.770> isn't<00:01:43.950> pumping<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
internet the pump isn't pumping out the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.270 
internet the pump isn't pumping out the
liquid<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.740> obviously<00:01:46.920> not

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
liquid so it's you know obviously not

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.749 
liquid so it's you know obviously not
cooling<00:01:47.549> these<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.689> cpu<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
cooling these the cpu and that is the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.130 
cooling these the cpu and that is the
problem<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.270> i<00:01:51.329> continue<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:52.020> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
problem if i continue to use it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.330 
problem if i continue to use it
obviously<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.649> probably<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> melt<00:01:53.189> or

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
obviously it's probably a melt or

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.670 
obviously it's probably a melt or
something<00:01:53.640> Bad's<00:01:53.790> gonna<00:01:53.970> happen<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.630> i<00:01:54.840> asked

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
something Bad's gonna happen so i asked

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
something Bad's gonna happen so i asked
him<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:55.890> he<00:01:55.950> thinks<00:01:56.070> i<00:01:56.250> should<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.640> he

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
him what he thinks i should do and he

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.670 
him what he thinks i should do and he
said<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:56.939> could<00:01:57.119> order<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.780> whole<00:01:58.020> new<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
said we could order in a whole new you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.249 
said we could order in a whole new you
know<00:01:58.710> rad<00:01:59.040> system<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> time<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
know rad system but the time we do that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.440 
know rad system but the time we do that
he<00:02:01.560> recommended<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.790> went<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.329> got

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
he recommended that I just went and got

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510 
he recommended that I just went and got
a<00:02:03.509> fan<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.890> real<00:02:05.159> expensive

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
a fan for it you know a real expensive

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
a fan for it you know a real expensive
fan<00:02:06.000> he<00:02:06.240> said<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> lot<00:02:06.930> better

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
fan he said it would be a lot better

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.919 
fan he said it would be a lot better
would<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.530> lot<00:02:07.860> quieter<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.780> that's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
would be a lot quieter and so that's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.300 
would be a lot quieter and so that's
what<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.170> ended<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.440> doing<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> fan<00:02:11.069> took<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
what I ended up doing so the fan took a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.630 
what I ended up doing so the fan took a
few<00:02:11.459> days<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.670> come<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.209> but

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
few days to come in but

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.100 
few days to come in but
it's<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.180> know<00:02:13.300> came<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.720> where<00:02:13.840> he<00:02:13.900> lived

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
it's you know came in to where he lived

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.559 
it's you know came in to where he lived
and<00:02:14.200> then<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.440> time<00:02:14.620> he<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.430> know<00:02:15.580> put<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.450> all

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
and then the time he you know put it all

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.540 
and then the time he you know put it all
together<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.050> stuff<00:02:17.470> like<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.069> got<00:02:18.430> it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
together and stuff like that and got it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.040 
together and stuff like that and got it
back<00:02:18.580> together<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.180> order<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.510> get<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.810> fan

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
back together in order to get the fan

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.210 
back together in order to get the fan
and<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.319> had<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.530> take<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.950> whole

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
and we had to take like the whole

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.800 
and we had to take like the whole
computer<00:02:21.640> apart<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.150> watched<00:02:22.360> him<00:02:22.569> do<00:02:22.780> it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
computer apart I watched him do it

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.449 
computer apart I watched him do it
because<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.680> know<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.920> find<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.250> kind<00:02:24.430> of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.980 
apart and he actually take apart like my
whole<00:02:34.780> computer<00:02:35.080> uh<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.520> get<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.660> one

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
whole computer uh to get this this one
