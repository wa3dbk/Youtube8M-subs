weird<00:02:57.900> coming<00:02:58.349> from<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.590> dude<00:02:58.769> but<00:02:59.160> those<00:02:59.400> are

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
weird coming from a dude but those are

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.900 
weird coming from a dude but those are
just<00:02:59.700> my<00:02:59.879> opinion<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:01.489> hopefully<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.640> think

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
just my opinion and hopefully you think

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
just my opinion and hopefully you think
the<00:03:03.000> same<00:03:03.209> thing<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.629> do

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
the same thing I do

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.710 
the same thing I do
all<00:03:04.530> right<00:03:04.950> now<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.670> dragons<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.269> one<00:03:06.450> point

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
all right now but dragons have one point

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.960 
all right now but dragons have one point
that<00:03:07.079> makes<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> split<00:03:07.890> decision<00:03:08.069> let's<00:03:08.819> go

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
that makes it a split decision let's go

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.940 
that makes it a split decision let's go
