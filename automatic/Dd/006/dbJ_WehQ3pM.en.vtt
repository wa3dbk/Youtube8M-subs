really the whole DNA of the movie and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.499 
really the whole DNA of the movie and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
song that somehow is so good that

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.969 
song that somehow is so good that
hopefully<00:02:09.030> thematically<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.649> used<00:02:10.830> in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
hopefully thematically it can be used in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.800 
hopefully thematically it can be used in
the<00:02:11.039> picture<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.000> me<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.480> kind<00:02:12.660> of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the picture that to me is the kind of

that I really prefer to write for where

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.180 
that I really prefer to write for where
you<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> collaboration<00:02:17.010> with

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you really do have a collaboration with

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.190 
you really do have a collaboration with
the<00:02:17.310> director<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.720> there's<00:02:18.990> something

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
the director and if there's something

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.230 
the director and if there's something
fanatic<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.980> song<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.520> may<00:02:20.670> appear<00:02:21.000> at<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
fanatic in a song that may appear at the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.860 
fanatic in a song that may appear at the
end<00:02:21.270> or<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.930> key<00:02:22.350> scene<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:23.310> always<00:02:23.850> always<00:02:24.600> a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
end or a key scene it's always always a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.450 
end or a key scene it's always always a
better<00:02:25.140> idea<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.770> use<00:02:25.920> some<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.280> material

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
better idea to use some of that material

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.630 
better idea to use some of that material
in<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.270> score<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.890> those<00:02:29.100> are<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.340> kinds

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
in the score and so those are the kinds

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
in the score and so those are the kinds
of<00:02:29.670> opportunities<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.480> usually

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
of opportunities that I'm usually

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.680 
of opportunities that I'm usually
looking<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.110> where<00:02:32.240> there's<00:02:33.240> some<00:02:33.450> thumb

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
looking for where there's some thumb

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
looking for where there's some thumb
attic<00:02:33.990> element<00:02:34.410> in<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.950> score<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.880> you

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
attic element in the score that you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.760 
attic element in the score that you
either<00:02:36.240> create<00:02:36.540> with<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.960> someone<00:02:37.620> who's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
either create with a someone who's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.260 
either create with a someone who's
scoring<00:02:38.100> or<00:02:38.280> they've<00:02:38.430> created<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.150> then

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
scoring or they've created it and then

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.260 
scoring or they've created it and then
you<00:02:39.330> create<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> song<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:42.120> me

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
you create a song out of that to me

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.850 
you create a song out of that to me
that's<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.720> way<00:02:43.160> songs<00:02:44.160> function<00:02:44.610> best<00:02:45.860> and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
that's the way songs function best and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.340 
that's the way songs function best and
feel<00:02:47.190> seamless<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.750> you've<00:02:48.900> heard<00:02:49.110> some<00:02:49.320> of

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
feel seamless is if you've heard some of

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.020 
feel seamless is if you've heard some of
the<00:02:49.470> material<00:02:49.950> throughout<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> movie<00:02:50.730> maybe

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
the material throughout the movie maybe

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.810 
the material throughout the movie maybe
in<00:02:51.180> emotional<00:02:51.600> moments<00:02:52.050> or<00:02:52.430> whatever<00:02:53.430> moments

in emotional moments or whatever moments
it<00:02:53.910> may<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.480> then<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:55.050> somehow

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
it may be and then it's somehow

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.340 
it may be and then it's somehow

looking at movies where songs function
in<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.650> brilliant<00:03:31.890> way<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.490> mean<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.209> could<00:03:33.390> take

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
in a brilliant way I mean you could take

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.199 
in a brilliant way I mean you could take
Casablanca<00:03:34.260> as<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.100> perfect<00:03:35.610> example<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.090> a

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
Casablanca as a perfect example of a

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.330 
Casablanca as a perfect example of a
song<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.810> functions<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.709> movie<00:03:37.950> as<00:03:38.100> well

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
song that functions in a movie as well

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.680 
song that functions in a movie as well
as<00:03:38.459> anything<00:03:38.670> that's<00:03:38.850> ever<00:03:39.060> been<00:03:39.180> written<00:03:39.330> as

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
the movie a couple of times but it is

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.560 
the movie a couple of times but it is
kind<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.500> fulcrum<00:03:46.950> for<00:03:47.360> flashbacks<00:03:48.360> to

Paris it's part of the score and it's a

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.800 
Paris it's part of the score and it's a
devastatingly<00:03:52.020> simple<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.920> fantastic<00:03:53.820> song

kind of serious way in pursuing that and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.950 
kind of serious way in pursuing that and
it's<00:04:32.100> certainly<00:04:32.400> possible<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:33.090> think<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
it's certainly possible I think the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.450 
it's certainly possible I think the
first<00:04:34.140> thing<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.410> do<00:04:34.560> is<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.890> make<00:04:35.130> sure<00:04:35.310> that

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
first thing to do is is make sure that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.640 
first thing to do is is make sure that
you<00:04:35.640> understand<00:04:36.150> how<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.840> collaborate<00:04:37.230> as<00:04:37.620> a

can<00:04:40.770> write<00:04:40.920> brilliant<00:04:41.370> songs<00:04:41.610> but<00:04:42.440> they

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
can write brilliant songs but they

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.780 
can write brilliant songs but they
really<00:04:43.740> have<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:43.980> grow<00:04:44.250> out<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.490> their<00:04:44.700> own

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
really have to grow out of their own

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.840 
really have to grow out of their own
imagination<00:04:45.590> when<00:04:46.590> you're<00:04:46.740> writing<00:04:47.220> for<00:04:47.490> film

imagination when you're writing for film
you<00:04:48.480> really<00:04:48.510> not<00:04:49.020> you're<00:04:49.470> not<00:04:49.620> sublimating

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
you really not you're not sublimating

you really not you're not sublimating
your<00:04:50.400> own<00:04:50.490> imagination<00:04:50.700> but<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.330> really<00:04:51.720> are

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
your own imagination but you really are

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.560 
your own imagination but you really are
trying<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.260> buy<00:04:52.440> into<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.860> vision<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:54.360> the

trying to buy into the vision that the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.250 
trying to buy into the vision that the
movie<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:55.080> trying<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:56.090> communicate<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:58.110> if

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
movie is trying to communicate and if

movie is trying to communicate and if
you<00:04:58.350> if<00:04:59.100> you're<00:04:59.370> not<00:04:59.520> able<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.880> kind<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.419> modify

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
you if you're not able to kind of modify

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.470 
you if you're not able to kind of modify
your<00:05:01.800> approach<00:05:02.190> that's<00:05:02.640> probably<00:05:03.090> not<00:05:03.240> good

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
your approach that's probably not good

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.450 
your approach that's probably not good
for<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.140> if<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.950> like<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.310> idea

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
for you but if you if you like the idea

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.740 
for you but if you if you like the idea
of<00:05:06.290> really<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.410> director<00:05:07.800> being<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:09.390> driving

of really the director being the driving
force<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.320> what's<00:05:10.530> happening<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.130> they're

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
force of what's happening and they're

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.190 
force of what's happening and they're
really<00:05:11.640> trying<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:12.000> understand<00:05:12.480> how<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.780> song

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
really trying to understand how the song

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.780 
really trying to understand how the song
is<00:05:13.320> supposed<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.620> work<00:05:13.770> then<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:14.550> can<00:05:14.640> be

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
is supposed to work then it can be

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.360 
is supposed to work then it can be
enormous<00:05:15.030> ly<00:05:15.300> satisfying<00:05:15.840> collaboration<00:05:16.470> but

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
enormous ly satisfying collaboration but

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.130 
enormous ly satisfying collaboration but
if<00:05:17.460> you're<00:05:17.580> not<00:05:17.820> flexible<00:05:18.180> it's<00:05:18.720> probably<00:05:19.080> you

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
if you're not flexible it's probably you

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.390 
if you're not flexible it's probably you
should<00:05:19.290> probably<00:05:19.320> just<00:05:19.740> do<00:05:19.980> your<00:05:20.220> own<00:05:20.280> thing

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
should probably just do your own thing

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.010 
should probably just do your own thing
you<00:05:21.120> know<00:05:21.150> because<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:24.030> have<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.360> be<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.510> bit<00:05:24.810> I

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
you know because you have to be a bit I

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.810 
you know because you have to be a bit I
mean<00:05:25.230> you<00:05:25.320> really<00:05:25.470> do<00:05:25.650> have<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.980> serve<00:05:26.310> the

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
mean you really do have to serve the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.090 
mean you really do have to serve the
picture<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.390> so<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.290> depends<00:05:28.620> on<00:05:28.680> what<00:05:28.830> one's

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
picture and so it depends on what one's

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.920 
picture and so it depends on what one's
range<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.240> tolerance<00:05:30.690> is<00:05:30.780> for<00:05:32.510> how<00:05:33.510> much<00:05:33.720> of

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
range and tolerance is for how much of

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.140 
range and tolerance is for how much of
themself<00:05:34.470> has<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.950> be<00:05:35.070> into<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.760> and<00:05:35.910> how

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
themself has to be into in it and how

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.960 
themself has to be into in it and how

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
much of it can be really as just working

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.450
