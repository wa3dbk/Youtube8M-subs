00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.800
 differ the thinner the slices the more 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 crunchy get eggplants in order 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 to achieve the effect of eggplant chips 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.300
 need to subtly cut and breaded 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 it's just that make has no face. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.420
 slices have a richer flavor and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.739
 I feel good eggplant pulp 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 put the eggplants in the bowl and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 fall asleep plenty of salt all

 eggplant for 20-30 minutes in the process 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.570
 procedures eggplant released enough 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.939
 a lot of juice then they need several times 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.189
 rinse in running water to leave 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.860
 personal salt and bitterness with it 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.310
 after that, eggplants need lightly 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.380
 squeeze and dry with a paper towel 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 slightly beat the eggs with a fork and add 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.689
 ground black pepper and salt to taste 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.840

 the other side 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.020
 thin slices are fried very quickly 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.090
 but when cooking large pieces 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.610
 they are best roasted on a gentle 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.979
 fire under the lid for cooking 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.469

 deal with big blue ones 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.470
 lots of seeds are better with them 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.950
 just cleans the skin and to the maximum 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.140
