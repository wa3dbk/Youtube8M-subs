guys know the be a pro for NHL 15 to not

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.860 
guys know the be a pro for NHL 15 to not
live<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.650> to<00:00:40.830> its<00:00:41.040> hype<00:00:41.180> obviously<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> severely

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
live up to its hype obviously a severely

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
live up to its hype obviously a severely
stripped<00:00:43.350> down<00:00:43.470> game<00:00:43.769> mode<00:00:44.070> especially<00:00:44.909> for

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
stripped down game mode especially for

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.600 
stripped down game mode especially for
the<00:00:45.120> skaters<00:00:45.540> opinion<00:00:46.110> can't<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.650> able<00:00:47.400> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the skaters opinion can't be able to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.149 
the skaters opinion can't be able to
simulate<00:00:48.390> between<00:00:48.960> line<00:00:49.140> changes<00:00:49.650> and<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
simulate between line changes and the

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.920 
simulate between line changes and the
fact<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:50.519> you<00:00:50.909> just<00:00:50.940> had<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> wait<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.659> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
fact that you just had to wait on the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
fact that you just had to wait on the
bench<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> watch<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.680> game<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:53.489> pretty<00:00:53.820> bad

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
bench and watch the game was pretty bad

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
bench and watch the game was pretty bad
then<00:00:54.839> obviously<00:00:54.989> you're<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.650> set<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
then obviously you're not gonna set the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
then obviously you're not gonna set the
four<00:00:56.280> minute<00:00:56.580> periods<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.449> rarely

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
four minute periods because you rarely

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.289 
four minute periods because you rarely
get<00:00:58.110> anything<00:00:58.470> done<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.220> those<00:00:59.400> periods<00:00:59.820> as

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
get anything done in those periods as

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:01.880 
get anything done in those periods as
for<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.659> goaltending<00:01:01.229> you<00:01:01.470> know<00:01:01.620> we've<00:01:01.860> had

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
for the goaltending you know we've had

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
for the goaltending you know we've had
our<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.339> and<00:01:02.519> down<00:01:02.670> moments<00:01:03.150> I<00:01:03.269> think<00:01:03.720> I<00:01:03.839> did<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
our up and down moments I think I did a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
our up and down moments I think I did a
pretty<00:01:04.199> good<00:01:04.589> job<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.860> reviving<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.060> career

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
pretty good job of reviving the career

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
pretty good job of reviving the career
of<00:01:06.570> Rick<00:01:06.900> DiPietro<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.770> certain<00:01:08.100> games

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of Rick DiPietro and certain games

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
of Rick DiPietro and certain games
obviously<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.909> had<00:01:09.030> our<00:01:09.180> good<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.540> had<00:01:09.690> our<00:01:09.840> bed

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
obviously we had our good we had our bed

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 
obviously we had our good we had our bed

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
what I mean by customized player is it's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.170 
what I mean by customized player is it's
just<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.140> randomly<00:02:29.040> generated

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
just going to be a randomly generated

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.140 
just going to be a randomly generated
player<00:02:30.180> from<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.260> mind<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.920> mine<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.460> will

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
player from the mind of mine that will

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.090 
player from the mind of mine that will
probably<00:02:33.420> reflect<00:02:34.020> my<00:02:34.260> personal<00:02:34.680> appearance

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
probably reflect my personal appearance

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.300 
probably reflect my personal appearance
appearance<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.390> named<00:02:36.630> after<00:02:36.870> me<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
appearance and be named after me and the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.370 
appearance and be named after me and the
most<00:02:38.490> weird<00:02:38.790> way<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> guess<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.720> could<00:02:39.750> imagine

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
most weird way I guess you could imagine

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.950 
most weird way I guess you could imagine
so<00:02:40.740> it'll<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.490> be<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> creative<00:02:42.270> player<00:02:42.570> just

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
so it'll just be a creative player just

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.740 
so it'll just be a creative player just
no<00:02:43.530> no<00:02:43.860> relation<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.460> anybody<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.240> NHL

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
no no relation to anybody in the NHL

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.660 
no no relation to anybody in the NHL
nothing<00:02:46.590> along<00:02:46.830> those<00:02:47.040> lines<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.520> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
nothing along those lines just a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.210 
nothing along those lines just a
creative<00:02:48.030> player<00:02:48.450> from<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:49.080> mind<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:50.100> will

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
creative player from my mind and we will

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.610 
creative player from my mind and we will
do<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.700> player<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:51.570> either<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> skater<00:02:52.350> or

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
do that player for either the skater or

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.030 
do that player for either the skater or
the<00:02:52.980> goaltender<00:02:53.550> whatever<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.300> guys<00:02:54.480> choose

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
the goaltender whatever you guys choose

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.490 
the goaltender whatever you guys choose
now<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.340> other<00:02:56.520> option<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.390> want<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> do

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
now for the other option I want to do

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.650 
now for the other option I want to do
something<00:02:58.790> along<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> lines<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.270> what<00:03:00.330> we<00:03:00.510> did

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
something along the lines of what we did

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.300 
something along the lines of what we did
with<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.870> Rick<00:03:01.050> DiPietro<00:03:01.260> for<00:03:01.920> instance

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
with the Rick DiPietro for instance

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.000 
with the Rick DiPietro for instance
obviously<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:03.030> brought<00:03:03.330> back<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> former<00:03:04.200> NHL
