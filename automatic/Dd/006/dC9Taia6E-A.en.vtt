00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.529
 yes and thus from the table to the members of Weingarten Fiat in the 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.390
 This year's season, everything was taken care of and successful 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.919
 Semifinals qualified for the German team championship 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.619
 on the penultimate weekend, however, put it in the fight at the TSV 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.349
 Luckenwalde a hearty 6 to 32 swatter now on Saturday you were there before 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.349
 the own fans for reparation endeavors 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.300
 These results are for the Germans 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 National is it 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.580
 Actually, that was not the moment in the Kleiber Italians 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.580
 a wistful German coach Frank Heinzelbecker 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.400
 the Weingartner wrestlers have it again after a strong season 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.650
 Semifinals were done in the fight in Luckenwalde but scarce going on 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.150
 set 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.240
 the appearance on Saturday night should be the faithful spectators 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.420
 once again offer exciting sports 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 also been practically excluded for advancement 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.220
 the Germanen Group showed themselves from the beginning on par with the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.050
 - so full of volume 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.590
 European champion 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.940
 Florian Gabriele Haas provided for the two German for it right from the beginning 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.480
 by 3 to 1 points for him, the joy was great 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.640
 careful sampling between Nikolai's spot fruits puck was 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 just before the end of the first round can be imagined 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.570
 the physical strength of Nico Graf can put the Germanic 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.979
 in round two and three 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.720
 awaken with his better technique 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.200
 13 0 in the end for him and bumped 6 2 1 lead for Weingarten 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.700
 If the competition was to continue for the Teutons this is still 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.450
 absence 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.920
 Can move 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.060
 but Marxen Petrofac and Rolf Linke would have to overcome the convoy 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.220
 give up 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760
 China like Dennis Blum 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.310
 André Moheit I would have a surprise in the penultimate fight 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880
 can worry about Lars Levermann 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 Laps one and two went clearly to the hosts 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 enter passage two to the previous month 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.800
 actually perfect 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.050
 There is still not two seconds left the lead 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.749
 it came as it had to Lieberman then also wants the four and 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.449
 five and thus secured in the first few months was the SC Dünen 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:21.189
 Weigend data is at the end with 15 to 22 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.779
 Although again a defeat the reconciliation for an indisputable 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 Appearance in the fight BSC succeeded 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.109
 this time out 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.839
 Sahr Senesie becomes Starks more Emmert she rules ears with "The Rock" 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:40.279
 After 2007, the Teutons stood for the second time in a row in the semifinals 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:44.009
 So they seem to be able to establish themselves in the German top 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.849
 The time until the start of the new round should now be five and therefore meaningful 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.949
 be used 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.989
 yes, if he is doing so, pay attention 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.379
 the employers for 1600 spectators and we are on the way in from 20 o'clock 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.579
 with 20 thousand albums more 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.579
 because with Sasa Stoiber more coach van Gaal in the final and even more 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.489
 strip 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.739
 Before the back round start in September, Steve van Bergen has starting couples 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.059
 and have a very special date in the calendar 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.239
 He chose the Olympics 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.120
