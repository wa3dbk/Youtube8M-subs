every<00:00:43.170> year<00:00:43.440> around<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.070> time<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> fish

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
every year around this time the fish

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
every year around this time the fish
that<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.899> coming<00:00:46.230> back<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that are coming back here think this is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.040 
that are coming back here think this is
their<00:00:47.640> home<00:00:47.670> stream<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.539> they're<00:00:48.750> coming

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
their home stream and they're coming

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
their home stream and they're coming
back<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> spawn<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> what<00:00:50.789> we're<00:00:50.940> doing

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
back here to spawn and what we're doing

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.529 
back here to spawn and what we're doing
is<00:00:51.980> tying<00:00:52.980> into<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.430> run<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.180> order<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
is tying into that run in order to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.020 
is tying into that run in order to
collect<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.989> eggs<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.440> continue<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.129> fishery

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
collect the eggs to continue the fishery

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
collect the eggs to continue the fishery
out<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.329> Lake<00:00:57.480> Michigan<00:00:57.510> okay<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.530> collect

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
out in Lake Michigan okay so you collect

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.299 
out in Lake Michigan okay so you collect
you<00:00:59.340> collect<00:01:00.109> Milt<00:01:01.109> from<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> male's<00:01:01.770> eggs

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you collect Milt from the male's eggs

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.759 
you collect Milt from the male's eggs
from<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> females<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.539> eventually<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.439> all

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
from the females and eventually that all

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.730 
from the females and eventually that all
it<00:01:05.519> gets<00:01:05.700> fertilized<00:01:06.390> together<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.200> make<00:01:07.380> more

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it gets fertilized together to make more

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.390 
it gets fertilized together to make more
salmon<00:01:08.070> fish<00:01:08.689> exactly<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.229> once<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.250> do

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
salmon fish exactly the once we do

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
salmon fish exactly the once we do
fertilize<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> eggs<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.689> salmon<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
fertilize the eggs from the salmon that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.200 
fertilize the eggs from the salmon that
are<00:01:13.439> coming<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.549> transfer<00:01:15.030> those

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
are coming back here we transfer those

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.440 
are coming back here we transfer those
eggs<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.350> sum<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> our<00:01:17.430> hatcheries<00:01:17.939> where

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
eggs to the sum of our hatcheries where

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
eggs to the sum of our hatcheries where
the<00:01:18.630> fish<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.960> reared<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.500> stock<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.729> into

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the fish are reared and stock back into

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
the fish are reared and stock back into
the<00:01:21.240> streams<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.350> let's<00:01:22.650> talk<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the streams okay so let's talk about the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.460 
the streams okay so let's talk about the
opportunity<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.210> public<00:01:24.420> because<00:01:24.900> this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
opportunity for the public because this

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
opportunity for the public because this
facility<00:01:26.070> has<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> lot<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.909> different<00:01:26.939> viewing

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
facility has a lot of different viewing

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.770 
facility has a lot of different viewing
areas<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.040> works<00:01:29.280> right

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
areas to see how all this works right

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.600
