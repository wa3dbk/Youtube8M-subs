a very easy pour on this it's a Belgian
style<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.750> probably<00:02:04.899> want<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.200> get<00:02:05.319> some<00:02:05.380> of

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
style so we probably want to get some of

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.499 
style so we probably want to get some of
that<00:02:05.649> yeast<00:02:06.009> in<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.369> bottom<00:02:06.729> if<00:02:06.880> there<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.179> any

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509

the yeast in there and I want you to see
how<00:02:40.390> clear<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.959> beer<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.349> now<00:02:41.620> let's<00:02:41.830> think
