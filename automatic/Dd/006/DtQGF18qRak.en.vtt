00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
design qualities right using a metal

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.429 
design qualities right using a metal
frame<00:01:02.399> although<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> back<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.140> good

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
create video performance and overall I

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.800 
create video performance and overall I
think<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.740> powerhouse<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.480> the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
think it's a powerhouse so in the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.150 
think it's a powerhouse so in the
performance<00:02:38.230> department<00:02:38.770> i<00:02:38.860> think<00:02:39.100> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
performance department i think the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.420 
performance department i think the
Galaxy<00:02:39.610> Note<00:02:39.640> 4<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.420> top<00:02:41.170> notch<00:02:41.410> now<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.280> such

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
Galaxy Note 4 is top notch now it's such

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.550 
Galaxy Note 4 is top notch now it's such
a<00:02:42.459> big<00:02:42.819> device<00:02:43.270> with<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> 2k<00:02:44.140> display<00:02:44.260> you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
a big device with a 2k display you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.220 
a big device with a 2k display you
obviously<00:02:45.040> need<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.459> big<00:02:45.940> battery<00:02:46.300> backup<00:02:46.690> so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
obviously need a big battery backup so

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.710 
obviously need a big battery backup so
we<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.970> 3220<00:02:48.970> mah<00:02:49.270> battery<00:02:49.690> which

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
we have a 3220 mah battery which

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.540 
we have a 3220 mah battery which
provides<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.410> lot<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.709> juice<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.220> device

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
provides a lot of juice to the device

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.530 
provides a lot of juice to the device
then<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:52.750> use<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.230> device<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:53.860> about<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:55.150> day

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
then we use the device for about a day

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.300 
then we use the device for about a day
we<00:02:55.720> got<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.900> full<00:02:56.200> charge<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.739> full<00:02:56.980> hundred

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
we got a full charge a full hundred

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.880 
we got a full charge a full hundred
percent<00:02:57.640> for<00:02:57.910> one<00:02:58.150> day<00:02:58.390> because<00:02:59.050> we<00:02:59.230> used<00:02:59.410> it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
percent for one day because we used it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.090 
percent for one day because we used it
extensively<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.790> gaming<00:03:01.420> camera<00:03:02.170> videos<00:03:02.890> and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
extensively on gaming camera videos and

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.860 
extensively on gaming camera videos and
everything<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:04.060> use<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.570> normal

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
everything if you use it on a normal

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.080 
everything if you use it on a normal
usage<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:05.980> pattern<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.640> get<00:03:06.970> about

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
usage you know pattern you can get about

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.820 
usage you know pattern you can get about
almost<00:03:07.690> about<00:03:07.840> two<00:03:08.080> days<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.650> battery

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
almost about two days of a battery

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.860 
almost about two days of a battery
backup<00:03:08.980> there<00:03:09.910> are<00:03:09.970> also<00:03:10.060> some<00:03:10.300> ultra<00:03:10.690> power

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
backup there are also some ultra power

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.449 
backup there are also some ultra power

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
saving modes which you know it

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.520 
saving modes which you know it
essentially<00:03:13.269> turn<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.750> display<00:03:14.110> black<00:03:14.350> and

performance<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.959> actually<00:03:35.680> really<00:03:35.920> good<00:03:36.220> even

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
performance is actually really good even

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.819 
performance is actually really good even
in<00:03:36.910> low-light<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.600> think<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.260> performance<00:03:38.530> of

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
in low-light I think the performance of

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.580 
in low-light I think the performance of
the<00:03:39.220> note<00:03:39.400> 4<00:03:39.640> camera<00:03:40.090> is<00:03:40.239> at<00:03:40.480> par<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:40.900> most<00:03:41.410> of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the note 4 camera is at par with most of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.140 
the note 4 camera is at par with most of
the<00:03:41.650> high-end<00:03:42.100> camera<00:03:42.310> smartphones<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:42.970> you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
the high-end camera smartphones that you

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.470 
the high-end camera smartphones that you
see<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:44.200> there's<00:03:45.040> no<00:03:45.190> shutter<00:03:45.519> lag<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:46.209> color

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
see the there's no shutter lag the color

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.630 
see the there's no shutter lag the color
reproduction<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.260> excellent<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:47.920> even<00:03:48.549> the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640
