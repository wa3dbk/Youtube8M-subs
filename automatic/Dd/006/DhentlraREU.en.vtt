couple of tips on how to tune the cabs
and<00:00:24.300> balance<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:25.279> what<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> did<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.760> I

bought<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> set<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> gauges<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:31.040> made<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
bought a set of gauges and I made up a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.360 
bought a set of gauges and I made up a
little<00:00:32.640> gate<00:00:32.940> set<00:00:33.559> one<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.800> each<00:00:34.860> carburetor

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
little gate set one for each carburetor

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.240 
little gate set one for each carburetor
and<00:00:35.640> three<00:00:36.510> hoses<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> each<00:00:37.800> one

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and three hoses of what one of each one

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.720 
and three hoses of what one of each one
okay<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.149> you're<00:00:39.870> probably<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
okay now you're probably not going to

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.590 
okay now you're probably not going to
know<00:00:41.730> where<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.000> start

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
know where to start

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.319 
know where to start
so<00:00:43.460> before<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.489> put<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> cabbies<00:00:45.180> back

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
so before you put the cabbies back

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.110 
so before you put the cabbies back
together<00:00:46.160> we've<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.280> our<00:00:47.399> members<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
together we've got our members at the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
together we've got our members at the
center<00:00:48.510> carb<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.960> copy<00:00:49.350> number<00:00:49.620> two<00:00:50.180> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
center carb your copy number two this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.170 
center carb your copy number two this
goes<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> engine<00:00:52.010> as<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.789> master

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
goes into the engine as the master

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.450 
goes into the engine as the master
carburetor<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.469> you've<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.070> screw

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
carburetor and then you've got a screw

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.290 
carburetor and then you've got a screw
here<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> adjusts<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> number<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.030> cab

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
here and it adjusts the number one cab

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.289 
here and it adjusts the number one cab
and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> screw<00:01:04.350> here

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.069 

which<00:01:08.899> adjusts<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.100> number-3<00:01:10.640> cap<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.810> what

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
which adjusts the number-3 cap but what

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.029 
which adjusts the number-3 cap but what
you've<00:01:12.200> got<00:01:12.289> to<00:01:12.409> do<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:12.649> make<00:01:12.799> sure<00:01:12.859> that

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
you've got to do is make sure that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.469 
you've got to do is make sure that
you're<00:01:13.219> not<00:01:13.280> going<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.520> getting<00:01:14.000> in<00:01:14.179> any

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
you're not going to getting in any

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.679 
you're not going to getting in any
influence<00:01:15.109> of<00:01:15.380> each<00:01:16.159> of<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.729> cabs<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.360> number

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
influence of each of the cabs on number

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.240 
influence of each of the cabs on number
two<00:01:17.899> so<00:01:18.710> what<00:01:19.250> I<00:01:19.280> do<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.820> I've<00:01:19.969> just<00:01:20.570> um<00:01:21.250> screw

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
two so what I do is I've just um screw

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.910 
two so what I do is I've just um screw
the<00:01:22.490> screw<00:01:22.789> out<00:01:22.819> on<00:01:23.149> number<00:01:23.420> one

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
the screw out on number one

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.910 
the screw out on number one
so<00:01:24.920> screwing<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.789> counterclockwise<00:01:26.920> opens

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
so screwing it counterclockwise opens

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.870 
so screwing it counterclockwise opens
the<00:01:28.069> throttle<00:01:28.280> up<00:01:28.549> on<00:01:28.729> number<00:01:29.030> one<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:31.640> what<00:01:31.850> I

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
the throttle up on number one so what I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.429 
the throttle up on number one so what I
want<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.209> in<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.569> as<00:01:32.689> you<00:01:32.719> can<00:01:32.959> see<00:01:33.200> the

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
want to in it and as you can see the

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.109 
want to in it and as you can see the
throttle<00:01:33.829> was<00:01:33.950> partially<00:01:34.459> open<00:01:34.490> because<00:01:34.939> it's

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
throttle was partially open because it's

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.149 
throttle was partially open because it's
got<00:01:35.360> oil<00:01:35.479> though<00:01:35.840> I'd<00:01:35.990> already<00:01:36.289> sit<00:01:36.679> which<00:01:36.979> is

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
got oil though I'd already sit which is

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.830 
got oil though I'd already sit which is
down<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:37.640> cable<00:01:38.090> here<00:01:38.119> which<00:01:38.390> goes<00:01:38.630> up

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
down on this cable here which goes up

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.529 
down on this cable here which goes up
into<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:40.159> carburetor<00:01:40.549> which<00:01:40.880> adjusts<00:01:41.420> as

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
into the carburetor which adjusts as

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.130 
into the carburetor which adjusts as
main<00:01:41.810> linkage<00:01:42.229> here<00:01:43.509> so<00:01:44.509> what<00:01:44.720> we've<00:01:44.869> got<00:01:44.899> to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
main linkage here so what we've got to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.279 
main linkage here so what we've got to
do<00:01:45.289> is<00:01:45.530> I'm<00:01:46.220> going<00:01:46.489> to<00:01:46.610> actually<00:01:47.479> screw<00:01:47.840> both

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
do is I'm going to actually screw both

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.529 
do is I'm going to actually screw both
of<00:01:48.500> these<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.130> too<00:01:49.189> close<00:01:49.670> too<00:01:50.090> close<00:01:50.119> the

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
of these so too close too close the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.740 
of these so too close too close the
struggle<00:01:51.459> you<00:01:52.459> go<00:01:52.640> clockwise<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.360> we<00:01:53.479> want<00:01:53.689> to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
struggle you go clockwise so we want to

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.479 
struggle you go clockwise so we want to
open<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.170> throttle<00:01:54.319> one<00:01:54.649> number<00:01:54.829> three<00:01:55.159> and

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
open the throttle one number three and

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.300 
open the throttle one number three and
number<00:01:55.520> one<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.599> we've<00:01:56.780> got<00:01:57.110> number<00:01:57.590> two<00:01:57.619> back

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
number one so we've got number two back

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.449 
number one so we've got number two back
into<00:01:58.610> its<00:01:59.239> neutral<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.899> untended<00:02:00.799> position

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
into its neutral and untended position

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.819 
into its neutral and untended position
so<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:01.789> not<00:02:01.909> getting<00:02:02.090> any<00:02:02.329> influence<00:02:02.929> on<00:02:03.140> any

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
so it's not getting any influence on any

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.979 
so it's not getting any influence on any
of<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.069> other<00:02:04.099> cavies<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.390> I'm<00:02:05.689> going<00:02:05.899> to

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:05.989 
of the other cavies so I'm going to

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.979 
of the other cavies so I'm going to
screw<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.679> counter<00:02:07.250> clockwise<00:02:07.989> probably

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
screw this counter clockwise probably

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.539 
screw this counter clockwise probably
about<00:02:09.079> three<00:02:09.379> tens<00:02:09.679> three<00:02:09.950> or<00:02:10.069> four<00:02:10.220> twos<00:02:10.429> and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
about three tens three or four twos and

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.009 
about three tens three or four twos and
you<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:10.789> see<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.150> it's<00:02:11.269> opened<00:02:11.599> up<00:02:11.660> quite<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
you can see that it's opened up quite a

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.800 
you can see that it's opened up quite a
bit<00:02:12.230> me<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.799> this<00:02:13.549> one<00:02:13.730> here<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.239> lot<00:02:14.480> closed

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
bit me and this one here is a lot closed

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.930 
bit me and this one here is a lot closed
and<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.739> one<00:02:15.859> is<00:02:16.010> opened<00:02:16.459> up<00:02:16.549> as<00:02:16.730> well<00:02:16.910> in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and that one is opened up as well in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.300 
and that one is opened up as well in
number<00:02:17.329> one<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.470> now<00:02:18.620> I'm<00:02:18.739> going<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> actually

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
number one so now I'm going to actually

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.720 
number one so now I'm going to actually
unscrew<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.209> idle<00:02:20.569> until<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.670> center<00:02:22.970> car<00:02:23.329> B

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
unscrew the idle until the center car B

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.960 
unscrew the idle until the center car B
sits<00:02:26.139> against<00:02:27.139> the<00:02:27.350> housing

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
sits against the housing

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.199 
sits against the housing
of<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.870> edge<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.320> Barrow<00:02:30.620> itself

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.210 

so<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:37.959> got<00:02:38.110> no<00:02:38.230> influence<00:02:38.590> at<00:02:38.860> all<00:02:38.980> so

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
so it's got no influence at all so

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.149 
so it's got no influence at all so
that's<00:02:39.370> closed<00:02:39.700> off<00:02:39.939> completely<00:02:40.540> there<00:02:41.159> just

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
that's closed off completely there just

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.080 
that's closed off completely there just
give<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> bit<00:02:42.579> of<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.700> blip<00:02:42.939> on<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.120> throttle

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
give it a bit of a blip on the throttle

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.059 
give it a bit of a blip on the throttle
and<00:02:46.090> as<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.329> can<00:02:46.450> see<00:02:46.659> number<00:02:47.260> one<00:02:47.409> cab<00:02:47.829> is

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
and as you can see number one cab is

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.330 
and as you can see number one cab is
open<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.610> little<00:02:49.060> bit

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
open a little bit

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.069 
open a little bit
number<00:02:51.340> two<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.579> closed<00:02:51.939> and<00:02:52.329> I've<00:02:52.629> got<00:02:52.810> number

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
number two is closed and I've got number

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.750 
number two is closed and I've got number
three<00:02:53.319> open<00:02:53.709> as<00:02:53.829> well<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.220> I've<00:02:54.310> got<00:02:54.519> no

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
three open as well so I've got no

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.729 
three open as well so I've got no
influence<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.629> centre<00:02:56.079> carburetor<00:02:56.560> at

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
influence on the centre carburetor at

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.009 
influence on the centre carburetor at
all<00:02:56.859> so<00:02:57.790> now<00:02:57.909> what<00:02:58.150> I'm<00:02:58.239> going<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.599> do<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.870> I'm

all so now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.290> screw<00:02:59.590> this<00:03:01.680> screw<00:03:03.480> for<00:03:04.480> number<00:03:04.720> one

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
going to screw this screw for number one

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.670 
going to screw this screw for number one
clockwise<00:03:06.760> until<00:03:07.290> looking<00:03:08.290> down<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.590> it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
clockwise until looking down on it

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.920 
clockwise until looking down on it
clockwise<00:03:10.109> until<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.940> carburetor<00:03:15.930> starts

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
clockwise until this carburetor starts

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.069 
clockwise until this carburetor starts
to<00:03:17.049> influence<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.799> second<00:03:18.159> carburetor<00:03:19.079> so

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
to influence the second carburetor so

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.229 
to influence the second carburetor so
what<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.260> do<00:03:20.409> is<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.829> actually<00:03:21.040> hold<00:03:21.489> pressure<00:03:22.000> on

screw to go you go tight I can feel the
I<00:03:31.439> know<00:03:32.439> that<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.010> starting<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.400> influence

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
I know that it's starting to influence

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.179

that<00:03:34.090> carburetor<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:34.900> I'll<00:03:35.769> back<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.010> off

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
that carburetor and I'll back it off

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.440 
that carburetor and I'll back it off
quarter<00:03:36.489> of<00:03:36.579> a<00:03:36.609> turn<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:36.849> that<00:03:37.030> will<00:03:37.150> give<00:03:37.299> you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
quarter of a turn and that will give you

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.449 
quarter of a turn and that will give you
within<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.620> quarter<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.489> turn<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:42.160> balance

out that carburetor so I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:03:44.889> I<00:03:45.310> can't<00:03:45.699> actually<00:03:45.849> do<00:03:46.329> it

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
demonstrate I can't actually do it

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.189 
demonstrate I can't actually do it

that's that car B there's those two car
B's<00:04:34.550> pretty<00:04:35.550> close<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.150> now<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:36.990> kept<00:04:37.290> it

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
B's pretty close and now we kept it

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.870 
B's pretty close and now we kept it
exactly<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:38.010> same<00:04:38.070> procedure<00:04:38.610> with<00:04:38.820> the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
exactly the same procedure with the

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.820 
exactly the same procedure with the
third<00:04:39.240> one<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.260> screw<00:04:40.590> it

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
third one so screw it

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.330 
third one so screw it
clockwise<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:42.000> close<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.449> throttle<00:04:43.340> until

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
clockwise to close the throttle until

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.240 
clockwise to close the throttle until
you<00:04:44.460> see<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.780> second<00:04:46.169> body<00:04:46.410> moves<00:04:46.740> but<00:04:47.220> I

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
you see the second body moves but I

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.050 
you see the second body moves but I
usually<00:04:47.940> hold<00:04:48.060> pressure<00:04:48.560> against<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:50.580> top<00:04:51.030> of

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
usually hold pressure against the top of

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.930 
usually hold pressure against the top of
the<00:04:51.510> butterfly<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.320> when<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:52.650> open<00:04:52.940> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
the butterfly so when you open the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.830 
the butterfly so when you open the
shuttles<00:04:54.300> up<00:04:54.949> top<00:04:55.949> of<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.130> butterfly<00:04:56.840> hold

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
shuttles up top of the butterfly hold

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.570 
shuttles up top of the butterfly hold
pressure<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.410> then<00:04:58.860> when<00:04:59.040> you<00:04:59.130> screw<00:04:59.400> this

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
pressure and then when you screw this

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.330 
pressure and then when you screw this
one<00:04:59.790> back<00:05:00.060> as<00:05:00.830> soon<00:05:01.830> as<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.070> starts

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
one back as soon as it starts

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.460 
one back as soon as it starts
influencing<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.210> calibrator<00:05:03.750> you'll<00:05:04.139> feel

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
influencing this calibrator you'll feel

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.210 
influencing this calibrator you'll feel
the<00:05:05.190> screw<00:05:05.550> pressure<00:05:05.820> get<00:05:06.389> quite<00:05:06.660> tight<00:05:07.220> so

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
the screw pressure get quite tight so

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.860 
the screw pressure get quite tight so
that's<00:05:08.370> my<00:05:08.520> tip<00:05:08.580> for<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.030> day<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.479> then<00:05:09.690> when

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
that's my tip for the day and then when

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.750 
that's my tip for the day and then when
you<00:05:09.960> can<00:05:10.110> basically<00:05:10.290> but<00:05:11.070> once<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:11.400> feel<00:05:11.729> it

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
you can basically but once you feel it

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.250 
you can basically but once you feel it
go<00:05:11.940> tight<00:05:12.210> back<00:05:12.419> it<00:05:12.540> off<00:05:12.630> quarter<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> turn

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
go tight back it off quarter of a turn

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.370 
go tight back it off quarter of a turn
put<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.130> car<00:05:14.340> beef<00:05:14.490> back<00:05:14.729> in<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:16.169> then<00:05:16.290> you

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
put the car beef back in and then you

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.040 
put the car beef back in and then you
can<00:05:16.530> put<00:05:16.680> your<00:05:16.710> vacuum<00:05:17.100> gauges<00:05:17.340> on<00:05:18.050> these

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
can put your vacuum gauges on these

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.440 
can put your vacuum gauges on these
three<00:05:19.880> ports<00:05:20.880> making<00:05:21.660> ports<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:23.270> balance<00:05:24.270> it

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
three ports making ports and balance it

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.120 
three ports making ports and balance it
finally<00:05:24.900> so<00:05:25.139> it's<00:05:25.260> only<00:05:25.440> only<00:05:25.770> going<00:05:25.919> to<00:05:25.979> need

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
finally so it's only only going to need

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.010 
finally so it's only only going to need
a<00:05:26.190> very<00:05:26.550> very<00:05:26.880> fine<00:05:27.150> amount<00:05:27.479> of<00:05:27.570> tuning<00:05:27.900> from

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
a very very fine amount of tuning from

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.560 
a very very fine amount of tuning from
that<00:05:28.199> point<00:05:28.410> onwards<00:05:28.800> bear<00:05:29.550> in<00:05:29.639> mind<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:30.389> do

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
that point onwards bear in mind you do

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.790 
that point onwards bear in mind you do
have<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.870> have<00:05:31.020> your<00:05:31.199> engine<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.620> good

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
have to have your engine and good

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.529 
have to have your engine and good
condition<00:05:32.220> so<00:05:32.250> typically<00:05:32.850> rinses<00:05:33.150> must<00:05:33.389> be

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
condition so typically rinses must be

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.820 
condition so typically rinses must be
good<00:05:34.010> flight<00:05:35.010> levels<00:05:35.340> must<00:05:35.580> be<00:05:35.700> good<00:05:35.880> and

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
good flight levels must be good and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.659 
good flight levels must be good and
clean<00:05:37.830> fuel<00:05:38.900> okay<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:39.960> hopefully<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.860> gives

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
clean fuel okay so hopefully that gives

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.600 
clean fuel okay so hopefully that gives
you<00:05:41.850> guys<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.030> few<00:05:42.270> tips<00:05:42.510> this<00:05:43.350> is<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.530> choke<00:05:43.860> rail

here mate then you can give that a bit

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.010 
here mate then you can give that a bit
of<00:05:47.700> a<00:05:47.760> lube<00:05:47.910> up<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.270> make<00:05:48.419> sure<00:05:48.570> that<00:05:48.750> doesn't

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
of a lube up and make sure that doesn't

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.589 
of a lube up and make sure that doesn't
it's<00:05:49.710> not<00:05:49.770> sticking

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
it's not sticking

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.980 
it's not sticking

all piped up and hoses and everything
back<00:06:00.480> on<00:06:02.060> so<00:06:03.060> all<00:06:03.210> I've<00:06:03.330> got<00:06:03.360> to<00:06:03.540> do<00:06:03.750> now<00:06:03.780> is

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
back on so all I've got to do now is

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.800 
back on so all I've got to do now is
I'll<00:06:05.040> put<00:06:05.250> my<00:06:05.400> tank<00:06:05.640> on<00:06:05.820> but<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.330> just<00:06:06.540> set<00:06:06.720> the

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
I'll put my tank on but I just set the

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.170 
I'll put my tank on but I just set the
tank<00:06:07.050> on<00:06:07.260> and<00:06:07.920> I<00:06:08.010> put<00:06:08.220> a<00:06:08.250> piece<00:06:08.610> of<00:06:08.640> four<00:06:09.030> four

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
tank on and I put a piece of four four

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.180 
tank on and I put a piece of four four
two

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.360 

just<00:06:13.820> here

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.220 

and<00:06:16.880> set<00:06:17.120> the<00:06:17.240> tank<00:06:17.449> so<00:06:17.690> you<00:06:17.720> can<00:06:17.930> actually

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
and set the tank so you can actually

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.920 
and set the tank so you can actually
adjust<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.770> screws<00:06:19.240> one<00:06:20.240> down<00:06:20.480> here<00:06:20.660> and<00:06:20.810> one

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
adjust the screws one down here and one

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.070 
adjust the screws one down here and one
on<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.080> other<00:06:21.199> side<00:06:22.750> so<00:06:23.750> I'm<00:06:23.840> going<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:24.020> hook

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
on the other side so I'm going to hook

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.450 
on the other side so I'm going to hook
my<00:06:24.230> vacuum<00:06:24.410> gauges<00:06:24.830> up<00:06:25.130> and<00:06:25.850> I'm<00:06:26.419> going<00:06:27.460> your

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
my vacuum gauges up and I'm going your

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.250 
my vacuum gauges up and I'm going your
initially<00:06:29.120> you'll<00:06:29.270> have<00:06:29.449> trouble<00:06:29.660> starting

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
initially you'll have trouble starting

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.620 
initially you'll have trouble starting
it<00:06:30.350> because<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:31.130> one<00:06:31.880> the<00:06:32.000> cartridge<00:06:32.389> will<00:06:32.510> be

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
it because the one the cartridge will be

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.200 
it because the one the cartridge will be
empty<00:06:33.110> but<00:06:33.380> also<00:06:33.560> your<00:06:33.919> idle<00:06:34.250> won't<00:06:34.610> lease<00:06:34.790> it

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
empty but also your idle won't lease it

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.820 
empty but also your idle won't lease it
so<00:06:35.810> you're<00:06:35.930> going<00:06:36.050> to<00:06:36.080> have<00:06:36.229> to<00:06:36.380> actually<00:06:36.530> hold

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
so you're going to have to actually hold

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.670 
so you're going to have to actually hold
the<00:06:36.979> throttle<00:06:37.190> and<00:06:37.460> then<00:06:37.610> balance<00:06:38.000> your<00:06:38.150> idle

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
the throttle and then balance your idle

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.320 
the throttle and then balance your idle
using<00:06:39.680> your<00:06:39.800> idle<00:06:40.070> screw<00:06:40.340> to<00:06:40.760> get<00:06:40.910> it<00:06:41.000> up<00:06:41.120> at<00:06:41.240> a

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
using your idle screw to get it up at a

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.860 
using your idle screw to get it up at a
thousand<00:06:41.990> rpm<00:06:42.729> once<00:06:43.729> you<00:06:43.820> got<00:06:43.970> a<00:06:44.000> thousand<00:06:44.479> 50

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
thousand rpm once you got a thousand 50

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.770 
thousand rpm once you got a thousand 50
thousand<00:06:45.590> thousand<00:06:45.919> 50<00:06:46.190> rpm<00:06:46.449> so<00:06:47.449> once<00:06:47.630> you've

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
thousand thousand 50 rpm so once you've

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.820 
thousand thousand 50 rpm so once you've
got<00:06:47.900> it<00:06:47.990> sitting<00:06:48.199> there<00:06:48.320> then<00:06:49.070> you<00:06:49.190> can<00:06:49.340> start

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
got it sitting there then you can start

00:06:50.830 --> 00:07:12.989 
got it sitting there then you can start
playing<00:06:51.830> with<00:06:51.979> the<00:06:52.130> caps

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:12.999 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:17.839 

I<00:07:13.289> got<00:07:14.289> a<00:07:14.319> third<00:07:14.679> gage<00:07:15.009> is<00:07:15.399> a<00:07:15.969> little<00:07:16.419> bit<00:07:16.569> too

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:17.849 
I got a third gage is a little bit too

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:22.459 
I got a third gage is a little bit too
too<00:07:18.849> high<00:07:19.119> on<00:07:19.329> Vickie<00:07:20.069> which<00:07:21.069> means<00:07:21.369> that<00:07:21.729> the

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:22.469 
too high on Vickie which means that the

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:24.839 
too high on Vickie which means that the
throttle<00:07:23.469> was<00:07:23.589> on<00:07:23.769> a<00:07:23.799> little<00:07:23.979> bit<00:07:24.219> close<00:07:24.489> till

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:24.849 
throttle was on a little bit close till

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.069 
throttle was on a little bit close till
wee<00:07:24.909> bit<00:07:25.539> too<00:07:25.809> much<00:07:27.029> so<00:07:28.029> I<00:07:28.089> need<00:07:28.269> to<00:07:28.419> basically

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:29.079 
wee bit too much so I need to basically

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:31.919 
wee bit too much so I need to basically
open<00:07:29.829> the<00:07:29.949> throttle<00:07:30.159> a<00:07:30.369> fraction<00:07:30.999> just<00:07:31.179> to

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:31.929 
open the throttle a fraction just to

00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:34.649 
open the throttle a fraction just to
drop<00:07:32.139> it<00:07:32.259> down<00:07:32.469> the<00:07:33.159> fraction<00:07:33.639> it<00:07:33.759> is<00:07:33.909> it<00:07:34.389> needs

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:34.659 
drop it down the fraction it is it needs

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:36.569 
drop it down the fraction it is it needs
because<00:07:35.409> it's<00:07:35.679> setting<00:07:35.949> up<00:07:36.039> a<00:07:36.219> little<00:07:36.459> bit

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:36.579 
because it's setting up a little bit

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.359 
because it's setting up a little bit
higher<00:07:36.789> about<00:07:37.659> two<00:07:37.899> to<00:07:38.379> two<00:07:38.409> notches<00:07:38.919> past

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:39.369 
higher about two to two notches past

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:42.359 
higher about two to two notches past
five<00:07:39.699> and<00:07:40.209> this<00:07:40.719> one's<00:07:40.929> these<00:07:41.829> two<00:07:42.099> here<00:07:42.339> are

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:42.369 
five and this one's these two here are

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:43.979 
five and this one's these two here are
sitting<00:07:42.669> perfectly<00:07:42.849> on<00:07:43.269> one<00:07:43.479> knotch<00:07:43.719> past

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:43.989 
sitting perfectly on one knotch past

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:47.039 
sitting perfectly on one knotch past
five<00:07:44.289> to<00:07:44.829> five
