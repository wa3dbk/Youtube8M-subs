 of operations very well has to do 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.960
 the hands are going to have to be by 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.859
 what to put with only with the mouth go 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 to have to take the spheres to the other 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 side of the clothesline with work ok which 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.199
 I managed to take more waits in a minute 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.430
 to be the winning team so that line 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.899
 chronometer 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.940
 I think it elaborates on the one hand because 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.640
 if it is not going to be able it is ready 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.700
 we would have a stopwatch at the moment 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.469

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.289

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.340

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.890

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.300

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.250
 you will not be able to have it with your cheeks 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.050
 it has nothing to do with the lips that 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.050

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.440

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:56.560
