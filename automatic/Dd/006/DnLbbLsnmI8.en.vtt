00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
some of the connections before removing

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.180 
some of the connections before removing
your<00:03:33.340> own<00:03:33.489> digitizer<00:03:34.620> we've<00:03:35.620> got<00:03:35.709> connections

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
your own digitizer we've got connections

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.059 
your own digitizer we've got connections
one<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.609> two<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.500> connectors<00:03:38.949> are

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
one and two here and the connectors are

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.610 
one and two here and the connectors are
fairly<00:03:39.250> easy<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:39.849> remove<00:03:40.120> here<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:41.500> this

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
fairly easy to remove here but this

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.170 
fairly easy to remove here but this
connection<00:03:42.129> is<00:03:42.190> connect<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.609> number<00:03:42.879> three

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
connection is connect to number three

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.979 
connection is connect to number three
and<00:03:43.449> it<00:03:43.930> has<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.079> white<00:03:44.760> leaver<00:03:45.760> which<00:03:46.629> needs<00:03:46.900> to

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
and it has a white leaver which needs to

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.369 
and it has a white leaver which needs to
be<00:03:47.280> flipped<00:03:48.280> up<00:03:48.519> like<00:03:48.699> so<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.359> then<00:03:50.290> the

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
be flipped up like so and then the

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.080 
be flipped up like so and then the
ribbon<00:03:50.680> cable<00:03:51.099> which<00:03:51.190> plugs<00:03:51.459> into<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.879> lever

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
ribbon cable which plugs into that lever

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.110 
ribbon cable which plugs into that lever
is<00:03:52.720> removed<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:53.739> way<00:03:56.609> ok<00:03:57.609> this<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:57.940> one<00:03:58.090> of

please take your time there are three
connections<00:04:03.150> connect<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.269> one<00:04:04.510> two<00:04:05.049> and

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
connections connect to one two and

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.099 
connections connect to one two and
there's<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.709> third<00:04:05.949> underneath<00:04:06.810> with<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.840> case

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
there's a third underneath with the case

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.039 
there's a third underneath with the case
opening<00:04:08.590> tool<00:04:08.889> simply<00:04:09.639> unclip<00:04:10.180> number<00:04:10.840> one

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
opening tool simply unclip number one

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.330 
opening tool simply unclip number one
here<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:13.870> number<00:04:14.079> two<00:04:14.199> and<00:04:15.690> then<00:04:16.690> slowly

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
here and then number two and then slowly

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.300 
here and then number two and then slowly
pulling<00:04:18.340> back<00:04:18.959> here<00:04:19.959> you'll<00:04:20.680> see<00:04:20.709> connector

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
pulling back here you'll see connector

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.879 
pulling back here you'll see connector
number<00:04:21.579> three<00:04:21.930> now<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:22.990> trick<00:04:23.380> with<00:04:23.620> number

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
number three now the trick with number

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.360 
number three now the trick with number
three<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.550> simply<00:04:27.930> open<00:04:28.930> or<00:04:29.139> lift<00:04:29.530> this

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
three it's simply open or lift this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.339 
three it's simply open or lift this
connector<00:04:30.909> here<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.419> white<00:04:31.630> connector<00:04:32.169> and

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
connector here the white connector and

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.219 
connector here the white connector and
then<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.250> ribbon<00:04:33.550> underneath<00:04:34.150> will<00:04:35.020> pull

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
then the ribbon underneath will pull

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.970 
then the ribbon underneath will pull
away<00:04:35.349> like<00:04:36.099> so

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
away like so

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:47.170 
away like so
you

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.240 

you
