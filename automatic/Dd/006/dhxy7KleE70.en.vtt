00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.220
 let's turn the wesh family 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.259
 we are not here to do 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.150
 poetry we are here to learn to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.500
 colorize color and black and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 white using photoshop for that I 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 will show you how to do from 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.320
 of a red panda or who has the advantage of 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.119
 behave and color and north 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.640
 so here is a quick example of this 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 that we can do 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.239
 so how do that on photoshop it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.590
 must first know crown that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.059
 I did first know that he 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 there are two procedures one for color 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.980
 and one for black and white let's start 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.230
 right away by the color that is the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 simpler then to apply everything 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 simply a recolorization there is and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.719
 if in the settings layers the calq 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.850
 is at saturation 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.699
 I increase the saturation to the maximum for 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.110
 see what color I'm changing is this 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.180
 that what I what color I improves 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.770
 this is for example I attach myself to the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.229
 color moment there ie its head 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.729
 mainly if I want to learn to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.110
 blue 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.840
 then I drop a little saturation 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.810
 until it suits me there 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.300
 suits me very well for example 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:28.880
 so I recolored the panda's head 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.150
 and the other parties in color but 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.080
 you 've seen that changes my background too 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.910
 but there as I have a background that is safe 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.610
 our layer I can very simply 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.840
 locate the torti saturation on this 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.240
 layer by making a mask 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.340
 decryption so for that I press on 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.530
 the alt key and you see at nikon 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.670
 that appears when I'm between 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.300
 two layers I click and here I have 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.660
 localized 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.630
 the effect of this adjustment layer on the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.330
 layer right below so that's 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.890
 for colors how to do it for 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.869
 black and white 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.920
 you have to create a new control layer 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.230
 shift hate and their empire with the tool 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.769
 paint pots touched from your keyboard 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.210
 then we will fill it some colors 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:25.400
 we will fill it 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:32.600
 of red and yellow I fill it and I 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:36.230
 pass it in dim light mode the same 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.850
 I click here with the paltrow keys 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.010
 past we have this decryption it goes 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.930
 apply to what is below the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.010
 point in so see who has a small 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.170
 problem is that it was also 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.140
 applied to color areas 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.470
 actually this state of the allows 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.870
 to apply a little everywhere news 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.330
 colors so how to do it for good 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:04.070
 located where I want and one just 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.960
 take not red panda and 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.310
 select where I want it 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.510
 applies ie black and white 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.060
 therefore selection of color ranges 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.740
 I click on black and you see that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.280
 takes not exactly everything I want 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.710
 it is not serious 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.820
 I press the shift key and I 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.470
 rake broad enough for all to be taken 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.490
 ok so here I have a little pre-screened 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.840
 everything I want what's behind 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.840
 it does not matter since it applies 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.580
 than those few there and I come back on 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.160
 my helmet 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:42.440
 the yellow one and I apply a mask of 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.850
 fusion here I click and that's it neither 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.860
 that on the black and white that I had 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.840
 selected then the problem is 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.930
 than by making a selection like that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.489
 you will have a rough job but very 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.360
 far from perfect so how do 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.400
 to soften the contours a bit 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.000
 we told you already several times so 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.459
 a large brush with a near hardness 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.470
 no one and an opacity that you can 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.739
 put 20 so pressing other 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.940
 here on 20 so I'm not going 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.650
 use that because I have a tablet 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.739
 graph that allows with the pressure of 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.079
 directly manage opacity 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.889
 so we have to go back to using the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.840
 contours you really see little opaque 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.440
 of your brush to soften the effect 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.169
 black and white 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.590
 yes, as we have already told you 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.240
 many times the fusion masks that 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.229
 thinking in black and white black it 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.740
 cache and blank is displayed so there I 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.110
 do not want eyes to show 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.240
 so here is pressed acts and click 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.180
 to display your merge mask 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.220
 to be able to work on it or not 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.690
 when you want anyway once 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.530
 you are on it you see well what 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.710
 so it's a game that it's done by 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.930
 example I not pretending press the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.510
 x key to the past from white to black 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.560
 and if it does not work, make sure 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.979
 you are black and white 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.240
 for that but it affects so there 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.550
 I make the transitions little more all 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.560
 you already see it's a little prettier 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.560
 it does it more is more realistic 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.880
 peugeot goes in white etc 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.330
 so you see times born girl like that 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.370
 good shot to fight obviously 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.580
 but that's not all there is the problem 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.050
 in fact with this kind of technique it's 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.520
 that in general the color is a bit lively 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.960
 so do not hesitate to go down a little 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.000
 opacity to make it a little more 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:49.260
 natural is so less 75 percent 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.420
 twenty five years so I re-show the 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.340
 problem is that these two are going 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.260
 interact 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.690
 how to make my different 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.290
 colors do not interact but he 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:07.080
 simply exclude areas 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.780
 where they apply to each other 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.370
 for that I have more than to copy my 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.370
 fusion mask on this one 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.800
 so for those at japy surratt I take 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.500
 my fusion mask and I drop it on 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.360
 what a few there and how I want it 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.300
 these areas of application 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.640
 exclude I have control there is it's 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.650
 reversed it and reversed it here it is 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.370
 so there actually my colors 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.919
 applies 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.330
 one for the color parts him for 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.560
 the black and white parties and you 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.510
 can make several several 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.100
 layers and for the colors and for the 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.070
 black and white using this ethics 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.729
 to change the color of everything that 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:50.300
 is black and white you can either 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:54.030
 change the fill color either 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:58.710
 applied to his own layer a 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:02.010
 few of adjustment attempted saturation in 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.640
 assuring who's going to act on exactly the 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:09.690
 even to others that this calculation has so there 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:13.500
 now send a max of encryption and 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.700
 of course and that applies to pandas and 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.890
 you see I can edit directly 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.470
 color without having to fill a 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.360
 different color each time 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:27.229
 even a little more practical 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:31.620
 so here is using the layers 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:33.900
 tinted saturation and colors 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.780
 filled in soft light you can 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.539
 colorized black and white images 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.229
 or color images with multiple 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:42.419
 colors etc 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:46.759
 so you have fun well before by 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.759
 sow and make us funny coloring
