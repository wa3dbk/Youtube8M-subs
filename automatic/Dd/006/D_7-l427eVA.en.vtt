00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 olmedo and you live to this channel living 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.490
 and good today we have a new video as 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.740
 you know about iphone 6 blogs this 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 so good apple terminal the version 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 improved the biggest one that has the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.970
 iphone 6 so as I say in the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
 other video sorry for the noise that 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.109
 background that is the air conditioning and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.220
 well I have many colors so without 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.220
 more delays 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.699
 i 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.699
 Y 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.710
 yes 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.560
 and well the dimensions are 15.81 of 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.090
 width 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.250
 after 7.78 high forgiveness upside down and 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.460
 then the thickness of doing so we go to 1 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.070
 millimeters 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.290
 the weight of 172 grams and the truth is that 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.600
 a weight that is not bad although if I see it 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.360
 a little bit heavy, although the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.380
 reinforcement to the full hd retina screen 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.560
 resolution 1920 x 1080p and good too 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.590
 it has the very soft 5.5 inches and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.890
 I think it's fine after it has the chip 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.020
 to 8 m 8 the motion recorder the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.210
 64 bits that make the terminal go 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.580
 very fast and how good the truth is that 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.180
 it's pretty good the camera is 1080p 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.680
 h of 30 or 60 fps in the normal of 13 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.460
 megapixels after slow motion 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.200
 can go to 120 to 240 fps thing that I 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 it seems to me that it is quite good and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.780
 make some videos that right now I'm going 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.780
 to leave with one 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 we really liked the truth is that 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.290
 record perfectly also has 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.270
 quality image stabilizer 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.250
 cinema and the truth is that it shows 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.390
 perfectly at the time of looking at it and the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 truth is that it is very good too 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.120
 has the zoom of three magnifications an optical 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.360
 we also made an optical zoom video 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.830
 and digital and good I think you can 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 visit it and you'll see what the 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.480
 differences we also have the sensor of 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.580
 touch haiti is the fingerprint sensor 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.500
 fingerprint right here tempts and tells 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.510
 which way you put it will work and the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.330
 it's really fine we're going to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.360
 follow wifi connectivity 4g lte has 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.360
 nfc bluetooth 4.0 and I think that good 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.240
 is a mobile that is quite good and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.070
 that I believe that apple has been overcome with 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.170
 you grow at the time of doing in terminals 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.480
 then the battery can hold up 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 14 hours with 3g after all with 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.070
 maximum can increase up to 11 hours 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.930
 well I think that from experience 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.360
 perfectly last one and a half two 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.090
 days in a user that good does not usually 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.580
 use a lot is used 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.800
 many etceteras a day you get what you 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.590
 I assure you also have like three or four 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.780
 screen hours or more as I say yes 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.760
 you're a medium theme user for 14 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.550
 hours now it was a pardon if the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 user is that it was up to much like 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.870
 minimum you get four hours later already 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.140
 yes no if not that can be mounted but 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.000
 we go but one day of the crime and so 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.560
 good the sensors the sweet there is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.540
 barometer he copied it three is the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.370
 Accelerometer proximity sensor and the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.620
 ambient light sensor that was 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.690
 just up here so very well 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.480
 and finally the operating system is the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.980
 God 8 good so good now too 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.860
 had to comment a voice at the end of 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.329
 video that you will like and good before 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.480
 to finalize the video we will compare 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.239
 iphone 6 with the zte that I have 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.510
 right now and good as you can see are 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.750
 very very similar 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.569
 the screen size good this 5 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.610
 inch is 5.5 inches that is 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.470
 this one looks a lot like defender and normal 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.569
 I want it to go through our 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.760
 office but it's not safe so good 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.799
 I think it's a very good terminal and 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.120
 which at the same time is too big for me 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.670
 taste but good is what we have brought 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.170
 and what we have analyzed so that I to 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.000
 finish I'll obviously put this note 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.170
 and good reality is over the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.730
 iphone 6 plas 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.099
 let's get ready to finish the video 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.290
 but before that I bring you a little gift 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.160

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.030
 draw how do you want the 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.940

 is going to put what you want the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.760

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.010
 count that I had to give this video 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.620
