00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello friends and in this video we 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 Consider a model of a gas 12 winters carriage 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.780
 ambulance scale 1 to 40 three 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.820
 which came out in a magazine series 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 car and in service and this model 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 came out at number one sleep this 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 the release was 99 rubles and a model 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.609
 which I purchased 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.189
 this model is from pilot series in test 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.980
 The series has been released 4 editions and these 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.869
 models were more carefully collected from 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 they had better painting 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.300
 body more detailed some 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.850
 elements and these models were made for 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 to attract a new buyer and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.200
 see whether there will be demand for this series 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.680
 characteristic feature of the pilot model 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.140
 series 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.690
 this is what they have rims 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.350
 cap made of two parts 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.059
 as a separate part and wheel on 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 models from the regular series 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.579
 the disk is already simplified it is not cast 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.850
 whole and simply painted with silver 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.710
 to say about the model is interesting itself 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.989
 prototype car real 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.979
 I have not seen cars but these 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 cars 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.650
 existed and not survived until 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.869
 Today I saw these cars now 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.600
 repainted in normal black 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.610
 put the salon and say it's just 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 civilian car but have medical 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.240
 cars have a characteristic feature on 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 trunk lid 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.330
 top there are loops on the car in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.850
 civilian version of these loops are 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 inside the cabin the medical version is 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.290
 made to the boot lid 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.030
 opened up more vertically for 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.470
 facilities 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.850
 patient loading medical compartment and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 what can be said about the model is quite 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.649
 well-made model it has many 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.990
 individual parts separate front 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.189
 headlights separate turn signals separate 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.140
 front and rear bumper 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.750
 separate grille on the hood 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.820
 there is a mascot there is a spotlight and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.070
 designation in a medical car 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.030
 another not a characteristic for 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 magazine series this is what the grille 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.640
 radiator there is a blackening principle on 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310
 most of the desire patterns of the series you 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.100
 you have to blacken the holes yourself 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.760
 here already 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.590
 the manufacturer took care of your model 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.810
 also separate wipers 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.600
 they are made a little rough but not 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.390
 less pretty looks good on 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.430
 this model is not painted black 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.120
 Salon if you wish you can 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.680
 to color 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.870
 the back of the medical compartment has 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.360
 frosted glass of thought all as on 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.400
 this prototype is pretty good 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.560
 made wheels and tires on 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.140
 I replaced this model with Kharkov 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 as you can see they have a little better 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.370
 detailing and who wants to purchase 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.340
 the same set of rubber then he 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.070
 called Kharkov tires Volga 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.870
 wide basically google and you can 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.920
 dial and give you a place where you can 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.010
 purchase this kit 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.050
 separate tail light and separate 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.540
 handle trunk closure also have 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.600
 license plate light space for 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.400
 license plate fastening 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.800
 traditional bottom for model john 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.540
 series and what's good is that on this 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.060
 model exhaust system is made 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.670
 separate detail as you can see I took it off 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.550
 painted in silver color is also 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.350
 improved the look of this model and competitor 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.810
 This model is a model from 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.360
 our auto industry manufacturer of course that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.490

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.490
 Available in two colors. 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.740
 white and black color of the model is painted 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.230
 salon and overall quality of performance 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.020
 slightly higher than the model and magazine 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.160
 series I also have a winter model from 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.170

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.050
 I will also make a comparative video where you 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.020
 You can see how the model is from 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.640
 our car industry is better than the model and 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.160
 magazine series but in general it's pretty 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.960
 good model and quite interesting 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.680

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.440
