00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hello friends greetings to your friends 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.250
 old here to present you with a 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.910
 macerated 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.779
 that you make with a cooler or with a 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.510
 cooler as you know this is coming 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:22.090
 originally from the store with this 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.009
 key that nothing else here oppress him 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.070
 install the liquid but like us 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.380
 we are handling the hot liquid not 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.779
 I recommend you is because this part of 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.269
 up is going to break down it's going to 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.800
 make a hole with hot water 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.830
 then with the experience that I already had 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 with this cooler or with this master 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.719
 what I did 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.180
 remove the other is as if it were a 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.120
 screw a tube louvers remove the nut 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.239
 from the inner side and it is the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.329
 hole in the equity part of the macerated 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.870
 then I put you here a round will play 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.670
 of the big one and adapt the key 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.400
 what is a long tube in the part of 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.520
 back inhabits I'll show it here 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.220
 how it looks inside is almost similar to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.759
 the other but this is a metal is 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:25.180
 made of metal the material then 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:27.110
 It is safer and more more durable 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.890
 well 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.250
 we have usually seen in more videos or 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.740
 less 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.759
 more senators of this style 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.759
 what I did 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.810
 I put here I made a 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.320
 double bottom with steel material 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.920
 stainless these are the legs 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.330
 and this is an ear that I put so that 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 it is easier to put it in and take it out 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.869
 storage so that when I'm 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.429
 macerating the grain I did not block the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.759
 entry to my key and it remains what they are 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.580
 as some 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.670
 two or three inches in height which he 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.280
 the must then the hot broth goes to 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.910
 get free here at the bottom and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.330
 the seed is not going to obstruct me 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:34.810
 when it comes out then what I use 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.810
 in this macerated is a bag 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.060
 kind bye 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.709
 the sample 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.709
 and that I put the seed 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.970
 pass the subway I put the hot water 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.440
 and excuse me if the sound I hear them 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.830
 well is this nylon type bag what 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.920
 I put here in the inside and already 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.420
 the full of grain and subsequently you 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.980
 I put the hot water to start 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:19.420
 macerate what is malted barley and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:22.270
 already when he considered that it is time for 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.680
 to wash the grain or circulate the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.709
 grain 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.910
 Well, I already have it come out for the key and 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.980
 also normally 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.550
 I use a jar to start 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.550
 to this 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.950
 to get started 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.140
 to collect here in the hot broth and 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.210
 in this way I circulate it 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.069
 putting back in the part of here of 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.670
 above 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.610
 yes they will serve 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.520
 there the only thing I use is the bag 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.730
 nylon 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.730
 the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.170
 double the false fund I made to this 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.049
 plate to this plate 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.340
 many holes I put his legs to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.389
 that is not to not fall to 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.020
 down and I put his little mouth to get it out 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:30.370
 in an easy way and the key that you 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 adapt here buffer if they are fixed is 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.730
 something cheap and something simple and easy 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.090
 to elaborate then my friends here 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:47.490
 I leave my idea once again and says goodbye 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.490
 you are your friend the old man see you later
