jailbreaking<00:02:09.649> stuff<00:02:10.310> will<00:02:10.520> work<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:13.010> now<00:02:13.160> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
jailbreaking stuff will work so now that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.980 
jailbreaking stuff will work so now that
your<00:02:13.400> device<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.700> turned<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.540> can<00:02:14.660> open<00:02:14.930> up

just boot and now turn off your device
which<00:02:22.250> will<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.520> doing<00:02:22.730> right<00:02:22.850> now<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.040> as

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
which will be doing right now and as

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.070 
which will be doing right now and as
soon<00:02:25.190> as<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.400> turns<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:26.390> turns<00:02:26.600> off<00:02:26.840> we

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
soon as that turns on it turns off we

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.690 
soon as that turns on it turns off we
can<00:02:27.140> go<00:02:27.290> into<00:02:27.440> DFU<00:02:27.950> mode<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.400> we're<00:02:28.490> just<00:02:28.520> going

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
can go into DFU mode so we're just going

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.050 
can go into DFU mode so we're just going
to<00:02:28.820> wait<00:02:29.200> for<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.590> power<00:02:31.070> down<00:02:31.250> hit<00:02:31.820> next

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
to wait for it to power down hit next

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.330 
to wait for it to power down hit next
now<00:02:32.390> follow<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.810> instructions<00:02:33.320> like<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.190> did

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
now follow the instructions like you did

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:44.230 
now follow the instructions like you did
before

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.650 

and<00:02:46.040> then<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.250> device<00:02:47.550> should<00:02:47.580> go<00:02:48.030> into<00:02:48.270> DFU

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and then the device should go into DFU

00:02:48.660 --> 00:03:00.650 
and then the device should go into DFU
mode<00:02:51.410> shortly<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:58.069> now<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.459> will<00:02:59.730> exploit

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
mode shortly and now it will exploit

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:13.220 
mode shortly and now it will exploit
with<00:03:00.840> lime<00:03:01.050> rain<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:05.420> boot<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.600> device<00:03:12.230> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
with lime rain and a boot to device and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.820 
with lime rain and a boot to device and
now<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:15.150> done<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.690> once<00:03:16.140> your<00:03:16.320> device<00:03:16.380> turns
