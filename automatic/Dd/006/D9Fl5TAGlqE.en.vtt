00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
he gave me this team it's I think

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.240 
he gave me this team it's I think
supposed<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:57.440> first<00:00:58.440> gen<00:00:58.680> pokes<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
supposed to be a first gen pokes I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.020 
supposed to be a first gen pokes I
believe<00:01:00.020> something<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:02.030> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
believe something like that it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.450 
believe something like that it's
basically<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.600> guess<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> team<00:01:04.199> type<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.280> thing

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
basically I guess a team type of thing

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.090 
basically I guess a team type of thing
and<00:01:05.720> his<00:01:06.720> team<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> theme<00:01:07.740> type<00:01:07.979> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and his team is also a theme type of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.580 
and his team is also a theme type of
thing<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.790> color<00:01:09.240> theme<00:01:09.810> thing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
thing it was just like color theme thing

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
thing it was just like color theme thing
I've<00:01:11.100> never<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.520> done<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:12.210> or<00:01:12.420> used<00:01:12.780> one

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I've never actually done one or used one

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.460 
I've never actually done one or used one
but<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.830> pretty<00:01:14.070> cool<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.270> looked<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> over

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
but it's pretty cool so I looked it over

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
but it's pretty cool so I looked it over
and<00:01:18.200> went<00:01:19.200> from<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.590> figured<00:01:20.040> okay<00:01:20.430> he'll

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and went from there I figured okay he'll

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
and went from there I figured okay he'll
start<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> battle<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.590> figured<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.549> he's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
start the battle so I figured that he's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
start the battle so I figured that he's
gonna<00:01:24.240> try<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.900> lead<00:01:25.200> off<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.500> something

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
gonna try and lead off with something

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
gonna try and lead off with something
that's<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:26.280> set<00:01:26.549> up<00:01:26.670> stealth<00:01:26.909> rock<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that's gonna set up stealth rock so I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
that's gonna set up stealth rock so I
felt<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.750> maybe<00:01:27.960> his<00:01:28.579> weeble<00:01:29.579> wobble

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
felt like maybe his weeble wobble

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.749 
felt like maybe his weeble wobble
because<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.840> usually<00:01:31.140> set<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.650> rocks<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
because they usually set up rocks so I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.060 
because they usually set up rocks so I
decided<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> bleed<00:01:33.659> off<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.110> mice<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.860> roof

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
decided to bleed off with mice and roof

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.670 
decided to bleed off with mice and roof
and<00:01:35.450> he<00:01:36.450> ends<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.689> leading<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.140> chimchar<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and he ends up leading with chimchar and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.530 
and he ends up leading with chimchar and
I'm<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:38.009> well<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.790> an<00:01:39.060> interesting

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
I'm like well that's just an interesting

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.679 
I'm like well that's just an interesting
lead<00:01:39.720> i<00:01:39.960> guess<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.619> he<00:01:41.040> u-turns<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:42.210> end<00:01:42.600> up

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
lead i guess so he u-turns and i end up

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.929 
lead i guess so he u-turns and i end up
staying<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.740> well<00:01:43.950> Sandra

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
staying in because I'm like well Sandra

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.179 
staying in because I'm like well Sandra
is<00:01:45.090> pretty<00:01:45.329> defensive<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.530> really<00:01:47.070> don't

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
is pretty defensive so I really don't

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.120 
is pretty defensive so I really don't
have<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:48.360> issue<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.470> suppose<00:01:49.829> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
have like an issue there I suppose I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580 
have like an issue there I suppose I
didn't<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.970> was<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.270> trouble<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:52.229> he

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
didn't think I was in trouble so then he

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
didn't think I was in trouble so then he
went<00:01:52.680> into<00:01:52.890> his<00:01:53.070> Paris<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.600> slowpoke

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

and then end up going into San true

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.050 
and then end up going into San true
thinking<00:02:04.560> maybe

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
thinking maybe

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.210

he's gonna try and paralyze me but no

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.580 
he's gonna try and paralyze me but no
instead<00:02:07.490> he<00:02:07.729> spores<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.420> then<00:02:08.569> I'm<00:02:08.720> ended<00:02:09.440> up

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
going into my growlithe and I expected

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.470 
going into my growlithe and I expected
him<00:02:12.319> go<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:12.739> grass<00:02:12.950> leg<00:02:13.190> move<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.150> I'm

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
stealth rocks again that's always cool

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.089 
stealth rocks again that's always cool
thing<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.790> do<00:02:50.060> he<00:02:50.630> goes<00:02:50.810> into<00:02:51.049> shelters<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.860> wrap

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
thing to do he goes into shelters I wrap

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.820 
thing to do he goes into shelters I wrap
it's<00:02:52.280> been<00:02:52.489> my<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.780> spiky<00:02:54.230> thing<00:02:54.440> he's<00:02:54.590> away

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
it's been my the spiky thing he's away

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.759 
it's been my the spiky thing he's away
now<00:02:55.340> she<00:02:55.400> last<00:02:55.819> on<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> one<00:02:56.299> sand<00:02:56.750> true<00:02:57.080> he

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
now she last on the one sand true he

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.380 
now she last on the one sand true he
predicted<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.549> wanted<00:02:59.000> for<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.209> rabbit

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
predicted that I wanted for a rabbit

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.229 
predicted that I wanted for a rabbit
spin<00:02:59.780> boat<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.230> thought<00:03:00.380> maybe<00:03:00.530> he<00:03:01.160> would<00:03:01.370> do

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
spin boat so I thought maybe he would do

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.420 
spin boat so I thought maybe he would do
that<00:03:02.420> again<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:02.989> I'm<00:03:03.080> like<00:03:03.200> staying<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.010> maybe

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
that again so I'm like staying and maybe

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.729 
that again so I'm like staying and maybe
you'll<00:03:04.670> work<00:03:04.910> but<00:03:05.660> now<00:03:05.840> he<00:03:05.900> kills<00:03:06.230> me<00:03:06.380> off<00:03:06.500> was

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
you'll work but now he kills me off was

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.650 
you'll work but now he kills me off was
just<00:03:06.860> like<00:03:07.069> all<00:03:07.610> right<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.269> i<00:03:08.299> go<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.540> my

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
just like all right so i go to my

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.509 
just like all right so i go to my
Magnemite<00:03:09.200> predicting<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.980> switch<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.400> go

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
Magnemite predicting the switch and go

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.360 
Magnemite predicting the switch and go
for<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> volt<00:03:10.970> switch<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:12.170> i<00:03:12.560> guess<00:03:13.010> which

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
for a volt switch so i guess which

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.640 
for a volt switch so i guess which
initiative<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.180> go<00:03:14.359> into<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.140> ground<00:03:15.530> with

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
initiative and I go into the ground with

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.479 
initiative and I go into the ground with
as<00:03:16.100> he<00:03:16.340> goes<00:03:16.579> into<00:03:17.290> weasel<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.530> that's<00:03:19.280> not

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
as he goes into weasel and that's not

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.979 
as he goes into weasel and that's not
very<00:03:19.670> good<00:03:19.880> matchup<00:03:20.239> for<00:03:20.269> me<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:20.750> I'm<00:03:20.840> going<00:03:20.959> to

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
very good matchup for me so I'm going to

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.770 
very good matchup for me so I'm going to
end<00:03:21.170> up<00:03:21.230> going<00:03:21.530> into<00:03:21.650> my<00:03:22.519> slowpoke<00:03:23.269> who<00:03:23.540> gets

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
end up going into my slowpoke who gets

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.270 
end up going into my slowpoke who gets
credit<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:24.739> like<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.630> stupid<00:03:26.980> but<00:03:27.980> I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
credit and I'm like that is stupid but I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.949 
credit and I'm like that is stupid but I
end<00:03:28.430> up<00:03:28.519> switching<00:03:28.790> out<00:03:29.030> because<00:03:29.269> i<00:03:29.359> do<00:03:29.420> want

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
end up switching out because i do want

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.440 
end up switching out because i do want
slowpoke<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.950> stay<00:03:31.190> around<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.819> he<00:03:32.150> also<00:03:32.269> has

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
slowpoke to stay around and he also has

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.360 
slowpoke to stay around and he also has
your<00:03:32.780> generator<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.769> helps<00:03:34.040> me<00:03:34.220> out<00:03:34.250> a

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
your generator so that helps me out a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.819 
your generator so that helps me out a
lot<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:34.819> end<00:03:35.299> up<00:03:35.329> going<00:03:35.630> into<00:03:35.720> Paris<00:03:36.260> basically

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
lot I end up going into Paris basically

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.520 
lot I end up going into Paris basically
as<00:03:37.069> fodder<00:03:37.569> because<00:03:38.569> now<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.840> can<00:03:38.959> just<00:03:39.230> come<00:03:39.410> in

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
as fodder because now I can just come in

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.110 
as fodder because now I can just come in

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
with Magnemite which is gonna be quicker

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.539 
with Magnemite which is gonna be quicker
than<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.810> just<00:03:42.139> kill<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.739> just<00:03:43.160> said<00:03:43.430> to

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
go for a thunderbolt because like

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.220 
go for a thunderbolt because like
everything<00:03:45.889> nothing<00:03:46.430> resisted<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.870> it's

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
everything nothing resisted it so it's

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.470 
everything nothing resisted it so it's
like<00:03:48.290> sure<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.100> then<00:03:49.609> he<00:03:49.700> goes<00:03:49.850> into<00:03:50.060> his<00:03:50.150> chin

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480

like sure and then he goes into his chin
chart<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.900> was<00:03:51.170> hoping<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.620> go<00:03:51.739> for<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:51.980> farm<00:03:52.220> oh

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
chart I was hoping and go for a farm oh

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.710 
chart I was hoping and go for a farm oh
if<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.549> didn't<00:03:52.730> go<00:03:52.819> for<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.060> farm<00:03:53.269> oh<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:53.540> I'm

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
if you didn't go for a farm oh so I'm

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.210 
if you didn't go for a farm oh so I'm
assuming<00:03:53.810> he's<00:03:54.200> going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.410> eat<00:03:54.590> her<00:03:54.739> now<00:03:54.950> so

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
assuming he's going to eat her now so

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.800 
assuming he's going to eat her now so
this<00:03:55.340> also<00:03:55.549> gives<00:03:55.819> me<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.060> chance<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.389> get<00:03:56.630> more

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
this also gives me a chance to get more

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.690 
this also gives me a chance to get more

scarfed magma I did not expect that to

scarfed magma I did not expect that to
be<00:04:06.230> honest<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:06.829> you<00:04:07.130> know

be honest but you know
it<00:04:07.720> happens<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:08.980> now<00:04:09.130> he's<00:04:09.340> likely<00:04:09.670> to

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
it happens so now he's likely to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
doesn't his shelter and I go into my

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.630 
doesn't his shelter and I go into my
slowpoke<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.200> I'm<00:04:32.260> like<00:04:32.500> oh<00:04:32.650> no<00:04:32.950> this<00:04:33.280> is

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
weird I didn't expect that because he

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.850 
weird I didn't expect that because he
had<00:04:35.860> rapid<00:04:36.250> spin<00:04:36.460> I'm<00:04:36.580> like<00:04:36.820> uh<00:04:37.590> this<00:04:38.590> sucks
