00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
when it came out the deck just got so

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.590 
when it came out the deck just got so
much<00:01:36.509> better<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.399> not<00:01:38.399> only<00:01:38.429> do<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.119> draw

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
much better because not only do you draw

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.830 
much better because not only do you draw
one<00:01:40.369> your<00:01:41.369> opponent<00:01:41.939> draws<00:01:42.179> one<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.720> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
one your opponent draws one so that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.010 
one your opponent draws one so that
works<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.259> appropriate<00:01:43.970> plus<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.689> stall

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
works with appropriate plus it's a stall

works with appropriate plus it's a stall
card<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.850> can't<00:01:48.149> take<00:01:48.360> damage

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.929 
during this turn or your opponent's next
turn<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.229> great<00:01:52.469> card<00:01:53.219> just<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> stall

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
turn so it's a great card just to stall

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.669 
turn so it's a great card just to stall
for<00:01:53.969> one<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.600> turn<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:54.929> then<00:01:55.289> see<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.560> you
