00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:21.390
 exposed these are at 199 each and this one 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.970
 it's 149 for this is a coupon in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.809
 background buying side and this makes 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.070
 a quota in the purchase of 22 dollars and 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:33.629

 come out as the first transaction that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.809
 I did in the morning of four dollars with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 55 cents but there they charged me more 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.579
 there they charged me 6 dollars with 71 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.079
 cents and the reason was because I had 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.870
 a few coupons of pons and digital pardon 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.390
 and that digital coupon can not be linked with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.350
 the manufacturer or it is digital or is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.089
