 screwdriver set mount with this all 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.259
 we will understand and probably when we will 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:13.510

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:32.950
 set the wires and look even have to 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.129

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.329
 this thing 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.640
 somewhere you can stick but there is also 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.840
 also 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.470

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.349
 carpet and this thing should be 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:19.599
 somewhere under the glass is a method of this 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:24.489
 signal further instruction is simple 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.859
 paper sheet but in english it 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.790

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:33.430
 how to fix how we connect this 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.769
 Well, let's use the scheme 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.769
 let's see what we have here 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.060

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.269
 on the Internet here it is 1 to 5 outputs 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.370
 it will be the most basic it will be 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.989
 set 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.989
 a little gum is out of place here 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.880

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.210
 installed on the driver's door and this 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:28.729
 each one already has two contacts 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:31.000
 and all is well today was such 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.090
