00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello like it here from markus fotos.de 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.130
 Today I want the canon league - in short 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.750
 imagine 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.429
 and I do that in cooperation with 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 few other channels on youtube the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.340
 also with the topic photography 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.320
 and technology 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 there we are together 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440
 for you a small advantage you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.020
 you can win something at the end and 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.570
 For example, an iphone 6 one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 Playstation 4 including game or 100 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.019
 euro coupon from saturn like that with 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.550
 you can find the winning game works 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.359
 in the video description there simply 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 take a look 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 and now to recognize league mix 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.750
 these small and compact cameras 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.489
 really ideal for all those always one 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.620
 want to have camera order 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.000
 be able to record something spontaneously 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.739
 that's why the thing is so popular 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.300
 at youtube because it fits with these 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.129
 really small dimensions really too 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
 in every jacket pocket or sometimes in 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.030
 the handbag is also the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.530
 stabilization of the camera really good 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.719
 because if you just do it now 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.980
 takes in the hand and just pure 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.600
 speaks and is doing a bit 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.250
 moved or even around in the area 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 then you can already see that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 picture is extremely quiet and also the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 Built-in microphones are real 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.210
 great because if I now of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 my microphone here at the lapel 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.189
 Switching to the sound were the camera 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 directly then you realize that the quality 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.670
 you really have to be really good at it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 not even big thoughts about 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 attitude make for the automatic 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 Models installed are working 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 really very good a positive 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.259
 innovation over the slightly older one 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.299
 model is that the camera now one 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.430
 separate input for microphone and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 has headphones so they did 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.479
 also external microphones can use 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.790
 if the protagonist something further 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.310
 is away from the camera or simply an 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.750
 a special kind of recording wishes 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.400
 on the other side we have too 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.240
 again two connections and once 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.890
 a usb port and a hdmi port 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.060
 which I personally very positive 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.340
 has surprised the long battery 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 term of around 3 hours and the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.000
 fact that the camera is not anymore 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.729
 works with a micro sd card 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.700
 but here is a normal sd 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.170
 map space in there is really good 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.280
 also the sharpness of the works 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 camera that is if I here the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.909
 distance to my face then change 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.350
 you see, the camera comes very much 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.640
 good after when it comes to spicy 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.500
 So it works for people too 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.280
 It's not about wanting to do it 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.560
 ideal 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.910
 who this wide-angle look of the camera 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.650
 not really like it because he's scared 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.360
 that's so scary all over 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.980
 looks or simply says there is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.959
 Much too much in the background 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.819
 he has the possibility s.der camera 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.620
 to switch to another zoom level 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.660
 against cutting so changed that the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.790
 proportions of the face of the some 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.350
 But you have to look better 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.030
 even the poor really complete 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.560
 extend as much as I do here now 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.090
 to be still in the picture 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.650
 there are only two tiny ones 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.870
 small points of criticism I at the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.840
 want to practice camera though has know each other 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.890
 really well considered the protection of 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.209
 lens front with the one off switch 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.860
 link function 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.269
 but unfortunately you have to say that in the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.610
 sleep mode the display completely 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.959
 Unprotected is therefore a protective film 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.519
 Similar to the mobile phone is here 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.230
 attached or in any case somehow 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.190
 a bag where you can do that safely 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.860
 then save 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.000
 Unfortunately, both know not with 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.950
 the other triviality me 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.959
 noticed is that when the camera 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.400
 once it went to sleep this is 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.290
 means after a certain time 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.850
 has turned itself off 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.890
 only reactivate the camera by 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.420
 you turn it off properly and once 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.130
 turn on the press of 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.840
 some button it is now on the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.850
 page the recording or the play button 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.470
 Unfortunately, it does not bring anything that is 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.180
 as I said everything complain on high 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.709
 level I like this camera right 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.360
 good and since I used it 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.190
 she is for everything now be it as 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.079
 little notebook where I myself 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.570
 just a little bit every now and then 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.769
 Reminder on the SD card I speak 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.049
 use them in between as 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.940
 camera and of course you useful 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.950
 Also to be cut with photo shootings 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.390
 or just a little video 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.890
 for my channel 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.359
 Overall, a thing which I very much 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.680
 like to have it and if you think so 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.750
 is the right one for you look at you 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.609
 In any case, and maybe buy 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.079
 some people say yes from berlin 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.280
 comes as it is in the case of the 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.500
 both days down here is that 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.329
 definitely different once the ben jaworski 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.640
 who has thought 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.109
 the top 5 ideas for photographers 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.880
 on the other side of the matthias 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.709
 proske of value check considering 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.269
 which three cameras might have 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.799
 you should be under the tree looks 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.329
 because in any case, purely in the and 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.250
 In the middle there is also the playlist 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.320
 with all videos from all channels 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.090
 participated in this action and 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.920
 Of course I have already said so 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.510
 you what the information about it in the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.739
 I do not forget video description 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.739
 Thank you for watching would
