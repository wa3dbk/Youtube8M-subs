00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:21.620
 [Music] 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.619
 Okay, now we 're going to learn the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.230
 modes sure of the greatest 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.360
 here comes the mode of the highest mode of melody 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.460
 fashion harmonic smoking act to understand 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.410
 and you must first learn how to 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 do for example if I did to scale 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.070
 bigger 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:50.629
 out of dodo it is classified as 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:52.940
 I do not know if I'm back as Doric me 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.540
 as fringe and is right 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.190
 now if you observe it seems that it does not 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.190
 Wow, when we do it this way. 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.500
 but now I'll explain the great but 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.350
 Dodo mode the way you have to get this 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.600
 face if you stay aft you make her bigger 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.600
 and see where there was change for example 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.920
 I danced that the Dorian had 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.570
 Tuesday 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.640
 which was a tense minor and in the seventh 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.729
 was 7 lower 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.530
 so for example if you make a doric 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.670
 so how would you make a stopover? 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.470
 even bigger 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.100
 only that it will change now what the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.100
 third grade and seventh grade 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.390
 then steal higher and change the third 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.390
 and a certain then would look like this 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.320
 the dóri qo why it is called dora 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:02.189
 because of these two 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:06.229
 third and seventh biennial if it was 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.229
 to analyze would be a scale of this mall 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.020
 So this is the big secret of you. 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.910
 to figure out the ways you'd do it's just that 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.470
 you will see a terror generation as it is 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.170
 you see that you had change making 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 she added so here got what was not 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:32.610
 the 3rd and 7th grade the same thing 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.610
 would be miami's name 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.600
 we will note that on the larger scale 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.630
 Of me have some additives deny 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.450
 some notes that you have to try 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.320
 the greater is also the only business is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.250
 da nba 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:55.269
 then there remains the call of 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.400
 fringe 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:10.080
 I have to see a detective separation 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:17.950
 had at least stayed in the seventh 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:22.780
 was the seventh best right certain minor 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:28.810
 But this excuse is Friday's sixth and 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:31.510
 in the seventh minor then the smaller fetus as 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:38.120
 it was an increased fifth that I 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.049
 I insist that increasing the minor anvisa and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.519
 is not less 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:46.459
 changing the ninth fringe is low 19 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.250
 fifth augmented except the sacred minor 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.319
 It's for you to make me cold. 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.140
 what would Africa be like 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.829
 he would have to have these changes a 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.070
 minor note 1 the smallest piece on the fifth 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:15.449
 half arrow then scale service here 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:15.449
 [Music] 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.580
 this here would be the right video mode 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.220
 the lithic way for us to scale 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.710
 and see where there was a change in scale 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.700
 of light is simon né 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.330
 only that he had a change that can 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.940
 then what would be a change 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.360
 in the fourth as if it were a smaller fifth 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.730
 tape the room increased I do not know 11th 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.850
 augmented right then if I had to 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.290
 You tell me one of the lydian like 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:57.830
 would you take a larger scale and 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.090
 truth would you add 11th augmented 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:06.960
 or who also would be evil 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:11.389
 [Music] 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.389
 the right would be this legal idea 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:32.769
 this idea now let's see a friend of yours 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.769
 book leaving from sun to sun 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:40.519
 if you look at the scale of your larger 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:51.199
 It has a fascination so it has already changed 

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:53.089
 here are going to make sound the no change was the 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.849
 who do not know would be a certain minor 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:58.279
 chance for you form for me of the mix 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.409
 Olivio as would be the name of his book 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.199
 you would do 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:06.769
 the scale of alone is not 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:11.389
 the dodo and would change the seventh that would 

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:13.719
 the seventh smaller would be this scale 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.719
 here o 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.550
 it would be this idea
