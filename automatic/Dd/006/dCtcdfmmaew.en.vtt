00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.129
 hello to all that such proposals very 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.779
 well today I bring you the first video 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.610
 review the fact for the channel and for the 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.890
 blog is the life review of nothing else and 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.599
 nothing less than an entire trilogy that 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.130
 I finished it very little thanks to the 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.200
 challenge keep on reading but that already takes 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.910
 enough time posted I'm 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.619
 talking about the hunger games of 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.480
 hunger games' written by suzanne 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.949
 collins the truth that I had so many 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.030
 eager to read that trilogy because everything 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.040
 the world was talking about her and 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.379
 I wanted to give my own opinion about them 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.360
 and does very little determined trial 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.129
 the third part of this trilogy I have 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.809
 to say that it has left me a taste of 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.700
 pretty bittersweet mouth and I wanted 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.020
 tell you why the commercial in the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.730
 Hunger games from hunger games' 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.320
 because they recommended me the friends they 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.760
 they wanted to go to the movies to watch the movie and 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.800
 I still had not read this first 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.539
 novel so I put the batteries with 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.399
 she, if I remember correctly, was one of the 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.559
 first works and but one of the most 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.090
 I liked the dystopian genre and those that 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.250
 it made me want about this whole genre 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.869
 literary I have to say that games 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.720
 of hunger 'the first part I thought 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.640
 a very original novel very very well 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.640
 counted although the company games 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.810
 a very violent macabre theme 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.280
 now it's a pretty idea 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.570
 quite original I was surprised by 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.909
 full 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.159
 you want me to enjoy it so much so 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.200
 gave me the opportunity to reflect on many 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.660
 things especially if it would be if we would be 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.040
 able to kill another human being and 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.560
 even though they are forcing us 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.240
 although our life depends on it its 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.070
 book that made me reflect and I liked 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.990
 very much I have to say that in the end 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.940
 it was amazing it was amazing I did not 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.410
 I expected and it made me want a lot more is 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.930
 this first novel I have to say that 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.300
 my opinion about her is excellent this 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.369
 first novel but not everything ended here 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.350
 I started the second part on fire for 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.960
 continue with this trilogy and under my 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.960
 point of view down a little bit the level 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.610
 of this trilogy the truth is that after 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 the end of the games of the games of the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.210
 hungry 'I had much more of this 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.979
 second work however the story is 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.910
 it became much more linear much more 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.289
 monotonous 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.180
 I found it repetitive to return to 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.580
 put the theme of the second games of the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.050
 hungry ' I expected much more though 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.280
 there were certain scenes that I 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.140
 completely surprised not me 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.769
 I expected I have to say it the truth is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.940
 that the end seemed to me a little 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.800
 boring the truth is that it cost me a 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.890
 little read it I have to say it but 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.860
 good is a novel that was 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.020
 however my total reaction complete and 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.209
 absolute came when I started reading 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.310
 Mockingjay that I finished it very little 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.930
 time and that many people had not 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.940
 said by a part that had them 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.640
 delighted that it was a spectacular ending 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.990
 of theology and other people that I 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.300
 They said that they had been disappointed that 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.760
 it was a pretty poor ending for that 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.680
 theology and I pigeonhole in the second 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.900
 group has been a book that has not 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.070
 liked for nothing is not a good ending and 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 under my point of view for this 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.720
 trilogy every page that I read I liked 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.850
 less than the previous one I have not enjoyed 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.730
 for nothing and I have to say that has 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.380
 lowered under my point of view the end 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.810
 of this theology left by the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.760
 floors even though the subject of introducing 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.950
 the rebellion that was already present the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.140
 second part now is the element 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.000
 principal of this third novel 'the one 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 all districts come together to fight 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.510
 against the capitol and be able to finish with 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.690
 This regime is a subject that has really 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.680
 liked because it means the union of everything 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.940
 the world to fight against an enemy 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.770
 common though 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.350
 there are also small problems 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.550
 This really liked me but do not 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.320
 I liked to see nothing of the instrument 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.950
 who have employed in this fight that well 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.660
 meats 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.520
 third- party songs has been 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.920
 basically a doll that I have manipulated 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.480
 as they have wanted for him to fight 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.459
 against the capitol that really no longer 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.000
 has done nothing I have not done for myself since 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.590
 my point of view nothing memorable nothing 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.790
 nothing important in this third part has 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.410
 been like a doll that they have 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.580
 employee his character that in this 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.930
 third part is immersed in a 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.480
 depression after the end of the second 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.640
 part that will not be overcome and that 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.230
 good lava completely block is not going to 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.989
 allow him to do anything that he does not feel 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.239
 nothing and good as I say is a character 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.459
 that is not mentioned but it has not 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.459
 liked for nothing in that trilogy are 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.530
 characters very cold very calculating and not 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.819
 They feel nothing is able to manipulate 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.220
 everyone to get what 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.810
 he wants and the truth is that I have good 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.910
 to say that although he is a character that 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.280
 I did not like the end that you have 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.440
 given I think it's not worthy of what I 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.169
 I was waiting for her at the end 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.900
 trilogy is quite sad is very poor 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.300
 I imagined something much more spectacular 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.100
 for the great trajectory he was carrying 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.170
 this trilogy but the truth is that it is 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.570
 the book is made good for me 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.620
 The third was completely redundant for me 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.960
 part could have been written 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.520
 perfectly without candice your character 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.980
 that I had left over could have 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.810
 employed another person to be the sense 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.630
 but the truth is that I did not have the 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.260
 shirt man so they used it we thought 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.930
 a book so sad so depressing I do not 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.730
 he liked it at all because every one is a 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 book that you live through meats and 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.840
 as meat is immersed in a 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.000
 depression because the whole book is like that is 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.470
 very dark is very gloomy the truth is 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.750
 that there were times when I wanted 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.630
 skip chapters and directly to 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.610
 but it can not be so good 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.140
 I finished the book and I have to say that 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.150
 there was a scene in the book that I 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.430
 I have to read twice to be able 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.650
 understand it because it was a scene that the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.840
 law is at the end of a chapter the law 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.140
 pass the next chapter I started 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.760
 they talked about that and I said about this I did not 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.560
 I had to return to the chapter 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.750
 previous to the end and re-read it 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.850
 because to employ such a metaphor 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.490
 metaphorical to talk about what has 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.409
 happened that the truth is that I know 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.629
 it happened to me completely 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:38.599
 really what I was reading and I 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.279
 was very surprised the end that has 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.860
 that chapter because I did not expect it 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.869
 I imagined something bigger for that 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.610
 character the truth I will not say 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:48.199
 spoilers the people who have 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.779
 read I imagine you can locate what 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.239
 scene I'm talking about but good 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.529
 I have to say that without sack it has been a 

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:56.300
 book that I did not like that has gone down 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.159
 completely the rhythm and level is the 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.979
 trilogy under my point of view has not 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.689
 been a final nothing worthy of this 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.659
 trilogy I was expecting a lot more from 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.279
 and despite all this I think it's a 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.860
 theology that is quite interesting from 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.209
 reading is very very entertaining although the 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.029
 third part because as I say it has 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:15.800
 cost a lot to read it but good is 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.539
 some books that I recommend reading and I 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.459
 wish that the first part 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.919
 outside autoconclusiva or write in 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:23.989
 the end to give something more spectacular 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.159
 to this third part but good this is 

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:26.509
 everything I had to tell you about the 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.949
 trilogy lets you donate wanted others 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.779
 hunger games ' to end ago 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.279
 very little time and above all I wanted 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.110
 share my opinion because there was 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.809
 finished pretty angry after the 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.429
 end of mockingjay so good I've 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:39.380
 tried not to give very specific details 

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:41.600
 and precise about things that happen 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.070
 because surely many people do not 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.260
 You have still read this trilogy 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.210
 and you want to do it and I wanted to avoid 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.980
 spoilers however also count 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.380
 some little things I hope they have not been 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.820
 very big because I wanted to explain two 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.350
 Things that seemed important to me 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.180
 of these books and especially my 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.290
 impressions so nothing I hope that you 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.030
 have liked the video that you leave 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.350
 your comments down here and 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.350
 see you in the next one a little kiss
