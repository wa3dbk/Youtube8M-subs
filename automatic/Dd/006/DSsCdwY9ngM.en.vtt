guys<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.440> xda-developers<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:41.430> created<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
guys at xda-developers have created a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
guys at xda-developers have created a
ROM<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.360> unlocks<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> additional<00:00:43.590> RAM<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
ROM that unlocks this additional RAM and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 
ROM that unlocks this additional RAM and
right<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:44.700> we're<00:00:44.850> running<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> stock<00:00:45.510> rom

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
right now we're running the stock rom

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.700 
right now we're running the stock rom
and<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> show<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.620> little

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and I'm just going to show you a little

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.440 
and I'm just going to show you a little
before<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.340> we'll<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> after<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
before and then we'll do the after in a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
before and then we'll do the after in a
sec<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> SD<00:00:49.620> card<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.100> storage

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
sec so if I go to SD card and storage

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
sec so if I go to SD card and storage
you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.600> i<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you can see that right now i have a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.639 
you can see that right now i have a
total<00:00:52.289> program<00:00:52.590> memory<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.600> 336<00:00:54.600> megabytes<00:00:55.170> as

you know some of its taken over by the
operating<00:00:57.719> system<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.260> you're<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
operating system so you're not going to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.760

we're going to put on the new rom and
see<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.930> difference<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.890> prove<00:01:08.159> or

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
see the difference and actually prove or

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.200 
see the difference and actually prove or
disprove<00:01:08.369> whether<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.930> european<00:01:10.380> hd2<00:01:10.860> has

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
disprove whether the european hd2 has

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.490 
disprove whether the european hd2 has
576<00:01:12.210> megabytes<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> ram<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.290> would<00:01:13.409> be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
576 megabytes of ram which would be

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.460 
576 megabytes of ram which would be
Crichton<00:01:13.830> quite<00:01:14.070> amazing<00:01:14.930> ok<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.170> flashed

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
Crichton quite amazing ok so we flashed

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
Crichton quite amazing ok so we flashed
the<00:01:16.650> rom<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.040> claims<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> give<00:01:17.670> back<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> HTC

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the rom that claims to give back the HTC

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.679 
the rom that claims to give back the HTC
hd2<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.439> lot<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.130> program<00:01:20.640> memory<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> HTC

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
hd2 a lot of program memory the HTC

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.899 
hd2 a lot of program memory the HTC
didn't<00:01:22.020> include<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> box<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.790> this

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
didn't include out of the box for this

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
didn't include out of the box for this
European<00:01:24.299> version<00:01:24.570> let's<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
European version let's see if it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
European version let's see if it
actually<00:01:25.470> hold<00:01:26.009> true<00:01:26.250> slide<00:01:26.790> over<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.270> go

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
actually hold true slide over here go

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
actually hold true slide over here go
into<00:01:27.479> SD<00:01:28.080> card<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> phone<00:01:28.920> storage<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> wow

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
into SD card and phone storage and wow

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.140 
into SD card and phone storage and wow
yes<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.509> hundred<00:01:31.140> megabytes<00:01:31.560> nearly<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.150> added

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
yes a hundred megabytes nearly are added

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.940 
yes a hundred megabytes nearly are added
to<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> total<00:01:33.659> program<00:01:33.990> memory<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.619> free

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
to the total program memory and free

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
to the total program memory and free
program<00:01:35.340> memory<00:01:35.549> before<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.299> number<00:01:36.570> was

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
program memory before this number was

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050 
program memory before this number was
about<00:01:36.960> 200<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.740> had<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.040> 200<00:01:38.729> megabytes

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
about 200 so we had about 200 megabytes

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
about 200 so we had about 200 megabytes
of<00:01:39.329> RAM<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.780> work<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> multitask<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.280> we

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of RAM to work with the multitask now we

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.340 
of RAM to work with the multitask now we
have<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:41.850> 300<00:01:42.360> megabytes<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.229> it's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
have more than 300 megabytes so it's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.800 
have more than 300 megabytes so it's
really<00:01:43.619> amazing<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> hd2<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.630> has

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
really amazing that the hd2 actually has

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.649 
really amazing that the hd2 actually has
