00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.910 
every season there's love story I guess
in<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.580> past<00:00:43.990> I've<00:00:44.990> been<00:00:45.020> doing<00:00:45.410> collections

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.000 
in the past I've been doing collections
but<00:00:46.280> in<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.640> mood<00:00:46.850> for<00:00:46.880> love<00:00:47.260> or<00:00:48.260> maybe<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.830> know

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
but in a mood for love or maybe you know

but in a mood for love or maybe you know
I'm<00:00:49.130> kind<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.460> cynical<00:00:52.570> desperately<00:00:53.570> looking

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
I'm kind of cynical desperately looking

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.250 
I'm kind of cynical desperately looking
for<00:00:53.960> love<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.560> last<00:00:55.550> season<00:00:56.150> was<00:00:56.450> about<00:00:56.870> some

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
for love and last season was about some

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.840 
for love and last season was about some
veiling<00:00:57.590> of<00:00:57.620> families<00:00:58.130> was<00:00:58.520> just<00:00:58.670> quite

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
veiling of families was just quite

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.840 
veiling of families was just quite
optimistic<00:00:59.360> so<00:01:00.130> ghosts<00:01:01.130> preparing

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
optimistic so ghosts preparing

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.689 
optimistic so ghosts preparing
themselves<00:01:02.060> to<00:01:02.690> be<00:01:02.810> homemakers<00:01:03.500> we<00:01:04.490> thought

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
themselves to be homemakers we thought

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.240 
themselves to be homemakers we thought
they<00:01:04.910> met<00:01:05.120> that<00:01:05.300> someone<00:01:05.630> else<00:01:05.840> next<00:01:06.380> season<00:01:06.980> I

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
they met that someone else next season I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.760 
they met that someone else next season I
guess<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.390> about<00:01:08.630> fighting<00:01:09.110> for<00:01:09.590> love

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
guess this is about fighting for love

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.930 
guess this is about fighting for love
maybe<00:01:10.369> it's<00:01:10.640> been<00:01:11.590> Pocahontas<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.770> guess<00:01:12.950> maybe

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
maybe it's been Pocahontas I guess maybe

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.240 
maybe it's been Pocahontas I guess maybe
be<00:01:14.270> Romeo<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.930> Juliet<00:01:15.350> I'm<00:01:15.650> constantly

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
be Romeo and Juliet I'm constantly

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.760 
be Romeo and Juliet I'm constantly
inspired<00:01:16.880> from<00:01:17.090> Japanese<00:01:17.720> culture<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.530> think

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
inspired from Japanese culture I think

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.080 
inspired from Japanese culture I think
they're<00:01:18.920> quite<00:01:19.070> fascinating

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
they're quite fascinating

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.280 
they're quite fascinating
or<00:01:20.690> maybe<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:21.050> just<00:01:21.110> like<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.729> child<00:01:22.729> then

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
or maybe it's just like a child then

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.350 
or maybe it's just like a child then
reminiscing<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.380> past<00:01:24.410> again<00:01:25.270> person<00:01:26.270> I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
reminiscing the past again person I

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.800 
reminiscing the past again person I
think<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.780> quite<00:01:27.170> an<00:01:27.410> aesthetic<00:01:28.100> driven<00:01:28.490> brand

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
think is quite an aesthetic driven brand

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.350 
think is quite an aesthetic driven brand
so<00:01:29.810> it's<00:01:29.960> not<00:01:31.060> necessarily<00:01:32.060> about<00:01:32.210> a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
so it's not necessarily about a

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.170 
so it's not necessarily about a
technique<00:01:32.900> or<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.740> garden<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.850> about<00:01:35.119> a

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
technique or a garden it's about a

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.220 
technique or a garden it's about a
feeling<00:01:35.780> it's<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:36.320> an<00:01:36.440> attitude<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.230> every

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
feeling it's but an attitude so every

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.920 
feeling it's but an attitude so every
season<00:01:39.440> them<00:01:40.010> be<00:01:40.280> different<00:01:40.700> inspiration<00:01:41.480> but

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
season them be different inspiration but

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.020 
season them be different inspiration but
really<00:01:42.800> it's<00:01:42.950> about<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.400> really<00:01:43.790> feminine

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
really it's about a really feminine

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.140
