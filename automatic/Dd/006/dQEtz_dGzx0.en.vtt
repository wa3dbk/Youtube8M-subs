00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.789
 against a field of jets and today I find myself cool alejandro d first 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.810
 with kers as sos alejandro collía and very well thank you to all the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.989
 of parachute 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.829
 Well here Alejandro is here today because he is presenting me and what he is 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.880
 the third disc of the primaries with staying 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.320
 claiming that others a little about the production of this material 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.910
 record yes yes it is the third disc of the helmsman are cheese 3 mf with 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.230
 a few cones a lot of people 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.310
 the other two discs were instrumental this album as they bring the 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.720
 novelty that is sung because of it I'm singing in all areas songs 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 he is still fonk is still going the abdomen but now the idea is to try to 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.970
 look for other slopes of the pont not in the two sessions with the rock 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.100
 with soul a little bit suddenly some team on the album too 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.170
 but in itself as the title suggests is to move disc 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.890
 totally I'm listening a little bit of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.770
 panama of the eight themes that are in this material and we talk about 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.320
 a little bit about how to record instruments because 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.230
 because it burns more it's not you alone that will be in this one in this project 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.130
 but there are several who are participating with bulls a bit about 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.550
 this 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.010
 if it is a group of musicians that I do not have the fortune to produce and 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.650
 difficult to compose the songs for the project 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.320
 I own a nea and battery company and Basque country with gaza and all kinds of 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.820
 instruments on this disk 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.220
 ed with tecos the participation of hand of the musicians that accompany me in 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.250
 I live that they are criminals 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.010
 and many guests that I was pleased to have them as people as a doctor 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.310
 flail this without excellent project of regué to pour the ebro with a great 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 guitarist is his people and four for example pigeon congas get overheated 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.910
 the battery then percent really is a very complete disk 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.920
 in the sense of being able to collaborate with many people and post by getting the word out to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.970
 this, then 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.300
 It makes the production a little more cd cared until late that 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 the abuse has its place not within the mix 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 of how long it came to disk production 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.429
 it was about six months of preproduction let's say to compose it 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.459
 all and three months in the study of really 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.529
 it was almost everything that goes of the 2008 in doing it 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.930
 Now I'm worried about changing 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.999
 these oils are instrumental because they include voices 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.459
 because as partizan always wants to kill you does not want to c 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.779
 expand your knowledge a little this 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.779
 reflect a little maturity and kutxa sighted not a lot of new music 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.619
 that I loved to go that I like a lot then 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:41.449
 because the idea is to evolve not to present each disc something different something 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:45.119
 new and the challenge of singing to me seemed like something I had not done since 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.009
 long ago 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.449
 I sing in English cerebrally obeys that the position is my first 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.929
 language not percent of the same bread are not from here they sell well out then 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.780
 per hundred since it is the language with which I identify the most and is the most 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.049
 also lends to compose in this musical style 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.739
 fiorotto really be excellent alejandro I think it's a record 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.930
 very well worked has subjects like so much because the tropel of fire you will 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.590
 smith although sony favorite so far and well worth listening to 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.959
 I have in my hands the physical version of this album 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.479
 but there is a great advantage for all those who want to hear more than 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.229
 primary with kers 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.859
 which is legally available for free in its digital version with 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.329
 bulls a bit about this yes I wanted to also home a little bit in 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.719
 the way of distribution that is made of this globally I think that the 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.409
 music industry to be going through many changes 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.999
 per cent many are very interesting others maybe for other people they are 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.850
 it's like 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.310
 everything is chopped to me in particular is born in so very much that if someone 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.740
 he wants my music that he has it and that rather he is going to see us live I have not 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.860
 chosen that you are going to listen to on the record when you download it for free the believe me 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.620
 that the stress say a version of the disc but already live we bring much more 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.609
 energy plus strength 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.829
 for me it's like a gift for all the fans that have supported us this 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.629
 during the day to 3 discs 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.829
 I also like my way of saying good, you have to release the music in a little 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.000
 you have to make it a little more accessible free and what if someone wants you to 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.029
 have not 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:13.679
 he played it when he downloaded this album 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:18.599

 bringing this physical version with extras lemos be adding remixes 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.430
 Photos
