00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
and the one we have here is from public

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.009 
and the one we have here is from public
now<00:00:35.030> this<00:00:35.210> is<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.539> bubbliest

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
now this is the bubbliest

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.040 
now this is the bubbliest
titanium<00:00:36.739> expression<00:00:37.399> Pro<00:00:37.699> as<00:00:38.449> you<00:00:38.600> can<00:00:38.809> see

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
titanium expression Pro as you can see

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.040 
titanium expression Pro as you can see
it<00:00:39.440> has<00:00:39.649> different<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:41.420> ability<00:00:41.749> to<00:00:41.780> change

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
it has different the ability to change

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.660 
it has different the ability to change
these<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.530> seem<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:42.920> there's<00:00:43.129> 11<00:00:43.519> heat

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
these that seem so there's 11 heat

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.329 
these that seem so there's 11 heat
settings<00:00:44.059> on<00:00:44.179> here<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.960> go<00:00:45.109> up<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.440> 210

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
settings on here that go up to 210

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.059 
settings on here that go up to 210
degrees<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.059> it<00:00:47.600> covers<00:00:47.839> enough<00:00:48.230> he<00:00:48.469> ranges<00:00:48.949> to

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.069 
degrees so it covers enough he ranges to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.309 
degrees so it covers enough he ranges to
suit<00:00:49.280> all<00:00:49.399> hair<00:00:49.609> types<00:00:49.659> you've<00:00:50.659> got<00:00:50.809> an<00:00:50.899> extra

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
suit all hair types you've got an extra

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.979 
suit all hair types you've got an extra
long<00:00:51.859> barrel<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:52.519> if<00:00:53.210> you've<00:00:53.390> got<00:00:53.569> very<00:00:53.809> long

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
long barrel so if you've got very long

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.829 
long barrel so if you've got very long
hair<00:00:54.229> and<00:00:54.499> you<00:00:54.559> find<00:00:55.249> most<00:00:55.429> curling<00:00:56.359> irons<00:00:56.629> you

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.689 
hair and you find most curling irons you
can't<00:00:57.079> fit<00:00:57.289> all<00:00:57.319> the<00:00:57.499> hair<00:00:57.649> around<00:00:58.159> the<00:00:58.519> barrel

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
can't fit all the hair around the barrel

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.610 
can't fit all the hair around the barrel
your<00:00:59.089> neck<00:00:59.329> space<00:00:59.629> this<00:00:59.960> is<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.109> brilliant<00:01:00.440> talk

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
your neck space this is a brilliant talk

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.549 
your neck space this is a brilliant talk
to<00:01:00.769> use<00:01:00.979> the<00:01:01.969> advanced<00:01:02.749> ceramic<00:01:03.229> since<00:01:03.440> I

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
to use the advanced ceramic since I

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.750 
to use the advanced ceramic since I
didn't<00:01:03.859> show<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.040> very<00:01:04.309> even<00:01:04.729> heat

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
didn't show a very even heat

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.090 
didn't show a very even heat
distribution<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.750> then<00:01:06.380> when<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.620> place<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
distribution and then when you place the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.010 
distribution and then when you place the
core<00:01:07.310> hair<00:01:07.520> onto<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.850> iron<00:01:07.969> it<00:01:08.509> recovers<00:01:08.990> the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
core hair onto the iron it recovers the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.289 
core hair onto the iron it recovers the
heat<00:01:09.259> very<00:01:09.290> quickly<00:01:09.790> so<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:10.820> don't<00:01:11.060> have<00:01:11.149> to

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
heat very quickly so you don't have to

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.530 
heat very quickly so you don't have to
leave<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.540> hair<00:01:11.719> on<00:01:11.869> for<00:01:12.229> 10<00:01:13.070> 20<00:01:13.430> 30<00:01:13.640> seconds<00:01:14.119> 5

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
leave the hair on for 10 20 30 seconds 5

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.480 
leave the hair on for 10 20 30 seconds 5
to<00:01:14.719> 10<00:01:14.869> seconds<00:01:15.259> is<00:01:15.409> most<00:01:15.680> Sears<00:01:16.070> enough<00:01:16.310> for

to 10 seconds is most Sears enough for

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.760 
to 10 seconds is most Sears enough for
most<00:01:16.640> people's<00:01:16.969> hair<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.049> titanium

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
most people's hair and the titanium

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.740 
most people's hair and the titanium
finish<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.219> the<00:01:19.310> barrel<00:01:19.640> ensures<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.420> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
finish of the barrel ensures that the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.289 
finish of the barrel ensures that the
hair<00:01:20.960> doesn't<00:01:21.289> say<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.740> stick<00:01:22.250> too<00:01:22.850> much<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.210> the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
hair doesn't say a stick too much to the

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.300 
hair doesn't say a stick too much to the
barrel<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.899> does<00:01:24.170> have<00:01:24.289> a<00:01:24.320> slight<00:01:24.710> grip<00:01:25.009> which

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
barrel it does have a slight grip which

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.550 
barrel it does have a slight grip which
is<00:01:25.460> great<00:01:25.759> because<00:01:26.240> some<00:01:26.450> pure<00:01:26.780> ceramic<00:01:27.259> irons

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
is great because some pure ceramic irons

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.620 
is great because some pure ceramic irons
are<00:01:28.100> too<00:01:28.310> slippy<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.789> therefore<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.299> find<00:01:29.450> it

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
are too slippy and therefore you find it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.700 
are too slippy and therefore you find it
quite<00:01:29.719> difficult<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.200> keep<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.530> hair

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
quite difficult to keep the hair

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.649 
quite difficult to keep the hair
actually<00:01:31.189> around<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.759> barrel<00:01:32.119> as<00:01:32.299> it<00:01:32.479> just

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
actually around the barrel as it just

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.090 
actually around the barrel as it just
falls<00:01:32.899> off<00:01:33.079> this<00:01:33.649> is<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.890> perfect

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
falls off this is the perfect

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.310 
falls off this is the perfect
combination<00:01:34.450> I'm<00:01:35.450> actually<00:01:35.719> use<00:01:36.109> this

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
combination I'm actually use this

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.590 
combination I'm actually use this
