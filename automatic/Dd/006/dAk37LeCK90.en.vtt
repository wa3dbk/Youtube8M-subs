00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 show you a new video of me today 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.359
 how to play black ops 2 smoothly 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.670
 could with me he was the problem as 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.779
 I had started two place there and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.150
 when I was in the game that I was always 80 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.210
 Had 60 fps and the game has with me 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.059
 always licked and yes i got up 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.739
 youtube watched a few videos and yes 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.360
 they also helped and me 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.050
 would show you today why this 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.480
 So first you have to go to steam 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.700
 you have to go on your call of duty black 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.210
 ops 2 multiplayer go goes 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.020
 right click on properties thank you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.300
 look at local files and a game 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.030
 check errors then that takes a bit 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.930
 longer so and then if you did that then 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:07.130
 he usually invites then argues 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:11.220
 he usually down here 42 mb yes 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.260
 and then when you're in the game can 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.140
 screw her up again and me 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.689
 show you the optimal settings 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.880
 and yes, we are the same again 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.680
 as close as you are there and I'll show you 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 now the optimal settings the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.170
 I use and you go to here 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.869
 options then on settings then 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.400
 you can go here you the highest 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.939
 make resolution so I have here now 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 full of de follow the monega here 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.799
 Shade makes her out of the scan gate 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 you also do that because that's more 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.720
 power somehow I do not know 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.720
 how so 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.390
 color blindness support you can 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.399
 let's see so I have it out yes and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.409
 here is also advanced 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.219
 critical texts announces extra 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.670
 to adjust 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:11.239
 the textures led to low duck 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.739
 racing on x16 and fx not 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.739
 turn on there in the ambient occultation 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.250
 also made from depth of field too 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.640
 small creations are made for it 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.069
 then the 90 and image repetition 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.959
 Show is almost only if I am now 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.959
 here the way or the height that the police 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.530
 gone away that was mostly analyzed 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.510
 fps I have yes and I do not have that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.859

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.730
