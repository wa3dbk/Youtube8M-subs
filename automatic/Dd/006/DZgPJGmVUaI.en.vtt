I<00:00:07.590> first<00:00:08.590> started<00:00:08.710> using<00:00:09.040> acrylics<00:00:09.490> about<00:00:09.670> 10

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
I first started using acrylics about 10

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.090 
I first started using acrylics about 10
years<00:00:10.180> ago<00:00:10.500> when<00:00:11.500> I<00:00:11.590> was<00:00:11.709> looking<00:00:11.799> for<00:00:12.070> a

years ago when I was looking for a

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.039 
years ago when I was looking for a
medium<00:00:12.490> that<00:00:12.639> was<00:00:12.760> better<00:00:12.940> suited<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:13.629> the<00:00:13.869> way

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
medium that was better suited to the way

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.859 
medium that was better suited to the way
that<00:00:14.230> I<00:00:14.320> like<00:00:14.980> to<00:00:15.129> paint<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:15.730> just<00:00:15.779> working<00:00:16.779> up

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
that I like to paint and just working up

a<00:00:16.960> composition<00:00:17.470> from<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.730> little<00:00:19.000> drawing

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
a composition from the little drawing

a composition from the little drawing
that<00:00:19.480> I've<00:00:19.600> done<00:00:19.750> here<00:00:19.990> I'm<00:00:20.410> just<00:00:20.680> using<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:21.130> mix

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
that I've done here I'm just using a mix

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.050 
that I've done here I'm just using a mix
of<00:00:21.929> Van<00:00:22.929> Dyck<00:00:23.140> red<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.679> a<00:00:23.949> phthalo<00:00:24.400> blue<00:00:24.429> as<00:00:24.999> a

color<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.680> I<00:00:31.800> mix<00:00:32.100> has<00:00:32.430> quite<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.760> high<00:00:32.940> yellow

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270

color that I mix has quite a high yellow
bias<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.650> it<00:00:34.830> which<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:35.820> doing<00:00:36.180> deliberately

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
bias to it which I'm doing deliberately

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.350 
bias to it which I'm doing deliberately
because<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.440> am<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.130> interested<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.820> trying

because I am very interested in trying

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.140 
because I am very interested in trying
to<00:00:39.510> play<00:00:39.810> off<00:00:39.990> the<00:00:40.230> yellow<00:00:41.000> against<00:00:42.000> its

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
to play off the yellow against its

the<00:00:44.580> water<00:00:44.900> everyone<00:00:45.900> thinks<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.500> most

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the water everyone thinks that the most

the water everyone thinks that the most
the<00:00:47.040> most<00:00:47.220> influential<00:00:47.670> thing<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.120> water<00:00:48.300> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the most influential thing on water is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.360 
the most influential thing on water is
going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.900> light<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> other

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
going to be the light because the other

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.000 
going to be the light because the other
thing<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.610> affects<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> hugely<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.720> wind

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
thing that affects it hugely is the wind

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.140 
thing that affects it hugely is the wind
because<00:00:53.010> I've<00:00:53.130> got<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.250> completely<00:00:53.670> broken

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
because I've got a completely broken

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:05.260 
because I've got a completely broken
surface<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.900> now

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270

really<00:01:12.540> about<00:01:12.979> reproducing<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.360> photograph

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
really about reproducing a photograph

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.260 
really about reproducing a photograph
the<00:01:16.020> cloud<00:01:16.289> formation<00:01:17.039> it's<00:01:17.369> more<00:01:17.579> a<00:01:17.610> case<00:01:17.909> for

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the cloud formation it's more a case for

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.410 
the cloud formation it's more a case for
me<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.750> actually<00:01:19.259> trying<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.759> describe<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420

me of actually trying to describe and
convey<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.560> entire<00:01:22.920> atmosphere<00:01:23.840> just<00:01:24.840> I'm

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
convey the entire atmosphere just I'm

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.460 
convey the entire atmosphere just I'm
just<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:26.299> suggesting<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:28.289> of<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
just really suggesting some of this

just really suggesting some of this
foreground

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.700 

what's<00:01:32.540> particularly<00:01:32.870> nice<00:01:33.140> about<00:01:33.350> this<00:01:33.500> one

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
what's particularly nice about this one

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.800 
what's particularly nice about this one
is<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.400> get<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.610> glimpse<00:01:34.880> through<00:01:35.150> of<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
is that you get a glimpse through of the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.770 
is that you get a glimpse through of the
sea<00:01:36.080> beyond<00:01:36.980> in<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.270> estuary<00:01:38.570> mouth

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
sea beyond in the in the estuary mouth

sea beyond in the in the estuary mouth
over<00:01:39.050> at<00:01:39.200> Exmouth

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
over at Exmouth

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.290 
over at Exmouth
it's<00:01:42.320> often<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.710> case<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.550> later<00:01:43.850> stages

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's often the case and the later stages

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.360 
it's often the case and the later stages
in<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.660> painting<00:01:45.140> then<00:01:45.380> we<00:01:45.980> have<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.220> come

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
in a painting then we have to come

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.030 
in a painting then we have to come
through<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.760> make<00:01:46.940> slight<00:01:47.450> tonal

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
through and make slight tonal

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.740 
through and make slight tonal
adjustments<00:01:49.040> everything<00:01:49.880> changes<00:01:50.480> every

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
adjustments everything changes every

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.390 
adjustments everything changes every
time<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:51.050> make<00:01:51.230> a<00:01:51.260> mark<00:01:51.650> it<00:01:51.890> affects<00:01:52.220> the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
time you make a mark it affects the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.100 
time you make a mark it affects the
marks<00:01:52.670> you've<00:01:52.820> already<00:01:53.030> made<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.810> marks

botanical study but I do need to get to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.200 
botanical study but I do need to get to
know<00:02:08.260> how<00:02:09.260> they<00:02:09.590> grow<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.399> understand<00:02:10.970> how

know how they grow and to understand how

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.790 
know how they grow and to understand how
they<00:02:11.390> work<00:02:12.910> see<00:02:13.910> when<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.600> pigment<00:02:15.350> starts
