Nicole this is a chamber you can see our
breath<00:00:11.170> already<00:00:12.170> that's<00:00:12.410> how<00:00:12.530> cold<00:00:12.740> it<00:00:12.920> is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
breath already that's how cold it is

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.129 
breath already that's how cold it is
zero<00:00:13.670> degrees<00:00:14.090> so<00:00:14.690> we'll<00:00:14.809> get<00:00:14.959> into<00:00:15.080> our

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
zero degrees so we'll get into our

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.930 
zero degrees so we'll get into our
sleeping<00:00:15.709> bag<00:00:15.889> and<00:00:16.190> I'm<00:00:16.309> not<00:00:16.490> sure<00:00:16.670> we<00:00:16.789> can<00:00:16.820> be

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
sleeping bag and I'm not sure we can be

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:30.970 
sleeping bag and I'm not sure we can be
smiling<00:00:17.600> oh<00:00:25.839> yeah<00:00:29.169> okay<00:00:30.230> Stephanie's<00:00:30.740> gonna

smiling oh yeah okay Stephanie's gonna

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.920 
smiling oh yeah okay Stephanie's gonna
take<00:00:31.220> some<00:00:31.369> quick<00:00:31.550> baseline<00:00:32.150> vitals<00:00:32.599> before

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
take some quick baseline vitals before

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.920 
take some quick baseline vitals before
you<00:00:33.020> get<00:00:33.140> into<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.440> cold<00:00:33.650> chamber<00:00:34.750> just<00:00:35.750> want

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
you get into the cold chamber just want

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.330 
you get into the cold chamber just want
to<00:00:35.990> make<00:00:36.110> sure<00:00:36.320> that<00:00:36.500> your<00:00:36.650> baseline<00:00:37.010> vitals

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
to make sure that your baseline vitals

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.580 
to make sure that your baseline vitals
see<00:00:37.760> what<00:00:37.880> they<00:00:37.970> start<00:00:38.240> out<00:00:38.360> at<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:38.990> see<00:00:39.440> what

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
see what they start out at and see what

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:54.639 
see what they start out at and see what
they<00:00:39.710> are<00:00:39.740> there's<00:00:40.130> any<00:00:40.310> effects

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.760 

Stephanie<00:00:55.520> right<00:00:55.879> now<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.390> bag<00:00:56.629> rated<00:00:57.559> at

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
Stephanie right now is in a bag rated at

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.220 
Stephanie right now is in a bag rated at
40<00:00:58.190> degrees<00:00:58.550> Fahrenheit<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.750> temperature

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
40 degrees Fahrenheit the temperature

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.560 
40 degrees Fahrenheit the temperature
she's<00:01:00.500> experiencing<00:01:01.340> is<00:01:01.790> zero<00:01:02.180> degrees

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
she's experiencing is zero degrees

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.630 
she's experiencing is zero degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:03.469> she's<00:01:03.890> gonna<00:01:04.040> start<00:01:04.309> getting

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
Fahrenheit so she's gonna start getting

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:45.620 
Fahrenheit so she's gonna start getting
a<00:01:04.729> lot<00:01:04.970> colder<00:01:05.390> really<00:01:06.170> quick<00:01:06.440> right<00:01:06.710> now

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.110 

yeah<00:01:46.630> slightly<00:01:47.590> cool<00:01:47.860> Stephanie<00:01:48.760> is<00:01:48.820> having<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
yeah slightly cool Stephanie is having a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.280 
yeah slightly cool Stephanie is having a
lot<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.270> heat<00:01:49.510> loss<00:01:49.660> seeing<00:01:49.930> all<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.110> white

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
lot of heat loss seeing all the white

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.380 
lot of heat loss seeing all the white
heat<00:01:51.160> just<00:01:51.370> started<00:01:51.670> emanate<00:01:51.970> from<00:01:52.000> her<00:01:52.180> face

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
heat just started emanate from her face

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:20.440 
heat just started emanate from her face
and<00:01:52.560> skin<00:01:53.560> folder

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.119 

yeah<00:02:21.450> basically<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.349> gave<00:02:22.530> more<00:02:22.709> heat<00:02:22.920> loss

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
yeah basically you gave more heat loss

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.479 
yeah basically you gave more heat loss
yeah<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:24.780> temperature<00:02:25.170> scale<00:02:25.530> there<00:02:25.769> you

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
yeah this temperature scale there you

00:02:26.489 --> 00:03:29.210 
yeah this temperature scale there you
look<00:02:26.640> like<00:02:26.790> you're<00:02:26.970> getting<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.239> little<00:02:27.390> colder

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.740 

even<00:03:30.220> though<00:03:30.340> Stephanie's<00:03:30.910> core<00:03:31.210> temperature

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
even though Stephanie's core temperature

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.900 
even though Stephanie's core temperature
is<00:03:31.900> fine<00:03:32.110> her<00:03:32.500> extremities<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.430> face<00:03:33.700> are

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
is fine her extremities and face are

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.250 
is fine her extremities and face are
starting<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.420> be<00:03:34.540> affected<00:03:35.050> by<00:03:35.080> the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
starting to be affected by the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.530 
starting to be affected by the
dangerously<00:03:36.010> low<00:03:36.190> temperatures<00:03:36.820> when

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
dangerously low temperatures when

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.660 
dangerously low temperatures when
hypothermia<00:03:38.230> sets<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.770> he<00:03:39.130> can<00:03:39.310> do<00:03:39.460> damage

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
hypothermia sets in he can do damage

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.440 
hypothermia sets in he can do damage
quickly

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
quickly

00:03:40.450 --> 00:04:05.699 
quickly
Stephanie's<00:03:41.170> test<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.860> over

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.899 

controllably<00:04:06.709> that's<00:04:07.340> when<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.519> really

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
controllably that's when I really

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.750 
controllably that's when I really
started<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.269> feel<00:04:08.540> very<00:04:09.469> uncomfortable<00:04:09.760> so

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
started to feel very uncomfortable so

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.849 
started to feel very uncomfortable so
things<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.150> hypothermia<00:04:11.900> could<00:04:12.500> happen<00:04:12.769> in

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
things like hypothermia could happen in

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.860 
things like hypothermia could happen in
such<00:04:13.099> such<00:04:13.579> a<00:04:13.609> quick<00:04:13.970> amount<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.299> time

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
such such a quick amount of time

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.819 
such such a quick amount of time
five<00:04:15.140> more<00:04:15.349> minutes<00:04:15.409> in<00:04:15.709> there<00:04:20.829> started

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
five more minutes in there started

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:30.840 
five more minutes in there started
dropping<00:04:22.220> rapidly<00:04:22.370> once<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.180> get<00:04:23.419> past

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.660 

now<00:04:31.420> it's<00:04:31.810> Newton's<00:04:32.200> turn<00:04:32.620> his<00:04:33.160> sleeping<00:04:33.610> bag

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
now it's Newton's turn his sleeping bag

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.240 
now it's Newton's turn his sleeping bag
is<00:04:34.030> rated<00:04:34.330> for<00:04:34.480> minus<00:04:34.960> 40<00:04:35.350> degrees<00:04:35.680> Fahrenheit

where the sleeping bag is it till he
pokes<00:04:56.470> his<00:04:56.650> face<00:04:56.800> out<00:05:06.180> like<00:05:07.180> my<00:05:07.540> bag<00:05:07.840> you<00:05:08.140> see

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
pokes his face out like my bag you see

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.170 
pokes his face out like my bag you see
the<00:05:08.440> heat<00:05:08.650> sneaking<00:05:09.040> out<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.280> sees<00:05:09.550> yours

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
the heat sneaking out of the sees yours

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.150 
the heat sneaking out of the sees yours
you<00:05:10.420> can't<00:05:10.630> even<00:05:10.780> see<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.110> bag<00:05:11.320> because<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.040> is

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
you can't even see the bag because it is

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.650 
you can't even see the bag because it is
so<00:05:12.490> well<00:05:12.820> made

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.700 

alright<00:05:16.660> so<00:05:16.810> Chuck<00:05:17.050> is<00:05:17.200> wondering<00:05:17.530> how<00:05:17.560> you

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
alright so Chuck is wondering how you

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.710 
alright so Chuck is wondering how you
feeling<00:05:18.130> for<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.430> thermal<00:05:18.760> sensation<00:05:19.390> scale

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
feeling for the thermal sensation scale

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.900
