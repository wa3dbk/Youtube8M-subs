sensitive

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
sensitive

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.760 
sensitive
getting<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> cyclocross<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:52.350> know<00:02:52.440> which<00:02:52.620> is

getting the cyclocross you know which is

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.260 
getting the cyclocross you know which is
also<00:02:53.069> rode<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.670> started<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> very<00:02:54.120> small

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
also rode it started as a very small

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.970 
also rode it started as a very small
sport<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.050> think<00:02:58.110> we'll<00:02:58.320> keep<00:02:58.530> pursuing

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
sport so I think we'll keep pursuing

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.470 
sport so I think we'll keep pursuing
stuff<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.520> it's<00:02:59.820> like<00:02:59.910> whatever<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.209> meant<00:03:00.420> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
stuff like it's like whatever I meant to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.680 
stuff like it's like whatever I meant to
at<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.690> time<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.930> guess<00:03:02.120> so

as<00:04:35.840> hard<00:04:35.960> as<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.170> can<00:04:36.250> so<00:04:37.250> when<00:04:37.520> we<00:04:37.610> have

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
as hard as I can so when we have

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.910 
as hard as I can so when we have
something<00:04:38.120> in<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.780> side<00:04:39.140> I'm<00:04:39.290> getting<00:04:39.530> feedback

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
something in a side I'm getting feedback

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.180 
something in a side I'm getting feedback
from<00:04:40.250> our<00:04:40.340> riders<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:41.710> designed<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.830> bikes<00:04:43.010> and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
is very important we have we're a

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.580 
is very important we have we're a
smaller<00:04:49.160> company<00:04:49.400> so<00:04:50.890> it's<00:04:51.890> quicker<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.400> get

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
smaller company so it's quicker to get

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.160 
smaller company so it's quicker to get
something<00:04:54.590> from<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:55.340> font<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:55.970> my<00:04:56.120> mind<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:57.050> our

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
something from a font of my mind to our

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.010 
something from a font of my mind to our
actual<00:04:57.470> production<00:04:57.770> line<00:04:58.390> so<00:04:59.390> if<00:04:59.600> we<00:04:59.720> look<00:04:59.930> for

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
actual production line so if we look for

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.930 
actual production line so if we look for
example<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.470> get<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.620> sample<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.100> are<00:05:01.760> you

can you tell me thoughts behind your
entry-level<00:06:12.260> models<00:06:12.890> and<00:06:13.100> your<00:06:13.250> in<00:06:13.310> size

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
entry-level models and your in size

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.670 
entry-level models and your in size
models<00:06:14.800> our<00:06:15.800> entry-level<00:06:16.220> models<00:06:16.820> are<00:06:17.680> press

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
models our entry-level models are press

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.070 
models our entry-level models are press
mode<00:06:18.890> well<00:06:19.160> and<00:06:19.400> the<00:06:19.580> reason<00:06:19.730> for<00:06:20.000> that<00:06:20.060> is

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.290 

that<00:06:25.080> being<00:06:25.259> said<00:06:25.590> it's<00:06:25.979> not<00:06:26.400> a<00:06:26.580> lower<00:06:27.000> quality

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
that being said it's not a lower quality

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.060 
that being said it's not a lower quality
it's<00:06:27.750> just<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.080> we<00:06:28.169> choose<00:06:28.350> to<00:06:28.410> use<00:06:28.650> a<00:06:28.680> tooth

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
it's just that we choose to use a tooth

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.890 
it's just that we choose to use a tooth
that's<00:06:29.280> more<00:06:29.610> readily<00:06:30.210> available<00:06:30.389> and

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
that's more readily available and

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.159 
that's more readily available and
accessible<00:06:31.729> the<00:06:32.729> price<00:06:32.910> now<00:06:33.090> something<00:06:34.080> like

accessible the price now something like

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.640

but I guess not all over France at least

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.120 
but I guess not all over France at least
on<00:07:02.699> the<00:07:02.820> price<00:07:03.060> but<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:04.289> price<00:07:04.320> reflects<00:07:04.919> the

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
on the price but the price reflects the
