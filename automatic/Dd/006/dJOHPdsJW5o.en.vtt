powder liner from L'Oreal professional
that<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.940> love<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.840> lifts<00:02:18.260> fast<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.160> lifts

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
that I love it lifts fast it lifts

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.589 
that I love it lifts fast it lifts
really<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:20.540> cleanly<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:23.180> got<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> lot

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
really like cleanly and it's got a lot

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.210 
really like cleanly and it's got a lot
of<00:02:23.630> power<00:02:23.840> behind<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.650> think<00:02:24.890> for<00:02:25.099> those

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
of power behind it so I think for those

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.370 
of power behind it so I think for those
brightening<00:02:25.730> up<00:02:25.819> those<00:02:25.970> very<00:02:26.239> ends<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.900> our

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
brightening up those very ends and our

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.690 
brightening up those very ends and our
gradient<00:02:27.620> hair<00:02:27.920> color<00:02:28.099> it's<00:02:28.400> gonna<00:02:28.549> be

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
gradient hair color it's gonna be

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.770 
gradient hair color it's gonna be
perfect<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.019> just<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:30.290> give<00:02:30.440> an<00:02:30.530> idea<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:32.720> is

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
perfect so just to give an idea this is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.229 
perfect so just to give an idea this is
the<00:02:32.930> way<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.620> am<00:02:34.280> envisioning<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the way that I am envisioning the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.110 
the way that I am envisioning the
placement<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> be<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.950> our<00:02:37.190> base<00:02:37.430> will<00:02:37.849> vary

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
placement to be so our base will vary

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.630 
placement to be so our base will vary
out<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.540> hair<00:02:38.720> strand<00:02:39.140> then<00:02:39.980> we'll<00:02:40.190> apply<00:02:40.459> our

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
out the hair strand then we'll apply our

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.660 
out the hair strand then we'll apply our
middle<00:02:40.880> tone<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.799> then<00:02:42.799> our<00:02:43.040> lighter<00:02:43.310> tone

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
middle tone and then our lighter tone

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.520 
middle tone and then our lighter tone
and<00:02:43.970> all<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.660> those<00:02:44.780> are<00:02:44.959> going<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.110> be<00:02:45.260> kind<00:02:45.500> of

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
and all of those are going to be kind of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.559 
and all of those are going to be kind of
smudged<00:02:46.220> together<00:02:46.790> with<00:02:47.000> our<00:02:47.150> fingers<00:02:47.540> so

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
smudged together with our fingers so

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.870 
smudged together with our fingers so
there<00:02:47.840> won't<00:02:47.959> be<00:02:48.079> any<00:02:48.400> horizontal<00:02:49.400> lines<00:02:49.610> at

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
there won't be any horizontal lines at

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.990 
there won't be any horizontal lines at
all<00:02:49.910> as<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:50.959> move<00:02:51.170> into<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.650> side<00:02:51.920> I'm<00:02:52.700> gonna

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
all as we move into the side I'm gonna

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.610 
all as we move into the side I'm gonna
alt<00:02:53.209> I'm<00:02:53.450> gonna<00:02:53.569> switch<00:02:53.810> from<00:02:54.019> my<00:02:54.079> horizontal

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
alt I'm gonna switch from my horizontal

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.720 
alt I'm gonna switch from my horizontal
placement<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:55.160> I'm<00:02:55.250> doing<00:02:55.370> through<00:02:55.640> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
placement that I'm doing through the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.229 
placement that I'm doing through the
back<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.329> do<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.049> vertical<00:02:57.680> placement<00:02:58.239> the

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
back and do a vertical placement the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.110 
back and do a vertical placement the
vertical<00:02:59.690> placement<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.579> when<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
vertical placement is so that when the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.420 
vertical placement is so that when the
hair<00:03:02.329> falls<00:03:02.660> there<00:03:03.500> will<00:03:03.650> be<00:03:03.680> any<00:03:03.950> horizontal

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
hair falls there will be any horizontal

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.759 
hair falls there will be any horizontal

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
lines going through there at all it'll

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.030

unlike her base color I'm starting the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.620 
unlike her base color I'm starting the
lightening<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.459> front<00:04:12.730> because<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.480> want

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
looks like so we go from this beautiful

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.190 
looks like so we go from this beautiful
reach<00:04:36.550> rich<00:04:37.270> deep<00:04:37.900> level<00:04:38.500> 4<00:04:38.880> into<00:04:39.880> our<00:04:40.030> 5<00:04:40.390> into

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
reach rich deep level 4 into our 5 into

4 and 1/2 ends and the 5 and the 6 blend
into<00:05:03.220> one<00:05:03.400> another<00:05:03.750> into<00:05:04.750> these<00:05:04.990> very<00:05:05.560> light

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
into one another into these very light

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.400 
into one another into these very light
ends<00:05:06.400> which<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.450> see<00:05:07.720> how<00:05:07.990> dramatically

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
ends which you can see how dramatically

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.320 
ends which you can see how dramatically
lighter<00:05:08.710> they<00:05:08.950> are<00:05:09.100> when<00:05:09.670> we<00:05:09.760> compare<00:05:10.150> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
lighter they are when we compare the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.010 
lighter they are when we compare the
base<00:05:10.540> to<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.930> ends<00:05:11.350> I<00:05:11.560> think<00:05:12.520> that<00:05:13.330> walking

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
base to the ends I think that walking

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.690 
base to the ends I think that walking
