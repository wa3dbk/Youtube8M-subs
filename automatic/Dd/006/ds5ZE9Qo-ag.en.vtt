00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.640
 hello everyone how are you welcome to 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.839
 another Friday of smart book and we're going to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.609
 continue with my pages of the month of 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.259
 February here as you can see I have already advanced 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.329
 some in which obviously they do not 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.550
 I did the procedure and it was created 5 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.199
 more pages and the next one I'm going to 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.599
 to do is also from the month of February in 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.090
 February birthday my brother my dad and 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.890
 my brother too and well obviously 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.370
 I'm going to have to cover the bottom of the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.170
 page because then it's like very 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.930
 feminine and I opted for this piece of paper 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.300
 decorated that brings circulitos in several 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.010
 colors when it 's by the pages by 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.929
 full I like to use papers 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.910
 thin so do not create much 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.489
 volume in the smac since I feel that the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.820
 spring is very small and I can not as 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.800
 that make more volume what I'm going to do 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.140
 is that with some inks and with a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.499
 stencil that I have of several figurines of 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.360
 as birthday because I'm going to decorate a 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.159
 little bit more my paper is already decorated 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.649
 by the little dots of colors but 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.450
 to give you more birthday reason I opted 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.969
 for this option that the truth was made to me 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.649
 it looks really nice I'm going to use three 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.020
 different colors to make these 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.840
 figures the truth is that I like 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.630
 very much use these distress ribbons 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.049
 with the stencil is very father and then to 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.349
 the best will use a plain paper since 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.299
 with these figurines we can do 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.009
 easily a decorated paper apologize 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.530
 a little bit the light changes what 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.969
 happens is that I'm recording as at 67 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.860
 in the afternoon is when the 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.360
 sun and suddenly as the video goes very 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.670
 quick, you can see the changes in 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.289
 light and good as you see this I am 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.450
 outlining everything that are 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.340
 figurines of my stencil the balloon 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.259
 cake and the stars to give it then 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.209
 a little more volume to the image a 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.390
 a little bit more of a view but the same also 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.439
 if you do it and want to leave like this 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.329
 simply with the ink you also see 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.369
 super nice here is very very clean 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.109
 easy these inks with wet wipes 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.000
 I use makeup remover sometimes that 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.829
 times of baby wipes me 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.319
 like to use them cleanser is 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.209
 because I feel that they last more humidity 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.859
 of baby like they dry faster and 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.670
 the make-up remover is how I feel that 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:16.220
 I can use them 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.770
 for more time I have another piece of paper 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.989
 decorated that brings several pennants like 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.500
 come cut this out just because I'm 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.560
 cutting all the edges to decorate 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.180
 at the top and I'm going to paste it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.709
 so to give it now yes that more 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.239
 birthday decoration and I'm going to 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.900
 outline all my pennants with a 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.280
 false stitched in black for 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.650
 give volume and have as 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.989
 continuity with the figures that mark 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.360
 with black color for my photography I'm going to 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.370
 place a marquito in yellow and 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.110
 I feel that if I hit the pure 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.120
 Photography as it has a white frame 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.299
 like you were losing a little bit in the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.400
 background and so with this yellow frame and the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.069
 marking it a little bit with black I feel 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.980
 that looks a lot better under the 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.290
 photograph I wrote the date with the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.080
 down from the smge and as you saw I have 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.459
 a leaf with several elements of 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.989
 equally just 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.610
 internet look for phrases of happy 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.769
 birthday and I printed them all in one 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.390
 because this is very practical 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.310
 at the moment of doing my macho the moment 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.500
 to make some layout or project life 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.080
 already have the images as well as happy 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.060
 birthday and everything decorated as it is very 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.190
 practical and it saves me a lot of time 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.650
 I will also place some in m the 2 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.709
 this is in the home doctor I made them 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.370
 there are many tutorials on the network about in 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.739
 hemel dots that melts pebbles 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.750
 these we use for the 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.280
 jewelery crafts and all this 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.140
 Plastic pebbles where you are in the oven 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.819
 they melt and I also have a tutorial 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.620
