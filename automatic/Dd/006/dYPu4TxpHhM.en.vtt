00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.830
 as often said limits or the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.950
 they are born in a very simple way and a lot 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.619
 home or the fridge to a pantry 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.860
 I see easy prey puts them together 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.410
 dependent things and I make and create mine 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.710
 also this cupcakes was born in this 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.800
 so a very simple way is a cake 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.040
 with cocoa with ricotta cream e 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.140

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.440

 you can also divide it into those stuffing it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.640
 internally I have seen the cream 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.730
 used as if it were a frosting 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.589
 see above the cake but precisely these 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.359
 also split in two and faty cirla with 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.719
 this cream 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.870
 I hope the regret is as always 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.870

 this tray also serves as a service 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.470
 in short, to follow the cake otherwise 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.519
 you can simply put it back on 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.400
 platter 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.100
 I put it back in and now I begin to 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.229
 prepare the ricotta cream 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.150
 then seen on crowe vanilla in 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.989
 bowl add the ricotta 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.989
 it looks like crowe environment 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.880
 and with the whips he begins to mount 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:36.410
 I add a spoonful of cocoa itself 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.410

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.830
 no 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:08.120
 like a knife I make more modern 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.240
 small sponsors I leave so much 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.139
 very irregular 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.120
 clearly if you prefer you can too 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.020
 level it all well with la 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.410
 spatula 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.790
 I want to leave this this 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:32.290
 look a little messy 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:35.040
