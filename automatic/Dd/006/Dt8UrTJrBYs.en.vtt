entry into the IJA tutorial contest for
2012<00:00:05.870> it<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.350> how<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.950> roll<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> hoop

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
2012 it is about how to roll a hoop

enjoy<00:00:11.599> I'm<00:00:12.599> doing<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.019> tutorial<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.500> rolling

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
enjoy I'm doing a tutorial on rolling

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.860 
enjoy I'm doing a tutorial on rolling
because<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.730> want<00:00:14.910> Hooper's<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.480> able<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.690> do

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
because I want Hooper's to be able to do

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.810 
because I want Hooper's to be able to do
a<00:00:15.900> full<00:00:16.379> roll<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.010> makes<00:00:17.160> contact<00:00:17.640> with

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
a full roll that makes contact with

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.570 
a full roll that makes contact with
their<00:00:18.090> body<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.449> entire<00:00:18.539> time<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.490> think<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
their body the entire time I think a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.400 
their body the entire time I think a
roll<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.029> really<00:00:21.210> any<00:00:21.390> trick<00:00:21.689> looks<00:00:21.930> best<00:00:22.170> when

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
roll or really any trick looks best when

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.300 
roll or really any trick looks best when
you<00:00:22.560> involve<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.180> your<00:00:24.330> body<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
you involve a lot of your body in it and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.740 
you involve a lot of your body in it and
because<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.460> trick<00:00:26.699> involves<00:00:27.000> your<00:00:27.539> whole

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
because this trick involves your whole

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.280 
because this trick involves your whole
arm<00:00:27.990> span<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.130> looks<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.519> nice

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.780 

let's<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> trick<00:00:34.950> you're<00:00:35.100> gonna<00:00:35.219> need<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
let's do this trick you're gonna need a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.229 
let's do this trick you're gonna need a
hoop<00:00:36.649> if<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.890> use<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> smaller<00:00:38.520> lighter<00:00:38.910> hoop

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
hoop if you use a smaller lighter hoop

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.639 
hoop if you use a smaller lighter hoop
it's<00:00:39.420> gonna<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.719> more<00:00:39.899> difficult<00:00:40.110> than<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
it's gonna be more difficult than a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.369 
it's gonna be more difficult than a
heavier<00:00:41.070> larger<00:00:41.850> hoop<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.870> when<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.230> use

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
heavier larger hoop because when you use

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
heavier larger hoop because when you use
a<00:00:43.410> smaller<00:00:43.860> hoop<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.000> rotations

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
a smaller hoop there are more rotations

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
a smaller hoop there are more rotations
in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> roll<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.100> use<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> larger<00:00:47.820> group

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
in the roll when you use a larger group

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.900 
in the roll when you use a larger group
it<00:00:48.180> has<00:00:48.300> more<00:00:48.539> surface<00:00:48.780> area<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:49.910> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it has more surface area so it really it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.549 
it has more surface area so it really it
can<00:00:51.300> roll<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.930> across<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.469> body

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
can roll all the way across your body

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.069 
can roll all the way across your body
and<00:00:52.860> only<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.360> less<00:00:54.360> than<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.719> rotation

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and only have less than one rotation

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.770 
and only have less than one rotation
I've<00:00:55.860> seen<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> lot<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.340> Hooper's<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.570> will

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I've seen a lot of Hooper's that will

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.000 
I've seen a lot of Hooper's that will
start<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.170> trick<00:00:58.440> by<00:00:58.770> spinning<00:01:00.649> which<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
start a trick by spinning which if you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.229 
start a trick by spinning which if you
have<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.250> done<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> trick<00:01:02.670> before<00:01:02.820> it's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
have not done the trick before it's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
have not done the trick before it's
gonna<00:01:03.359> make<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.559> difficult<00:01:05.189> when<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
gonna make it way more difficult when I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.160 
gonna make it way more difficult when I
learned<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> trick<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.510> break<00:01:06.720> everything<00:01:06.960> down

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
learned a trick I break everything down

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
learned a trick I break everything down
to<00:01:07.680> its<00:01:07.799> simplest<00:01:08.159> parts<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> practice<00:01:09.240> each

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
to its simplest parts and practice each

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.980 
to its simplest parts and practice each
one<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.740> slowly<00:01:11.310> build<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:11.990> adding

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
one and then slowly build it up adding

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.310 
one and then slowly build it up adding
them<00:01:13.110> together<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.570> we're<00:01:16.200> gonna

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
them together so with this we're gonna

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
them together so with this we're gonna
start<00:01:16.710> without<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.700> spin<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> beginning

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
start without a spin in the beginning

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
start without a spin in the beginning
without<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.380> spin<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> end<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.670> just

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
without a spin in the end it's just

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.140 
without a spin in the end it's just
gonna<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.240> dead<00:01:21.840> stop<00:01:22.310> swing<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.939> role

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
gonna be dead stop swing into the role

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
gonna be dead stop swing into the role
and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:25.320> dead<00:01:26.130> end<00:01:26.630> over<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> once<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and then dead end over here so once you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
and then dead end over here so once you
learn<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> basics<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> roll<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
learn the basics of the roll then you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.690 
learn the basics of the roll then you
can<00:01:31.229> start<00:01:31.439> adding<00:01:31.650> variations<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
can start adding variations on the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.880 
can start adding variations on the
beginning<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> end<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:34.340> for<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> middle

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
beginning and end of it for the middle

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
beginning and end of it for the middle
all<00:01:37.890> rules<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.600> object<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
all rules with with any object have a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.690 
all rules with with any object have a
sort<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.310> wave<00:01:41.579> feel<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.860> goes<00:01:44.009> from<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.430> hand

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
sort of wave feel it goes from this hand

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.510 
sort of wave feel it goes from this hand
you<00:01:45.119> give<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> initial<00:01:46.380> energy<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.220> then

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you give it the initial energy and then

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.120 
you give it the initial energy and then
it<00:01:47.549> rides<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> way<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> other<00:01:48.750> side

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
it rides all the way to the other side

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.080 
it rides all the way to the other side
before<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> roll<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.670> might<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
before you do the roll you might want to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.410 
before you do the roll you might want to
practice<00:01:51.299> doing<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:52.020> wave<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:53.240> just<00:01:54.240> working

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
practice doing a wave and just working

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:06.100 
practice doing a wave and just working
on<00:01:54.689> moving<00:01:54.960> every<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.770> piece<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.729> arm

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.630 

to<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.230> these<00:02:07.410> roles<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.010> want<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> keep<00:02:08.430> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
to do these roles you want to keep a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.990 
to do these roles you want to keep a
loose<00:02:08.940> grip<00:02:09.240> on<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.869> hoop<00:02:13.730> when<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.850> first

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
hand down and this makes it a lot easier

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720

here<00:02:33.970> are<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> few<00:02:34.120> exercises<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:34.990> try<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
here are a few exercises you can try to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.290 
here are a few exercises you can try to
build<00:02:35.560> up<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> larger<00:02:36.280> role

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300

backward making full contact on the back
the<00:02:45.000> whole<00:02:45.180> time<00:02:46.520> then<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.760> try<00:02:47.940> rolling

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
the whole time then you can try rolling

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.900 
the whole time then you can try rolling
it<00:02:48.390> over<00:02:48.540> your<00:02:48.810> hand<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.380> forearm<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.220> off

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
to be out so it's a nice flat surface

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.510 
to be out so it's a nice flat surface
for<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.070> hoop<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.460> roll<00:04:47.820> across<00:04:49.340> many<00:04:50.340> people

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
will have trouble with the second part

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.629 
will have trouble with the second part
of<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.229> trick<00:04:52.470> which<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:53.280> hoop<00:04:53.460> going

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
from your back onto your receiving arm

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.430 
from your back onto your receiving arm
that's<00:04:56.820> why<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.000> want<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.300> keep<00:04:57.449> it<00:04:57.630> straight

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
that's why you want to keep it straight

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.879 
that's why you want to keep it straight
so<00:04:58.680> it'll<00:04:58.860> lead<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.430> hoop<00:04:59.669> onto<00:05:00.389> it<00:05:00.740> if<00:05:01.740> you

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
so it'll lead the hoop onto it if you

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.620 
so it'll lead the hoop onto it if you
have<00:05:02.039> a<00:05:02.070> far<00:05:02.400> back<00:05:02.639> it's<00:05:02.940> not<00:05:03.120> going<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.360> even

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
have a far back it's not going to even

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.899 
have a far back it's not going to even
be<00:05:04.050> able<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.380> make<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:04.919> curve<00:05:05.400> it's<00:05:05.699> just

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
be able to make that curve it's just

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:19.440 
be able to make that curve it's just
gonna<00:05:06.030> roll<00:05:06.330> right<00:05:07.080> off

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.580 

you<00:05:20.450> want<00:05:20.630> to<00:05:20.690> keep<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.930> hoop<00:05:21.080> as<00:05:21.230> straight<00:05:21.470> as

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
you want to keep the hoop as straight as

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:29.730 
you want to keep the hoop as straight as
possible<00:05:21.650> for<00:05:22.220> the<00:05:22.310> entirety<00:05:22.670> of<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.940> role

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.530 

lifting<00:05:30.740> up<00:05:30.950> in<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.130> end<00:05:31.370> to<00:05:31.730> slow<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.330> hoop

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
lifting up in the end to slow the hoop

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.700 
lifting up in the end to slow the hoop
so<00:05:33.080> you<00:05:33.140> can<00:05:33.350> easily<00:05:33.770> catch<00:05:33.980> it

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.529
