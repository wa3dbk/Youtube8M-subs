00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.180
 at the beginning we recorded with film 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.030
 16 millimeters let's be a scene it 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.910
 closed with white tail that is tail is 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.660
 veiled movie 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.160
 it closed in a continuous circle 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.980
 then what was put in a projector 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.790
 and he gave you what is what we call 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.009
 looks yet this one gave you one and 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.700
 again and again the same scene for 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:38.900
 rehearse recording it and a whole loop 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.910
 the set of 28 words or 25 seconds 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.190
 what happens first after he left 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.480
 changing technology came a few 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.570
 things other things synchronous with the p 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.590
 with the 16 projector a large stream 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.840
 of different magnetic tape 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.059
 different technologies were 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.980
 coming until we get to the current 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.230
 what is the pro tools and what is a 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.340
 wonder because it allows us to do 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:12.190
 millimeter editions and then we 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.190
 allows polishing work much more 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.060
 physical is to say if they have good if it is 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.340
 fat or if the jobs already jumps and the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.590
 shower because there too much 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.030
 work for them it is very difficult to digest 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.190
 because I tell you that nothing else in the voice 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.479
 but a friend who is there is acting 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.060
 is shaking hands is using 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.100
 gesticulating moving is in action and 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.929
 here the actor can not move because 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.880
 if it moves then you know that the 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.159
 noise 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.009
 the actors and the acting has 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.240
 different branches in the cinema television 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.939
 theater and dubbing is another branch 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.439
 so basically they are the actors and 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.320
 hence, you have to learn the technique 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.329
 of the dubbing was done and the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.549
 Mexican dubbing a dubbing that stops 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.799
 many is the best in the world now 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.119
 let's review the current scenario that 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.880
 subtitle that we have as mexico the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.230
 the world's best dubbing no longer exists 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.190
 there is no longer why 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.799
 If so, all the work would be 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.349
 done by us all the dubbing 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.530
 it would still be our level 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.790
 Latin America and it is not like that to the contrary 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.250
 of a lot of competition and competition 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.799
 foreign competition from colombia 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.470
 venezuela from argentina from many countries 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.140
 from latin america because they are already 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.030
 dominating the famous neutral accent not that 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.590
 is this the one that really our 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 other environments simply the Spanish 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.799
 mexican that is the one that we pronounce 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.049
 from all of life where they are pronounced 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.959
 all the letters and everything is understood and is 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.390
 the least offensive to mexico and to 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.790
 any country in latin america goes that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.340
 is the competition situation very 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.240
 strong then there has come a great 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.460
 union separation of the actors 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.350
 there are people who belong to the anda and 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.070
 people who belong to sitatyr and those who 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.170
 they are independent and then it has 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.620
 come generating a conflict of the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.660
 three and the three parties with the companies 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.280
 and also the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.440
 the preference of companies to 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.060
 work or not with a union or just 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.950
 with independents or with the three or with 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.010
 one with another 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.550
 all this situation has generated today in 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.500
 a very serious problem that is that the 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.050
 business owners are accepting 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.620
 work without even knowing if they are going 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.620
 to pay or not 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.500
 by tradition in the dubbing, first 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.250
 it does and after that they pay you or it is no longer 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.569
 Necessary to belong to any union 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.569
 however, it has a lot to do 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.850
 the interpersonal relationships that 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.860
 have with the current directors of 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.140
 dubbing these are some possible 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.460
 solutions because ending up with a 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.770
 industry more than in this country gives you 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.530
 to eat 1500 families 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.570
 and that also generates a lot of foreign currency to 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.360
 our country because like everything that is 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.160
 double by logic is foreign then 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.190
 generates a lot of money to value what 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.650
 it is done I believe and not only the dubbing 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.710
 everything good that we have and so the 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.220
 princess and the prince married and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.290
 They were very happy and colorado colorado 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.290
 this story is over
