is an ancient Chinese technique of tired
I'm<00:02:07.070> which<00:02:07.280> involves<00:02:07.790> like<00:02:07.940> knotting<00:02:08.479> and

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
I'm which involves like knotting and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.560 
I'm which involves like knotting and
stitching<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.320> bolding<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.270> went<00:02:11.450> with<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
stitching and bolding and we went with a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.510 
stitching and bolding and we went with a
textile<00:02:12.050> woman<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> while<00:02:12.980> and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
textile woman on that for a while and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.570 
textile woman on that for a while and
then<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.180> lifted<00:02:14.630> prints<00:02:14.930> from<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.709> samples

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
then we lifted prints from the samples

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.820 
then we lifted prints from the samples
so<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.000> could<00:02:17.239> produce<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.290> more

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
so we could produce it on a more

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.310 
so we could produce it on a more
production<00:02:19.310> level<00:02:19.610> because<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:21.050> tie-dye

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
production level because the tie-dye

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.020 
production level because the tie-dye
production<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.070> ridiculously<00:02:22.640> like

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
production is just ridiculously like

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.470 
production is just ridiculously like
high<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:24.320> then<00:02:24.550> yeah<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.270> like

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
high and then yeah and then just like

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.960 
high and then yeah and then just like
