00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.420
 analysis so I told you about it in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.760
 another video later today 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 of course I have not yet 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.699
 collected all the information that I 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.840
 can the leather but as I have this one 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.550
 is like a big information I 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 prefer to share it with you in a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 pretty short video so to which 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.679
 regards the multiplayer will have to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.739
 new things they have to be 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.260
 added a complete customization of the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.940
 game to start an aura the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 possibility to customize our 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 camouflage so it's even more of a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.920
 front angouleme creation was limited 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.530
 to when it could be tied pernoud 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.780
 customize our things have been enough 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.160
 limited but now we can create 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 camouflage so I do not know what 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.610
 it'll look like that glue del ya 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.059
 a few days to issue but it's okay 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.739
 to be super super cool is what I like 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.829
 does in this case have to say will go 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.329
 to say that in fact it's the goal it's 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.650
 add pleasure because if you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.390
 really want to make money 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.560
 he did like black ops of no 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.720
 creation that my village and he did it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.920
 several camouflage packs there for the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.180
 coup we will have creations that my 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.290
 club that you're so cool I can not wait 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.090
 to see all the camouflage 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.259
 will be able to find in multiplayer I 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.939
 look forward to seeing how great it is going to be 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.470
 fun will be seen animating 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.500
 camouflage competitions but I tell them 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.280
 find that cool of one thing that I 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.540
 want to talk is that now we can 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.070
 create our souls then that's like 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.840
 ghost recon future soldier for those who 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 did not play we can create from a to z 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.460
 our weapon even renew it very much 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 it's going a little bit far we agree 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.439
 I have a simple call of duty classic 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 Would she and happily makes perfect 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.439
 that's another feature that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 really at the gender gender level of 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.640
 subscription debt that may be 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920
 super cool personalized november 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.680
 imagine how aqua were gathering 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 the state of mind that we will have we will have 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.990
 million last to millions 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 of men would be funny runs into our 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.729
 arms 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.070
 then you're someone picking up his 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.770
 weapon for one thing I can not wait 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.020

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 I have small news I you 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.520
 spoke again of multiplayer 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 regulars or it's the gameplay in the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.200
 trailer for those who have not seen a 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.030
 gameplay in the water 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.680
 to what is happening is taken from a millet that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.480
 I'm not sure of my source that's it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.650
 who said in wood for people 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.110
 recognize a weapon quite similar to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.840
 the n4 go see the trailer for those 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.640
 who have not seen what I can say that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.720
 it adept fighting so fighting 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.769
 in the sky was so cool 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 honestly there will be so much 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.700
 different ways of playing what 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.349
 I'm afraid it's just guys who have 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.640
 raised for a long time with 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.209
 are about to burst for lack 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.980
 oxygen 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.150
 he gets up a little bit the time that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.480
 there is oxygen after now from 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.280
 dangerous 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.709
 a little bit of kanpe but to see one 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.970
 psy can thus have gone from multiplayer 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.860
 but it's so cool fighting 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.510
