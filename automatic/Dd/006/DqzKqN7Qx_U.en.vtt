 pumpkins that are going to have to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.399
 split like half in this way 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.160
 these pumpkins are totally raw 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.420
 we're going to leave them like this and we're going to 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.350
 pepper a bit of olive 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.930
 how this olive is chopped is not 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.750
 green olive is chopped we have to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.380

 pretty good stops 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.189
 it's so raw , the truth is they're all 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 pumpkins do not have to cook 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.150
 previous or nothing then nothing else 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.040

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.140
 cooking in the oven already with its filling and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.239
 the pulp please reserve it because the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.819
 we will use to mix with the 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.970
 meat then good here I already have my 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.680
 hollowed pumpkin thin and thin 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.139
 avocado end the rest is here 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.609
 we need 300 grams more or less 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.590
 they reach for about 4 zucchini 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.620
 broken in half is a chrome 8 pieces 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.290
 they are 300 grams of ground beef we are going 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.110
 to put approximately 80 100 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.560
 grams of 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:04.990
 this is a medium-sized tomato 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.400
 minced and then we're going to take a 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.510
 little of it comes from seeds that 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.310
 tomato 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 you can leave the news that the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.260
 seeds contain all the vitamin a 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.670
 that the tomato is pegadito to the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.130
 seed I am I prefer from saleh so 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.320
 thin as the seed any of 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.140
 the two things to which the nutritious ones ok 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.940
 let's put it here a bit of the center 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.570
 of the zucchini that we apply and already 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.570
 we have it ready 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.690
 If you do not have too much filling left, you can 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.000
 save later to make a sopita what 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.150
 Lee Kuan and they make a quality creampie 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.330
 I have bread, let's put a 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.850
 teaspoon ground cumin at 70 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.290
 people to put it and a little salt and 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.350
 good pepper is always value 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.090
 reached before or so because there are houses 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.380
 where susana salts houses where they are used 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.690
 less search here where you go 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.730
 putting your us small and glory where 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.440
 we can find recipes 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.510
 that no dotcom can find 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.209
 many recipes there are thousands of recipes 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.040
 and all are quick and easy 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.950
 simple as well as to change what 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.659
 that they always eat so that 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.849
 everyone knows what to do when they do not know 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.139
 what to eat that can be sold 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.669
 there that page must change to the others 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.620
 children the medium likes to be changed 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.750
 is that it is not the same to them always if it is 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.180

 quite practical and now that the mere 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.370
 not season of the pumpkin and if it's so 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.880
 good and the olive because the 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.990
 winter is that it does not start and the 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.639
 Olives are super nutritious and have 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.199
 antioxidants and also has also 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.600
 processors are the ones that more what more 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.600
 I like the olives is an acquaintance 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.260
 it is a capsule so it does not age then 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.180
 They are also valid in a competition 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.910
 of admonitions what not what is it 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.530
 that the cold water fish have 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.080
 stable is not what makes it 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.810
 They slip come in the sea but not 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.930
 produced in this or has been eaten when 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.250
 for us it makes us help in 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.620
 let's age like this is that we have to take 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.420
 channel and they are more olives or they are not 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.570
 call for the component which we have 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.280

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.020
 it is a subject that is which is not which one is not 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.000
 is a new component hey and now 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:50.070
 after here in the natural will measure the 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.050
 oven to see knows to be is already in follow 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.690

 the olives we can already get 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.330
