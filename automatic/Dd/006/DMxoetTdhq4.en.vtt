00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and a be scaling index this is a pretty

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.440 
and a be scaling index this is a pretty
much<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.350> quality<00:01:10.890> build<00:01:11.100> weapon<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.299> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
much a quality build weapon which is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.820 
much a quality build weapon which is
good<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.780> me<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.049> I've<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.530> been

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
good for me because I've actually been

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
good for me because I've actually been
running<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.760> character<00:01:15.000> is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
running that's what this character is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.990 
running that's what this character is
right<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.170> 40<00:01:16.409> 40<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.009> dex<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
right now it's actually 40 40 in dex and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810 
right now it's actually 40 40 in dex and
strength<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.830> decent<00:01:20.340> amount<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
strength so I get a decent amount in the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
strength so I get a decent amount in the
scaling<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> whole<00:01:21.930> lot<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.350> think

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
scaling I don't get a whole lot I think

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.230 
scaling I don't get a whole lot I think
with<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> ringer<00:01:23.189> blades<00:01:23.460> plus<00:01:23.700> once<00:01:24.000> since

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
with the ringer blades plus once since

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.990 
with the ringer blades plus once since
I'm<00:01:24.420> only<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> first<00:01:25.290> playthrough<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.640> get

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
I'm only in the first playthrough I get

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
I'm only in the first playthrough I get
something<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.450> 170<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.159> too<00:01:29.369> bad

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
something like 170 so it's not too bad

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.160 
something like 170 so it's not too bad
but<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> same<00:01:30.180> time<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.960> great

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
but at the same time it's not that great

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.950 
but at the same time it's not that great
now<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> pros<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> cons<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.810> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
now one of the pros and cons of this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.980 
now one of the pros and cons of this
weapon<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.560> kind<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.390> passive<00:01:36.390> thing<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
weapon is kind of a passive thing that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.160 
weapon is kind of a passive thing that
this<00:01:37.170> weapon<00:01:37.470> has<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
this weapon has and that's that it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.630 
this weapon has and that's that it
decreases<00:01:40.170> some<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.740> resistance<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
decreases some of your resistance to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
decreases some of your resistance to
certain<00:01:41.970> magics<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.720> increases<00:01:43.170> your

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
certain magics and it increases your

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.490 
certain magics and it increases your
resistance<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.000> others<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
resistance to the others I think it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.240 
resistance to the others I think it
decreases<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.549> dark<00:01:48.000> lightning<00:01:48.829> sorcery<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
decreases the dark lightning sorcery and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
decreases the dark lightning sorcery and
I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.759> fire<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.810> 70<00:01:52.200> points<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I think fire by 70 points and it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
I think fire by 70 points and it
increases<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.340> resistance<00:01:53.909> towards<00:01:54.420> poison

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
increases your resistance towards poison

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.330 
increases your resistance towards poison
by<00:01:55.290> 200<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.969> rest<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.450> by<00:01:57.600> 70<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.619> if

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
by 200 and the rest of them by 70 so if

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.499 
by 200 and the rest of them by 70 so if
you're<00:01:59.490> fighting<00:01:59.640> against<00:02:00.000> people<00:02:00.119> who<00:02:00.360> like

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
you're fighting against people who like

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.210 
you're fighting against people who like
to<00:02:00.540> spam<00:02:00.840> poison<00:02:01.320> or<00:02:01.469> believe

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
to spam poison or believe

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.650 
to spam poison or believe
then<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.940> definitely<00:02:03.300> something<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
then this is definitely something that

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.390 
then this is definitely something that
you<00:02:03.810> might<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.260> check<00:02:04.440> out<00:02:04.650> but<00:02:05.190> if<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
you might want to check out but if you

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.220 
you might want to check out but if you
find<00:02:05.550> yourself<00:02:05.910> running<00:02:06.060> against<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.960> whole

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
find yourself running against a whole

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.990 
find yourself running against a whole
bunch<00:02:07.410> of<00:02:07.500> magic<00:02:07.830> users<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.490> it's<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
bunch of magic users and it's kind of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.310 
bunch of magic users and it's kind of
something<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.660> might<00:02:09.899> want<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.170> watch

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
something that you might want to watch

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.500 
something that you might want to watch
out<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.590> since<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.550> does<00:02:11.760> decrease<00:02:12.060> in

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
out for since it does decrease in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.720 
out for since it does decrease in
resistance<00:02:12.630> towards<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.650> another<00:02:14.520> thing

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
resistance towards that another thing

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.040 
resistance towards that another thing
that<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:14.970> thought<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.390> actually<00:02:15.540> really

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
that I thought was actually really

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.660 
that I thought was actually really
amazing<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.800> actually<00:02:17.070> kind<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> cool<00:02:17.460> is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
amazing it's actually kind of cool is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.060 
amazing it's actually kind of cool is
that<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.150> weapon<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.840> kind<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
that this weapon is kind of like the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.880 
that this weapon is kind of like the
Sancerre<00:02:21.030> spear<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:23.000> before<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.870> react<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
Sancerre spear and before you react the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.140 
Sancerre spear and before you react the
reason<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.250> say<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.120> has

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
reason I say that is because it has

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.250 
reason I say that is because it has
multiple<00:02:27.840> move<00:02:28.590> sets<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.850> weapon<00:02:30.270> it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
multiple move sets in this one weapon it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260 
multiple move sets in this one weapon it
has<00:02:31.470> something<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.400> twin<00:02:32.790> blade<00:02:33.030> move

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
has something like the twin blade move

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.810 
has something like the twin blade move
set<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.840> has<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.410> spear<00:02:34.740> move<00:02:35.010> set<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.580> Lance

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
set it has the spear move set the Lance

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.150 
set it has the spear move set the Lance
and<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.840> even<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.170> broadsword<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
and I think even the broadsword with the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.699 
and I think even the broadsword with the
two-handed<00:02:38.790> rolling<00:02:39.240> attack<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.750> maybe<00:02:40.560> even

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
two-handed rolling attack or maybe even

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.920 
two-handed rolling attack or maybe even
the<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.100> hand<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> rolling<00:02:41.580> attack<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:42.720> one

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the one hand a rolling attack it's one

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.720 
the one hand a rolling attack it's one
of<00:02:43.050> those<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.250> something<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.700> I

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
of those but that's something that I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.760 
of those but that's something that I
definitely<00:02:45.150> thought<00:02:45.270> was<00:02:45.480> pretty<00:02:45.690> cool

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
definitely thought was pretty cool

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.460 
definitely thought was pretty cool
in<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.250> honesty<00:02:47.760> some<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> move<00:02:48.990> sets<00:02:49.290> are

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
in all honesty some of the move sets are

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250 
in all honesty some of the move sets are
kind<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.220> really<00:02:50.550> useful<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:51.570> guess<00:02:52.020> more

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
kind of not really useful I guess more

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.820 
kind of not really useful I guess more
specifically<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.570> second<00:02:54.570> r1<00:02:55.050> which<00:02:55.380> goes

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
specifically the second r1 which goes

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.530 
specifically the second r1 which goes
into<00:02:56.010> kind<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.370> like<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.550> twin<00:02:56.940> blade<00:02:57.150> twirling

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
into kind of like a twin blade twirling

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.100 
into kind of like a twin blade twirling
attack<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.160> noticed<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.630> push<00:03:00.990> your

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
attack I noticed that if you push your

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.870 
attack I noticed that if you push your
enemy<00:03:01.410> out<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.560> range<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.310> might<00:03:02.670> either

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
enemy out of range then you might either

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.150 
enemy out of range then you might either
completely<00:03:03.390> miss<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.900> attack<00:03:04.200> or<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.950> might

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
completely miss that attack or you might

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.880 
completely miss that attack or you might
not<00:03:05.310> land<00:03:05.610> all<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.090> hits<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.900> attack<00:03:07.170> so

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
not land all the hits in that attack so

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.540 
not land all the hits in that attack so
I<00:03:08.370> guess<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.600> want<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.810> get<00:03:09.900> all<00:03:09.989> technical

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
I guess if you want to get all technical

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.400 
I guess if you want to get all technical
stamina<00:03:11.550> consumption<00:03:12.120> versus<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.989> damage

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
stamina consumption versus the damage

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.930 
stamina consumption versus the damage
that<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> actually<00:03:13.800> do<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.670> person

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
that you actually do to the person

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.300 
that you actually do to the person
you're<00:03:15.030> fighting<00:03:15.060> against<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.590> second<00:03:16.890> r1<00:03:17.190> is

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
you're fighting against the second r1 is

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.190 
you're fighting against the second r1 is
not<00:03:17.550> really<00:03:17.820> worth<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.209> but<00:03:18.570> at<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> same<00:03:18.989> time

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
not really worth it but at the same time

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.600 
not really worth it but at the same time
there<00:03:19.410> has<00:03:19.560> been<00:03:19.590> times<00:03:20.130> where<00:03:20.340> I've<00:03:20.430> actually

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
there has been times where I've actually

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.150 
there has been times where I've actually
landed<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.330> done<00:03:21.810> some<00:03:21.989> real<00:03:22.140> good<00:03:22.290> damage<00:03:22.709> so

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
landed it done some real good damage so

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.920 
landed it done some real good damage so
that's<00:03:23.400> kind<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.760> situational<00:03:24.450> type<00:03:24.660> thing

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
that's kind of situational type thing

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.900 
that's kind of situational type thing
it's<00:03:25.680> not<00:03:25.830> something<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.400> would<00:03:26.519> heavily

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
it's not something that I would heavily

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.270 
it's not something that I would heavily
rely<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.209> but<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.320> good<00:03:28.500> thing<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.950> it

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
rely on but the good thing is that it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100 
rely on but the good thing is that it
does<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.670> multiple<00:03:29.910> other<00:03:30.420> move<00:03:30.690> sets<00:03:30.959> that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
does have multiple other move sets that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.920 
does have multiple other move sets that
you<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.440> use<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.940> one<00:03:33.150> really<00:03:33.810> isn't

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
you can use that that one really isn't

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.960 
you can use that that one really isn't
that<00:03:34.200> bad

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
that bad

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.820 
that bad
another<00:03:35.750> Pro<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.410> thought<00:03:36.590> was<00:03:36.800> really

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
another Pro that I thought was really

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.280 
another Pro that I thought was really
awesome<00:03:37.280> about<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:37.850> weapon<00:03:38.060> was<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
awesome about this weapon was that the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.380 
awesome about this weapon was that the
range<00:03:39.560> on<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.160> actually<00:03:40.490> pretty<00:03:41.180> damn

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
range on it is actually pretty damn

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.110 
range on it is actually pretty damn
crazy<00:03:41.920> I've<00:03:42.920> had<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> couple<00:03:43.490> fights<00:03:43.820> against

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
crazy I've had a couple fights against

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.490 
crazy I've had a couple fights against
spear<00:03:44.420> people<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.840> I've<00:03:44.930> actually<00:03:45.110> out

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
spear people and I've actually out

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500 
spear people and I've actually out

speared them I had a couple fights with

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.870 
speared them I had a couple fights with
people<00:03:47.780> who<00:03:48.200> are<00:03:48.320> using<00:03:48.440> Lance's<00:03:49.130> out<00:03:49.580> Lance

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
people who are using Lance's out Lance

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.230 
people who are using Lance's out Lance
them<00:03:50.180> pretty<00:03:50.990> much<00:03:51.050> any<00:03:51.530> other<00:03:52.240> thrusting

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
them pretty much any other thrusting

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
them pretty much any other thrusting
attack<00:03:53.590> weapon<00:03:54.790> York<00:03:55.790> spear<00:03:56.060> will<00:03:56.480> more<00:03:57.230> than

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
attack weapon York spear will more than

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.710 
attack weapon York spear will more than
likely<00:03:57.590> if<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.190> use<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.550> right<00:03:58.760> pretty<00:03:59.510> much

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
likely if you use it right pretty much

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.610 
likely if you use it right pretty much
win<00:04:00.320> it<00:04:00.500> out<00:04:00.650> in<00:04:00.860> every<00:04:01.310> situation<00:04:01.520> possible

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
win it out in every situation possible

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.040 
win it out in every situation possible
the<00:04:03.620> downside<00:04:04.490> about<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:05.060> lances<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.750> the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
the downside about the lances and the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.170 
the downside about the lances and the
spears<00:04:06.380> is<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.830> they<00:04:07.160> all<00:04:07.340> mainly<00:04:07.970> have

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
spears is that they all mainly have

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.360 
spears is that they all mainly have
thrusting<00:04:08.960> attacks<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.680> will<00:04:09.830> find<00:04:10.100> some

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
thrusting attacks and you will find some

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.430 
thrusting attacks and you will find some
that<00:04:10.550> does<00:04:10.790> have<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.360> different<00:04:11.960> type<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.140> move

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
that does have a different type of move

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.710 
that does have a different type of move
set<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.070> but<00:04:13.610> with<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.120> one<00:04:14.360> it<00:04:14.570> has

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
set to it but with this one it has

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.960 
set to it but with this one it has
overheads<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.770> has<00:04:15.920> sweeps<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.670> has

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
overheads it has sweeps and has

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.240 
overheads it has sweeps and has
thrusting<00:04:17.390> attacks<00:04:17.690> if<00:04:18.620> you're<00:04:18.799> looking<00:04:19.070> for

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
thrusting attacks if you're looking for

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.979 
thrusting attacks if you're looking for
a<00:04:19.280> spear<00:04:19.580> or<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:19.790> lens<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.270> use<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.630> definitely

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
a spear or a lens to use I definitely

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.690 
a spear or a lens to use I definitely
recommend<00:04:21.260> picking<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:21.709> one<00:04:21.890> up<00:04:22.070> mainly

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
recommend picking this one up mainly

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.640 
recommend picking this one up mainly
because<00:04:23.060> not<00:04:23.390> only<00:04:23.420> does<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.930> have<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.470> move

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
because not only does it have the move

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.410 
because not only does it have the move
set<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.130> might<00:04:25.280> be<00:04:25.400> looking<00:04:25.430> for<00:04:25.730> but<00:04:26.330> it

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
set that you might be looking for but it

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.120 
set that you might be looking for but it
has<00:04:26.570> alternate<00:04:27.080> move<00:04:27.230> sets<00:04:27.470> as<00:04:27.620> well<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.010> you

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
has alternate move sets as well that you

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.430 
has alternate move sets as well that you
might<00:04:28.160> want<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.550> check<00:04:28.730> out<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.210> even<00:04:30.200> though

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
might want to check out and even though

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.740 
might want to check out and even though
some<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.860> them<00:04:30.950> are<00:04:31.010> situational<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.090> have

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
some of them are situational I have

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.750 
some of them are situational I have
found<00:04:32.960> myself<00:04:33.140> in<00:04:33.560> that<00:04:33.710> situation<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:34.550> those

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
found myself in that situation and those

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400 
found myself in that situation and those
move<00:04:34.940> sets<00:04:35.210> have<00:04:35.450> proved<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.870> be<00:04:35.960> pretty

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
move sets have proved to be pretty

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.500 
move sets have proved to be pretty
useful<00:04:36.650> one<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.760> moves<00:04:38.030> that<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.240> really

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
useful one of the moves that I really

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.480 
useful one of the moves that I really
like<00:04:38.660> doing<00:04:38.960> is<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.290> roll<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.980> one-handed

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
like doing is the roll the one-handed

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.300 
like doing is the roll the one-handed
running<00:04:40.850> attack<00:04:40.970> which<00:04:41.390> is<00:04:41.420> an<00:04:41.660> overhead

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
running attack which is an overhead

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.440 
running attack which is an overhead
surprisingly<00:04:43.310> enough<00:04:43.670> it<00:04:43.880> actually<00:04:44.270> hits

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
surprisingly enough it actually hits

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.630 
surprisingly enough it actually hits
pretty<00:04:44.540> consistently<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.770> has<00:04:46.070> some<00:04:46.520> pretty

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
pretty consistently it has some pretty

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.540 
pretty consistently it has some pretty
decent<00:04:46.880> tracking<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.800> all-in-all<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.130> just

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
decent tracking and all-in-all I just

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.430 
decent tracking and all-in-all I just
like<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:49.790> animation<00:04:50.270> of<00:04:50.390> it<00:04:50.540> if<00:04:51.140> you<00:04:51.350> guys

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
like the animation of it if you guys

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.510 
like the animation of it if you guys
have<00:04:51.650> your<00:04:51.710> work<00:04:51.919> spear

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
have your work spear

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.190 
have your work spear
just<00:04:53.240> check<00:04:53.450> it<00:04:53.570> out<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:53.720> check<00:04:53.840> out<00:04:54.080> the

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
just check it out and check out the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.170 
just check it out and check out the
animation<00:04:54.560> for<00:04:55.040> some<00:04:55.220> reason<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.730> really<00:04:56.000> like

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
animation for some reason I really like

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.320 
animation for some reason I really like
it<00:04:56.419> it's<00:04:56.710> kind<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:57.800> crazy<00:04:58.010> because<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:59.300> know

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
it it's kind of crazy because you know

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.180 
it it's kind of crazy because you know
something<00:05:00.169> like<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.470> really<00:05:00.770> wouldn't

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
something like that really wouldn't

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.940 
something like that really wouldn't
catch<00:05:01.490> my<00:05:01.700> eye<00:05:01.730> but<00:05:02.540> seeing<00:05:03.140> how<00:05:03.290> this<00:05:03.560> one<00:05:03.740> did

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
catch my eye but seeing how this one did

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.530 
catch my eye but seeing how this one did
I<00:05:04.190> just<00:05:04.610> felt<00:05:04.760> like<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:05.000> was<00:05:05.090> worth<00:05:05.210> pointing

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
I just felt like it was worth pointing

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.120 
I just felt like it was worth pointing
out<00:05:05.690> because<00:05:06.050> like<00:05:06.530> I<00:05:06.620> said<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:06.890> kind<00:05:07.010> of

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
out because like I said it's kind of

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.730 
out because like I said it's kind of
something<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.550> really<00:05:07.820> did<00:05:08.000> like<00:05:08.740> there

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
something that I really did like there

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.470 
something that I really did like there
are<00:05:09.890> two<00:05:10.100> cons<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.550> can<00:05:10.730> think<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.030> right

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
are two cons that I can think of right

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.960 
are two cons that I can think of right
off<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.750> bat<00:05:11.930> one<00:05:12.290> of<00:05:12.380> them<00:05:12.500> is<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.950> weight<00:05:13.130> my

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
off the bat one of them is the weight my

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.630 
off the bat one of them is the weight my
character<00:05:14.330> isn't<00:05:14.750> really<00:05:15.020> built<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.800> have<00:05:16.340> too

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
character isn't really built to have too

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.760 
character isn't really built to have too
much<00:05:16.790> heavy<00:05:17.090> equipment<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.440> one<00:05:18.620> is

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
much heavy equipment so this one is

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.430 
much heavy equipment so this one is
actually<00:05:19.450> kind<00:05:20.450> of<00:05:20.540> on<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.810> heavy<00:05:20.990> side<00:05:21.080> for

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
actually kind of on the heavy side for

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.860 
actually kind of on the heavy side for
my<00:05:21.560> character<00:05:22.120> 19<00:05:23.120> pounds<00:05:23.450> is<00:05:23.540> actually

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
my character 19 pounds is actually

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.540 
my character 19 pounds is actually
pretty<00:05:24.020> heavy<00:05:24.260> for<00:05:24.350> any<00:05:24.650> weapon<00:05:25.040> let<00:05:25.220> alone<00:05:25.490> a

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
pretty heavy for any weapon let alone a

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.760 
pretty heavy for any weapon let alone a
spear<00:05:26.180> so<00:05:27.020> that's<00:05:27.200> kind<00:05:27.380> of<00:05:27.440> something<00:05:27.710> you

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
spear so that's kind of something you

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.159 
spear so that's kind of something you
might<00:05:27.980> want<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.340> consider<00:05:28.669> if<00:05:29.060> your<00:05:29.630> character

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
might want to consider if your character

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.740 
might want to consider if your character
is<00:05:30.550> mainly<00:05:31.550> using<00:05:31.820> lightweight<00:05:32.180> armor<00:05:32.419> and

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
is mainly using lightweight armor and

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.060 
is mainly using lightweight armor and
doesn't<00:05:33.080> really<00:05:33.200> have<00:05:33.410> a<00:05:33.440> whole<00:05:33.680> bunch<00:05:33.919> of

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
doesn't really have a whole bunch of

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.370 
doesn't really have a whole bunch of
equipment<00:05:35.000> load<00:05:35.180> then<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:35.930> might<00:05:36.050> have<00:05:36.080> to

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
equipment load then you might have to

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.750 
equipment load then you might have to
move<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.590> couple<00:05:36.710> things<00:05:36.950> around<00:05:37.250> or<00:05:37.460> you<00:05:37.580> might

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
move a couple things around or you might

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.550 
move a couple things around or you might
have<00:05:37.910> to<00:05:38.030> wear<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.240> couple<00:05:38.510> rings<00:05:38.840> to<00:05:39.200> kind<00:05:39.500> of

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
have to wear a couple rings to kind of

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.620 
have to wear a couple rings to kind of
adjust<00:05:39.919> for<00:05:40.040> that<00:05:40.220> but<00:05:40.820> for<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.030> most<00:05:41.090> part<00:05:41.450> if

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
adjust for that but for the most part if

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.750 
adjust for that but for the most part if
your<00:05:42.080> character<00:05:42.680> can<00:05:42.710> equip<00:05:43.370> a<00:05:43.400> lot<00:05:43.610> of

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
your character can equip a lot of

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.950 
your character can equip a lot of
different<00:05:44.180> heavy<00:05:45.080> armors<00:05:45.440> and<00:05:45.590> all<00:05:45.680> that

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
different heavy armors and all that

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.540 
different heavy armors and all that
stuff<00:05:46.319> then<00:05:46.740> you<00:05:46.860> don't<00:05:47.039> really<00:05:47.310> have<00:05:47.430> to

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
stuff then you don't really have to

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.360 
stuff then you don't really have to
worry<00:05:47.729> about<00:05:47.819> that<00:05:48.240> another<00:05:49.110> con<00:05:49.350> is<00:05:49.380> that<00:05:49.680> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
worry about that another con is that the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.219 
worry about that another con is that the
weapon<00:05:50.639> attacks<00:05:50.910> pretty<00:05:51.150> slow

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
weapon attacks pretty slow

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.830 
weapon attacks pretty slow
it<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.949> a<00:05:53.220> spear<00:05:53.789> I<00:05:53.819> think<00:05:54.150> it's<00:05:54.300> classed<00:05:54.569> under

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
it is a spear I think it's classed under

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.670 
it is a spear I think it's classed under
the<00:05:55.199> spear<00:05:56.419> weapon<00:05:57.419> class<00:05:57.630> but<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.289> attacks

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
the spear weapon class but it attacks

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.339 
the spear weapon class but it attacks
more<00:05:58.949> kind<00:05:59.340> of<00:05:59.430> like<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.729> grand<00:06:00.030> Lance<00:06:00.349> it's

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
more kind of like the grand Lance it's

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.379 
more kind of like the grand Lance it's
pretty<00:06:01.590> slow<00:06:01.889> it's<00:06:02.610> really<00:06:02.880> easy<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.240> dodge

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
pretty slow it's really easy to dodge

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.710 
pretty slow it's really easy to dodge
and<00:06:03.810> for<00:06:04.169> people<00:06:04.289> who<00:06:04.440> are<00:06:05.099> used<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.479> slow

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
and for people who are used to the slow

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.480 
and for people who are used to the slow
thrusting<00:06:07.139> movesets<00:06:07.560> that<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.830> grand<00:06:08.069> lances

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
thrusting movesets that the grand lances

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.339 
thrusting movesets that the grand lances
or<00:06:08.610> any<00:06:08.759> lance<00:06:09.030> has<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.840> might<00:06:09.990> find<00:06:10.169> yourself

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
or any lance has you might find yourself

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.620 
or any lance has you might find yourself
having<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:11.280> little<00:06:11.610> tough<00:06:11.789> time<00:06:12.060> trying<00:06:12.419> to

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
having a little tough time trying to

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.420 
having a little tough time trying to
actually<00:06:12.780> hit<00:06:13.020> these<00:06:13.169> people<00:06:13.500> I<00:06:13.710> noticed<00:06:14.280> that

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
actually hit these people I noticed that

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.950 
actually hit these people I noticed that
when<00:06:14.639> I<00:06:14.699> was<00:06:15.030> fighting<00:06:15.180> against<00:06:15.630> people<00:06:15.840> who

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
when I was fighting against people who

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.710 
when I was fighting against people who
had<00:06:16.139> daggers<00:06:16.650> or<00:06:16.860> fists<00:06:17.449> weapons<00:06:18.449> or<00:06:18.599> whatever

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
had daggers or fists weapons or whatever

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.900 
had daggers or fists weapons or whatever
I<00:06:19.199> found<00:06:19.889> it<00:06:20.099> really<00:06:20.340> hard<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.669> hit<00:06:20.759> them

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
I found it really hard to hit them

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.400 
I found it really hard to hit them
mainly<00:06:21.449> because<00:06:21.570> they<00:06:21.780> kept<00:06:21.990> rolling<00:06:22.289> around

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
mainly because they kept rolling around

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.900 
mainly because they kept rolling around
so<00:06:23.070> that's<00:06:23.160> kind<00:06:23.400> of<00:06:23.460> something<00:06:23.639> that<00:06:23.759> you

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
so that's kind of something that you

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.240 
so that's kind of something that you
might<00:06:24.120> want<00:06:24.300> to<00:06:24.330> consider<00:06:25.099> personally<00:06:26.099> I<00:06:26.130> just

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
might want to consider personally I just

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.140 
might want to consider personally I just
don't<00:06:26.669> like<00:06:26.820> slow<00:06:27.509> hitting<00:06:27.900> weapons<00:06:28.860> I<00:06:29.729> always

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
don't like slow hitting weapons I always

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.850 
don't like slow hitting weapons I always
have<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.419> kind<00:06:30.630> of<00:06:30.690> adjust<00:06:30.780> my<00:06:31.110> playstyle<00:06:31.530> for

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
have to kind of adjust my playstyle for

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.290 
have to kind of adjust my playstyle for
him<00:06:32.009> especially<00:06:32.160> since<00:06:32.520> I<00:06:32.880> really<00:06:33.150> like

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
him especially since I really like

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.890 
him especially since I really like
playing<00:06:33.449> aggressive<00:06:34.080> but<00:06:34.800> for<00:06:34.979> the<00:06:35.070> most<00:06:35.220> part

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
playing aggressive but for the most part

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.450 
playing aggressive but for the most part
it's<00:06:36.900> not<00:06:36.990> something<00:06:37.500> that's<00:06:37.620> unbearable

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
it's not something that's unbearable

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.820 
it's not something that's unbearable
it's<00:06:38.580> just<00:06:38.880> kind<00:06:39.120> of<00:06:39.210> something<00:06:39.720> that<00:06:39.800> like<00:06:40.800> I

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
it's just kind of something that like I

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.189 
it's just kind of something that like I
said<00:06:41.070> I<00:06:41.099> might<00:06:41.370> as<00:06:41.520> well<00:06:41.580> just<00:06:41.820> point<00:06:42.240> out<00:06:42.419> just

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
said I might as well just point out just
