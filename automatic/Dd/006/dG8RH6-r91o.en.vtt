00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.790
 have you surely heard the phrase the 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.110
 train left me left me the train what 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.730
 heard at different ages what 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.920
 listened to the boy who is 14 years old 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.180
 let everyone come to all their 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.890
 friends with girlfriend and they do not have and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.689
 then they say that the train 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.700
 I leave and they are only 14 years old 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.390
 also heard in 100 people 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.610
 older people who are 30 years old 25 years old and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.470
 says that the train also not the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.110
 truth is that I believe something in the case of 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.239
 the young guys 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.400
 I do not think it's good to have a relationship 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.250
 of engagement before fulfilling the majority 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.949
 of age because there are many stages that 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.900
 we start to burn before time and 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.970
 They bring terrible problems in our 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.850
 emotions in our heart and it makes us 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.040
 go as a couple as a couple when it's supposed 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.809
 that the courtship in the previous stage 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.600
 that must be a marriage 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.489
 if you are 15 or 14 years old and do not wait 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.290
 to marry you in three years as they say 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.610
 the specialists that should last 1 degree 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.409
 then it should not be a concern 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.659
 pretty that train has not left you any better 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.640
 the train has not yet reached the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.420
 stop and you have rather to worry 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.460
 because it will offer in the future 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.840
 If you are a person of legal age as 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.330
 many of my friends who have spoken to me 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.430
 they feel bad because they are already 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 professionals are already economically 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.810
 stable but they have no partner and they 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.610
 feel alone I want to tell you that despite 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.680
 of that you should not rush to take 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.119
 a decision 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.460
 surely I have not chosen a couple 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.280
 because your standards are very high 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.110
 then they do not choose anything or do not choose what 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.060
 which must be because your level of 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.670
 requirement is very high lowered a little 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.170
 the standards in my recommendation 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.460
 look around maybe that person who 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.130
 you are waiting is already around you 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.350
 you just have not seen it on the other hand 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.229
 it's not about the train leaving you 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.899
 it's about riding on the right train 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.209
 it is my recommendation uncovered pirela we 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.209
 we see here in singles competition
