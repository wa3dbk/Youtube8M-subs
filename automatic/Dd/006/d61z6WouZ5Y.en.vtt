I<00:00:08.710> recently<00:00:09.850> purchased<00:00:10.850> a

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
I recently purchased a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.890 
I recently purchased a
bunch<00:00:11.660> of<00:00:11.780> these<00:00:11.990> tailored<00:00:12.800> operate

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900

tailored<00:00:19.450> operational<00:00:19.870> training<00:00:20.140> meal<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.520> I

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
tailored operational training meal and I

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.110 
tailored operational training meal and I
got<00:00:22.750> them<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.440> idea<00:00:23.680> of<00:00:23.890> you<00:00:24.670> know<00:00:24.700> being<00:00:24.940> like

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
got them the idea of you know being like

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.540 
got them the idea of you know being like
my<00:00:25.450> fee<00:00:25.570> MREs<00:00:25.960> and<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:27.070> didn't<00:00:27.280> really<00:00:27.370> know<00:00:27.490> a

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
my fee MREs and I didn't really know a

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.460 
my fee MREs and I didn't really know a
lot<00:00:27.760> about<00:00:27.790> these<00:00:28.120> when<00:00:28.840> I<00:00:28.870> when<00:00:29.230> I<00:00:29.260> picked

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
lot about these when I when I picked

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.940 
lot about these when I when I picked
them<00:00:29.530> up

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
them up

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.640 
them up
I<00:00:29.980> basically<00:00:30.430> thought<00:00:30.760> that<00:00:31.000> they<00:00:31.150> were<00:00:31.210> just

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
I basically thought that they were just

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.549 
I basically thought that they were just
civilian<00:00:32.650> MREs<00:00:34.140> that's<00:00:35.140> what<00:00:35.260> they<00:00:35.350> appear<00:00:35.530> to

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
civilian MREs that's what they appear to

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.280 
civilian MREs that's what they appear to
be<00:00:35.680> with<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.010> with<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.340> clear<00:00:36.520> plastic<00:00:37.290> but

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
be with the with the clear plastic but

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.200 
be with the with the clear plastic but
it<00:00:38.410> turns<00:00:38.590> out<00:00:38.770> that<00:00:38.830> they<00:00:39.100> actually<00:00:39.130> are<00:00:39.850> made

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
it turns out that they actually are made

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.420 
it turns out that they actually are made
for<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.840> government<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.710> just<00:00:41.920> like<00:00:42.070> on<00:00:42.309> the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
for the government and just like on the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.970 
for the government and just like on the
MREs<00:00:42.820> they<00:00:43.510> have<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.410> warning<00:00:44.620> US

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
MREs they have the the warning US

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.900 
MREs they have the the warning US
government<00:00:45.370> property<00:00:45.520> not<00:00:46.000> for<00:00:46.680> resale<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
government property not for resale so

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.369 
government property not for resale so
that's<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:49.570> shows<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.930> it<00:00:50.080> is<00:00:50.110> different

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
that's that shows that it is different

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.990 
that's that shows that it is different
from<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.830> from<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.370> civilian<00:00:51.700> ones<00:00:51.850> which

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
from the from the civilian ones which

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.820 
from the from the civilian ones which
don't<00:00:52.210> have<00:00:52.300> that<00:00:52.480> because<00:00:52.720> you<00:00:53.110> can<00:00:53.290> buy<00:00:53.680> and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
don't have that because you can buy and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.650 
don't have that because you can buy and
sell<00:00:54.010> them<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:56.040> these<00:00:57.040> things<00:00:57.370> are<00:00:57.820> meant<00:00:58.540> for

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
sell them so these things are meant for

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.270 
sell them so these things are meant for
I<00:01:00.090> guess<00:01:01.090> for<00:01:01.329> situations<00:01:01.900> where<00:01:02.230> all<00:01:03.070> the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
I guess for situations where all the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.859 
I guess for situations where all the
stuff<00:01:03.520> that<00:01:03.700> that's<00:01:03.820> found<00:01:04.030> on<00:01:04.150> an<00:01:04.239> MRE<00:01:04.600> isn't

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
stuff that that's found on an MRE isn't

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:05.490 
stuff that that's found on an MRE isn't
necessary

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
necessary

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.830 
necessary
you<00:01:06.430> know<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.670> memories<00:01:07.150> it's<00:01:07.600> basically

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
you know the memories it's basically

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.300 
you know the memories it's basically
considered<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:08.290> meal<00:01:08.440> but<00:01:08.650> you<00:01:08.710> can<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.190> can

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
considered a meal but you can you can

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.380 
considered a meal but you can you can
make<00:01:09.400> one<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.580> these<00:01:09.640> last<00:01:09.850> for<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.060> day<00:01:10.210> if<00:01:10.330> you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
make one of these last for a day if you

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.840 
make one of these last for a day if you
need<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.750> have<00:01:11.410> forgot<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.710> some<00:01:11.920> how<00:01:12.670> many

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
need to have forgot it some how many

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.180 
need to have forgot it some how many
calories<00:01:13.030> but<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.259> a<00:01:14.290> reduced<00:01:14.619> reduced

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
calories but this is a reduced reduced

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.249 
calories but this is a reduced reduced
calorie<00:01:15.550> meal<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.210> this<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.869> same<00:01:17.050> thing

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
calorie meal and this is the same thing

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.570 
calorie meal and this is the same thing
but<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.500> has<00:01:17.649> less<00:01:17.860> less<00:01:18.670> stuff<00:01:18.940> in<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.240> less

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
but it has less less stuff in it less

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.340 
but it has less less stuff in it less
components<00:01:24.539> they're<00:01:25.539> pretty<00:01:25.840> similar<00:01:26.319> to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
components they're pretty similar to

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.950 
components they're pretty similar to
MREs<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.039> noticed<00:01:27.310> some<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.000> them<00:01:28.119> don't<00:01:28.810> have

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
MREs I noticed some of them don't have

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.499 
MREs I noticed some of them don't have
date<00:01:29.200> codes<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.740> MREs<00:01:30.069> have<00:01:30.280> these<00:01:30.509> these

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
date codes the MREs have these these

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.850 
date codes the MREs have these these
date<00:01:31.750> codes<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.110> know<00:01:32.289> how<00:01:32.380> fresh<00:01:32.649> they

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
date codes so you know how fresh they

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.029 
date codes so you know how fresh they
are

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
are

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.940 
are
this<00:01:33.880> one's<00:01:34.119> nine<00:01:34.390> two<00:01:34.929> seven<00:01:35.229> two<00:01:35.380> which

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
this one's nine two seven two which

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.080 
this one's nine two seven two which
meant<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.369> was<00:01:37.050> packed<00:01:38.050> on<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:39.039> 270<00:01:39.729> second

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
meant it was packed on the 270 second

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.249 
meant it was packed on the 270 second
day<00:01:40.209> of<00:01:40.240> 2009<00:01:41.580> and<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:42.880> one<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.810> tio<00:01:43.990> TM

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
day of 2009 and this one this tio TM

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.240 
day of 2009 and this one this tio TM
doesn't<00:01:44.590> have<00:01:44.770> any<00:01:46.229> date<00:01:47.229> on<00:01:47.440> it<00:01:47.619> any<00:01:48.039> date

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
doesn't have any date on it any date

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.880 
doesn't have any date on it any date
code<00:01:48.429> because<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:48.970> call<00:01:49.179> it<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.360> born-on<00:01:49.660> date

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
code because you call it a born-on date

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.460 
code because you call it a born-on date
but<00:01:50.890> most<00:01:51.190> of<00:01:51.280> them<00:01:51.429> do<00:01:52.020> almost<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.229> ones<00:01:53.380> I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
but most of them do almost the ones I

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.669 
but most of them do almost the ones I
have<00:01:53.679> this<00:01:54.069> ones<00:01:54.750> zero<00:01:55.750> three<00:01:55.990> five<00:01:56.020> five<00:01:56.380> so

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
have this ones zero three five five so

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.090 
have this ones zero three five five so
it<00:01:56.740> was<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.950> 350<00:01:57.759> fifth<00:01:57.910> day<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.209> 2010<00:01:59.069> yeah<00:02:00.069> I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
it was the 350 fifth day of 2010 yeah I

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.960 
it was the 350 fifth day of 2010 yeah I
think<00:02:00.190> it's<00:02:00.369> kind<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.520> funny<00:02:00.670> about<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:00.850> is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
think it's kind of funny about that is

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.160 
think it's kind of funny about that is
you<00:02:01.209> sort<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.479> know<00:02:01.569> how<00:02:01.690> many<00:02:01.810> need<00:02:01.990> that

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
you sort of know how many need that

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.559 
you sort of know how many need that
because<00:02:02.759> since<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:03.910> clear<00:02:04.179> you<00:02:04.420> can

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
because since it's clear you can

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.109 
because since it's clear you can
actually<00:02:04.840> see<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.229> date<00:02:06.039> codes<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.729> on

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
actually see the date codes on the on

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.850 
actually see the date codes on the on

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
with a napkin now so this so basically

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.510 
with a napkin now so this so basically
this<00:05:13.560> doesn't<00:05:13.950> include<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.360> matches<00:05:15.740> and<00:05:16.740> the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
this doesn't include the matches and the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.570 
this doesn't include the matches and the

toilet<00:05:20.940> paper<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.210> guess<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.630> reason<00:05:21.900> being

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
toilet paper I guess the reason being

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.780

that you won't need matches because

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.950 
that you won't need matches because
