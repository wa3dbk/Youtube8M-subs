00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
going to be an all grain brew so here's

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.990 
going to be an all grain brew so here's
all<00:00:27.570> my<00:00:27.680> 11<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.859> half<00:00:28.890> pounds<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.429> grain<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
all my 11 and a half pounds of grain and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.340 
all my 11 and a half pounds of grain and
then<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:30.960> got<00:00:31.140> some<00:00:31.920> hops<00:00:32.189> I'm<00:00:32.640> using<00:00:32.940> some

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
then we got some hops I'm using some

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.209 
then we got some hops I'm using some
traditional<00:00:35.180> English<00:00:36.180> type<00:00:36.930> hops<00:00:37.230> ok<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.100> we

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
traditional English type hops ok so we

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
traditional English type hops ok so we
get<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> pearl<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:40.110> Kent

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
water my strike water up here is at 145

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.789 
water my strike water up here is at 145
and<00:01:32.690> we're<00:01:32.780> going<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:32.930> try<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.140> stabilize<00:01:33.409> it

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
and we're going to try to stabilize it

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:52.210 
and we're going to try to stabilize it
between<00:01:34.009> 130<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.720> 135<00:01:50.770> already<00:01:51.770> check<00:01:52.039> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
between 130 and 135 already check the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.130 
between 130 and 135 already check the
temperature<00:01:52.670> on<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.539> temperature

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
temperature on this and the temperature

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.340 
temperature on this and the temperature
stabilized<00:01:55.070> around<00:01:55.720> 134<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.020> we're<00:01:57.170> going<00:01:57.259> to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
stabilized around 134 so we're going to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.469 
stabilized around 134 so we're going to
do<00:01:57.440> our<00:01:57.470> protein<00:01:58.070> rest<00:01:58.340> for<00:01:59.030> 30<00:01:59.780> minutes<00:02:00.340> our

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
do our protein rest for 30 minutes our

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.210 
do our protein rest for 30 minutes our
protein<00:02:02.479> rest<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:02.990> done<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:05.420> off<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.979> let's

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
protein rest is done this off and let's

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.590 
protein rest is done this off and let's
see<00:02:07.369> how<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.520> temperature<00:02:08.030> did<00:02:08.269> our

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
see how the temperature did our

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.580 
see how the temperature did our
temperature<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.350> about<00:02:09.560> 132<00:02:11.230> now<00:02:12.230> let's<00:02:12.440> get

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
temperature is about 132 now let's get

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.150 
temperature is about 132 now let's get
the<00:02:13.540> boiling<00:02:14.540> water<00:02:14.569> in<00:02:15.019> here<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.890> we<00:02:16.010> can

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the boiling water in here so that we can

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.770 
the boiling water in here so that we can
get<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.459> up<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.790> temperature<00:02:17.090> now<00:02:17.239> we<00:02:17.450> want

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
get this up the temperature now we want

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.550 
get this up the temperature now we want
it<00:02:17.870> about<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.769> know<00:02:18.890> 150<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.730> 155<00:02:20.300> s<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> five

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it about you know 150 to 155 s is a five

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.610 
it about you know 150 to 155 s is a five
and<00:02:22.510> three-quarters<00:02:24.100> quarts<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:26.620> boiling

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
water or just under boiling we're going

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.300 
water or just under boiling we're going
to<00:02:31.220> just<00:02:31.430> stir<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.700> up<00:02:32.769> really<00:02:33.769> get<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.190> all

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
to just stir that up really get it all

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.020 
to just stir that up really get it all
stirred<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:35.650> let's<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:36.860> where<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.130> stabilizes

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
stirred in let's see where it stabilizes

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.880 
stirred in let's see where it stabilizes
right<00:02:38.269> like<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.630> color<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.079> can<00:02:39.380> see<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
right like in the color I can see the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.699 
right like in the color I can see the
color<00:02:40.310> right<00:02:40.610> down<00:02:40.820> there<00:02:41.060> at<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.239> bottom

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
color right down there at the bottom

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.009 
color right down there at the bottom
it's<00:02:42.709> getting<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> nice<00:02:43.160> color<00:02:43.579> to<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.060> let's

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
it's getting a nice color to it let's

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.729 
it's getting a nice color to it let's
see<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.320> can<00:02:45.440> get<00:02:45.590> all<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:46.060> starch

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
see if we can get all that starch

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.160 
see if we can get all that starch
converted<00:02:48.739> into<00:02:48.920> sugars<00:02:49.600> be<00:02:50.600> good<00:02:50.810> for<00:02:51.049> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
converted into sugars be good for the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.390 
converted into sugars be good for the
stirring<00:02:51.650> now<00:02:51.890> let's<00:02:52.070> see<00:02:52.220> what<00:02:52.340> our

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
stirring now let's see what our

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.690 
stirring now let's see what our
temperature<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.620> okay<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:55.040> looks<00:02:55.100> like<00:02:55.340> we

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
temperature is okay so it looks like we

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.990 
temperature is okay so it looks like we
got<00:02:55.880> about<00:02:56.209> one<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:57.280> little<00:02:58.280> high<00:02:58.489> we're<00:02:58.970> a

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
got about one a little high we're a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.410 
got about one a little high we're a
little<00:02:59.239> high<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.530> what<00:03:00.650> I'm<00:03:00.739> going<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:00.920> do<00:03:01.420> is

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
little high so what I'm going to do is

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.199 
little high so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:02.570> just<00:03:02.690> going<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.900> keep<00:03:03.079> this<00:03:03.670> open<00:03:04.670> for<00:03:05.150> a

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
I'm just going to keep this open for a

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.580 
I'm just going to keep this open for a
little<00:03:05.329> bit<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.660> stop<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.049> temperature<00:03:06.470> we

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
little bit just stop the temperature we

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.009 
little bit just stop the temperature we
need<00:03:06.769> it's<00:03:06.950> at<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:07.459> at<00:03:07.700> 155<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:08.959> to

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
need it's at now at 155 so I'm going to

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.960 
need it's at now at 155 so I'm going to
get<00:03:09.109> this<00:03:09.260> mash<00:03:09.739> jacket<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.400> here<00:03:10.670> really

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
get this mash jacket on here really

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.789 
get this mash jacket on here really
quick<00:03:11.239> it's<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:12.049> maintain<00:03:12.590> that

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
quick it's like maintain that

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.949 
quick it's like maintain that
temperature<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:14.420> then<00:03:14.540> we're<00:03:14.660> going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.840> just

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
temperature and then we're going to just

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.060 
temperature and then we're going to just
maintain<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.650> temperature<00:03:16.130> for<00:03:16.400> about<00:03:16.780> 45

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
maintain this temperature for about 45

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.310 
maintain this temperature for about 45
minutes<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:20.269> know<00:03:20.359> we<00:03:20.510> want<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.750> keep<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.019> this

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
minutes you know we want to keep it this

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.410 
minutes you know we want to keep it this
smash<00:03:21.680> jacket<00:03:22.160> will<00:03:22.250> keep<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.579> between<00:03:22.700> you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
smash jacket will keep it between you

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.780 
smash jacket will keep it between you
have<00:03:23.510> 155<00:03:24.320> we'll<00:03:24.859> see<00:03:25.010> what<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.220> drops<00:03:25.519> down<00:03:25.640> to

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
have 155 we'll see what it drops down to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.880 
have 155 we'll see what it drops down to
but<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.269> doesn't<00:03:26.600> drop<00:03:26.750> very<00:03:27.019> much<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.799> we're

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
but it doesn't drop very much so we're

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.110 
but it doesn't drop very much so we're
going<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.069> just<00:03:28.099> leave<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.519> here<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:29.000> we'll

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
going to just leave this here and we'll

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.780 
going to just leave this here and we'll
see<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.300> in<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:29.480> 45<00:03:30.319> minutes<00:03:30.590> our<00:03:30.950> match

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
see you in just 45 minutes our match

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.770 
see you in just 45 minutes our match
time<00:03:32.120> is<00:03:32.300> done

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
time is done

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.050 
time is done
so<00:03:33.020> let's<00:03:33.410> get<00:03:33.590> open<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.250> up<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.520> see<00:03:34.610> how<00:03:34.910> it

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
so let's get open it up and see how it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.470 
so let's get open it up and see how it
turned<00:03:35.300> out<00:03:36.730> I'm<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:37.850> going<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.120> check<00:03:38.330> the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
turned out I'm just going to check the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.150 
turned out I'm just going to check the
temp<00:03:38.720> check<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.170> temperature<00:03:39.650> really<00:03:39.920> quick

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
temp check with temperature really quick

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.559 
temp check with temperature really quick
I<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.459> like<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.760> see<00:03:40.940> how<00:03:41.150> much<00:03:41.330> the

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
I just like to see how much the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.000 
I just like to see how much the
temperature<00:03:42.140> dropped<00:03:43.130> over<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.580> last<00:03:45.010> 45

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
temperature dropped over the last 45

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.600 
temperature dropped over the last 45
minutes<00:03:46.600> perfect<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:48.140> temperature<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.950> right

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
minutes perfect the temperature is right

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.790 
minutes perfect the temperature is right
at<00:03:49.760> 150<00:03:50.450> right<00:03:50.690> now<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.290> dropped<00:03:51.530> down<00:03:51.650> from

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
at 150 right now so it dropped down from

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.260 
at 150 right now so it dropped down from
about<00:03:52.640> 155<00:03:53.319> 154<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.440> 150<00:03:55.069> /<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.430> 45<00:03:55.910> minutes

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
about 155 154 to 150 / that 45 minutes

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.479 
about 155 154 to 150 / that 45 minutes
all<00:03:56.480> right<00:03:56.930> let's<00:03:57.110> get<00:03:57.230> this<00:03:57.410> already<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.430> i

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
all right let's get this already so i

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.660 
all right let's get this already so i
can<00:03:58.730> start<00:03:58.970> sparging<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.980> time<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.370> get<00:04:01.489> this

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
can start sparging it's time to get this

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:14.099 
can start sparging it's time to get this
barge<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.270> going

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.629 

but<00:04:15.109> I<00:04:15.140> just<00:04:15.319> wanted<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.620> show<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:15.829> this<00:04:16.070> the

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
but I just wanted to show you this the

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.479 
but I just wanted to show you this the
color<00:04:16.880> coming<00:04:17.539> out<00:04:18.039> just<00:04:19.039> a<00:04:19.130> little<00:04:19.160> bit

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
color coming out just a little bit

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.969 
color coming out just a little bit
darker<00:04:20.000> than<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.239> expected<00:04:20.359> but<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.650> still

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
darker than I expected but it still

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.590 
darker than I expected but it still
looks<00:04:22.009> pretty<00:04:22.490> good<00:04:22.669> we'll<00:04:23.180> see<00:04:23.389> how<00:04:23.570> it

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
looks pretty good we'll see how it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.200 
looks pretty good we'll see how it
ferments<00:04:24.259> out<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.800> all<00:04:25.580> right<00:04:25.789> now<00:04:25.940> we<00:04:26.000> have

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
ferments out and all right now we have

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.909 
ferments out and all right now we have
our<00:04:26.240> work<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> boil<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.470> I'm<00:04:27.590> going<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.800> add
