00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.700 
so let's give it a try after smelling it
we<00:04:56.720> have<00:04:56.840> these<00:04:56.990> things<00:04:57.200> over<00:04:57.320> here<00:04:57.530> called

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
we have these things over here called

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.380

york peppermint patties which sort of

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.480 
york peppermint patties which sort of
makes<00:04:59.510> sense<00:04:59.780> now<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.770> they're<00:05:00.980> called<00:05:01.190> York

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
makes sense now that they're called York

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.060 
makes sense now that they're called York

pattie<00:05:19.729> but<00:05:20.120> i<00:05:20.150> think<00:05:20.419> we<00:05:21.320> have<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.560> in<00:05:21.680> the

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
pattie but i think we have this in the

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.500 
pattie but i think we have this in the
refrigerator<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.760> i<00:05:22.910> have<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.120> feeling<00:05:23.300> that

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
refrigerator and i have a feeling that

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
if we had put a york peppermint pattie

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.170 
if we had put a york peppermint pattie
in<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.040> refrigerator<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.640> would<00:05:25.729> do<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.000> same

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
in the refrigerator it would do the same

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.159 
in the refrigerator it would do the same
thing<00:05:26.419> but<00:05:26.630> when<00:05:27.320> I<00:05:27.350> bit<00:05:27.590> into<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:28.160> like
