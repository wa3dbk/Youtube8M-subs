00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
do in a second because it has to be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
exit the app and then a third step it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.420 
exit the app and then a third step it's
just<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.589> back<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> app<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.250> i'll<00:01:05.339> be
