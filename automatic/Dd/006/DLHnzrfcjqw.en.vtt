00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
in the second nine fiber 9 sugar and for

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.719 
in the second nine fiber 9 sugar and for
protein<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.360> um<00:01:21.780> i<00:01:22.200> calculate<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.310> macros

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to eat and i came to the conclusion that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640 
to eat and i came to the conclusion that
i<00:01:28.799> needed<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:30.079> eighty-two<00:01:31.079> percent<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
i needed to have eighty-two percent of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.840 
i needed to have eighty-two percent of
one<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.159> instead<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.360> full<00:01:33.540> serving

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
one of these instead of the full serving

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.429 
one of these instead of the full serving
