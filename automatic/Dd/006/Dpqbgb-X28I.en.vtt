at<00:00:48.280> their<00:00:48.460> most<00:00:48.850> tense<00:00:49.239> because<00:00:49.450> they're<00:00:49.840> in<00:00:49.960> a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
at their most tense because they're in a

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.170 
at their most tense because they're in a
unfamiliar<00:00:50.920> surroundings<00:00:51.160> maybe<00:00:51.940> they're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
unfamiliar surroundings maybe they're

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.729 
unfamiliar surroundings maybe they're
suffering<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.630> little<00:00:52.840> separation<00:00:53.290> anxiety

from<00:00:54.160> their<00:00:54.520> friends<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.629> they're<00:00:55.780> kind

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
from their friends and so they're kind

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.530 
from their friends and so they're kind
of<00:00:56.050> looking<00:00:56.320> around<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:57.040> very<00:00:57.250> tense<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:58.239> what

of looking around and very tense so what

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.119 
of looking around and very tense so what
I'm<00:00:58.629> talking<00:00:58.989> about<00:00:59.050> with<00:00:59.410> prewriting<00:00:59.890> is

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
I'm talking about with prewriting is

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.710 
I'm talking about with prewriting is
basically<00:01:00.489> getting<00:01:00.970> on<00:01:01.120> them<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.480> writing

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
basically getting on them and writing

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.229 
basically getting on them and writing
them<00:01:01.989> well<00:01:02.230> before<00:01:02.680> you<00:01:03.220> compete<00:01:03.670> or<00:01:03.910> even

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
them well before you compete or even

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.330 
them well before you compete or even
warm<00:01:04.510> up<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.080> so<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.800> they<00:01:05.920> become<00:01:06.160> a<00:01:06.220> little

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
warm up so so that they become a little

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.500 
warm up so so that they become a little
bit<00:01:06.490> more<00:01:06.550> familiar<00:01:07.150> with<00:01:07.270> their

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
bit more familiar with their

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.030 
bit more familiar with their
surroundings<00:01:08.140> now<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.710> may<00:01:08.890> not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
surroundings now this may not

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.950 
surroundings now this may not
necessarily<00:01:09.160> be<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.820> most<00:01:09.850> fun<00:01:10.330> ride<00:01:10.630> of<00:01:10.869> all

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
necessarily be the most fun ride of all

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.630 
necessarily be the most fun ride of all
time<00:01:11.229> because<00:01:11.800> they're<00:01:12.040> probably<00:01:12.160> going<00:01:12.550> to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
time because they're probably going to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.999 
time because they're probably going to
be<00:01:12.729> quite<00:01:13.000> tense<00:01:13.420> but<00:01:14.110> often<00:01:14.470> times<00:01:14.710> just

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
be quite tense but often times just

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.469 
be quite tense but often times just
getting<00:01:15.310> them<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.520> bit<00:01:15.670> more<00:01:15.700> familiar<00:01:16.330> with

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
getting them a bit more familiar with

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.760 
getting them a bit more familiar with
where<00:01:16.660> they<00:01:16.780> are<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.290> having<00:01:17.410> them<00:01:17.590> have<00:01:17.740> a

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
where they are and having them have a

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
little bit not only that sometimes the

forth back and forth can actually calm

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.550 
forth back and forth can actually calm
them<00:01:31.420> down<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.690> little<00:01:31.930> bit<00:01:32.110> just<00:01:32.290> from<00:01:32.440> the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
them down a little bit just from the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560 
them down a little bit just from the
monotony<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:34.149> you're<00:01:34.330> not<00:01:34.420> necessarily

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
monotony of it so you're not necessarily

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.810 
monotony of it so you're not necessarily
making<00:01:35.320> them<00:01:35.410> exhausted<00:01:36.130> but<00:01:36.580> they<00:01:36.640> don't

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
making them exhausted but they don't

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.490 
making them exhausted but they don't
really<00:01:36.970> know<00:01:37.390> what's<00:01:37.660> coming<00:01:38.020> next<00:01:38.170> Center

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
really know what's coming next Center

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.070 
really know what's coming next Center
they<00:01:38.710> can't<00:01:38.979> really<00:01:39.330> anticipate<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.660> so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
they can't really anticipate it and so

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.389 
they can't really anticipate it and so
they<00:01:41.200> tend<00:01:41.410> to<00:01:41.530> sort<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.830> settle<00:01:42.160> down<00:01:42.340> a

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.100 
they tend to sort of settle down a
little<00:01:42.520> bit<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.540> be<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.690> very<00:01:43.780> useful

horses nervousness and anxiety this is

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.190 
horses nervousness and anxiety this is
most<00:04:38.010> probably<00:04:38.550> because<00:04:38.820> he's<00:04:39.540> not<00:04:39.720> often<00:04:40.050> in

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
most probably because he's not often in

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.320 
most probably because he's not often in
that<00:04:40.230> situation<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.220> also<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.940> warm-up

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
that situation and also to the warm-up

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.760 
that situation and also to the warm-up
can<00:04:42.570> be<00:04:42.720> quite<00:04:42.990> tense<00:04:43.290> there's<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.500> lot<00:04:43.650> of

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
can be quite tense there's a lot of

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.890 
can be quite tense there's a lot of
horses<00:04:44.040> going<00:04:44.430> around<00:04:44.700> and<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.360> rider<00:04:45.630> is

the warm

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.840 
the warm
first<00:04:53.200> of<00:04:53.380> all<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.680> getting<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.190> timing<00:04:54.550> of

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
first of all is getting the timing of

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.280 
first of all is getting the timing of
the<00:04:55.030> warm-up<00:04:55.390> right<00:04:55.600> now<00:04:55.780> this<00:04:55.960> really

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
the warm-up right now this really

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.220 
the warm-up right now this really
depends<00:04:56.920> on<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:58.060> horse<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.630> you're<00:04:58.840> going<00:04:59.140> to

depends on the horse and you're going to

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.930 
depends on the horse and you're going to
figure<00:04:59.440> this<00:04:59.530> out<00:04:59.890> on<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.190> trial<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.790> error

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
figure this out on a trial and error

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.750 
figure this out on a trial and error
basis<00:05:01.420> some<00:05:02.020> horses<00:05:02.350> thrive<00:05:02.830> getting<00:05:03.610> in

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
basis some horses thrive getting in

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.550 
basis some horses thrive getting in
doing<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.300> quickly<00:05:04.480> and<00:05:04.840> getting<00:05:05.050> in<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.320> ring

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
doing it quickly and getting in the ring

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.260 
doing it quickly and getting in the ring
others<00:05:05.950> need<00:05:06.100> a<00:05:06.160> lot<00:05:06.430> longer<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:06.970> sort<00:05:07.240> of

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
others need a lot longer to sort of

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.970 
others need a lot longer to sort of
start<00:05:07.480> to<00:05:07.570> see<00:05:07.630> straight<00:05:08.200> before<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.560> compete

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
start to see straight before you compete

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.580 
start to see straight before you compete
so<00:05:09.580> really<00:05:10.060> gonna<00:05:10.180> try<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.600> tweak<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.110> timing

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
so really gonna try and tweak the timing

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.190 
so really gonna try and tweak the timing
of<00:05:11.680> your<00:05:11.740> warmup<00:05:12.190> as<00:05:12.340> you<00:05:12.730> learn<00:05:13.090> about<00:05:13.420> your

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
of your warmup as you learn about your

the worst things you can do is trying to

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.910

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
going in the ring because the horse

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.870 
going in the ring because the horse
really<00:05:29.470> needs<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:29.980> kind<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:30.250> get<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.670> nervous
