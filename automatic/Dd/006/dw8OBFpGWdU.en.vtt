 Sudden vision bothers you in the light or

 suffering from a uveitis and has to 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.870
 go to the ophthalmologist for 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.900
 diagnosis and treatment of this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900
 disease 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.590
 Uveitis are a group of diseases 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.160
 that they have in common the information of the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.180
 obvious middle layer of the eye and what good 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.370
 it affects the back of the eye 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.280
 to the posterior pole and can also 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.380
 affect the previous pole depending on 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.750
 that will be anterior uveitis uveitis 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.920
 later and sometimes affect both 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.290
 common areas that have this disease 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.610
 is that the simple eye is inflamed bunch 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.260
 due to infectious causes or causes 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.670
 autoimmune where the defenses themselves 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.140
 of the patient 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.270
 somehow attack structures 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.120
 ocular 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.980
 the signs are potentially serious 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.400
 clinical signs the most important sign is 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.930
 pain annoying eye to light 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.820
 puts the red eye and vision is lost 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.100
 any of these clinical signs 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.380
 any of these symptoms 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.940
 well, it makes the patient have 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.170
 to go to the consultation by technology 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.729
 preferentially and what once 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.580
 comes the consultation of the treatments 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.380
 are either local to remove the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.729
 information but sometimes also 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.869
 we have to do treatments 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.960
 systemic either orally or via 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.400
 intravenous 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.940
 the prognosis of these diseases 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.830
 when they are treated and the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.630
 etiology the cause 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.090
 Well, it's pretty good 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.220
 prognosis but if one is tolerated 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.259
 inflammation larvae information 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.070
 prolonged if you tolerate that these 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.229
 uveitis are chronified and it is not treated 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.570
 this information with a strategy to 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.440
 long term and trying to address the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.300
 cause the prognosis is very bad and the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.270
 patients in a way that they do not have 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.780
 these highly specialized care 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.119
 they end up having macular problems 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.759
 the macula or glaucoma that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.709
 it is the common way in which patients 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.620
 with uveitis can reach blindness 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.890
 with a medical treatment either be 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.709
 Surgical either topically in the eye or as 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.110
 be oral and known the cause is not 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.360
 we can only treat the disease 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.600
 popular disease but also treat 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.230
 a possible systemic disease that 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.230
 affect the eye
