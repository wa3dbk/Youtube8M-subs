00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello you finish Juan Ignacio says hello 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.450
 Mr. Daily I am young was born Álvarez 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.370
 I have a turquoise beta like a year ago 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
 and since he bought it he started with a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.750
 problem in the fins since this is 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.030
 frayed I do not know how I can cure 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.710
 selo and I would like some help my vein 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 lives alone and about is an aquarium 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 about 16 liters I hope you help me 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 I would appreciate very much greetings from temuco 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.869
 chile the fins of the veins are 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.310
 quite delicate and when the aquarium 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.840
 is not well is the first thing they 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.580
 Note though not only of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.470
 silencing can come by the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.149
 bad water conditions or even by 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.739
 a filtration too powerful though 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.840
 they are fish that are used to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.059
 live in puddles in waters where others 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 fish would die and also to breathe from 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 air also need the changes of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.180
 partial water weekly or even 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.820
 twice a week since the filtration 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.680
 that they need these fish must be very 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.210
 little powerful so that the water outlet 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 of the filter does not spoil its pretty 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 fins and also so that you do not break down 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.820
 its bubble nests on the other hand in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.250
 cases like this a good way to treat the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 fish is to put Indian almond leaves 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.430
 in the aquarium but if you can not find them 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.769
 You can also put a little aloe 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.820
 You will see both are very effective and have a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.530
 lots of qualities 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.300
 for the fish so I could continue 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.860
 using them after passing the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.409
 problem among other good options 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.270
 you also have general tetra everything that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.060
 contains cris the flour or also blue 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 from methylene álex says hello good I have 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.410
 a fish oscar a parrot fish and a catfish and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 I would like to move them to an aquarium 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.759
 larger than about 200 liters maximum I 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.369
 would like to put terror in the aquarium 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.479
 green and some other American circuit 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.670
 could you tell me what other cichlids 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.990
 they would be compatible with these and they would fit 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.960
 in the aquarium or on the contrary 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.399
 replace the green terror and if you're from 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.380
 madrid could this I signed a store 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.479
 where to get this kind of fish and the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 Aquarium at a good price, I do not know if 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.860
 put plants but if so, which ones 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.420
 you recommend thank you very much for your time 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.399
 if you have thought about getting a more queue 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.500
 big and having an oscar fish I'll 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.030
 I would recommend getting an aquarium of 300 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.860
 liters put there to oscar that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.050
 accompany him with another of his kind but 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.820
 of the other sex having the thus separated ones 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.190
 of the other fish with which undoubtedly 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.890
 will have serious problems in the long run if not 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.140
 it is possible this other 600 liters other 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.209
 option would be to remove the oscar leaving the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.950
 green terror like the cyclic the gold and 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.790
 no more fish as long as they are from 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.500
 pomp character 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.329
 and you know that every time inside your 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.739
 species has its personality too 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.599
 it will be necessary to limit the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.189
 territory with stones caves and trunks 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.620
 as we always say to maintain 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.540
 several cycles of all those species are 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.549
 necessary aquariums greater than 300 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.340
 liters about aquarium science online 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.769
 For example, you have no ecosystems 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.510
 that is from madrid in spain and although not 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.459
 that makes them deserve publicity and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.810
 What happened if I saw you 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 you deserve this information 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.620
 so here below in the description 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.450
 I leave the link to that page and 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.489
 then to buy aquariums online 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.260
 large dimensions and consume the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.389
 best offer I know is the following 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.790
 is an aquarium with led lighting you can 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.040
 choosing the outer filter brings its own 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.959
 table your heater the thermometer and the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.900
 conditioners best of all is that 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.909
 They are 300 liters and you get for 440 euros 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.379
 that come to be 20 or 30 euros more than 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.569
 that you will have an aquarium of 200 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.040
 liters with the same components per 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.109
 supposed to have led lighting 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.970
 will spend less electricity I think with 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.859
 this would already solve the problem of your 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.780
 plant hybrids only you 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.470
 I recommend using the a nubia battery 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.510
 and variety barter and tied work 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.280
 or to the trunk and eventually if you go 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.500
 Seeing that it works for you to add another 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.900
 type of anubis alan aguilar question 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.760
 hello sir daily followed tips on 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.100
 the beta I once fulfilled was a hospital 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.440
 of 10 liters for the beta that I bought myself 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.540
 15 days ago and today when I 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.310
 I was going to school I checked it and I noticed 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.620
 that had already formed a bubble nest 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.630
 and immediately cleaning 5 fish tank 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.340
 liters and place my female beta that 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.870
 live in my third community but 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.730
 Now my doubt that I have is that I do not know 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.920
 how long must they be together fatty 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.200
 fish tanks since the forums and videos that I've 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.720
 seen is that the minimum time they should 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.160
 Being there is 4 to 3 weeks but the truth 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.140
 I'm not sure and I would be very grateful 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.450
 that you gave me a more or less time 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.190
 sure so that me beta female does not 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.470
 die for the male did not want it all 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.209
 ways thank you and keep it that way you help us 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.459
 Many greetings from town to mexico 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.470
 to reproduce sales first to 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.500
 keep in mind is that both surpass 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.790
 7 or 9 months and if possible more 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.370
 second will keep the temperature 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.530
 according to our objectives close to 30 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.510
 degrees if we want more male fry and 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.340
 below 27 degrees if we want that 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.870
 Most are females in 3rd 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.510
 the female and the male must be kept 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.010
 in an aquarium with good hiding places 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.840
 where only the female fits so that 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.760
 you can where I'm going, I 'll understand them 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.770
 with a transparent division within the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.180
 aquarium or in another box apart as it is 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.250
 your case waiting for the female 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.590
 show the stomach bloated and make 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.180
 possible vertical stripes then 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.370
 we can put it to the point with the male 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.229
 this may take two weeks or more but 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.150
 they must also be accepted while they are 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.160
 separated simply if they do not reach that 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.990
 point you will have to separate them and wait for 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.580
 another moment is a system that usually 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.650
 work pretty well and late or 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.389
 early they will be accepted yes feeds 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.580
 both during the entire process with 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.470
 live or frozen food and baby food 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.690
 high quality because the petas spend it 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.330
 pretty bad during playback and 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.160
 after her Juan Diego says good 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.350
 nights recently that has started with my 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.760
 aquarium four months watching many of 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.370
 your videos I have learned many things 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.440
 about how to start and take care of my fish and 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.570
 a couple of weeks ago I thought I saw some 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.610
 mini minnows but it was not very clear 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.130
 that were this morning I saw some 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.930
 how many +4 and I have managed to throw them some 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.850
 fotitos to see if you can help me 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.070
 know what is my aquarium is 100 liters 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.890
 I have a pee 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.560
 in climbing a grammy a cleaner 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.960
 albino generous and loose glass cleaner 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.700
 I think I do not forget any of that 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.770
 I attach the photos that I have made 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.720
 they were in the glass and others in a 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.600
 leaf of a plant I hope you can 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.790
 help I'm intrigued a greeting though 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.770
 the quality photos very appreciable to me 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.390
 the same thing happens to me and you could use a 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.950
 magnifying glass in front of the camera lens 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.810
 so that it looks good I think we can 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.820
 ensure they are baby fry the 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.350
 which are pardons and very elongated by 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.060
 what some people confuse them 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.530
 with dragonfly larvae it does not stop being 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.090
 surprising that these fry of 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.350
 terrorists have managed to impress 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.970
 stalls of the eggs walk 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.290
 scattered around the aquarium and I 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.330
 often eat some will have been 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.710
 hidden and have had luck you have 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.990
 that keep these little ones separated 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.610
 of the rest of adult fish because if not 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.230
 they will eat and feed us with 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.270
 newly hatched artery or if not 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.950
 more chapels frozen food 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.700
 commercial foods for very young fry 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.200
 little ones 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.480
 all well crushed while the 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.160
 fry are developing anonymous 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.530
 says hello every day in the aquarium 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.030
 I would like to know if my aquarium is fine and 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.250
 What I need to improve 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.630
 td with the photos and by the way I do not know if 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.820
 it is appreciated in the photos by the flash 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.400
 but neither water nor lately is the water 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.290
 cloudy and a soft white color I 've 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.880
 changed the water by cleaning the filter 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.740
 things I have inside I also 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.080
 cleaned and I changed the plants that 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.850
 I can do thanks for everything included 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.740
 your videos the first thing I've done 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.200
 fixed is that the aquarium counter that 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.180
 you have is too small and they excel 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.770
 several centimeters per side this 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.630
 I should solve it by setting the table 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.370
 wider and suitable for aquariums and in its 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.440
 less advisable defect would be to put 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.270
 a smooth and very solid surface that 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.800
 covering all the water in the meantime you 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.330
 I advise you to have it balanced with 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.010
 both sides then the heater that 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.110
 you have I would not keep it totally 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.460
 submerged in the water unless you check 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.200
 which is submersible by water 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.240
 whitish do not worry because this 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.010
 is normal in newly initiated aquariums 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.990
 so that it disappears we should only 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.580
 wait a while and do not clean everything 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.380
 also for this and keep a good 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.420
 quality in the water I recommend you put 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.800
 all the natural plants that you can and 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.480
 how do you have an internal filter of the 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.160
 tiny ones it's also normal that water 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.990
 it took me a little longer to cycle like these 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.360
 usually bring a small sponge is 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.490
 better cut a little bit and put 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.200
 ceramic combs and something to see 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.270
 while you do not have another type of 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.950
 filtration one last tip is to not poke 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.580
 fish or other bugs in the water of 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.620
 trovar me 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.720
 until the 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.780
 white color and be crystal clear when 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.370
 you finish if we have changed a little bit 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.449
 panorama so you do not get bored and I hope 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.430
 I wish you like it 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:53.310
 I remind you that you have me in my 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.500
 other channels remove only 720 guitars 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.430
 and jose tronic 2 in the body video of 

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.199
 mónsul and we're going to kill a 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.199
