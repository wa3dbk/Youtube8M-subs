00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.660
 hello everyone welcome to my channel and in 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.029
 This video will teach you how 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.279
 become a superman like this one and 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.669
 go flying around the map without any way 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.599
 only two commands without spring for 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.769
 doing it is super simple you go to my web 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.600
 which is the link that the description and 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.269
 discharges this spring so that what 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.160
 you have by mega and by mediafire when 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.980
 you have downloaded 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.450
 you go to pacific spring and you see it here 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.640
 you have to unzip the file that 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.770
 Download directly you can see it here 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.440
 is then select it and now what 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.879
 I have here and you can do it without 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.110
 spring for but you will not see the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.590
 super hand and it's going to be a bit worse 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.470
 then you see that there are two commands here 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 let's copy this to zero in this order 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.019
 first this one up and then the one below 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.080
 if you do not see 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.280
 we select them we give control ce 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.110
 ah 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.590
 and we're going to take a block in minecraft 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.590
 of commands 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.290
 and with control v we paste it here 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.550
 we put a rest on the side and you see that it 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.550
 will build a single machine 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.679
 plop be built that a machine 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.680
 we do the same with the other command 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.680
 we copy it with control c 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.910
 and control v here to paste it 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.780
 we put a rest and it's going to be built 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.780
 another machine already alone 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.270
 here you have if you want to remove it only 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.510
 you have to give this red sign of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.479
 here and they clear themselves then 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.700
 when you have done this, it is all 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.320
 we created a red armor 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.610
 and as soon as I put it on, I'm going to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.119
 become superman and I will continue 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.119
 flying I'm going to put on survival 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.970
 so you can see that I'm not flying in 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.700
 survival there is no way to fly 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.740
 then me and I'll put me 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.250
 becomes superman and I fly 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.140
 You see that all the addresses can 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.600
 can go down can go towards 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.290
 up I'm not flying as if it were a 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.290
 real superman 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.500
 You see that he has given me some red boots 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.930
 when he put them on me he stopped flying pop and 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.450
 It makes me a person again and 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.590
 when I put the top armor on him 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.590
 Become a superman and I'm flying 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.910
 now I will explain how this works 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.560
 very easy 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.610
 discuss flying wherever you want 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.610
 superchule this 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.870
 and a person told me to the sea when 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.870
 I put some boots 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.900
 this function to a very simple way 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.700
 I'm going to put on creative again 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.280
 You see that the superman that I have taught you 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.620
 before it was actually a zombie with a 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.250
 block in the head if we take off the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.250
 spring peaceful 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.380
 you will see that what he has in reality 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.600
 it's a clay block 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.520
 and the result so that what he does is 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.070
 replace the clay block with a 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.340
 3d model that created me and some textures 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.640
 that I have taken from a web of skins you see 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.240
 carries a block of click on the head 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.680
 so if I make it invisible it seems that 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.680
 it's a real superman flying 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.710
 this can be done only in 1.8 of 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.050
 minecraft in the following versions 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.030
 I put limitations and it's superman not 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.360
 It appears crooked so I recommend you 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.700
 try in 1.8 but it will work in 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.050
 all versions from 1.8 lo 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.100
 unique that is superman on table and makes 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:07.440
 twisted upwards 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.210
 and what this does is the movement is 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.360
 responsible for the movement and the yellow 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.190
 rest 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.890
 here you see that what it does is detect 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.500
 where are we looking and we tpa in 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.040
 that address 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.840
 then when we put on the armor 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.460
 what this machine does is remove the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.740
 and put a clean block in the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.930
 head then when we put the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.720
 block of want the head adds a 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.550
 marker that is called superman a point 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.460
 and this machine starts to work as 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.680
 You see here it only works when the score 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.180
 of superman be in 1 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.400
 so what are you starting to 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.680
 work begins to be eaten when we 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.150
 We put the boots off the click of 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.060
 head 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.050
 the superman score is set to 0 and 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.050
 this machine stops working 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.210
 so in this simple way we 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.400
 we can become superman 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.040
 I already give 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.020
 you will see that what is happening is 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.360
 that I am invisible and I carry an object of 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.789
 click on the head then gives the 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.220
 feeling that I'm flying but in 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.169
 I am really a normal person 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.710
 here that I have 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.629
 the boots in my hand I'm still 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.949
 I say that I am invisible and it seems that I am 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.980
 a superman because I have put in the 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.850
 head 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.850
 I'm going to stop here 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.650
 note also that when you go flying 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.310
 it puts invisible barriers underneath I go to 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.310
 talk here a little bit 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.650
 Now I go back where I came 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.420
 and you see there are invisible barriers this makes 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.460
 Do not fall and only climb towards 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.710
 in front you would say falling down and not 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.540
 I would fly but when I put this on you 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.670
 keep at the same height and give the 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.260
 feeling that you are flying and when 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.730
 you look down at you worse block 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.249
 down and when you look up 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.569
 tpa one block up 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:02.639
 and when you put on your boots 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.650
 remove the barriers and have the floor 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.150
 so in this easy way we can 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.440
 become superman is super 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.010
 pimp of this the truth 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.010
 wheat 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.510
 I'm going to remove this 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.840
 and we are a superman who goes out there 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.840
 flying 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.000
 Beware of embedded the block in 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.650
 blocks you see me I can get inside the 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.860
 block if you see in survival you can 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.860
 die 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.730
 so this is all with these two 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.950
 commands and result pack you can 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.620
 becoming superman is very simple 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.180
 you do not have to do anything else and I hope that 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.740
 you liked the video if it has 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.860
 liked to like it so it does more 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.820
 things like you are in a command and up 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.820
 another goodbye
