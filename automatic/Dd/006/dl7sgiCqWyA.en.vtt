select<00:00:00.390> vertices<00:00:01.490> go<00:00:02.490> back<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.909> front<00:00:03.210> mode

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
select vertices go back to front mode

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.809 
select vertices go back to front mode
now<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.529> want<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.040> show<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.339> guys<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.580> to

now I want to show you guys how to
select<00:00:06.390> multiple<00:00:06.870> vertices<00:00:07.880> and<00:00:08.880> stuff<00:00:09.269> like

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
select multiple vertices and stuff like

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.150 
select multiple vertices and stuff like
that<00:00:09.540> so<00:00:10.349> if<00:00:10.440> you'll<00:00:10.590> go<00:00:10.710> ahead<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.010> select

that so if you'll go ahead and select
that<00:00:11.460> top<00:00:11.700> vertice<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.420> top<00:00:12.630> left<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.110> if

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
that top vertice that top left one if

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.490 
that top vertice that top left one if
you<00:00:14.280> hold<00:00:14.460> down<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.820> shift<00:00:14.849> key<00:00:15.289> come<00:00:16.289> down

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
you hold down the shift key come down

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800 
you hold down the shift key come down
here<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> bottom<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.550> select<00:00:18.539> this

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
here to the bottom and select this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.990 
here to the bottom and select this
bottom<00:00:19.199> right<00:00:19.380> vertice<00:00:19.980> now<00:00:20.640> you'll<00:00:20.880> notice

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
bottom right vertice now you'll notice

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.099 
bottom right vertice now you'll notice
that<00:00:21.330> both<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.109> these<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.769> selected<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
that both of these are selected and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.689 
that both of these are selected and
pretty<00:00:25.109> much<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.590> know<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:26.039> grab<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
pretty much you know you can grab it and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.580 
pretty much you know you can grab it and
take<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:28.080> probably

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
take it up like that you probably

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
take it up like that you probably
wouldn't<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.070> ever<00:00:29.310> see<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> object<00:00:30.269> like

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
wouldn't really ever see a object like

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
wouldn't really ever see a object like
that<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.769> press<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> X<00:00:32.820> button

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that but you could press the X button

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.869 
that but you could press the X button
and<00:00:33.510> scale<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.719> it'll<00:00:37.760> give<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and scale it in so that it'll give you

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.450 
and scale it in so that it'll give you
that<00:00:39.090> pyramid<00:00:39.629> type<00:00:39.870> shape<00:00:40.260> again<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:41.160> course

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that pyramid type shape again of course

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.190 
that pyramid type shape again of course
if<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.850> scaled<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> go

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
if you scaled it in you would have to go

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.450 
if you scaled it in you would have to go
to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:44.930> three<00:00:45.930> view<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> lecture<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to the three view and lecture you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.920 
to the three view and lecture you
probably<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.780> grab<00:00:49.020> these<00:00:49.320> two<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
probably just have to grab these two and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.459 
probably just have to grab these two and
scale<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.770> well<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:54.590> India<00:00:56.989> okay<00:00:57.989> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
scale them in as well and India okay so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
scale them in as well and India okay so
we're<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.579> ahead<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.789> press<00:01:00.059> Z

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we're just going to go ahead and press Z

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.930 
we're just going to go ahead and press Z
a<00:01:00.710> control<00:01:01.710> Z<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> few<00:01:02.250> times<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.670> undo

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
a control Z a few times to undo

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.230 
a control Z a few times to undo
everything<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:04.790> well<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.939> pretty<00:01:06.119> much

tutorial what we're going to go over is

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.899 
tutorial what we're going to go over is
extruding<00:01:21.540> now<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.590> extruding<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
extruding now what extruding is is it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.749 
extruding now what extruding is is it
it's<00:01:24.780> pretty<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.229> taking<00:01:26.159> something<00:01:26.460> like

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it's pretty much taking something like

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's pretty much taking something like
out<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.360> object<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.759> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.880> making

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
out of this object and you know making

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.890 
out of this object and you know making
it<00:01:30.479> right<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.079> guess<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.560> could<00:01:31.710> give<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> guys<00:01:32.189> a

it right I guess I could give you guys a
little<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> extrude<00:01:35.670> from

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
little so if you want to extrude from

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.469 
little so if you want to extrude from
here<00:01:36.979> what<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> do<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
here what it's going to do is take that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
here what it's going to do is take that
wall<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> side<00:01:43.860> or

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
wall up or you know out to the side or

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
wall up or you know out to the side or
you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.180> something<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> then

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you know something like that and then

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
you know something like that and then
you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.770> extrude<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.600> we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you can extrude that out and and when we

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.870 
you can extrude that out and and when we
start<00:01:49.049> actually<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.619> over<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> tutorials

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
start actually going over the tutorials

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.600 
start actually going over the tutorials
about<00:01:51.500> modeling<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.799> stuff<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.549> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
about modeling and stuff like that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
about modeling and stuff like that
you'll<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.899> extruding<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> very

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you'll see that the extruding is a very

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.289 
you'll see that the extruding is a very
important<00:01:56.880> thing<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.229> blender<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> after<00:02:00.180> we

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
important thing in blender and after we

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
important thing in blender and after we
go<00:02:00.450> over<00:02:00.689> our<00:02:00.719> extruding<00:02:01.259> tutorial<00:02:01.799> which

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
go over our extruding tutorial which
