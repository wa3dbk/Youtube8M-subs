00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 rest assured I do not intend to lose 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.359
 top 5 h 24 but here it was too much for me 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.910
 heart to make you my top 5 of my 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.440
 favorite polish for summer and you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.360
 as a bonus a little nose guard 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 I really hope it will please you a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.820
 favorite varnish is a red varnish of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.920
 at the barrier of the gabegie einstein 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.320
 they are really a very very beautiful they 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 have this gelled side actually in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.859
 sense where they are really very bright 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.840
 when we ask them they are really 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.949
 beautiful for the whole year and not that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.900
 was elsewhere 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.550
 so I really love them a lot 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.649
 color that I love especially summer 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.380
 it's the coral color this one it's 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.149
 the body dior at 899 and that's really 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.040
 a crazy color 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.899
 a real killing on the elite nails and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.469
 they flash at will loop if you 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.809
 are tanned 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.059
 in short I love turquoises I have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.969
 tried a lot a lot a lot but 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 my favorite is the bazaar cur this one 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.770
 so it's called the rising cake it's 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.079
 really gorgeous sublime it's 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.239
 really the most beautiful turquoise that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.559
 I never tried another color that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.539
 do not do it if this ecstasy but that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.220
 I like worn in summer it's this 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.970
 color of monoprix called 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.280
 Pearl grey 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.530
 I think it turns a little at the top 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 and I find really very beautiful it is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.760
 a fairly simple sober color that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.920
 is really very easy and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 this is me I loved it a lot and finally 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 my favorite of all time for summer 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.670
 it's the white of the six obviously if 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.830
 the one I put the most in the summer to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.840
 spring also from elsewhere 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.400
 really too pretty and when you 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 tanned contrary to what we can 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.759
 believe in a lot who say it's done 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.560
 little ones nail when we put white 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.409
 but I think it's really too much 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.540
 beautiful it's really cool it's sober 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.159
 it's simple it's just all that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 I like and I leave you with the tutorial 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.799

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.799
