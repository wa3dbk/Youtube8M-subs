00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 pirate ships could be so long 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.700
 in minecraft that build so right 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.470
 feeling was not there on what was missing 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.910
 was a flag or a banner and 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.590
 exactly these banners are found only in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.380
 minecraft with the snapshot 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.719
 14.30 more information on this now in this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.430
 snapshot review the banners can be 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.630
 probably as the biggest update this 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.760
 denote snapshots 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 and she's supposed to be six in six hundred 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 give opportunities and that is whole 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.010
 certainly not a little around these 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.630
 to reach possibilities 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.609
 the banners quite simple with different 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 customize materials 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.329
 so you are in the middle of crafting 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 just tables a banner in the color 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.230
 your choice and around you assign 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 different dyes and as well 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 how the dyes are arranged then becomes 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.790
 accordingly also the band look 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.500
 you definitely have to do that once 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.910
 Try and you are welcome in 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 Download snapshot once 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.600
 but before that you need it first 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 another empty when he is in one of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.050
 Minecraft have this and it powers itself 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 quite simply with a stick and above 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
 want six wool or colors 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 In addition, these bands can also be 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 to use as a headgear and ins 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 emmental into the lot for the helmet 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.030
 You can also put them on the floor 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.010
 or hang on the wall 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.720
 but there are also banners 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.430
 some changes in the more frequent rhys green 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.810
 that shows us how many 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.820
 jobs are saved 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 also has the chance to do that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.310
 margins distance because this was now from 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.409
 a maximum of 16 doubles to 32 so that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.330
 player with powerful pcs one 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.659
 far greater visibility guaranteed 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.729
 becomes 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.049
 maybe one knows or uses one or 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.670
 others of you yes the heads in 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.950
 minecraft be it from pugs or even from 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.500
 players these heads are indeed partly 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.020
 already dropped in the survival mode of mobs 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.729
 items but with the snapshot it is now 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.979
 All these heads are also possible in survival 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.780
 getting fashion as it is tells us 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.430
 Unfortunately, as usual, we do not mojang us 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.200
 will do it and in another 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 video in the following days here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.610
 on 1 007 is known , however, that one 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 again the killer rabbit a new one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.240
 Enchantment must use 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.130
 Also noticeable is that apparently 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.020
 now player heads three-dimensional and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.880
 no longer in a 2d view in the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 inventory bar 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.240
 performance improvements has become 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.890
 beware flat mojang will probably be on the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.170
 Written new flags 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 because these too should be replaced by the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.240
 snapshot has been performed again 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 are 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.989
 the chance of chance was immense, too 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.290
 accelerated and for this reason make 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.629
 Here's just a little field 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.060
 so long did it take the chance in the 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.609
 reload previous snapshot and so on 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.840
 fast it goes in the snapshot 14.30 a 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.769
 difference should be in every case 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.269
 be recognizable 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.069
 besides, they are now again the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.450
 races in block rotations for the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.370
 ensures that blocks as in this example 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.989
 the grass is not just in one anymore 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.819
 pointing direction but randomly scattered 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.010
 There are also, as often happens 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.480
 small hidden feature which it 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.980
 according to mojang many players 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.629
 weight and to which we too 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.609
 again a little extra video 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.349
 will produce warm luck and 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.579
 By the way, also to dinner born of this 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.069
 snapshot on his birthday today 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.689
 created for us, we have since forward to 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.189
 flags have written you every week 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.720
 there are reports on the snapshots 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.340
 right now the snapshot links to us 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.599
 from the last week and directly 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.340
 including the current issue of 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.319
 minecraft news among others with the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.329
 topic he mojang steve from minecraft 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.099
 wants to remove at the end again a 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.169
 small warning be careful of the white 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.730
 banner because you are still graphing 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.500
 a few small bugs and it has me 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.629
 do not produce these snapshot videos 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.040
 necessarily made simple start now 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.720
 but further information on twitter facebook 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
