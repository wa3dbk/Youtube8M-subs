00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:10.650
 might have shown how to fix a 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:13.440
 Hawaiian sandal usually Avaian 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.640
 may be nine times and not authorized in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.550
 fake it breaks here the highlight of funk 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 it breaks doing here is not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.869
 This one is breaking today, see you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.869
 here o 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 This one already broke, I'll show it to you. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.280
 You as if you still confess to having a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 slipper for a long time 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.390
 this task you will need 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.390
 Brake control 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:55.210
 a flat head screw 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:01:01.810
 let me have on the screw a screw 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:08.350
 boring head search superb with a tip 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:09.700
 a point and a tool of the respective 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.530
 screw 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.490
 I particularly prefer headaches. 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:21.100
 things and it stays easy double that I do not 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:28.119
 I'm with her, and now she's more like that. 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:31.390
 saying that we and close the slipper here 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.440
 broke a sharp blade 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.920
 You'll see the game at the beginning of the room. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:46.200
 but you will put here O pass 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.200
 blade and strip as if it were a cap 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.780
 take off the lid 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.080
 I'm just screwin 'to stay 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.080
 Appearing 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.770
 Let's put it here. 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.950
 how was he? 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.660
 with screw closes here or with the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.430
 screw 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.430
 I'm going to get some wine that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:31.300
 led screw thread here the first 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.820
 started with love to point the screw 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.820
 year in 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.810
 You do not have to make a hole because 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.810
 like rubber 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.440
 the screw itself will open its 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.440
 way 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.400
 now ends with the tool 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.489
 always being careful not to screw the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.489
 are going to come out that 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:15.450
 O 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:19.799
 the program now paste a tape 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:25.139
 double-sided glue here and the 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.389
 slipper is ready if it is here then it is 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.290
 That's it, folks, there's going to be Bahians. 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.290
 still for a long time
