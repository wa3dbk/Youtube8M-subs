00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.710
 Well, kids, we're here 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.720
 new video of black ops this time in a 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.100
 game of weapons game without a so 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.930
 let's see what it was doing for quite some time 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.730
 that we got one of these 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.379
 I have tried so I will look in 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.260
 sniper that is the way that I most 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.630
 like these games but there were 5 or 6 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.270
 people just playing then why not 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.250
 I found departure but good to try 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.289
 is that to see if I can upload any and 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.780
 shake costs also because it does 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.400
 enough time also that no 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.400
 I do not give cane to anyone 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.430
 let's change change change 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.480
 I do not hate the shotgun but I would say 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.480
 with the guns also 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:50.060
 to see what I've seen here here 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.060
 one 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.469
 here 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.120
 how well he had caught them 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.059
 had to leave the other from behind for 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.500
 see if I do not know myself very much about 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.530
 responsible in this game changes a 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.600
 little and they go crazy 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.450
 voucher voucher 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.640
 and be in this corner instead of there and 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.640
 amelio to see where they are 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.360
 and the other one is dead 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 in you or if there were two bursts left there with 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 the m16 are the ones that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 I always say that I have to come up with this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.370
 rifle something but I think he wants me not 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.910
 has gone up nothing I'm not very sure yes 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.060
 if it went up in the end what it did come 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.180
 man where you live 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.430
 that is, a plan 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.090
 It's worth to see if we can catch the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.420
 around here that leave everywhere that 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.420
 another can be 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.790
 and 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.880
 and if someone comes out here he can bring 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.880
 my iron also we go no 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.650
 anything goes 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.710
 take, come on, come on, come on, look, dude, yes, 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.110
 I was aiming a little bit a little 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.890
 before fuck it costs me it costs me with the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.700
 francs of this game 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.270
 I like to make myself do not eat 14 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 it went to the mouths that is always what 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.380
 The francs also cost me more, no no 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.950

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:38.500

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.620
 quickly removed this this god 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.910
 where are we going, come on, lad without aiming 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.700
 in something up to see if we are going 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.160
 out or what it takes to change this 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.150
 what, today 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.490
 counted little between payments of all 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:05.050
 voucher worth voucher there is another and another 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:08.060

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.380
 I'm also not very sure but good 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.510
 27 has been pretty cool always 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.300
 it costs me especially from the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.740
 frank bazookas I always mess and I 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.900
 they kill a lot of times but the past 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.760
 pretty fast so I do not expect anything 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.760
