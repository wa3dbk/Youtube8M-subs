00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
because of how many attempts it takes if

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.650

is<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> couple<00:01:38.880> collaterals<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.990> best

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
is a couple collaterals and your best

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
is a couple collaterals and your best
shooter<00:01:40.590> should<00:01:40.770> probably<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:42.270> four

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630

by<00:01:43.079> potting<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.740> tip<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.310> say<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.790> if

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
by potting a tip I would say is if
