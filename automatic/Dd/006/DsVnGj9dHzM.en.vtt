00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.010
 install on how to create fashions then i 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 actually shows on the one worm 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.349
 that you need in this tutorial 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.689
 next tutorial and if who will be in front 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.950
 various programs but I tell them 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.260
 angry then I'll explain immediately that 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.250
 I would like to start by quoting 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.040
 the first season with creator friends ie 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.440
 is a program to create your own way 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.260
 facts I'll explain how to do it too 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.430
 script went all the kirk blogs doing 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 all strings with the proper scripts i 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.879
 script I don't want to do it right away because 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.699
 I 'm not very good at it yet 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.199
 in fact made many mistakes and more 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.860
 that good to succeed at 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 explain 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.070
 so I decided to get this started 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.229
 heading with creator friends who are who 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.840
 I'm fine with it and so I would say museum 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.420
 immediately then the villetti deal vi 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.180
 bear the leak of the cin description e 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.380

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.480
 go down and download the most version 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.600
 updated for 1.6.4 or for 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.940
 other versions you want 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.780
 but I downloaded 6.4 because I 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.800
 I want to create fashions for 1.4 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:49.190

00:01:49.190 --> 00:02:04.460

 here and there you have it then you start it 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.860
 the second one starts 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.170
 and go immediately you won't have this 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.310
 network interface not the interface in 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.860
 where you have to install mmm 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.520
 creator to install it will put us 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.800
 really really made waste then 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.300

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.990
 the is near the m creator 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.870
 so once installed you have this 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.510
 interface here another to extract 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.570
 the creator who needs a program for 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.790
 do the textures I use pride punto rat 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:12.800
 because in my opinion it is intuitive and the most 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.630
 easy to use and it's also free then 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.750
 I leave you the downloading description 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:23.900
 true look here you can't use paint 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.850
 because pied normal practically postpones 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.040
 to throw the textures then lourousa spy 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:33.830
 normal though if you have the gip or photoshop 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.860
 go very well use those there if you are 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.570
 if you are able to use them or just coma 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.390
 that use point break then mute 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.660
 paint.net excuse me only the voice of 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.990
 shit but a very good cold one 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:52.280
 once downloaded paint.net we will also have 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:55.640
 the program to make textures then 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.360
