the most irritating thing about getting

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.700 
the most irritating thing about getting
older<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.350> several<00:00:25.560> different

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
older so there's several different

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.040 
older so there's several different
processes<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.580> find<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.210> happen<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.869> get

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
processes we find that happen as we get

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.050 
processes we find that happen as we get
older<00:00:28.380> cataracts<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.580> them<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
older cataracts are one of them that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.690 
older cataracts are one of them that
comes<00:00:30.359> from<00:00:30.810> too<00:00:31.800> many<00:00:31.920> oxygen<00:00:32.489> free<00:00:32.669> radicals

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
comes from too many oxygen free radicals

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.229 
comes from too many oxygen free radicals
and<00:00:33.329> also<00:00:33.920> sunlight<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.550> ultraviolet

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and also sunlight so the ultraviolet

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.819 
and also sunlight so the ultraviolet
light<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.630> something<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.350> damaging

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
light is something that can be damaging

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
light is something that can be damaging
to<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> lens<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.790> her<00:00:38.910> eyes<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to the lens of her eyes so that's what a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
to the lens of her eyes so that's what a
cataract<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.590> where<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.890> starts<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> opacifier

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
cataract is where it starts to opacifier

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
cataract is where it starts to opacifier
get<00:00:42.660> cloudy<00:00:42.960> from<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> damage<00:00:43.800> from<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
get cloudy from the damage from the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
get cloudy from the damage from the
oxygen<00:00:44.579> free<00:00:44.760> radicals<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.360> ultraviolet

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
oxygen free radicals and ultraviolet

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.889 
oxygen free radicals and ultraviolet
radiation<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.190> wearing<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.879> good<00:00:48.149> pair<00:00:48.600> of

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
radiation so wearing a good pair of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.619 
radiation so wearing a good pair of
sunglasses<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.980> helps<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.550> filter<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
sunglasses that helps to filter out the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.350 
sunglasses that helps to filter out the
UVA<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.170> UVB<00:00:52.350> rays<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.280> extremely<00:00:54.210> beneficial

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
UVA and UVB rays is extremely beneficial

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.340 
UVA and UVB rays is extremely beneficial
and<00:00:55.079> also<00:00:55.770> having<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> diet<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.579> high<00:00:56.789> in

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
and also having a diet that's high in

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.130 
and also having a diet that's high in
antioxidants<00:00:58.520> then<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.149> next<00:01:00.449> thing<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
antioxidants then the next thing is the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.479 
antioxidants then the next thing is the
problem<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.430> macular<00:01:02.940> degeneration<00:01:04.489> so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
problem with macular degeneration so

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
problem with macular degeneration so
macular<00:01:05.939> degeneration<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.170> number<00:01:07.680> one

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
macular degeneration is the number one

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880 
macular degeneration is the number one
cause<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.310> adult<00:01:08.939> onset<00:01:09.320> blindness<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
cause of adult onset blindness the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.370 
cause of adult onset blindness the
macula<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.390> center<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
macula is at the very center of the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
macula is at the very center of the
retina<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.189> back<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.760> where<00:01:14.909> we

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
retina in the back and that's where we

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.539 
retina in the back and that's where we
have<00:01:15.270> our<00:01:15.450> best<00:01:15.840> visual<00:01:16.530> acuity<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.460> our

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
have our best visual acuity and our

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700 
have our best visual acuity and our
color<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.140> happens<00:01:19.560> with

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
color there and so what happens with

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.039 
color there and so what happens with
macular<00:01:19.920> degeneration<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.810> just

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
macular degeneration is that it just

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
macular degeneration is that it just
starts<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.860> damaged<00:01:23.640> basically<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
starts to get damaged basically and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.840 
starts to get damaged basically and
degeneration<00:01:25.680> means<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.400> starting<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
degeneration means that it's starting to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
degeneration means that it's starting to
fall<00:01:27.270> apart<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.560> ways<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
fall apart but there are ways that you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
fall apart but there are ways that you
can<00:01:29.220> help<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.880> protect<00:01:30.119> against<00:01:31.110> getting

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
can help to protect against getting

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.940

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to come back to those in a second

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.399 
going to come back to those in a second
but<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> mean<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> optic<00:01:48.600> nerve<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
but I mean the optic nerve is is a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.080 
but I mean the optic nerve is is a
muscle<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.579> there<00:01:50.759> things<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
muscle right so are there things that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
muscle right so are there things that
the<00:01:51.240> nerve<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.110> nerve<00:01:52.290> well<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:52.680> are

wrong
that's<00:03:03.480> right<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.350> when<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:05.190> look

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
that's right so when you actually look

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.000 
that's right so when you actually look
at<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.060> back<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> retina<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.319> area<00:03:07.709> where

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
at the back of the retina the area where

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.520 
at the back of the retina the area where
the<00:03:08.100> macula<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:09.120> yellow<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.019> yellow

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the macula is is yellow so that yellow

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.420 
the macula is is yellow so that yellow
pigment<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.730> know<00:03:11.880> xanthines<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:13.430> lutein

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
pigment is you know xanthines in lutein

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.110 
pigment is you know xanthines in lutein
is<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.850> specific<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.110> know<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.950> their

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
is a specific you know and their

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.310 
is a specific you know and their
antioxidants<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.269> derivatives<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.930> vitamin

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
antioxidants and derivatives of vitamin

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.680 
antioxidants and derivatives of vitamin
A<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.579> can<00:03:20.760> take<00:03:20.940> them<00:03:21.120> as<00:03:21.239> supplements

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
A so you can take them as supplements

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.420 
A so you can take them as supplements
you'll<00:03:21.959> find<00:03:22.230> them<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.500> certain<00:03:22.829> foods<00:03:23.100> and

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
you'll find them in certain foods and

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.490 
you'll find them in certain foods and
sometimes<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:24.150> deceptive<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.260> suppose

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
sometimes it's deceptive I suppose

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.990 
sometimes it's deceptive I suppose
you're<00:03:25.650> gonna<00:03:25.709> tell<00:03:25.829> me<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.130> could<00:03:26.340> find<00:03:26.519> lutein

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
you're gonna tell me I could find lutein

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.610 
you're gonna tell me I could find lutein
and<00:03:27.030> something<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.870> well<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.380> close

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and something like that well it's close

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.890 
and something like that well it's close
actually<00:03:28.980> um<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.730> know<00:03:30.239> one<00:03:30.420> thing<00:03:30.630> where<00:03:30.810> you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
actually um you know one thing where you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.330 
actually um you know one thing where you
wouldn't<00:03:31.140> even<00:03:31.230> know<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:31.950> there<00:03:32.010> is

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
wouldn't even know that it's in there is

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.440 
wouldn't even know that it's in there is
in<00:03:32.579> kale<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> biggest<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:35.100> know

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
in kale it's one of the biggest you know

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.300 
in kale it's one of the biggest you know
repositories<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.500> lutein<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.799> don't<00:03:38.010> see

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
repositories of lutein but you don't see

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.150 
repositories of lutein but you don't see
it<00:03:38.430> because<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.180> deciduous<00:03:39.930> trees<00:03:40.350> you

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
it because just like deciduous trees you

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
it because just like deciduous trees you
know<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.430> are<00:03:41.519> green<00:03:41.760> during<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
know that are green during the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.490 
know that are green during the
summertime<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.810> don't<00:03:42.959> see<00:03:43.140> their<00:03:43.320> color

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
summertime you don't see their color

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500 
summertime you don't see their color
until<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.070> chlorophyll<00:03:44.579> goes<00:03:44.820> away<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.329> then

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
until the chlorophyll goes away and then

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.390 
until the chlorophyll goes away and then
it<00:03:45.600> expose<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.590> see<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:46.950> as<00:03:47.100> kale

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it expose it so you can see that as kale

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.280 
it expose it so you can see that as kale
starts<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.940> get<00:03:48.090> older<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.540> turns<00:03:48.750> yellow<00:03:48.989> so

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
starts to get older it turns yellow so

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.170 
starts to get older it turns yellow so
it's<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> very<00:03:49.620> high<00:03:49.799> source<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.280> lutein<00:03:50.609> but

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
it's a very high source of lutein but

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.460 
it's a very high source of lutein but
again<00:03:51.359> for<00:03:51.540> your<00:03:51.600> eye<00:03:51.660> health<00:03:52.109> it's<00:03:52.320> a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
again for your eye health it's a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.289 
again for your eye health it's a
actually<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> good<00:03:53.670> idea<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.090> take<00:03:54.269> a

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
actually a good idea to take a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.729 
actually a good idea to take a
supplement<00:03:54.570> because<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.200> hard<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.560> get

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
supplement because it's hard to get

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.340 
supplement because it's hard to get
enough<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.220> those<00:03:56.400> nutrients<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.840> there

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
enough of those nutrients in there

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.229

more benefit for the condition where we

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.810 
more benefit for the condition where we

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
lose our ability to accommodate so that

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.819 
lose our ability to accommodate so that
usually<00:04:15.150> hits<00:04:15.329> people<00:04:15.660> around<00:04:15.870> 40<00:04:16.380> some<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:16.709> us

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
usually hits people around 40 some of us

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.890 
usually hits people around 40 some of us
you<00:04:17.039> know<00:04:17.160> 50<00:04:17.519> or<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:17.940> but<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.600> know<00:04:18.690> where<00:04:18.810> you

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
you know 50 or so but you know where you

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.120 
you know 50 or so but you know where you
have<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.169> start<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.560> wear<00:04:19.739> reading<00:04:19.979> glasses

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
have to start to wear reading glasses

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.610 
have to start to wear reading glasses
and<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.000> there<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.450> been<00:04:21.620> ophthalmologists

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and so there have been ophthalmologists

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.050 
and so there have been ophthalmologists
or<00:04:22.680> optometrists<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:23.550> have<00:04:23.669> worked<00:04:23.880> on

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
or optometrists that have worked on

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.640 
or optometrists that have worked on
these<00:04:24.180> various<00:04:24.570> different<00:04:24.720> eye<00:04:25.020> exercises

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
these various different eye exercises

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.300 
these various different eye exercises
and<00:04:26.190> even<00:04:26.610> these<00:04:26.700> Blass

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
and even these Blass

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.800 
and even these Blass
that<00:04:27.580> have<00:04:27.730> little<00:04:28.000> pin<00:04:28.180> holes<00:04:28.480> in<00:04:28.720> them<00:04:28.870> that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
that have little pin holes in them that

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.850 
that have little pin holes in them that
that<00:04:31.810> one<00:04:32.760> those<00:04:33.760> actually<00:04:34.510> do<00:04:34.780> help<00:04:35.169> so<00:04:35.650> there

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
that one those actually do help so there

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.010 
that one those actually do help so there
is<00:04:35.980> some<00:04:36.250> benefit<00:04:36.610> from<00:04:36.760> using<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.270> exercises

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
is some benefit from using the exercises

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.050 
is some benefit from using the exercises
and<00:04:38.139> using<00:04:38.440> those<00:04:38.530> glasses<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.220> slowing<00:04:39.880> down

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
and using those glasses and slowing down

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.820 
and using those glasses and slowing down
the<00:04:40.389> natural<00:04:40.750> progress<00:04:41.139> that<00:04:41.320> we<00:04:41.410> get<00:04:41.620> and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
the natural progress that we get and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.950 
the natural progress that we get and
losing<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.250> ability<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:43.510> see<00:04:43.720> things

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
losing the ability to to see things

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.320 
losing the ability to to see things
close<00:04:44.260> up<00:04:44.290> okay<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:45.669> let's<00:04:45.850> just<00:04:45.910> review<00:04:46.180> a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
close up okay so let's just review a

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.370 
close up okay so let's just review a
couple<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.690> these<00:04:46.810> things<00:04:47.050> because<00:04:47.230> there's

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
couple of these things because there's

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.930 
couple of these things because there's
been<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.530> lot<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.800> information<00:04:48.490> here

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
been a lot of information here

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.850 
been a lot of information here
so<00:04:49.690> some<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.080> things<00:04:50.290> associated<00:04:50.620> with

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
so some of the things associated with

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.950 
so some of the things associated with
cardiovascular<00:04:51.580> disease<00:04:51.760> can<00:04:52.330> also<00:04:52.450> be

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
cardiovascular disease can also be

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.250 
cardiovascular disease can also be
problematic<00:04:53.260> for<00:04:53.710> our<00:04:53.860> health<00:04:54.220> like<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:55.260> larger

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
problematic for our health like a larger

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.650 
problematic for our health like a larger
a<00:04:56.290> rich<00:04:56.770> meat<00:04:57.070> diet<00:04:57.340> because<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.300> can<00:04:58.450> cause

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
a rich meat diet because that can cause

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.930 
a rich meat diet because that can cause
heart<00:04:59.410> problems<00:04:59.830> we<00:05:00.010> want<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.520> try<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.729> lower

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
heart problems we want to try to lower

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.780 
heart problems we want to try to lower
that<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.360> replace<00:05:01.660> that<00:05:01.690> with<00:05:01.930> plants<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:03.460> and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
that and replace that with plants so and

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.700 
that and replace that with plants so and
then<00:05:03.880> exercise<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.840> then<00:05:04.960> some<00:05:05.169> actual<00:05:05.560> eye

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
then exercise and then some actual eye

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.150 
then exercise and then some actual eye
exercises<00:05:06.580> can<00:05:06.760> be<00:05:06.820> useful<00:05:08.160> inserting

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
exercises can be useful inserting

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.860 
exercises can be useful inserting
