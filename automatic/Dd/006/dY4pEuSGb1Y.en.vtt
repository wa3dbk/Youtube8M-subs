after this you can draw a simple image

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.940 
after this you can draw a simple image
right<00:01:15.830> onto<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.400> fabric<00:01:16.880> or<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.530> could<00:01:18.710> place

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
right onto the fabric or you could place

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.520 
right onto the fabric or you could place
an<00:01:19.159> image<00:01:19.510> beneath<00:01:20.510> it<00:01:20.720> that<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.170> might<00:01:21.320> want
