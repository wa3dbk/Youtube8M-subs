 Evil is not always correct only out 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000

 asleep 8 hours we woke up with the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.449
 empty belly and we go to the more 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.010
 productive of the day without power and what 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.569
 let's do today is to take away the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 pretexts that there is no time and we are going to 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:50.069
 prepare a super full breakfast that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.199
 you can prepare the 55 minutes 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.420
 and then we ran and that's why 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.399
 we take nothing but exactly what we can 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.399
 do quick 5 minutes and you take it to the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.629
 car that we are going to do today we are going to 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.790
 make a recipe that is very very basic 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 basic but other's favorite 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.299
 customers urges so are the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.160
 turkey cups for this we need a 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.510
 little bit of turkey ham that 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.900
 we arrange like a cazuelita 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.510
 in a cup of coffee tea easy 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.240
 we broke an egg and we did it here 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.400
 in today the direct director is 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.810
 credited thus and what is it that 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.480
 let's do it is not that it does not give me time 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.310
 of cooking I do not know what this device looks at 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.660
 magical that I have around here do not tell me 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.350
 what are we going to do exactly as 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.630
 cupcake microwave or just a minute you 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.160
 we are going to give in maximum power and in that 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.270
 in that time that is cooking the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.230
 egg I say all the ovens of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.360
 microwaves are a little different 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.850
 then we can go milk when it thunders 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.260
 Perez is the normal ham and that we are going to 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.810
 do we will complement our 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.390
 protein in the day that is the egg and the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.479
 let's do in a mood and delicious 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.400
 banana strawberries almond milk and what 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.240
 let's have a little chia 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.240
 those omega 3 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.360
 then we are going to take very easy media 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.090
 cup of almond milk 0 dairy 0 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.500
 gluten has this banana recipe for the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.410
 potassium 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 to cramps exactly a little bit 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.190
 of frozen strawberries 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.260
 we take it out let's finish with this what 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 we can sweeten a little bit with stevia 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.490
 it's not sugar but it's also going to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.010
 Give a little bit of perfect sweetness and 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.170
 half a teaspoon of chia and what is it 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.630
 what does chia add fiber us 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.660
 add omega 3 fatty acids which is all 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.040
 this welfare that is giving us and of 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.040
 flown to the blender 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.130
 finally actions 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.500
 this liquefied and such a simple thing 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.290
 got to the house ourselves not 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.600
 we can 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.459
 because they do not know it exactly and that's what 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.610
 what we are looking for with this fit will not help 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.620
 people to be creative talking not 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.930
 means eating ugly which is the perception 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.030
 that everyone has I'm not on a diet and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.800
 then I am suffering the is not that of 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.870
 there we are in an error we are worth it I think 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.230
 that from the moment that we 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.470
 you say you are going to diet diet and we 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.750
 implies restriction this is not so diet 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.180
 It is simply a supplement for 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.890
 our good nutrition and that's what 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.680
 what we have to say and what took 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.239
 Exactly demanding, you can also 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.690
 Pour a little olive oil if 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.060
 you want and it's delicious here you have your 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.560

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.060
 avocado that will give you a lot of energy 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.120
 during this morning with your smoothie that 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.370
 already brings chia and attracts stevia and has tried 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.590

 microwave so easy that simple 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:26.690

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.910
 We're going with the empty stomach we're not 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.910
 in a bad mood because we no longer feel 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.800
 as weak neither the bud will know that 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.480
