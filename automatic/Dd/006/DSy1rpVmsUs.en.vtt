00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.930
 holidays the new year is traditionally ready for 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.300
 takes away a lot of time from housewives and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.340
 so in this regard, maybe a little 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 spoil the mood today we will 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.880
 raise hostess dispensation and find out 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 with what modern kitchen 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 appliances can ease New Year's Eve 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 New Year's Eve Fuss 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.510

 New Year's Eve to the New Year 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.990
 there is very little time left 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.010
 I would like to know from you here about what what 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.540
 help make life easier for housewives and 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.090
 to set the New Year's table with a minimum 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.399
 efforts that we will prepare today with 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.010
 using what devices well, in general, then 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.840
 many such devices which is easier there 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 of life 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.250
 housewives but today we will 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.140
 prepare charlotte charlotte we will 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.699
 cook with a pear for this to us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.719
 need helpers 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 mixer and multicooker, respectively 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.329
 ingredients are the main part of this 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.299
 cooking we need 3 eggs 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.540
 flour sugar and pears directly 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.880
 how much time we spend we spend 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.970
 u probably about along with 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.159
 cooking for half an hour but 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.830
 the main part as I understand multicooker 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.580
 will take over yes and go out half an hour 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.040
 enters already completely the process 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.270
 it's kneading and cooking us 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.299
 need 3 eggs 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.259
 sugar flour and pears sugar plan c 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.259
 somewhere around the glass 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.860
 so i'm pulling down sugar 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.410
 we start cookies flour we add 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.820
 somewhere in the eye so that we have dough 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.950
 did it get very liquid not 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.990
 not very thick and so understood that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.880
 the churning process is complete what remains 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.320
 make it left to add the main 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.530
 ingredient is pears well and so for a start 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.590
 I almost forgot we will grease the molds with butter 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.300
 in order for our hanks or pla to you 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 you will need oil and this is such 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.790
 silicone brush is very good for 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.430
 evenly lubricate the whole bowl and 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.680
 as I understand it, the slow cooker will help us 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.390
 in the pre-New Year rush not only 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.110

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.170

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.450

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.190

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.880
 the very same fish that is absolutely everything that 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.860

 such the most delicious can say so 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.160

 I may say so almost the same 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.600
 my task is only to 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.140
 take and put 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.510
 Well, we proceed first, we grind 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:55.080
 luber apples about 10 speed of this 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:58.200
 well enough for us 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.320

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.990
 800 watts of high power 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.300
 lets handle up to for example even 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.260
 apples torment from kozhurki that is she 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.890
 Lukado for example this is not to cut that 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.720
