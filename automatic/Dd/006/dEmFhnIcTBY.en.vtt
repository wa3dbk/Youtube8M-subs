00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.899
 differences between rugby and football 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.899
 American 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.510
 number of players around here soccer 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.110
 American we have 11 players and in the 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.349
 rugby these growing the rugby union or 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.259
 rugby to 15 or 15 players and the rum 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.710
 weasley that are interest of players in 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.680
 both there are reduced versions is the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 South American last night and in rugby is 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.640
 rugby seven like sad played 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 the 7th and the soccer nine in Spain number 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.559
 of substitutions in American football 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.769
 the athletes specialize in 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.199
 attack or in defense and it can happen that 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.059
 according to the end of a play they can 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.190
 change to the onces therefore the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 changes are unlimited in rugby 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.649
 the players are more versatile and the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.019
 number of changes yes that is limited 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.909
 the need to know how to defend 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.550
 attacking the playing field is very similar 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.769
 very similar simply 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.050
 the rugby field is longer and a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.050
 little bit wider not much 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.570
 as for the h 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.700
 the sticks and the crossbar is soccer 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.050
 American who has a little 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.990
 more separated in the distances the 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.650
 poles and the crossbar a little bit more more 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.790
 high 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.810
 he does it in the rugby field 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.050
 is on the same line back by 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 in front of the day of the ocean 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.359
 in the case of South America not the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.490
 each basket at each end of the field by 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.490
 behind the chat area regarding the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.500
 ball is usually American fire in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.299
 pointy legs at the ends and the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
 of rugby which is more cowardly by endo 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.549
 mean the basic one that looks simple 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.829
 seen the South American are the ones who 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.689
 helmet protections and rugby besides 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.840
 very good but the duration of the match 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.600
 it's also very different in rugby are 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.470
 two parts of 40 minutes plus the glen 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.380
 at the end of extra time as football 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.350
 and a total of 80 minutes in the game 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.010
 American are 4 parts of 15 minutes and 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.500
 in total they are 60 and they are 60 of game because 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 in football it's time 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.000
 stopped 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.450
 after a goal after an out of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.730
 game separates the rubino chronometer 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
 burst time running this 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.300
 also produces in the development of 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.270
 action 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.270
 in rugby everything is very continuous 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.670
 while American football is made 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.290
 a play ends they regroup and I can 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.630
 start are the short actions in the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.870
 american football rugby 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.940
 also in both cases in case of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.410
 tie there is an extension if another 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.570
 very important difference is that in the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.430
 Rugby can only be passed to the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.020
 sides or back never towards 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.480
 forward while football 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.610
 american so be it something you want 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.980
 if you can pass the ball to teammates 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.040
 that are ahead of you however 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.700
 in rugby in sport in which 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.350
 can kick and kick the ball the game 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.820
 American you can do that in 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.130
 certain very complete actions 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.340
 Finally, I'm going to tell you about the system 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.230
 score the american game there is a 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.450
 thing called the safety that is the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.610
 only way to score without having the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.010
 possession of the ball consists in retaining 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.040
 to the rival his own swimming area that 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.480
 he loses possession and the ball comes out 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 from your area 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.700
 it's worth two points you're down from the bottom 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.690
 American is worth 6 strike is the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:47.290
 equivalent in rugby is worth 5 in union 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.650
 and 4 in rugby after the touchdown 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.060
 strike 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.580
 there is one thing called the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.410
 extra performances of per change the 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.599
 name but basically this is 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.090
 when you sult and have to go through 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.489
 above the crossbar and between the poles 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.520
 more than two points in rugby the tone 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.280
 American depends 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.780
 there are situations in which the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.930
 score but for an explanation 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.980
 basic is enough I do not want hands anymore 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.410
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.209
 it became clear I subscribe that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.540
 share the video that you comment what 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.540
 you want
