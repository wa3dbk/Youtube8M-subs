00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.289
 stone 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.539
 old school player what has changed from the bottom and demand a lot 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.929
 finalist on bass and today compared to what it once was according to walter 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.099
 magnificent 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.099
 meanwhile you have to know what's more text 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.619
 here are the other two players 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.720
 I would say that the euro has changed 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.820
 yeah the figure of the athlete much more athletically prepared motorcycle - 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.840
 technically prepared because the poor words 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.690
 then of course as in all the others you have changed a certain way 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.190
 sport de 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.130
 so - summer team spirit once now basketball and therefore the gifts i'm 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.380
 a bit like in the award-winning nba a team game no no no I don't talk about this 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.370
 I speak my own as we live by 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.129
 remember how little complicity and certainly not sense that is 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.460
 of all the components that create a sporting season 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.949
 company team city video of certain poses via jolly print iodice maybe 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.929
 also due to the fact that the player is no longer a flag player like you 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:08.850
 who remain the same team for 10 15 years as you and rabona mountains 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.360
 if i believe i'm people do in these houses in a group in a 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.260
 player 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.290
 since he can see it at most if he is a missionary 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 and then maybe they change house happens if this is one of the reasons here 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.700
 are the new territory tools 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 a real basket and the great Italian basketball rings of the 90s story 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.020
 in the summer it is that one does not go back because it is already being built even if then 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.440
 as I said, you are impoverished as young as knowing that I say though 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.659
 it's very flat vertigo so it has its own bridges 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.530
 positive for the rest, I think some stage rules seemed thirty years ago 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.920
 they are worth today they can have in 30 years what I told you before surely 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.590
 nono a coldness 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.430
 relationships 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.230
 deer hidden behind the professionalism behind this word that makes you cool 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.460
 a bit of everything but the fact of returning to living the sea was much more felt 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.700
 a lot more intense trallallÃ  the sport activity I repeat between all the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.140
 components to pessano then this is something that they live in a manner 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.540
 particular magnificent walter would now have a chance to play mendes e 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.540
 magnificent walter I was twenty 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.689
 region between a job help committed - to seduce with work 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.689
 for you alphabetic time after abortion art 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.729
 specific hours badoo basket e 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.939
 lower it all with the v 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.139
 eee you so if a player a little from the old guard you could 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:39.490
 to identify the carmet world with the big boston for those in the nba 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.040
 message path will really be touched a right key 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.609
 lawn and I lived in the era in which 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.680
 in addition to the philadelphia sixers credits, if i do arise 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.069
 phenomenal where there was this rivalry between mediaset boston so 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.259
 server although I like it a few more days from the exit of the telecaster today 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:03.759
 place are growing scary these last games have team play 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.590
 very strong, of course, leaning on those three phenomena which are column a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.180
 right Milan team was not exceptional
