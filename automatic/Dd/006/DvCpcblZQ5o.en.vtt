00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:12.110
 Hello, my name is Jose 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.110
 You said the name Jose Vicente before 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.760
 of a question of how to know what has 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.370
 what to see but when I take proteins 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.740
 new 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.470
 I do not take as many hours as you do but I'm going 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.289
 much to the service be 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 yes good when you have white means 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 Sen finally when white lines 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 it simply means that you 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 metabolites that you have so much of 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 vitamins of waste substances then 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710
 your kidney is very clean surely 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.150
 works very well is the only thing there is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.530
 it happens that yes it is true that you have 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.430
 to keep in mind that living a lot 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.910
 water you have to be still in the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.290
 service 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.680
 and you have to learn to hold on 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.500
 quite this is true this is true 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.790
 but also to see me for example I for 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.950
 example I will also say to whom 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.629
 you take the issue of health sometimes I go 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.040
 example formerly anciently when 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.619
 competed he made the mistake of taking 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.270
 many genetic Ticos free 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.220
 artificial pharmacies that are the ones 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.900
 they are used for people who have 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.260
 high blood pressure problems and 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.060
 so then that's what it presents to me 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.920
 bad thanks and being the championships 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.900
 quite flat and very tired not 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.360
 I enjoyed bodybuilding I had to 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.040
 learn to do other things 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.130
 way and me in the way of doing it without 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.270
 Take salt and drink plenty of water 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.100
 many criticize it but I also still 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.050
 I keep taking distilled water the note that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.910
 take diuretics in the end that yes taking 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.770
 my intake of potassium magnesium calcium 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.119
 colo colore important minerals that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.880
 I miss them because the water is no longer 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.710
 takes nothing and drags everything but with 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.119
 gastric protectors also but the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 we boil it, you have to boil it because 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.560
 Spain is not from Zioni, that is, it is not 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.030
 hygienic is not for human consumption in 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.800
 other countries and for example people what 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.120
 criticism in the usa coma see markets 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.370
 what is water 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.530
 but mineralized but they sell it as 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.180
 human consumption says not the American what 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
 they take it like I'm not seen with what 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.390
 they take this they go to the water there 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.720
 because they do not trust here but they want 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.100
 say the subject is in that water what 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.470
 you promotions is a cleaning by 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.840
 brutal inside 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.700
 yes it is true that when one was more 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.310
 Of course he says I'm wrong it's not like you're going 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.990
 well when you have white me is that you go very 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.610
 well because if you do not have the substance of 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.260
 debris come out fast then you take 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.880
 a polyvitamin and you're going to look at 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.440
 it will come out a yellow it looks a lot of water 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.060
 and also when you leave a lot of water out 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.860
 for a while you get white if you're 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.310
 throwing out all the substances of 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.940
 scrap 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.300
 and taking salt from me does not benefit me at all 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.400
 that I say for example when I talk about 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.530
 that for example a person who eats 68 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.780
 times a day and eat only eat chicken 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.099
 fish and let's look at the tables 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.989
 nutritional what a breast carries 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.950
 chicken 100 grams of chicken breast 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.310
 It can take us about 110 milligrams 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.480
 of sodium if you multiply 200 per take 8 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.060
 times a day that what you eat a 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.380
 bodybuilder on the middle level we are 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.150
 taking more than one gram of sodium per day 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.340
 so for having I do not know any 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.069
 animal 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:13.680
 I do not know any animal food 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.680
 that the iguana 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.959
 Y 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.999
 it has been seen some animal has been 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.370
 has seen has been seen in but has not been 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.290
 seen in droughts or seasons where 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.329
 are poorly hydrated or dry by 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.310
 example, but when the 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.530
 long when they dry the rivers that go 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.450
 to hours to a series of stones that were going 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.370
 sucking that yes it has been seen but when 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.969
 but you look at seasons always 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.950
 of drying dehydration that there is not 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.109
 water to consume then as it is a 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.989
 little the same down the road is something else 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.260
 - another good thing but that I say the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.549
 the one human being in ancient times 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.230
 antiquity before civilization not 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.230
 I think he was getting know salt 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.870
 Well it's the same but you can take it 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.409
 say that if we want to take it we can 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.480
 take now either water intake 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.650
 nothing happens to see what happens that clear 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.859
 everything depends on the level of fat that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.150
 let's have a low-carbohydrate diet 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.879
 taking salt while having a lot of fat 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.950
 accumulated old this I already say it by 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.440
 experience costs more to clean it 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.040
 if you take away the salt with which the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.019
 Water 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.520
 this flower disappears it seems like the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.410
 draining of all the fat seems to be 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.600
 faster and it seems like the person 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.190
 improving the better you also have more 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.200
 soft and delays the loss of 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.290
 fat with a person that is already dry 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.670
 almost as good shove salt until I 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.170
 for example now gone to eat and tucked 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.510
 in the Chinese I have put has given to the ass of 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.400
 salt because that was salad and ximo ya 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.320
 that only the legs have been 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.630
 legs of veins but full of things 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.210
 disgusting because we speak called lotus 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.800
 body temper increases also but 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.770
 that's why the change is reason what 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.599
 we say for example 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.160
 at the end or obviously you have it 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.270
 what to remove and say if you can sunbathe 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.490
 but when it's not going to compete it's the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.550
 they have to remove that then you can 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.720
 add what to say when you remove the water 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.400
 Finally, for example, I usually do 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.380
 or the loads I take them from the lake I put the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.830
 salt in the food 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.480
 without water then what happens is that the 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.980
 salt takes the place of potassium and over 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.010
 on top you increase the thickness of the 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.860
 veins does what is the theory of the 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.270
 super osmotic compensation this is click 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.890
 in a program 10 minutes talking the 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.570
 theory the super conversation do not make me 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.090
 repeat what I said because I studied it 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.650
 I studied it from 3 or 4 sources of 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.870
 study of these from people who were from 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.120
 bus and I learned a lot that went well 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.500
 I do not remember but there is one thing that says 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.470
 there is something called theory the 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.940
 osmotic sensation that justifies in 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.040
 dominated changes the reasons that the 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.060
 assault to take the place of potassium and 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.440
 do a water retention 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.030
 intramuscular which is what really 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.030
 look when you load with sodium 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.650
 and not 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.889
 no no
