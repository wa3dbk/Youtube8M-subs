00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
 for sustainable development that's where the planet simply and that's 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.510
 respect also we give a sign 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.689
 if the unpud 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.389
 something that seems 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.639
 today a little more fundamental the theme this year was gone what 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.440
 has had behavioral and communication efforts 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.070
 in terms of two gastronomy or a logic of what I suck 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.390
 mallied in my universe it's an important thing this time to settle down 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.470
 in the Rhone Valley in the southern part of the pole side in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.179
 Iraq facing Chateauneuf du Pape 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.339
 and this phenomenon has occurred 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.489
 all in organic and biodynamic agriculture 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.670
 so with a desire to use only natural products 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.630
 to use forces and energies and especially disaster 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.000
 beyond earth to be able to produce better 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.640
 more simply with perhaps more those of human investment but in 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.830
 any case much happier lasting in any case in terms of 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.620
 environment 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 of ecological approach in the biodynamic approach we try 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.870
 to anticipate problems we avoid them years sarko implements elements 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.440
 who will protect the vine those who will protect the skyscraper protect the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.290
 do and who will protect the wood of the vine and so on 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.469
 the good behavior of the elements of fertilization of the key elements 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.969
 the reason stylist to promote impoundment and maturity 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:16.140
 the cow dung student that we're going to m energized buried it was a 

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:19.029
 then divided into micrograms in his opinion not being able to 

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:23.019
 foster root development will accept as to sufferings for 100 

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.569
 m it is still the only element of conservation today as at the level 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:26.360
 belly 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.830
 our authorities designate all this is a real danger to the taste of August 20 and 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.510
 by its conservation by cons use at least two names of the authorized d2 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.520
 by the standards of the French who are competent knew that standards 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 Europeans that's what we do it's a very very little collective 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.780
 as a student sick in the axÃ© seine no I think it's cooked 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 today to use because it's not frankly other things that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.080
 ensure good conservation and group accuracy 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.350
 the sustainable approach is not limited just the simple production of grapes or 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.380
 to make wine 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.130
 it is also the fact of finding perhaps rejected more lightened for 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.740
 minimize the power and therefore the cost of transport if using them 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.399
 labels always cartons from recycled paper so as to 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.480
 not able to% eurofirst wither the forests that it was rare to use 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.130
 also symposia 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.330
 they are only but as soon as the dory feed to its visitors there is 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.420
 a whole process that who actually does that we will be able to 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.620
 to extend in his actions 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.709
 multiple 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.099
 the sustainable approach is difficult because there is some 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.980
 understanding of the people here is a little disappointing what are people who 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.769
 do particular things to it that's good finally because what 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.569
 is important also it is that it is good to film them 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.589
 so I'm trying to demonstrate that sebta from the cre first 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.709
 viable economic level 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.829
 e valuing in terms of approach 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.269
 and thirdly it has great tasting locarno which makes the least of 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.680
 things that's the guarantee that we must also bring people cleanliness of 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.499
 the picture of james dio 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.299
 we will play with aromatic drifts and wines that are consumed 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.079
 with this rage believe that we must distinguish between actually% of 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.809
 wines that maybe I would have done well 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.290
 an approach that takes a m agri approach 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.930
 as the departure of agriculture banks and after with a respect of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.279
 fairly precise rules 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.589
 so respect the environment all that is the winemaking process 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.589
 side of the one hour soundtrack
