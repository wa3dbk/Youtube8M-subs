00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.769
 hello everyone today I'm going to talk about these 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.349
 little plants that I have here that are two lime 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:11.290
 wide is and they are a super hard plant 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:14.080
 and very easy to have at home with this is 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.940
 the look so beautiful that I can 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.710
 tell of her good because it is a plant 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.140
 that belongs to the family of 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.689
 clauses that is the cactus without 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.060
 spikes as I call it because you see that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.420
 has some very hard leaves are 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.890
 and quite fat you are worth and to know 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.050
 that we can already get an idea of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.510
 how to take care of them 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.960
 especially you have to be careful with the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.610
 excess watering to be a large plant 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.090
 because he does not like the excess of 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.800
 watering ojito with that needs moisture 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.840
 but you do not have to spray it and what 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.610
 we do in these cases then in the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.620
 little dish we put some pebbles 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.120
 little stones and we cover it a little 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.309
 water and that adds to the humidity that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.019
 you need this plant this plant the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.149
 we can find in many colors here 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.350
 I have a pink and a red one but also 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.420
 there is white yellow the orange and 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.290
 different shades of pink is there are many 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.750
 varieties of the caranchos is 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.120
 this plant can be paid every 10 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.240
 15 days especially when it is in 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.210
 flowering to give it more more strength than 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.650
 temperature needs this plant because the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.380
 wide lime of truth that does not resist 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.120
 very well the cold so it's better than 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.490
 we have inside the house or if we have it 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.070
 outside in a place that does not suffer frost 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.840
 ok if we have it inside the house that 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.540
 give good light that you have 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.360
 well of light and if it were better 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.950
 have it in the semi shade a little bit 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.640
 because we can burn the leaves 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.860
 when the sun shines in summer 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.890
 directly and you see that they are 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.110
 very easy steps to have facilitated 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.780
 this plant there are times that after 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.270
 buy it like this is flowered like how 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.700
 it is because we are saying that they are 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.369
 forced to be precious there are 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.780
 Sometimes it does not bloom again but 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.400
 why do not you worry because we are 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.280
 there is a plant with a green blanket 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.590
 pretty pretty and then there are sometimes 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.459
 it comes back to bloom so why 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.290
 Do not leave flower again do not throw it away 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.230
 how can we reproduce it 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.810
 in the spring it is super easy even 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.030
 the branches are going to see that you get the root 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.379
 and you are by seeds and it is with more 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.409
 complicated so I recommend that you 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.909
 done through cuttings and little else you 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.400
 I remember as always that you have 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.560
 layout my facebook page so much 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.230

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.530

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.859
