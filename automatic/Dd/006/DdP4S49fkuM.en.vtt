all about composition in photography now

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.660 
all about composition in photography now
i'm<00:00:07.379> still<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> student<00:00:07.830> myself<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.400> i'm<00:00:08.490> still

learning and i'm still trying to figure

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.660 
learning and i'm still trying to figure
things<00:00:09.990> out<00:00:10.139> for<00:00:10.290> myself<00:00:10.349> but<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.190> lot<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.490> you

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
things out for myself but a lot of you

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.120 
things out for myself but a lot of you
guys<00:00:11.700> have<00:00:12.000> asked<00:00:12.300> me<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:13.230> share<00:00:13.769> some<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
guys have asked me to share some of the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.680 
guys have asked me to share some of the
things<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:14.849> about<00:00:15.240> when<00:00:15.540> I'm

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
things that I think about when I'm

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.210 
things that I think about when I'm
composing<00:00:16.199> an<00:00:16.440> image<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.770> when<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:17.010> creating

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
composing an image and when I'm creating

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980 
composing an image and when I'm creating
an<00:00:17.460> image<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.090> thought<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.750> would<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
an image so I thought it would be a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.689 
an image so I thought it would be a
great<00:00:19.199> opportunity<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:20.100> create<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.640> new

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
great opportunity to create this new

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.519 
great opportunity to create this new
series<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.750> really<00:00:21.990> break<00:00:22.140> down<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
series to really break down the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.990 
series to really break down the
different<00:00:22.859> compositional<00:00:23.460> rules<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
different compositional rules and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
different compositional rules and
compositional<00:00:24.720> guidelines<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.500> may<00:00:25.680> or

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
compositional guidelines that you may or

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
compositional guidelines that you may or
may<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.310> already<00:00:26.640> heard<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.000> talk<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
may not have already heard of talk a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.210 
may not have already heard of talk a
little<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.050> about<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.160> how

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
little bit about what they do and how

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.609 
little bit about what they do and how
they<00:00:30.029> actually<00:00:30.390> work<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.320> make

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
they actually work and how they make

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
they actually work and how they make
your<00:00:31.769> image<00:00:32.009> better<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.090> more<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
your image better because the more you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.729 
your image better because the more you
know<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.570> more<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.200> make<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> conscious

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
know the more you can make a conscious

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.590 
know the more you can make a conscious
decision<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.520> whether<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.360> rule

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
decision on whether or not that rule

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.229 
decision on whether or not that rule
actually<00:00:36.840> benefits<00:00:37.590> your<00:00:38.219> images<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:38.790> whether

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
actually benefits your images or whether

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.340 
actually benefits your images or whether
or<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.870> pass<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
or not you can just pass on that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
or not you can just pass on that
specific<00:00:40.860> guideline<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.390> stick<00:00:42.570> to

this<00:00:49.260> being<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.559> introductory<00:00:49.950> episode<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this being an introductory episode I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.069 
this being an introductory episode I
thought<00:00:50.670> I'd<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> talk<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
thought I'd take the time to talk a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.029 
thought I'd take the time to talk a
little<00:00:52.289> bit<00:00:52.469> about<00:00:52.620> where<00:00:52.890> these

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
little bit about where these

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.340 
little bit about where these
compositional<00:00:53.969> rules<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.390> guidelines<00:00:54.510> came

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
compositional rules and guidelines came

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
compositional rules and guidelines came
from<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.860> lot<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.280> people<00:00:56.489> think<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.789> these

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
from a lot of people think that these

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.610 
from a lot of people think that these
computational<00:00:57.719> rules<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.199> guidelines<00:00:58.289> were

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
computational rules and guidelines were

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.020 
computational rules and guidelines were
just<00:00:58.800> created<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.280> someone<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.879> then

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just created by someone and then

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.590 
just created by someone and then
followed<00:01:01.219> their<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> truth<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
followed their on but the truth is that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
followed their on but the truth is that
these<00:01:03.930> guidelines<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.680> these<00:01:04.830> rules<00:01:05.100> came

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
these guidelines and these rules came

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
these guidelines and these rules came
about<00:01:05.700> through<00:01:06.150> years<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.689> years<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
about through years and years of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.590 
about through years and years of
studying<00:01:08.070> works<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.850> through<00:01:09.150> analyzing

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
studying works and through analyzing

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
studying works and through analyzing
works<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.229> look<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.040> patterns<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.970> what

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
works and look for patterns to see what

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240 
works and look for patterns to see what
was<00:01:12.689> appealing<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> human<00:01:13.860> eye<00:01:13.950> what

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
was appealing to the human eye what

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
was appealing to the human eye what
worked<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> human<00:01:15.119> eye<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:16.229> looked

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
worked for the human eye and what looked

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.679 
worked for the human eye and what looked
good<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.770> these<00:01:17.549> didn't<00:01:17.880> come<00:01:17.970> before<00:01:18.479> works

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
good so these didn't come before works

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
good so these didn't come before works
were<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.200> created<00:01:19.320> these<00:01:19.979> came<00:01:20.280> from

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
were actually created these came from

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
were actually created these came from
analyzing<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.689> good<00:01:22.049> works<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.650> bad

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
analyzing these good works and these bad

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.999 
analyzing these good works and these bad
works<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.400> finding<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.360> different

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
works and finding the different

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.080 
works and finding the different
similarities<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> different<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
similarities and different the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.460 
similarities and different the
differences<00:01:27.570> between<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.170> works<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
differences between the good works in

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
differences between the good works in
the<00:01:28.530> bad<00:01:28.680> works<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.390> then<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> rules<00:01:30.720> were

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the bad works and then the rules were

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.740 
the bad works and then the rules were
created<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.470> when<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.759> how<00:01:33.150> much

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
created so when you think about how much

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.649 
created so when you think about how much
time<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> effort<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.670> put<00:01:35.790> into<00:01:35.970> figuring

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
time and effort was put into figuring

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.840 
time and effort was put into figuring
out<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.990> works<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.439> think<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.579> only

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
out what works I think that it only

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.640 
out what works I think that it only
makes<00:01:39.150> sense<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.960> advantage<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
makes sense to take advantage of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.889 
makes sense to take advantage of
everything<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:42.180> people<00:01:42.390> who<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.720> come

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
everything that the people who have come

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.590 
everything that the people who have come
before<00:01:42.960> us<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.920> studied<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.970> figured<00:01:45.479> out

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
before us have studied and figured out

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.289 
before us have studied and figured out
in<00:01:45.899> order<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.649> our<00:01:46.860> work<00:01:47.159> better<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.729> my

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
in order to make our work better so my

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.670 
in order to make our work better so my
whole<00:01:48.570> take<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.899> learning<00:01:49.470> these

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
whole take on learning these

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
whole take on learning these
compositional<00:01:50.399> rules<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> compositional

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
compositional rules and compositional

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
compositional rules and compositional
guidelines<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.560> absorb<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.189> much<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> as

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
guidelines is to absorb as much of it as

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.020 
guidelines is to absorb as much of it as
you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.590> about

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
you can because the more you know about

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
you can because the more you know about
did<00:01:57.030> these<00:01:57.210> different<00:01:57.570> rules<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.049> these

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
did these different rules and these

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.899 
did these different rules and these
different<00:01:59.009> guidelines<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> can

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
different guidelines the more you can

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
different guidelines the more you can
make<00:02:00.060> conscious<00:02:00.479> decisions<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:01.200> different

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
make conscious decisions on different

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
make conscious decisions on different
things<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.430> composition<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.600> not

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
things in your composition because not

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.569 
things in your composition because not
all<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.619> these<00:02:04.740> rules<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.369> guidelines

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
all of these rules and these guidelines

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.359 
all of these rules and these guidelines
work<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.329> every<00:02:06.600> single<00:02:06.899> image<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:08.250> you

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
work for every single image but when you

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.880 
work for every single image but when you
know<00:02:08.550> how<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:08.940> work<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.770> use

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
know how they work you know when to use

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.199 
know how they work you know when to use
them<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> use<00:02:11.819> them<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
them and when not to use them and I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.700 
them and when not to use them and I
think<00:02:12.480> that's<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> most<00:02:12.930> important<00:02:13.440> part

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
think that's the most important part

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
think that's the most important part
now<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> lot<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.550> people<00:02:14.850> ask<00:02:15.000> me<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.450> just

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
now a lot of people ask me if I just

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.600 
now a lot of people ask me if I just
shoot<00:02:15.810> by<00:02:15.960> instincts<00:02:16.530> or<00:02:16.620> whether<00:02:17.160> or<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
shoot by instincts or whether or not I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.190 
shoot by instincts or whether or not I
use<00:02:17.880> these<00:02:18.060> compositional<00:02:18.720> rules<00:02:18.960> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
use these compositional rules and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.460 
use these compositional rules and
compositional<00:02:19.710> guidelines<00:02:21.350> whenever<00:02:22.350> I'm

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
compositional guidelines whenever I'm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.710 
compositional guidelines whenever I'm
taking<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.860> photo<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.060> usually<00:02:24.360> tell<00:02:24.540> them

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
taking a photo and I usually tell them

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.380 
taking a photo and I usually tell them
that<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:24.960> shooting<00:02:25.230> by<00:02:25.380> instinct<00:02:25.980> but

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
that I'm shooting by instinct but

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.970 
that I'm shooting by instinct but
instinct<00:02:27.390> isn't<00:02:27.600> just<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.080> gut<00:02:28.350> feeling<00:02:28.380> or

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
instinct isn't just a gut feeling or

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.220 
instinct isn't just a gut feeling or
just<00:02:29.640> seeing<00:02:30.180> what<00:02:30.330> looks<00:02:30.570> good<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.990> it's

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
just seeing what looks good to you it's

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.930 
just seeing what looks good to you it's
more<00:02:31.500> than<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.710> it's<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.280> combination<00:02:32.580> of

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
more than that it's a combination of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.640 
more than that it's a combination of
that<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.200> everything<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.290> you've<00:02:34.440> learned

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
that and everything that you've learned

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.020 
that and everything that you've learned
from<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.160> past<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.640> when<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.790> talk<00:02:36.000> about

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
from in the past so when I talk about

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.870 
from in the past so when I talk about
instinct<00:02:36.780> I'm<00:02:36.990> talking<00:02:37.440> about<00:02:37.880> everything

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
instinct I'm talking about everything

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.280 
instinct I'm talking about everything
that<00:02:39.150> I've<00:02:39.240> learned<00:02:39.390> through<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> many<00:02:40.110> years

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
that I've learned through the many years

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.260 
that I've learned through the many years
that<00:02:40.410> I've<00:02:40.620> done<00:02:40.710> photography<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.520> done<00:02:42.060> art

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
that I've done photography and done art

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.700 
that I've done photography and done art
and<00:02:42.450> that's<00:02:42.570> another<00:02:42.840> part<00:02:43.170> about<00:02:43.410> learning

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
and that's another part about learning

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.890 
and that's another part about learning
all<00:02:43.950> these<00:02:44.160> things<00:02:44.430> once<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.270> learn<00:02:45.480> more<00:02:45.810> of

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
all these things once you learn more of

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.480 
all these things once you learn more of
them<00:02:46.050> they<00:02:46.350> get<00:02:46.470> ingrained<00:02:46.980> into<00:02:47.190> your<00:02:47.370> head

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
them they get ingrained into your head

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.950 
them they get ingrained into your head
and<00:02:47.640> they<00:02:47.760> come<00:02:47.940> out<00:02:48.060> naturally<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.690> sort<00:02:48.840> of

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
and they come out naturally it's sort of

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.990 
and they come out naturally it's sort of
like<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.110> basketball<00:02:49.590> player<00:02:49.910> practicing<00:02:50.910> his

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
like a basketball player practicing his

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.850 
like a basketball player practicing his
free-throw<00:02:51.450> when<00:02:52.020> he<00:02:52.140> actually<00:02:52.290> shoots<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
free-throw when he actually shoots the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.710 
free-throw when he actually shoots the
free<00:02:53.010> throw<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> game<00:02:53.460> he<00:02:54.330> doesn't<00:02:54.600> really

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
free throw in a game he doesn't really

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.480 
free throw in a game he doesn't really
think<00:02:54.840> about<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.350> too<00:02:55.470> much<00:02:55.500> he<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:55.980> does<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
think about it too much he just does it

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.340 
think about it too much he just does it
and<00:02:56.640> that's<00:02:57.240> through<00:02:57.510> years<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.900> years<00:02:58.080> of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
and that's through years and years of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.110 
and that's through years and years of
practicing<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.980> motion<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.880> applies

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
practicing the motion and it applies

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.300 
practicing the motion and it applies
with<00:03:00.360> basket<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:01.050> applies<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.740> photography

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
with basket it applies to my photography

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.340 
with basket it applies to my photography
as<00:03:02.430> well<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.270> more<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.480> study<00:03:03.780> things<00:03:04.170> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
as well the more you study things the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.500 
as well the more you study things the
more<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.770> come<00:03:04.950> naturally<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.970> when
