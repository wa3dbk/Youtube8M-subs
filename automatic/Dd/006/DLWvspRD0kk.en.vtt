 Havana 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.720
 the cattle trails came to cover all regions 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.519
 why livestock transhumance was necessary 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.039
 distinguishing four main 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.339
 the royal gorge of silver the royal gorge Leon 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.439
 the royal segovian gorge and the royal gorge of the jets 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.359
 precisely because of these encounters with the big predators so the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.380
 farmers since the beginning of the transhumant rhythm an animal that was 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 dif non-rival of the greatest of them the wolf 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.350
 thus they were eliminating flatly 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.810
 to all those who did not adapt to their needs for being too 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.230
 lazy 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.520
 do not resist long walks 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.060
 they abandon the flock 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.350
 attack him or be unable to defend them when necessary 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.729
 No rigorous selection 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.720
 mila that would be the wolf the most strict the true judge 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.720
 the Spanish mastiff was born 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.000
 the purpose of these dogs 9 to chase the wolf by stalking him 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 give him hunting 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 if not to protect the flock from its attacks 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.000
 these encounters despite what may seem was not very normal 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.509
 already veteran in these hauls the old mastina goes a little further to the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.000
 herd and us mastiffs 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.750
 tired and with many years as leader of the group has transferred his 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.680
 responsibilities to younger members 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.940
 staying her as matriarch and subject with more experience 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 it's more 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 the mastiffs 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.060
 the pastor himself is more attached to the merino group 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 hence they obey the orders relatively 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.840
 This is not only a reality known to the pastor 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.149
 but is reinforced by this one 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.199
 precisely so that the dog's attachment for his hut if it is deeper and 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.489
 strong 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.200
 on many occasions to sharpen precisely this attachment the pastor 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.120
 he mixes mastiffs with grazing dogs so that he gets an animal that he 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.359
 Believe better prepared for your work 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.580
 although with it 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.580
 I sacrificed some of his bravery 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.349
 This intimate union is also felt by the sheep 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.220
 that they will see in the canid not only a huge companion over their routine 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.169
 daily 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 but a calm and always present protector 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.719
 I will not win 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.169
 fair 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.969
 oo 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.809
 Certain moments of alert and some careers can not always be avoided
