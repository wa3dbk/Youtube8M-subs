00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
converted it this is not how I'd

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.370 
converted it this is not how I'd
recommend<00:03:33.540> converting<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.140> there<00:03:34.290> are

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
recommend converting it there are

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.990 
recommend converting it there are
changes<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.190> want<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.580> do<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.910> the

the injector return up to the inlet so

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.590 
the injector return up to the inlet so

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
I had to mount it here it worked out

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.420 
I had to mount it here it worked out
really<00:06:01.470> well<00:06:01.740> because<00:06:02.900> know<00:06:03.900> if<00:06:04.020> we<00:06:04.139> can<00:06:04.290> see<00:06:04.560> I

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.190 

feel<00:06:08.430> along<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.880> bottom<00:06:09.120> here<00:06:11.510> where<00:06:12.510> is

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
feel along the bottom here where is

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:31.910 
feel along the bottom here where is
everything's<00:06:13.710> bundled<00:06:14.220> in

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:50.339 

bullet<00:06:32.730> line<00:06:32.940> drops<00:06:33.330> across<00:06:33.920> for<00:06:34.920> the<00:06:34.950> return

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.850 

there<00:06:51.349> you<00:06:51.469> go

here they go damn shut down BAM back on

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.060 
here they go damn shut down BAM back on
diesel<00:07:06.820> you<00:07:07.210> didn't<00:07:07.450> notice<00:07:07.720> nothing<00:07:07.990> either

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
diesel you didn't notice nothing either

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.920 
diesel you didn't notice nothing either
what's<00:07:10.670> happening<00:07:11.150> now<00:07:11.270> though<00:07:11.540> is<00:07:11.780> the

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
what's happening now though is the

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.740 
what's happening now though is the
lights<00:07:12.200> not<00:07:12.500> off<00:07:12.740> because<00:07:13.610> the<00:07:13.880> return<00:07:14.240> is

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
lights not off because the return is

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.660 
lights not off because the return is
still<00:07:15.050> sending<00:07:15.320> to<00:07:15.560> the<00:07:15.650> vegetable<00:07:16.100> oil<00:07:16.190> tank

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670 
still sending to the vegetable oil tank

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.970 
still sending to the vegetable oil tank
and<00:07:17.210> allows<00:07:17.930> the<00:07:18.140> diesel<00:07:18.500> to<00:07:18.590> push<00:07:18.770> any

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
and allows the diesel to push any

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.730 
and allows the diesel to push any
vegetable<00:07:19.460> oil<00:07:19.580> in<00:07:19.790> the<00:07:19.880> engine<00:07:19.910> out<00:07:20.740> without

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
vegetable oil in the engine out without

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.190 
vegetable oil in the engine out without
pushing<00:07:22.310> it<00:07:22.400> back<00:07:22.580> to<00:07:22.760> the<00:07:22.850> diesel<00:07:23.270> tank<00:07:23.450> that

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
pushing it back to the diesel tank that

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.810 
pushing it back to the diesel tank that
way<00:07:24.380> it<00:07:24.500> wouldn't<00:07:24.740> coagulate<00:07:25.280> if<00:07:25.430> we<00:07:25.520> lived<00:07:25.730> in

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
way it wouldn't coagulate if we lived in

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.550 
way it wouldn't coagulate if we lived in
a<00:07:25.880> cold<00:07:26.090> climate<00:07:26.300> but<00:07:26.690> since<00:07:27.110> we<00:07:27.290> live<00:07:27.440> in

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 
a cold climate but since we live in

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.050 
a cold climate but since we live in
Florida<00:07:27.680> it<00:07:27.950> really<00:07:28.250> wouldn't<00:07:28.520> matter<00:07:28.640> so

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
Florida it really wouldn't matter so

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.140 
Florida it really wouldn't matter so
you'll<00:07:29.480> see<00:07:29.660> here<00:07:29.840> in<00:07:29.930> about<00:07:30.430> 15<00:07:31.430> seconds

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150 
you'll see here in about 15 seconds

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.090 
you'll see here in about 15 seconds
when<00:07:32.720> that<00:07:32.840> light<00:07:33.020> shuts<00:07:33.350> off<00:07:33.560> then<00:07:34.010> the

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.100 
when that light shuts off then the

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.920 
when that light shuts off then the
diesel<00:07:34.430> will<00:07:34.550> then<00:07:34.730> again<00:07:35.180> be<00:07:35.390> returning<00:07:35.840> the

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
diesel will then again be returning the

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.990 
diesel will then again be returning the
diesel<00:07:36.260> tank<00:07:36.530> just<00:07:37.100> like<00:07:37.190> normal<00:07:37.490> diesel

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
diesel tank just like normal diesel

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.350 
diesel tank just like normal diesel
we're<00:07:38.210> here<00:07:38.390> and<00:07:38.480> I'm<00:07:38.570> back<00:07:38.600> on<00:07:38.990> diesel<00:07:40.180> and<00:07:41.180> I

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 
we're here and I'm back on diesel and I

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.200 
we're here and I'm back on diesel and I
can<00:07:41.540> shut<00:07:41.690> the<00:07:41.780> charge<00:07:42.020> off
