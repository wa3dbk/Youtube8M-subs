around here so that's the shape I'm

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.780 
around here so that's the shape I'm
going<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.590> cut<00:02:10.830> this

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
going for you will cut this

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.000 
going for you will cut this
with<00:02:12.480> each<00:02:12.720> paper<00:02:13.110> rule<00:02:13.439> I<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.739> cut<00:02:13.980> them

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
with each paper rule I have cut them

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.500 
with each paper rule I have cut them
into<00:02:14.579> five<00:02:15.030> pieces<00:02:15.510> five<00:02:16.379> pieces<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.159> this

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
into five pieces five pieces like this

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.509 
into five pieces five pieces like this
so<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.200> these<00:02:19.560> are<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.769> pieces

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
so as you can see these are the pieces

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.600 
so as you can see these are the pieces
of<00:02:20.989> paper<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.319> tough<00:02:22.500> cut<00:02:22.829> and<00:02:23.069> I've

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
of paper in the tough cut and I've

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.380 
of paper in the tough cut and I've
painted<00:02:23.909> these<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.959> black<00:02:25.530> color<00:02:25.890> which<00:02:26.549> look

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
painted these in black color which look

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.339 
painted these in black color which look
like<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.939> so<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.269> transformation<00:02:30.750> so

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
like this so the transformation so

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.080 
like this so the transformation so
basically<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.040> color<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.489> whatever<00:02:32.730> you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
basically you can color it whatever you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.149 
basically you can color it whatever you
want<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.629> what<00:02:34.019> whatever<00:02:34.439> color<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:34.980> would

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
want to what whatever color you would

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.640 
want to what whatever color you would
like<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.579> color<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:37.019> gone<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
like to color it so I have gone for the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.119 
like to color it so I have gone for the
basic<00:02:38.189> black<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.930> what<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:39.959> am<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.620> I'm<00:02:40.769> doing

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
basic black and what I am what I'm doing

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.509 
basic black and what I am what I'm doing
is<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:41.640> attaching<00:02:42.150> all<00:02:42.629> all<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.379> pieces<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
is I'm attaching all all the pieces so

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.069 
is I'm attaching all all the pieces so
these<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> individual<00:02:45.599> pieces<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
these are the individual pieces that I

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.789 
these are the individual pieces that I
have<00:02:47.299> if<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.599> see<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.440> these<00:02:49.560> are<00:02:49.709> all

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
have if you can see so these are all

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.729 
have if you can see so these are all
individual<00:02:50.370> pieces<00:02:50.609> and<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.200> attached

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
individual pieces and I have attached

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.770 
individual pieces and I have attached
them<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.790> shapes<00:02:54.629> like<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.139> oops<00:02:55.379> that<00:02:55.739> broke

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
them in shapes like this oops that broke

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.440 
them in shapes like this oops that broke
so<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> have<00:02:58.079> attached<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.400> shapes<00:03:00.090> like

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
so I have attached them in shapes like

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.140 
so I have attached them in shapes like
this<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.180> that's<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.629> four<00:03:03.989> flower<00:03:04.889> four<00:03:05.760> petal

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
this so that's a four flower four petal

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.289 
this so that's a four flower four petal
flower<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.109> five<00:03:07.470> petal<00:03:07.889> flower

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
flower and this is a five petal flower

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.089 
flower and this is a five petal flower
so<00:03:09.299> these<00:03:09.629> are<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.930> shapes<00:03:10.200> I'm<00:03:10.439> going<00:03:10.829> for

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
so these are the shapes I'm going for

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.360 
so these are the shapes I'm going for
and<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:12.239> would<00:03:13.049> also<00:03:13.230> be<00:03:13.500> using<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.099> glue<00:03:14.340> stick

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
and you would also be using a glue stick

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.330 
and you would also be using a glue stick
to<00:03:14.849> attach<00:03:15.209> these<00:03:15.629> I'm<00:03:16.049> using<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.500> glue<00:03:16.799> gun<00:03:16.829> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
to attach these I'm using a glue gun I

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.509 
to attach these I'm using a glue gun I
found<00:03:18.000> glue<00:03:18.299> gun<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.720> much<00:03:19.049> much<00:03:19.440> easier<00:03:19.889> to

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
found glue gun to be much much easier to

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.479 
found glue gun to be much much easier to
work<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.389> takes<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.989> very<00:03:22.949> less<00:03:23.220> time

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
work with and it takes a very less time

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.479 
work with and it takes a very less time
to<00:03:23.669> dry<00:03:23.910> out<00:03:23.940> actually<00:03:24.319> so<00:03:25.319> stay<00:03:25.799> tuned<00:03:26.129> to<00:03:26.459> see

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
to dry out actually so stay tuned to see

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.970 
to dry out actually so stay tuned to see
how<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.000> bring<00:03:27.629> up<00:03:27.810> all<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.319> pieces<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.680> attach

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
how I bring up all the pieces and attach

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.309 
how I bring up all the pieces and attach
them<00:03:29.250> into<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> shape<00:03:29.909> thanks<00:03:32.989> okay<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.049> what
