00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.520
 what comes out of it if that's great 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.639
 nintendo 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.800
 gta and the pop culture of the 80s and 90s 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.990
 years together we know it 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.309
 not exactly accurate the rampage 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.900
 comes the result, however 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.270
 probably not moved to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.730
 this is the role of the player 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.769
 a little crook and drive run 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 and shoot us in good gta manner 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.359
 through the completely freely accessible 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.880
 city ​​boss tripolis and meet at the same time 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.380
 some familiar faces of the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.300
 Acting of over 60 missions 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.280
 We do not want a comprehensive campaign 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.110
 betrayed too much for this 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.750
 actually quite funny and much 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.850
 comes completely unexpected only so much around 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.149
 to indicate what you expect 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.219
 can 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.399
 already in the first mission we experience 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.079
 allusions to batman the ninja 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.649
 turtles frogger and back in the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.539
 future 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.820
 especially player a bit older 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.440
 Generations are likely to contribute to the story 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.440
 missions have their true joy 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 who shares one of the first two gta 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.690
 has been playing in retro city 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.030
 homepage and one 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.190
 little experience of nostalgia we experience 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.510
 Explore the city of Tripoli in the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.610
 bird's-eye view 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.200
 We can run to the streets 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.580
 and us some passing car 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.960
 grab or we just walk on foot 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.630
 By the way, that goes much faster 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.220
 a cup of coffee indus coffee machines 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.360
 are distributed throughout the city 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:43.460
 Just like supermarkets, weapons shops skate 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.619
 shops and the spray garage in which we 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.080
 as in the pace pace of the gta series 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.030
 repainting our cart and using weapons 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.330
 can equip against the corresponding 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.520
 Cash understands the dare around 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.960
 Paint is then useful if we have before 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.030
 the police have to escape 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.710
 exactly as known from gta namely increases 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.630
 our search level the more 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.910
 We commit crime and that happens 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.680
 by the way in the retro city homepage 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.660
 can hardly be prevented 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.690
 passers-by or over 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.760
 police cars together also in the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.740
 City is usually distributed to any 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.910
 far away places zeug to 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.920
 pick up around 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.349
 they can be weapons like pistols 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.940
 dynamite or a rocket launcher with those 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.849
 we defend ourselves against the state power 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.300
 set or we look for bonus 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.300
 then things like these packages 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.920
 are there still the headnote devices with 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.459
 which we the police completely without 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.349
 Expense in coming extremely practical 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.360
 But it's the most beautiful when we get up 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.030
 one of our forays through the city 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.470
 then find one of the many bonus levels 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.180
 For example, we hop in a pipe 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.349
 in the directly from super mario 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.569
 could come 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.430
 just to get some blocks in the underground 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.080
 destroy and so a flamethrower too 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.400
 Find 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.060
 or we suddenly find ourselves in such a way 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.890
 an underwater level again or us 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.870
 encounter a remote cave 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.790
 a guy who swears us and 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.050
 shield equips with which we then grass 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.360
 to change owners 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.810
 this is also known to us somewhere 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.900
 before all the allusion to 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.610
 all the classics of the feature film and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.310
 Tv story make retro city 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.290
 rampage will be out of that already 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.599
 mentioned mario pipes or left 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.360
 arming like here a trip on the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.000
 back of donkey kong a motorcycle that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.319
 looks like joschi or the doc 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.329
 back to the Future 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.299
 at every corner, the game spreads 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.859
 pure nostalgia 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.629
 our character can even be on opponents 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.650
 hop and turn it off 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.959
 much like mario or we lift ours 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.049
 just stand up and become them 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.909
 For example, it can absorb water 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.299
 We also garbage or explosive 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.250
 barrels 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.290
 So we save ammunition who do not want to 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.849
 has to pay attention to his ammunition and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.590
 just a bit of chaos 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.359
 he wants the story mode 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.200
 leave and the free roam mode 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.510
 select 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.819
 in it we have endless ammunition 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.560
 disposal of our vehicles does not work 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.750
 broken so fast and we have so much 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.180
 It does not guarantee us that money 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.230
 it's fast going out in this mode 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.730
 a children's game 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.680
 the highest level of search 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.329
 then reach back chips with 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.060
 machine guns and later even 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.620
 Panzer at the old gta is tricking 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.810
 just like that to grab one and 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.530
 Turning spit works also in 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.820
 retro city ​​homepage 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.139
 however, plague in retro city rampage 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.880
 also a few quirks 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.530
 for example, some are the story 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.030
 missions are great 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.099
 but again and again there are also right 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.260
 lama tasks to complete 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.750
 once there is a whole mission only 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.229
 from there to a place and back to 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.090
 drive 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.260
 another time we need a car too 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.530
 track foot 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.729
 after all, we run faster thanks to café 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.729
 still hardly boring 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.189
 on the graphic of riedrode the rampage 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.860
 divide the spirits 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:04.110
 logically the game is aware of the 8 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.849
 bit lung age games separated that 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.860
 does not change the fact that 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.110
 this optics especially on large 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.620
 nowadays eye cancer 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.199
 causes something similar applies to the sound 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.779
 no speech output always the same 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.469
 chiptuning doodle in the background 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.210
 sparse effects 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.909
 it's all pink 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.189
 nostalgia glasses certainly great though 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:29.039
 just far away from what 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:31.590
 possible is the control with the 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.509
 gamepad works for a perfectly 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.699
 a bit of getting used to it may take 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.710
 especially the vehicle control after a 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:43.620
 but two game hours, everything goes like 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:45.689
 one should think of oneself 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.770
 before buying retro city homepage in 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.409
 be clear 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.389
 the biggest motivational factor is not 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.370
 the game mechanics are but the 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.069
 many successful allusions 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.080
 Classics of the last decades 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.150
 certainly that gta principle also attacks 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.129
 here for a while in the end there are 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.960
 but not much to do 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.029
 The game world is really huge too 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.740
 not the exploration streep holds so 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:12.599
 Also not forever before that is retro 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.789
 city ​​rampage a nice detour 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.339
 back in time and one 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:19.349
 successful parody besides that 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:21.659
 it is enough to access without hesitation 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:25.370
 everyone else would rather dig gta again 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.370
 or does he take two out of the drawer?
