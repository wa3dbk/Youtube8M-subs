00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.400
 hello here is an old door of 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:15.190
 service that is slightly damaged on 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.999
 sees that she is dipping in addition the bottom is 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 completely dilapidated made him out 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:24.550
 more so we'll do it again 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.060
 so to do that I think the case 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.349
 in chain 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.539
 and then a box at home not really 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.880
 very dear I will make it in wood of 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.610
 Larch is a wood that does not need 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.410
 to be treated outside boards 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.530
 that I chose then it's cladding 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.070
 massive larch which is 22 mm 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.289
 thick and the principle it's going to be 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.899
 make a double thickness door to 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.420
 know we will cross will send exactly 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.460
 how does the wood to get so a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.170
 final door that will make 44 mm 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.730
 thick 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.109
 other particularity I wished to do 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.969
 a studded doors they make a 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.199
 little old doors even though the wood 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.449
 will not be old but old doors 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.860
 so I found on the internet some nails 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.580
 diquelou of mariners who are nails 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.410
 forget to hammered head as we work 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.270
 on cladding boards we will remove 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:22.030
 the end stage at the end of which we do not have 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 need for the door we will measure 90 100 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.200
 90 cm 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.690
 I finished cutting my boards in front of 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.310
 lens in 90 and so I started to 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.360
 to lay flat and already the pre assembled 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.480
 we will see how and then we 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.880
 will return to propose the second 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:55.860
 thickness the next step we're going 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 tighten through a probe the boards 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.310
 so that it stays well welded finally 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.620
 tight against each other 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.750
 and then I'll put some screws 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.190
 here and in bone the time to be able 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.190
 return the panel to finally move 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.310
 next step to remind you that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.680
 brings me must do without two wide 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.190
 so now I'm going to cut the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.560
 width 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.090
 now that everything is assembled before 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.270
 to continue that will be much more 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.270
 simple 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.060
 at first I go life that's 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.430
 so this piece that will serve as 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.110
 reinforcements in the middle of the door 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.360
 I 'm just meters from the iss for 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.209
 get it we fixed our big piece 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.470
 of wood at the top in the middle and works 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.519
 firstly for the moment they are fixed 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.110
 just a temporary way and 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.379
 now we will continue to 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.120
 dress up the second sentence of door 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.030
 so I cut pieces that make 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.310
 sense of the width of my door and I 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.849
 just go nested them 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.849
 in each other 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.860
 so add a little difficulty just 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.140
 to do something more 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.590
 aesthetic so we advise that the party 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.170
 high 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.780
 so I'm like that brought me in 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.599
 this meaning there the upper part of the door 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.099
 we will do a diagonal dressing 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.420
 who will be nicer then diagonal 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.720
 to the middle and 20 m in the other 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.040
 meaning 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.290
 my angle here must come exactly to 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.829
 the tip of 7 years ill so we go 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:44.370
 check with the rule against well placed 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:47.280
 with the carpenter cairns and then 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.079
 denounced it must be our tip here 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.230
 come dress up to the point here 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.690
 so same principle 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.280
 I put my carpenter gap and I 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:06.209
 trace so I know that my troop is going 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.970
 get to that point the other point 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.250
 who will give me the angle to fill 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.769
 low and where the boards 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:19.470
 will join here so the same I 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.979
 trace here which means that in this concept 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:31.380
 I'll have my angle of one traces 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:42.510
 this misses the pro this lake and ditto for 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:45.389
 the other year missy so reacted that's it then 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.360
 first panel so this one with my 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.639
 last piece that the game but we're going 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 slide this last piece back down 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.400
 so the panel against each other and after 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.380
 We'll see 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.910
 the next step that will be the highlight 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.590
 door page as I do a 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.750
 studded doors that means I'm going 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.599
 put a number so before 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.880
 of them to put them two things I'm going 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.479
 close very fine breakthrough to prevent the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.960
 wood bursts 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.700
 and above all I will measure and 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.960
 would allow here I started here I 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.690
 I'll do my features before I break 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.440
 to have a breakdown of costs 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.440
 harmonious 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.080
 I will show you the other side of the 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.780
 studded finished door for now you 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.270
 see that made the choice to take 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.759
 blows that goes beyond the other side of 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.470
 the door to really do like 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.780
 sent on request is strong at 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:55.660
 the old one so once we put 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:59.979
 our cloud like that we're just wrong 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.280
 to finalize this is the realization of which 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:06.190
 you see the boards laid in fir 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.720
 the bottom part the nails and he we 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.729
 will remain to fix in an upcoming video 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:17.190
 the scrap recover so on a 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.190
 old door abandoned to ask
