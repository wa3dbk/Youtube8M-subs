00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 that is, the number 3 will arrive, I'll call you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.220
 this new engine 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.970
 and still skeptical about this we have 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.259
 heated a racing engine 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.519
 operating temperature 88 90 degrees 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.060
 we have redeemed the engine o 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.980
 we will reach the meta bonci for oil 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.699
 engine oil additive engine 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.640
 we'll see if we'll notice measured difference 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.590
 mechanical line we first have 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 measured the horses at the crankshaft 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.290
 at the test bench we will put it now 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 this product and after a few 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.210
 kilometers on the track we will go 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.180
 again let's see what the mechanic says 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 you wanted to pay for the song that smashes 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.969
 the room and the romanese is split and if 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.539
 whoever pays China does not pay we pay 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:06.479
 we dinner on the counter we see that you go 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:07.979
 as out of power as what between them 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.220
 of 250 ml 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.439
 we have 35 rickys that you feel first 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.370
 the literature wants heating but 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.350
 now 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:26.520
 now gone 250ml sensor that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.910
 change several times now you can see 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.760
 that remains something for you traveler 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.320
 guarantee 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.410
 nothing for insurance like some 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.630
 look better because i want some 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.940
 Product no I do not want to put everything you 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.470
 remains in place for configuration 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.200
 when it hurts to make them we stay for 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.970
 tell you how much you remain with a story 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.710
 more for professional perceived role ok 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.350
 turn it back on again see if 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.540
 notice some difference in the noise 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.080
 we take care of the gasoline ce 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:18.510
 we have it I have to bring it in now 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:21.560
 there will be a bit of a story 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.560
 then we put gasoline 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:32.080
 I know we see later we add the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.780
 gasoline was placed in the tank of the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.560
 product let's see if we have 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.140
 differences 80 but had to temperatures 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.140
 making the engine temperature 84 degrees 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.350
 not help his charge 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.340
 this year how it went then 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.500
 this year it went like this and so we have 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.890
 done no customer rationing maybe 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.340
 none of you with disqualification 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.830
 we say of the first we are said second in 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.580
 race ranking 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.510
 then we add gasoline in a few 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.510
 words made me laugh 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.930
 the bet does not want money is not after 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:12.310
 going over turn after shooting people 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:15.810
 they are seen as perrotta as it's called 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.810
 yesterday the animals 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:26.699
 let's see this but find someone 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.699
 we put them in motion from the hands 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.539
 the first untreated vehicle was a thousand 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.539
 three hundred fifteen hundred remain 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.210
 Yes No 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.030
 for this reason 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.810
 hello here from sagittarius guys 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:20.450
 then we want to talk about this medium 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:23.630
 his tmax scooter abundant liver 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.340
 racing scooter as we see 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.040
 between we explain a moment how it is 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.540
 gone the day we have courier in 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.200
 workshop we have lawn to put the 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:37.290
 product made sometimes for the engine is 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.080
 already from Venice that you noticed that 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.430
 practically not having the product not 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.190
 it had more profit than it already was 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:49.590
 raising by 300 turns to modesty without 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:52.830
 touch and silent silence e 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.300
 even in exhaust gas before 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.060
 you can admire them easily 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.200
 breath forward with the airport 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.660
 offers 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.470
 Take machete we also applied 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.840
 the metal behind the gearbox 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.030
 where we don't say gears where 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.889
 they are the relationships and we have seen that there is 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.930
 a much more remarkable smoothness 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.659
 much more free we came today 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:19.030
 try everything we are to approve it in 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:21.460
 citterio square to the lyre of there are 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.069
 there were differences in the sense that the engine 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:28.240
 on the track he was much faster to climb 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:34.150
 of turns and it was a lot more we have a 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:38.340
 much rarer excellent acceleration 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.340
 product that above all functional
