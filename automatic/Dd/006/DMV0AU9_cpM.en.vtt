00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.149
 move and move to another planet 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:43.649
 since the crisis with resources brought to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.230
 of having to fly to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.460
 going to the shuttle which will deliver 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.719

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.030
 live let's collect the remaining resources 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:09.119
 I have already gathered a lot of things and all of mine 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.810
 belongings go with me i will go 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.060
 to the city and sit on the canoe i am one of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.280
 volunteers who decided to learn 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.450
 space 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.530
 to colonize new planets in order 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.520
 so that people can then settle there 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.930
 live well, that and if it's fair 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.590
 the spray just ends and we 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.479
 go to the new card like this 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.369
 that I don't see anything wrong with that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.140
 only interesting all your belongings 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.729
 collected 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.939
 for a long time went all straight collected 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.520
 almost even there all the boxes are all 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.520
 I got a little firm left 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.040
 so any trifle on the little things well house 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.970
 of course here I gathered all the resources 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.890
 practically but 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.079
 cotton I will not touch yes and this too 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.020
 as you see no farm nothing 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.030
 left because I collected everything in 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.329
 the lower world is true I have this 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.640
 the tank filled the words and had to stupidly 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.829
 to break it well, that is, 20,000 form 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.200
 eagle you just went nowhere but it 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.850
 nothing because all the resources we have 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.190
 will be over there in storage we 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.800
 will come along with them in the lower world I 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.890
 all gathered well, except of course platforms 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.140
 glass lanterns all the resources of course 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.430
 as you see here, too, I have nothing 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.140
 gathered here in this place is all 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.240
 all my resources are right here 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.160
 in the bar for kept all kinds of things 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.440
 which is not really needed but I am her too 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.850
 I will take the bed afterwards resources 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.260
 divided by some principles here 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.170
 we have greens and yes that is all alive here 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.100
 we have every kind of torch prepared 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.990
 here we have bees here we have crystals here 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.410
 full of all sorts of crystals that is all that 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.220
 I have all sorts of mechanisms here 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.810
 by the way I forgot to say will 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.510
 windmills at high altitude turns into 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.670
 generators the first time I noticed this here 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.820
 in short all my resource here that is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.610
 if i start when i'm done out 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.010
 playdo you can not write I'm a cheater I 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.740
 just move everything from this world to 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.860
 I have a new continuation here too 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.510
 have it all the same mechanisms you can 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.680
 look here I have every such 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.500
 I have a tripe here too 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.990
 have all my belongings and magical court 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.830
 seeds and all sorts of bushes from tinker 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.700
 construct 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.630
 and the remaining resources that are to me and 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.120
 other 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.150
 tripe is also well shorter than very valuable 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.800
 resources, too, they are stored here somewhere 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.410
 I had hard drives 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:55.670
 I remember where they are and I donâ€™t see something 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.670
 where are hard drives by the way 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 it's not funny anymore but they are shorter 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.439
 saying here are actually two of these hard 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.689
 I have one disk for stones 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.000
 ore is still sundry in large 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:15.599
 the quantity on the other also see that is 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.820
 two almost 1 almost filled and the second 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.650
 a little that is, there are all resources too 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.049
 are and also here having a system then 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.889
 I have everything I build 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.260
 collected it 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.930
 this house is empty as they say 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.340
 completely but not counting of course 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.820
 flashlights and other crap it Well 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.370
 that's all hope that there was a play was 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.139
 interesting come to us in new here 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.780
 spray which will by the way be called a 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.650
 there will also be no magic there too 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.789
 but basically there will be a bias on technology 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.699
 there as they say we will be 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.100
 evolve how to follow you in this 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.169
 play we prepared and set off 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.300
 can say for a new planet for a new 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.880
 I hope you like the new card 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.090
 format as i try to do 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.430
 flying play new pain a little role-playing 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.340

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.320
 principle as if we are new 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:16.110
 the planet though what you see will be 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.530
 It seems really a new planet Well 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.449
 I will not keep you waiting 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.990
