00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:31.810
 from these kits I took serve for 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:35.890

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.269

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:22.090
 done the male is upside down and the 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:25.479
 female the lower one goes over the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:30.580
 below and above would be the male 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:33.450

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:04.490
 this would be the head above and this 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:11.230
 it would be the under from the female since 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:19.240
