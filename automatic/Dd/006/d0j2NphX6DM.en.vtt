00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
let me do it for the first half of my

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.650 
let me do it for the first half of my
60-day<00:00:09.540> period<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:11.040> four<00:00:11.370> circuits<00:00:11.880> each

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
60-day period so it's four circuits each

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.140 
60-day period so it's four circuits each
containing<00:00:13.170> four<00:00:13.500> exercises<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.370> per

containing four exercises and per

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.000 
containing four exercises and per
circuit<00:00:15.420> you're<00:00:16.109> gonna<00:00:16.199> run<00:00:16.470> through<00:00:16.740> one

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
circuit you're gonna run through one

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.480 
circuit you're gonna run through one

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
circuit over and over three times and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.859 
circuit over and over three times and
give<00:00:20.490> about<00:00:20.699> thirty<00:00:21.029> Seconds<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> minute

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and thirty seconds in between each

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.689 
and thirty seconds in between each
circuit<00:00:24.720> round<00:00:25.039> after<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> finish<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.490> that

that's certain those three rounds on the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.689 
that's certain those three rounds on the
circuit<00:00:28.769> you're<00:00:28.890> gonna<00:00:29.010> move<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.580> next
