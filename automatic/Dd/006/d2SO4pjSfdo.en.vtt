00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
shed which is a good thing because lace
units<00:02:09.269> you<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.630> don't<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:10.049> it<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> shed

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
units you know you don't want it to shed

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.050 
units you know you don't want it to shed
too<00:02:10.709> much<00:02:10.860> because<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.430> bald<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
too much because then you go bald and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.130 
too much because then you go bald and
you<00:02:12.180> can't<00:02:12.360> use<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.750> anymore

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the way down here you see that

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.290 
the way down here you see that
it's<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.349> really<00:02:34.950> really<00:02:35.099> you<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.760> thinned

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
it's just really really you know thinned

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.630 
it's just really really you know thinned
out<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.530> couldn't<00:02:37.890> put<00:02:38.040> your<00:02:38.130> part<00:02:38.430> there

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
out you couldn't put your part there

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.270

because<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> desert<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:41.099> over

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
because the desert and that's all over

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.880 
because the desert and that's all over
the<00:02:41.520> head<00:02:41.819> other<00:02:42.599> than<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.170> front<00:02:43.560> portion

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the head other than the front portion

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.650 
the head other than the front portion
here<00:02:44.400> because<00:02:44.880> that's<00:02:45.030> where<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.480> usually

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
here because that's where you usually

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.000 
here because that's where you usually
would<00:02:45.989> part<00:02:46.319> your<00:02:46.440> hair<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.709> if<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.920> were

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
would part your hair but if you were

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.479 
would part your hair but if you were
shining<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.400> those<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.730> coral<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:50.250> all

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
shining like those in coral but like all

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.510 
shining like those in coral but like all
that<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.209> see<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.569> really<00:02:51.720> finished

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.449 

but<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.209> front<00:02:57.540> areas<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.650> does<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.220> tip

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
but in the front areas it does have tip

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.050 
but in the front areas it does have tip
parting<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.540> lace<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:02.060> better

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
parting and the lace is you know better

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.809 
parting and the lace is you know better
here<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:05.099> know<00:03:05.220> that's<00:03:05.459> just<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
here so you know that's just a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
difference I want to point out in the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
in Eddie its perfect texture doesn't

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.430 
in Eddie its perfect texture doesn't
have<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> smell<00:03:24.030> doesn't<00:03:24.330> tangle<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.260> it's

like<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.830> perfect<00:03:26.160> density<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.910> probably

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
like the perfect density I probably

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.699 
like the perfect density I probably
wouldn't<00:03:27.840> went<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.049> little<00:03:28.350> more<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.620> the

wouldn't went a little more with the
density<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.640> hundred<00:03:29.850> percent<00:03:30.060> density

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
density but the hundred percent density

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.350 
density but the hundred percent density
is<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.140> good<00:03:31.290> also<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:32.190> yeah<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.670> plus<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.330> my
