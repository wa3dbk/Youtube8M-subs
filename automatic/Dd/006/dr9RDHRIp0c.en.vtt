00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
and if you can then use it so yeah

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.040 
and if you can then use it so yeah
basically<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.560> happens<00:02:18.920> now<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:20.050> you're

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
basically what happens now is you're

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.290 
basically what happens now is you're
gonna<00:02:21.170> run<00:02:21.440> towards<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.070> screen<00:02:22.340> our<00:02:22.520> arrow

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
gonna run towards the screen our arrow

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.670 
gonna run towards the screen our arrow
on<00:02:23.630> your<00:02:23.660> mini-map<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:26.350> jump<00:02:27.350> over<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.620> wall

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
on your mini-map and jump over this wall

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.320 
on your mini-map and jump over this wall
I<00:02:28.130> think<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:28.550> like<00:02:30.580> 1111<00:02:31.580> agility<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.090> need

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
I think it's like 1111 agility you need

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.290 
I think it's like 1111 agility you need
something<00:02:32.720> quiet<00:02:32.930> anyway<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:34.820> keep<00:02:35.090> one<00:02:35.270> in

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
something quiet anyway just keep one in

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.650 
something quiet anyway just keep one in
this<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:37.280> annoying<00:02:37.550> part<00:02:37.790> about<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.300> is

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.479 

basically<00:02:41.660> getting<00:02:41.989> there<00:02:42.310> unless<00:02:43.310> you've

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
basically getting there unless you've

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.780 
basically getting there unless you've
got<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.700> high<00:02:43.989> agility<00:02:44.989> level<00:02:45.560> which<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.640> will

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
got a high agility level which I will

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.610 
got a high agility level which I will
let<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.030> know<00:02:47.060> which<00:02:47.390> what<00:02:48.050> level<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.410> you

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620

need<00:02:49.239> once<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.450> get<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.470> pipe<00:02:51.860> thing<00:02:52.160> what

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
need once I get to the pipe thing what

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.120 
need once I get to the pipe thing what
you<00:02:52.580> want<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.760> do<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:52.970> run<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:54.290> Northwest<00:02:54.980> of

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
you want to do is run the Northwest of

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.400 
you want to do is run the Northwest of
these<00:02:55.250> ladders<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.570> then<00:02:57.020> climb<00:02:57.290> down<00:02:57.530> them

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
these ladders and then climb down them

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.020 
these ladders and then climb down them
like<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:01.040> you've<00:03:01.220> got<00:03:01.340> enough<00:03:01.550> agility<00:03:01.970> you

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
like if you've got enough agility you

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.340 
like if you've got enough agility you
can<00:03:02.180> squeeze<00:03:02.450> through<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.750> pipe

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
can squeeze through this pipe

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.850 
can squeeze through this pipe
we<00:03:04.160> need<00:03:04.310> 70<00:03:04.730> agility<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.270> get<00:03:05.420> through<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:06.800> if

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
we need 70 agility to get through so if

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.010 
we need 70 agility to get through so if
you've<00:03:06.980> got<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.550> recommend<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.480> do<00:03:08.840> go

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
you've got it I recommend you do go

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.229 
you've got it I recommend you do go
through<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.350> way<00:03:09.530> if<00:03:10.430> not<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.850> have<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.060> run

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
through that way if not you have to run

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.350 
through that way if not you have to run
all<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.420> way<00:03:11.480> around<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:12.020> so<00:03:12.790> run<00:03:13.790> after<00:03:14.269> you

all the way around like so run after you
get<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.510> these<00:03:14.690> two<00:03:14.870> gates<00:03:17.049> it's<00:03:18.049> your<00:03:18.170> first

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
get to these two gates it's your first

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.560 
get to these two gates it's your first
time<00:03:18.530> through<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.890> gates<00:03:19.100> these<00:03:19.430> two<00:03:19.730> super

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
time through the gates these two super

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.360 
time through the gates these two super
bombers<00:03:20.930> will<00:03:21.110> attack<00:03:21.380> eeeh<00:03:21.620> but<00:03:22.250> they're

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
bombers will attack eeeh but they're

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.890 
bombers will attack eeeh but they're
only<00:03:22.430> level<00:03:22.760> 19<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:24.160> yeah<00:03:25.160> then<00:03:25.430> start<00:03:25.700> running

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
only level 19 so yeah then start running

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.840 
only level 19 so yeah then start running
east<00:03:29.350> until<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.620> get<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.459> bit<00:03:31.640> where<00:03:31.790> it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
east until you get to the bit where it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.550 
east until you get to the bit where it
splits<00:03:32.150> off<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.989> then<00:03:33.080> runs<00:03:33.320> south

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.920 

so<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.550> it's<00:03:40.000> gonna<00:03:40.120> take<00:03:40.390> forever<00:03:40.840> I

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
so this is it's gonna take forever I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.000 
so this is it's gonna take forever I
should<00:03:41.080> have<00:03:41.170> bought<00:03:41.319> so<00:03:41.440> many<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.709> your<00:03:41.800> pots

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.820 
and once that bit loads or but click on
this<00:04:00.430> bit<00:04:00.580> here<00:04:00.700> like<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:01.120> am<00:04:01.300> now<00:04:01.620> because<00:04:02.620> then

that<00:06:19.770> calculated<00:06:20.340> together<00:06:21.710> made<00:06:22.710> me<00:06:22.940> 318

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
that calculated together made me 318

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.100 
that calculated together made me 318
okay

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
okay

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.400 
okay
roughly<00:06:25.740> so<00:06:26.610> I'd<00:06:26.760> say<00:06:27.000> every<00:06:27.840> hour<00:06:27.960> you<00:06:28.200> make

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
roughly so I'd say every hour you make

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:35.450 
roughly so I'd say every hour you make
about<00:06:30.020> 252<00:06:31.490> maybe<00:06:32.900> 350<00:06:33.900> K<00:06:34.230> an<00:06:34.410> hour<00:06:34.530> depending

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
about 252 maybe 350 K an hour depending

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.560 
about 252 maybe 350 K an hour depending
on<00:06:35.850> like<00:06:36.440> how<00:06:37.490> what<00:06:38.490> like<00:06:38.700> strength<00:06:39.120> level<00:06:39.450> you

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
on like how what like strength level you

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.470 
on like how what like strength level you
are<00:06:39.720> and<00:06:40.020> all<00:06:40.170> that<00:06:40.200> and<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:41.670> faster<00:06:42.060> Calum

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
are and all that and the faster Calum

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.880 
are and all that and the faster Calum
obviously<00:06:43.080> the<00:06:43.200> molecule<00:06:43.530> should<00:06:43.710> get<00:06:43.800> an

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
obviously the molecule should get an

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.180 
obviously the molecule should get an
hour

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
hour

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.280 
hour
I<00:06:45.560> do<00:06:46.560> recommend<00:06:46.950> having<00:06:47.400> a<00:06:48.000> pretty<00:06:48.810> decent

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
I do recommend having a pretty decent

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.560 
I do recommend having a pretty decent
combat<00:06:49.650> level<00:06:49.770> to<00:06:50.070> fight<00:06:50.250> them<00:06:50.430> because<00:06:50.570> they

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
combat level to fight them because they

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.430 
combat level to fight them because they
do<00:06:51.630> take<00:06:51.960> quite<00:06:52.140> a<00:06:52.200> while<00:06:52.290> to<00:06:52.440> kill<00:06:52.970> some<00:06:53.970> and

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
do take quite a while to kill some and

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.780 
do take quite a while to kill some and
sometimes<00:06:55.440> you<00:06:55.770> can<00:06:55.950> just<00:06:56.130> hit<00:06:56.220> zeros<00:06:56.640> and

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790 
sometimes you can just hit zeros and

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.220 
sometimes you can just hit zeros and
zeros<00:06:57.290> gets<00:06:58.290> a<00:06:58.380> bit<00:06:58.500> annoying<00:06:58.770> but<00:07:00.230> obviously

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
zeros gets a bit annoying but obviously

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.830 
zeros gets a bit annoying but obviously
the<00:07:01.350> high<00:07:01.470> you<00:07:01.530> shrimp<00:07:02.070> an<00:07:02.370> attack<00:07:03.300> the<00:07:03.660> more
