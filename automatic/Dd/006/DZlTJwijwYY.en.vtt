I<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.420> transitioning<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:53.070> helped<00:01:53.369> me

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I was transitioning and really helped me

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.880 
I was transitioning and really helped me
detangle<00:01:53.939> my<00:01:54.060> hair<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:55.259> thing<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.680> stood

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
out is when I was transitioning I would

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.959 
out is when I was transitioning I would
section<00:01:58.799> my<00:01:58.950> hair<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> select<00:01:59.700> four

section my hair and select four

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389 
section my hair and select four
different<00:02:00.390> sections<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:00.960> head<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.399> work

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
different sections on my head and work

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.359 
different sections on my head and work
my<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.640> through<00:02:03.090> each<00:02:03.450> section<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.369> with

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
my way through each section and with

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.380 
my way through each section and with
this<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.360> was<00:02:06.990> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> pressed<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.039> time

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
this one I was kind of pressed one time

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500 
this one I was kind of pressed one time
so<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.869> only<00:02:10.379> section<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.069> into<00:02:11.400> two<00:02:11.700> sections

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
so I only section it into two sections

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.670 
so I only section it into two sections
that<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> was<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.170> whatever

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that I was like whatever

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.869 
that I was like whatever
doesn't<00:02:13.890> matter<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.700> gonna

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
doesn't matter because it's not gonna

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.780 
doesn't matter because it's not gonna
work<00:02:15.030> anyway<00:02:15.359> let<00:02:16.019> me<00:02:16.049> just<00:02:16.260> give<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.469> a<00:02:16.530> try

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
work anyway let me just give it a try

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.209 
work anyway let me just give it a try
but<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:18.989> really<00:02:19.379> worked<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:19.950> was

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
but it really really worked so I was

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.709 
but it really really worked so I was
really<00:02:20.370> surprised<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.329> that<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.629> don't

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
really surprised about that that I don't

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.780 
really surprised about that that I don't
have<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.959> section<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.829> like<00:02:23.219> you<00:02:23.370> know<00:02:23.489> like

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
have to section and like you know like

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.809 
have to section and like you know like
half<00:02:24.000> my<00:02:24.030> head<00:02:24.510> whatever<00:02:24.689> and<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.859> works<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.280> it

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
half my head whatever and it works so it

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.729 
half my head whatever and it works so it
definitely<00:02:27.329> I<00:02:27.359> was<00:02:27.750> really<00:02:28.049> happy<00:02:28.230> about<00:02:28.319> that

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
definitely I was really happy about that

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.629 
definitely I was really happy about that
while<00:02:29.189> I<00:02:29.219> was<00:02:29.519> transitioning<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:30.569> used<00:02:31.139> a<00:02:31.349> as<00:02:31.639> a

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
while I was transitioning I used a as a

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.199 
while I was transitioning I used a as a
co-wash<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.689> I<00:02:33.959> used<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.409> on<00:02:34.799> my<00:02:35.400> wash<00:02:35.639> days<00:02:35.969> my

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
co-wash and I used it on my wash days my

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.229 
co-wash and I used it on my wash days my
wash<00:02:36.389> days<00:02:36.689> came<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.439> lot<00:02:37.950> more<00:02:38.189> often<00:02:38.609> back

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
wash days came a lot more often back

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.009 
wash days came a lot more often back
then<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.019> about<00:02:40.139> three<00:02:40.469> times<00:02:41.689> after<00:02:42.689> I

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
then was it about three times after I

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.659 
then was it about three times after I
got<00:02:43.469> my<00:02:43.680> big<00:02:44.040> chop<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.609> a<00:02:45.389> co-wash<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:47.220> I

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
got my big chop as a co-wash and then I

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.640 
got my big chop as a co-wash and then I
kind<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.239> left<00:02:48.419> it<00:02:48.599> alone<00:02:48.689> while<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> had<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
kind of left it alone while I had the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.559 
kind of left it alone while I had the
braids<00:02:49.889> in<00:02:50.189> my<00:02:50.220> hair<00:02:50.370> while<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.879> twist<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.359> my

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
braids in my hair while the twist in my

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.440 
braids in my hair while the twist in my
hair<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.139> then<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:53.400> recently<00:02:53.639> took<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.209> twist

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
hair and then I recently took the twist

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.020 
hair and then I recently took the twist
out<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:55.049> I've<00:02:55.470> used<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.889> twice<00:02:56.280> already<00:02:56.519> so

out and I've used it twice already so
it's<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.659> twist<00:02:57.900> out<00:02:58.019> because<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.290> just

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409

but<00:03:17.699> as<00:03:18.060> Michael<00:03:18.569> Wacha's<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.680> what<00:03:19.979> I

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
but as Michael Wacha's this is what I

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.430 
but as Michael Wacha's this is what I
have<00:03:20.370> been<00:03:20.699> using<00:03:20.729> and<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.810> love<00:03:22.019> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
have been using and I love it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.460 
have been using and I love it
as<00:03:22.560> for<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.729> texture<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.479> and<00:03:24.870> it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
as for like the texture of it and it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.229 
as for like the texture of it and it
kind<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.829> turned<00:03:26.159> me<00:03:26.280> off<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.669> first<00:03:26.940> time<00:03:27.209> I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
kind of turned me off the first time I

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.729 
kind of turned me off the first time I
used<00:03:27.659> it

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
used it

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.330 
used it
just<00:03:29.459> because<00:03:29.819> I'm<00:03:30.090> very<00:03:30.449> used<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:32.310> a

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
just because I'm very used to like a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.429 
just because I'm very used to like a
thick<00:03:32.729> like<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> very<00:03:33.419> rich<00:03:33.720> conditioner

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
thick like a very rich conditioner

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:40.039 
thick like a very rich conditioner
whereas<00:03:34.859> this<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.609> very<00:03:36.540> like<00:03:37.019> thin<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:39.180> wasn't

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
whereas this is very like thin I wasn't

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.240 
whereas this is very like thin I wasn't
used<00:03:40.229> to<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.379> at<00:03:40.620> all

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
used to that at all

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.539 
used to that at all
but<00:03:41.729> because<00:03:42.449> you<00:03:42.780> know<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.229> leaves<00:03:44.069> my<00:03:44.340> hair

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
but because you know it leaves my hair

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.330 
but because you know it leaves my hair
feeling<00:03:44.970> soft<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.810> everything<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.189> does

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
feeling soft and everything and it does

really

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.619 
really
like<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:23.490> kind<00:04:23.789> of<00:04:23.849> like<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.389> is

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:24.629

very<00:04:24.930> strong<00:04:25.349> though<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.889> think<00:04:25.979> maybe<00:04:26.280> that's

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
very strong though I think maybe that's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.490 
very strong though I think maybe that's
why<00:04:26.699> people<00:04:26.729> don't<00:04:27.030> like<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.300> cuz<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.930> think<00:04:28.349> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
why people don't like it cuz I think the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.189 
why people don't like it cuz I think the
smell<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:28.919> good<00:04:29.129> it's<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.550> like<00:04:29.879> if<00:04:30.330> you're

smell is good it's just like if you're

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.960 
smell is good it's just like if you're
not<00:04:31.379> used<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.710> lot<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.860> strong<00:04:32.190> smells<00:04:32.550> and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
not used to a lot of strong smells and
