 good afternoon to everyone in this video i will show 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.060
 how to equip silicone bait 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.070
 double crochet 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.780
 double hook silicone bait 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.620
 used in places where 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.130
 small amount of vegetation 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.130
 get down to practice 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.739
 in order to equip silicone 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.610
 double crochet bait 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.769
 first we need a double hook 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.129
 straighten out here in this way to 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:59.360
 these knobs here and did not fit snugly 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.370
 friend friend now we need 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.820
 determine the place and where we will be 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.860
 Silicone hook for better 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 visibility accuracy recommend 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.680
 use marker to map 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.430
 this place since we will wind up 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.520
 hook on this side of the fish 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.899
 turn over and present to her 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.179
 hook represent in such a way that 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.460
 near the front bit 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.250
 stuck out of this peak here so here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.820
 put the other hand hold the loop 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.200
 and a marker on the sword is a place where we will 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.720
 start a hook here now 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.720
 so here 's a hook in one hand and 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.989
 about here here is the center of the fish 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:59.209
 where we intended to pierce through 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:59.209
 here and there 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.260
 and print 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:12.810
 in such a way drowns faces and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.810
 now push the hook forward 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.040
 so he went through the silicone and got out 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:24.180
 so that the loop is cut right here right here 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:29.239
 spout market while controlling 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.989
 with your fingers so that this loop does not cut out 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.989
 silicone side 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.659
 that loop seemed 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.250
 we spread our little bit 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.560
 silicone fish 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.660
