00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
back in January and I think the ones

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.080 
back in January and I think the ones
that<00:02:05.350> finished<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:06.100> back<00:02:06.280> end<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.729> season

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
that finished the back end in the season
