well-written
but<00:00:26.730> for<00:00:26.910> whatever<00:00:27.119> reason<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:28.760> fly<00:00:29.760> through

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
but for whatever reason I fly through

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
but for whatever reason I fly through
them<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> little<00:00:31.170> bit<00:00:31.289> obsessed<00:00:31.650> with

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
them and I'm a little bit obsessed with

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.410 
them and I'm a little bit obsessed with
them<00:00:31.980> after<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> finish<00:00:32.640> reading<00:00:32.820> them<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.300> on

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
them after I finish reading them but on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.940 
them after I finish reading them but on
the<00:00:33.540> flip<00:00:33.750> side<00:00:33.780> because<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> consider<00:00:34.860> them

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the flip side because I consider them

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.229 
the flip side because I consider them
guilty<00:00:35.280> pleasures<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.850> don't<00:00:36.090> necessarily

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
guilty pleasures I don't necessarily

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
talk about them as much so today I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.639 
talk about them as much so today I
thought<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.149> would<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> whole<00:00:39.960> dedicated

thought I would make a whole dedicated

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.280 
thought I would make a whole dedicated
video<00:00:40.920> about<00:00:41.430> them<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.270> tell<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:42.899> them

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
video about them to tell you about them

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.670
