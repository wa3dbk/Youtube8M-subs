00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hello dear viewers with you mushroom 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.910
 stick today we play the game scania 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.280
 truck driving simulator 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.360
 I want to say that it will not 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.059
 full latspley there series on 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.460
 half an hour it will be let's say such a bonus 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 channel 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 because half an hour to write down 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.600
 own nothing this game is not a simulator 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 freight is rather a simulator 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.420
 extreme truck driving well 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.620
 more precisely simulator of extreme situations 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.450
 all sorts of different where you need to maneuver 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.920
 in this game you will understand why on the cockpit 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 truck need mirrors extra 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 before that, I certainly imagined for what 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.260
 not necessary but did not know that they are not exactly 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 might even think that they are not so necessary 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.890
 in the cockpit in general all sorts of different 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 extreme situation where necessary 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.260
 squeeze in and maneuver in general 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.890
 very well calculate the dimensions 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.450
 truck will show the real skill 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.880
 driver if you are a cool driver view with 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 try playing here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 this is not a wide autobahn 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.240
 I repeat once again maneuver a lot well 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.210
 Well, controlling the mouse 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.689
 my wheel has not been repaired so may 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.570
 it will be difficult but not manageable 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.610
 keyboard bastard so there is here 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.329
 several different types of tests 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:40.679
 driving school various tasks 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:42.090
 perform quite simple as well 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.619
 say simple relatively simple 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.220
 Of course for many they may seem 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.549
 complex 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:53.250
 especially here for example this is where it is necessary 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.750
 reverse the snake go with a trailer but 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.509
 initial tasks will be enough 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.009
 lungs also have a driving 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.009
 where is the competition 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.470
 the stadium is being held with such tests 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.720
 where can i show myself 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.350
 there is extreme here already the situation in 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.450
 nature in the city 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.640
 any with which trucker 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:35.570
 may encounter at any time 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.570
 Well, there is enough a lot of testing 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.520
 every test of me will be dedicated 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.380
 separate series well, except maybe 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:54.940
 initial pairs of tests they are quite 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:58.310
 easy, more accurate, not even a test 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:05.739
 small there is still free and 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.739
 driving that's where we work in the city and 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.180
 suburb means you need to perform here 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.790
 usual tasks usual cargo transportation 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.820
 but there is no maneuver here either 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.709
 because the city is made so it is necessary 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.769
 squeeze through bottlenecks 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.489
 any scored much hardcore than nothing 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:28.610
 the same 2 and there is a test here 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.680
 reaction rate well, everything is clear 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.090
 okay, we'll start with a driving school 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.739
 I'm here for a test record already a couple 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.840
 tests passed a new profile was lazy 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.590
 here we create these two tests 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.590
 right now and go and so we went 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.440
 to get a driver's 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.540
 identity you will need to pass a number 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.580
 tests start with braking it 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.190
 the task is quite simple and will help 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.880
 evaluate truck stopping distance 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.130
 try to stay at 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.450
 marked pad without knocking down cones not 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.070
 keep vigilant and all you have 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.690
 it turns out well that the task went and 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:18.970
 really very simple you just need to go 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:20.890
 ahead and in this place stay here and 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.680
 all you can watch your record 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:29.400
 action to evaluate from give 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.400
 look 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.210
 That seems to be all right, but for now 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:46.770
 very simple task very simple well and 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:48.480
 next let's go ask on 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.160
 direct the next task will be a bit 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.200
 harder you have to get back 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.030
 this position can not do without 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.600
 true friends driver from the rear mirrors 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.490
 kind of 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.850
 they will help you complete without mistakes 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.500
 even the most difficult maneuver 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.270
 well, that really depends on the driver and the mirrors 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.390
 really help yes and here these 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.380
 mirrors help and here these help 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.970
 very well why did we go here 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.740
 the truck we have is exactly so if 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.490
 do not turn the wheel, you can just push 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.960
 gas and go back 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.550
 home stay on time to not 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.550
 knock down a cone and which stand behind 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.430
 that's all 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.400
 Well, so far nothing complicated here, but 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.320
 in fact, the game is quite hardcore 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.670
 will go further therefore we will be further 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.680
 give each task each 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.240
 one test series but maybe 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.560
 series will be published twice a day 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.150
 because they are short as a bonus 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.770
 such a 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.310
 well okay see you in the following 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.850
 trials 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.850
 bye everyone
