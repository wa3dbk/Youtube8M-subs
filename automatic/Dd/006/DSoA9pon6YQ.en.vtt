00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
established offered dragon scale whoa

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.789 
established offered dragon scale whoa
huh<00:00:49.789> I<00:00:50.199> don't<00:00:51.199> think<00:00:51.379> I<00:00:51.440> want<00:00:51.589> to<00:00:51.649> do<00:00:51.769> that

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
huh I don't think I want to do that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.810 
huh I don't think I want to do that
because<00:00:52.100> I<00:00:53.769> think<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.920> dragon<00:00:55.309> scales<00:00:55.640> are

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
because I think the dragon scales are

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.279 
because I think the dragon scales are
pretty<00:00:56.059> valuable<00:00:58.629> so<00:00:59.629> it<00:00:59.690> looks<00:00:59.750> like<00:00:59.930> that's

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
pretty valuable so it looks like that's

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.850 
pretty valuable so it looks like that's
pretty<00:01:01.010> much<00:01:01.159> it<00:01:01.219> he<00:01:01.610> doesn't<00:01:01.820> offer<00:01:02.860> any

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
pretty much it he doesn't offer any

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.919 
pretty much it he doesn't offer any
items<00:01:04.280> for<00:01:04.489> sale<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:08.390> was<00:01:08.479> pretty<00:01:08.600> simple

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
items for sale so that was pretty simple

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.690 
items for sale so that was pretty simple
I<00:01:10.330> wonder<00:01:11.440> can<00:01:12.440> we<00:01:12.500> chop<00:01:12.800> his<00:01:12.979> tail<00:01:13.220> off<00:01:13.250> again

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
I wonder can we chop his tail off again

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.040 
I wonder can we chop his tail off again
let's<00:01:13.909> try<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:15.970> as<00:01:16.970> tail<00:01:17.600> grew<00:01:17.840> back<00:01:20.050> see

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
let's try that as tail grew back see

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.290 
let's try that as tail grew back see
what<00:01:21.170> happens<00:01:24.520> stamina

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.540 

and<00:01:30.220> there<00:01:31.220> we<00:01:31.340> go<00:01:34.660> nothing<00:01:35.660> happens<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.550> when

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
and there we go nothing happens so when

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.920 
and there we go nothing happens so when
you<00:01:37.640> chop<00:01:37.820> his<00:01:38.000> tail<00:01:38.180> off<00:01:38.330> choice<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.840> only
