a dehydrated tarantula is probably the

a dehydrated tarantula is probably the

people's tarantulas when they bring them
in<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.840> say<00:00:33.960> there's<00:00:34.140> something<00:00:34.320> wrong<00:00:35.070> with

that's<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.129> you're<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> feed<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.700> if

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that's what you're going to feed them if

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.940 
that's what you're going to feed them if
not<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.210> variety<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:40.079> different<00:00:40.379> insects

high in calcium wax worms which are

high in calcium wax worms which are
fatty<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.170> put<00:00:46.379> fat<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.010> animal

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
fatty and will put fat on the animal

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
fatty and will put fat on the animal
it's<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.149> give<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> animal<00:00:48.780> variety<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
it's good to give the animal variety to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's good to give the animal variety to
be<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> spice<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> life<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
be the spice of life but if you see that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
be the spice of life but if you see that
suddenly<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> animal<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:53.190> performing

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
suddenly the animal is not performing

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
suddenly the animal is not performing
he's<00:00:54.390> getting<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.050> sluggish<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
he's getting a little sluggish and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
he's getting a little sluggish and
certainly<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.730> he<00:00:56.850> starts<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.390> curl<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:58.079> his

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
certainly if he starts to curl up his

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
certainly if he starts to curl up his
legs<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:58.859> bit<00:00:59.070> normally<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.270> sign

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
legs a little bit normally that's a sign

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
legs a little bit normally that's a sign
of<00:01:00.660> dehydration<00:01:00.949> which<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.100> guess<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.460> an

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
of dehydration which I guess is an

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.039 
of dehydration which I guess is an
illness<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> keeper

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
illness but really it is a keeper

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
illness but really it is a keeper
illness<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.010> didn't<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.640> job

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
illness you didn't do the right job

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
illness you didn't do the right job
you're<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.540> giving<00:01:06.810> him<00:01:06.930> enough<00:01:07.170> water<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.010> we

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you're not giving him enough water so we

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
you're not giving him enough water so we
can<00:01:08.220> rehab<00:01:08.750> tarantulas<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
can rehab tarantulas that do that that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.070 
can rehab tarantulas that do that that
little<00:01:10.740> bowl<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.900> I've

little bowl that I have here which I've
used<00:01:13.110> today<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.760> way<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.630> take

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
used today is the way we do it we take

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.289 
used today is the way we do it we take
the<00:01:16.080> tarantula<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:17.040> put<00:01:17.549> his<00:01:17.700> face<00:01:18.000> as

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the tarantula and just put his face as

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
the tarantula and just put his face as
fangs<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> water<00:01:19.740> fill<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
fangs right in the water fill it up to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
fangs right in the water fill it up to
the<00:01:20.759> top<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> let<00:01:21.810> him<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.110> sit<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.619> they

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the top and let him just sit there they

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.499 
the top and let him just sit there they
have<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> vacuum<00:01:23.580> mount<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.150> suck<00:01:24.479> in

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
have like a vacuum mount they suck in

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.170 
have like a vacuum mount they suck in
moisture<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> way<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> replenish

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
moisture so that is a way to replenish

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
moisture so that is a way to replenish
the<00:01:27.540> bodily<00:01:27.900> fluids<00:01:27.930> inside<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> animal

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the bodily fluids inside of the animal

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.520 
the bodily fluids inside of the animal
and<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.270> very<00:01:30.570> effective<00:01:31.140> you'll

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and that's very very effective you'll

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
and that's very very effective you'll
see<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.400> trench<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.850> stop<00:01:33.150> any<00:01:33.540> sauce<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
see if the trench will stop any sauce to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260 
see if the trench will stop any sauce to
curl<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> best<00:01:35.310> method<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:36.000> there's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
curl that's the best method if there's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
curl that's the best method if there's
something<00:01:36.540> beyond<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.960> he's<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.320> eating
