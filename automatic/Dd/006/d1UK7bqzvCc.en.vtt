and filters one is here and the other
one<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:46.919> here<00:05:47.310> it's<00:05:48.150> very<00:05:48.270> easy<00:05:48.539> to<00:05:48.990> clean<00:05:49.200> and

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
one is here it's very easy to clean and

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.070 
one is here it's very easy to clean and
they<00:05:49.950> recommend<00:05:50.789> to<00:05:50.849> wash<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:51.270> after<00:05:51.720> every

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
they recommend to wash it after every

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.969 
they recommend to wash it after every
every<00:05:53.070> load<00:05:53.930> so<00:05:54.930> basically<00:05:55.349> we<00:05:55.500> just<00:05:55.650> snap<00:05:55.800> it

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
every load so basically we just snap it

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.200 
every load so basically we just snap it
off<00:05:56.099> and<00:05:56.870> it<00:05:57.870> comes<00:05:58.139> off<00:05:58.380> very<00:05:58.680> easy<00:05:59.220> you<00:06:00.030> can

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
off and it comes off very easy you can

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.740 
off and it comes off very easy you can
just<00:06:00.419> still<00:06:01.729> you<00:06:02.729> can<00:06:02.910> remove<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.300> from<00:06:03.539> both

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
just still you can remove it from both

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.290 
just still you can remove it from both
sides<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:04.200> then<00:06:04.380> pull<00:06:04.650> it<00:06:04.770> out<00:06:04.889> and<00:06:05.160> rinse<00:06:06.150> it

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
sides and then pull it out and rinse it

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.550 
sides and then pull it out and rinse it
with<00:06:06.419> water<00:06:06.660> or<00:06:06.900> clean<00:06:07.590> it<00:06:08.660> yeah<00:06:09.660> so<00:06:10.020> that's

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
with water or clean it yeah so that's

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.640 
with water or clean it yeah so that's
pretty<00:06:10.800> much<00:06:10.979> it<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:15.780> problem<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.260> would<00:06:16.320> say

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
pretty much it the problem I would say

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.400 
pretty much it the problem I would say
with<00:06:17.130> this<00:06:17.370> one<00:06:17.610> I<00:06:18.150> haven't<00:06:18.660> used<00:06:19.020> it<00:06:19.200> yet<00:06:19.229> but

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
with this one I haven't used it yet but

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.570 
with this one I haven't used it yet but
since<00:06:22.410> I've<00:06:22.560> used<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.889> previous<00:06:23.070> generation

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
since I've used the previous generation

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.060 
since I've used the previous generation
I<00:06:23.669> can<00:06:23.880> say<00:06:24.060> it<00:06:24.270> does<00:06:24.660> a<00:06:24.690> fair<00:06:24.960> job<00:06:24.990> in<00:06:25.680> washing

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070
