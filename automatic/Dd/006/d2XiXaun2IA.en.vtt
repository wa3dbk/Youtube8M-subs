00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.340 
it's a personal preference and you'll
decide<00:01:56.940> what<00:01:57.150> you<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.870> more<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
decide what you like the more that you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.920 
decide what you like the more that you
use<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.920> technique<00:01:59.400> so<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> said<00:02:00.690> I'm

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
use this technique so like I said I'm

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.170 
use this technique so like I said I'm
sponging<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.490> dobbers<00:02:02.850> I'll<00:02:03.000> use

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
sponging in the little dobbers I'll use

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.620 
sponging in the little dobbers I'll use
if<00:02:03.360> I've<00:02:03.510> got<00:02:03.690> details<00:02:04.170> um<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.370> work<00:02:05.580> on<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.090> my

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
if I've got details um to work on on my

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.839 
if I've got details um to work on on my
image<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.260> pretty<00:02:08.129> much<00:02:08.190> I'm<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.670> building

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
image and pretty much I'm just building

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.639 
image and pretty much I'm just building
up<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> ink<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.599> know<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:10.110> layers<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
up the ink you know little layers at a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.800 
up the ink you know little layers at a
time<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.370> ink<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.330> don't<00:02:12.450> want<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> go<00:02:12.750> too

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
time of ink you don't want to go too

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.199 
time of ink you don't want to go too
much<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.950> start<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:14.849> want<00:02:15.060> to

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
much to start with you just want to

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.820 
much to start with you just want to
start<00:02:15.510> light<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.050> build<00:02:16.319> more<00:02:16.500> ink<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.800> top

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
start light and build more ink on top

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.160 
start light and build more ink on top
it's<00:02:17.640> easier<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.030> add<00:02:18.150> ink<00:02:18.450> than<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.810> take<00:02:19.050> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
it's easier to add ink than to take it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.589 
it's easier to add ink than to take it
away<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:20.069> I'm<00:02:20.190> using<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.550> smaller<00:02:20.849> sized<00:02:21.209> or

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
away here I'm using the smaller sized or

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.479 
away here I'm using the smaller sized or
just<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.930> kind<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.230> get<00:02:22.439> around<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.249> head<00:02:23.459> and

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
just to kind of get around the head and

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.800 
just to kind of get around the head and
get<00:02:23.819> some<00:02:24.030> detail<00:02:24.420> put<00:02:24.719> in

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810

holiday button bit set that little line
then<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.630> decided<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.110> take<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.500> little<00:02:53.769> dabur

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
then I decided to take that little dabur

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.580 
then I decided to take that little dabur
and<00:02:54.580> while<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.209> had<00:02:55.450> my<00:02:55.569> wedding<00:02:55.900> gout<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.110> did<00:02:56.470> my

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
and while I had my wedding gout I did my

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.699 
and while I had my wedding gout I did my
own<00:02:56.620> little<00:02:57.099> polka<00:02:57.489> dot<00:02:57.700> snowflakes<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.440> this

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
own little polka dot snowflakes so this

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.990 
own little polka dot snowflakes so this
is<00:02:59.860> kind<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.430> could<00:03:00.580> use<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.730> pencil

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
is kind of like you could use a pencil

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.610 
is kind of like you could use a pencil
eraser<00:03:01.239> for<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.080> if<00:03:02.170> you've<00:03:02.260> got<00:03:02.470> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
eraser for this but if you've got the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.100 
eraser for this but if you've got the
little<00:03:02.739> dabur<00:03:03.100> this<00:03:04.000> works<00:03:04.330> just<00:03:04.600> fine<00:03:04.870> I

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
little dabur this works just fine I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.840 
little dabur this works just fine I
think<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.470> adds<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.799> fun<00:03:06.190> little<00:03:06.340> whimsical

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850

first I thought I might use a label but
I<00:05:40.699> it<00:05:41.330> just<00:05:41.630> seemed<00:05:41.780> like<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:42.020> covered<00:05:42.320> up<00:05:42.409> too
