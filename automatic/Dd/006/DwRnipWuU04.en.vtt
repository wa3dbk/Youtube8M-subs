what he did on offense and why it could

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
what he did on offense and why it could
be<00:01:28.740> extremely<00:01:29.490> tough<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.939> stop<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.170> he

be extremely tough to stop so what he

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.140 
be extremely tough to stop so what he
did<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.500> he<00:01:31.650> ran<00:01:31.950> single<00:01:32.369> back<00:01:32.520> spread<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
did is he ran single back spread and the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.840 
did is he ran single back spread and the
play<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:33.689> PA<00:01:34.020> slot<00:01:34.409> wheels<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.950> I've<00:01:35.579> seen

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
play was PA slot wheels and I've seen

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.730 
play was PA slot wheels and I've seen
this<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> couple<00:01:36.210> times<00:01:36.360> both<00:01:37.020> from<00:01:37.259> top<00:01:37.439> 50

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this a couple times both from top 50

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.069 
this a couple times both from top 50
players<00:01:37.860> actually<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.630> reason<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
players actually and the reason is this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.929 
players actually and the reason is this
such<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> tough<00:01:40.560> play<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.920> defend<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> because

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
such a tough play to defend is because

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.370 
such a tough play to defend is because
of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> wheel<00:01:42.270> routes<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
of the wheel routes and because it's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
of the wheel routes and because it's
under<00:01:43.590> center<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.220> quick<00:01:44.430> past<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.509> PA

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
under center it can be quick past the PA

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.310 
under center it can be quick past the PA
play<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.409> very<00:01:46.799> difficult<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.430> blitz<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.320> it's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
play is very difficult to blitz and it's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.510 
play is very difficult to blitz and it's
also<00:01:49.530> tough<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> book<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.430> so

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
also tough the book because it's so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.399 
also tough the book because it's so
spread<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.270> basically<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.020> play<00:01:52.200> two

inside pass lead so you see there on the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.389 
inside pass lead so you see there on the
left<00:01:59.790> side<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.409> torches<00:02:01.860> man<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
well I'll just go to zone okay so we try

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.240 
well I'll just go to zone okay so we try
to<00:02:11.400> play<00:02:11.580> cover<00:02:11.819> three

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to play cover three

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.470 
to play cover three
you're<00:02:13.490> still<00:02:13.640> going<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.820> get<00:02:13.910> torched<00:02:14.210> by<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
you're still going to get torched by the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.420 
you're still going to get torched by the
wheel<00:02:14.780> routes<00:02:15.020> let's<00:02:15.530> look<00:02:15.710> here<00:02:15.980> at<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> left

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
wheel routes let's look here at the left

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.900 
wheel routes let's look here at the left
side<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.640> field<00:02:17.380> carlie<00:02:18.380> three<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.760> get

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
side of field carlie three and you get

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.370 
side of field carlie three and you get
torch<00:02:23.120> down<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.390> sideline<00:02:23.720> food<00:02:23.930> will<00:02:24.020> begin

torch down the sideline food will begin

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.500 
torch down the sideline food will begin
so<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:25.100> know<00:02:25.220> even<00:02:25.550> if<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.730> play<00:02:25.910> cover<00:02:26.180> three

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
and you know add in some purple zones

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.570 
and you know add in some purple zones
you<00:02:29.240> know<00:02:29.360> maybe<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.840> all<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.920> know<00:02:31.070> stop<00:02:31.370> it

worked kind of well but then you know

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.680 
worked kind of well but then you know
once<00:03:31.430> they<00:03:31.580> get<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.790> job<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.120> everybody<00:03:32.480> back

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
once they get a job and everybody back

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.500 
once they get a job and everybody back
in<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.959> coverage<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:34.220> basically<00:03:34.910> what<00:03:35.360> my

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
in the coverage so basically what my

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.870 
in the coverage so basically what my
solution<00:03:36.049> was<00:03:36.080> was<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.830> play<00:03:36.980> cover<00:03:37.250> four<00:03:37.580> and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
solution was was to play cover four and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.069 
solution was was to play cover four and
then<00:03:38.600> man<00:03:38.930> up<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.260> slot<00:03:39.470> receivers<00:03:39.980> with<00:03:40.370> the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
then man up the slot receivers with the

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.150 
then man up the slot receivers with the
deep<00:03:42.079> blue<00:03:42.230> zones<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.739> are<00:03:42.799> in<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:42.980> middle

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
deep blue zones that are in the middle

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.120 
deep blue zones that are in the middle
of<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.310> field<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:44.440> then<00:03:45.440> i<00:03:45.470> was<00:03:45.709> going<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.040> go

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
of the field and then i was going to go

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.860 
of the field and then i was going to go
ahead<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.370> protect<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.390> deep<00:03:47.540> part<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
ahead and protect the deep part of the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.050 
ahead and protect the deep part of the
field<00:03:48.019> myself<00:03:48.579> with<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.700> middle<00:03:49.910> linebacker

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
field myself with the middle linebacker

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.870 
field myself with the middle linebacker
so<00:03:50.980> with<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.010> setup<00:03:52.340> i'm<00:03:52.519> still<00:03:52.730> watching

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
so with this setup i'm still watching

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.060 
so with this setup i'm still watching
the<00:03:53.090> two<00:03:53.239> guys<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.690> outside<00:03:54.049> well<00:03:54.799> what

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
the two guys on the outside well what

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.640 
the two guys on the outside well what
you'll<00:03:55.220> see<00:03:55.519> is<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.810> manned<00:03:57.110> up<00:03:57.290> slot

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
you'll see is that the manned up slot

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.120 
you'll see is that the manned up slot
receivers<00:03:58.540> don't<00:03:59.540> burn<00:03:59.959> there<00:04:00.260> don't<00:04:00.769> bring<00:04:00.980> a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
receivers don't burn there don't bring a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.009 
receivers don't burn there don't bring a
guy<00:04:01.160> as<00:04:01.519> much<00:04:01.670> as<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.910> did<00:04:02.060> with<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.690> regular

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
guy as much as it did with the regular

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.110 
guy as much as it did with the regular
coverage<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.590> actually<00:04:03.950> allows<00:04:04.280> us<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.970> get

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
coverage and actually allows us to get

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.870 
coverage and actually allows us to get
some<00:04:05.329> heat<00:04:05.510> from<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.620> outside<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.370> sax<00:04:07.700> not

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
some heat from the outside that sax not

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.430 
some heat from the outside that sax not
going<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.060> happen<00:04:08.150> all<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.420> time<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:08.930> because

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
going to happen all the time but because

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.840 
going to happen all the time but because
we're<00:04:09.620> watching<00:04:09.920> those<00:04:10.040> guys<00:04:10.220> on<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.489> outside

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
we're watching those guys on the outside

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.120 
we're watching those guys on the outside
and<00:04:11.120> i'm<00:04:11.600> using<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.870> 49ers<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.650> know<00:04:12.709> the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
and i'm using the 49ers you know the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.259 
and i'm using the 49ers you know the
quarterbacks<00:04:13.640> not<00:04:13.820> going<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.030> have<00:04:14.120> all<00:04:14.150> day

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
quarterbacks not going to have all day

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.479 
quarterbacks not going to have all day
to<00:04:14.450> throw<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.560> see<00:04:15.769> here<00:04:16.010> because<00:04:16.370> the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
to throw so you see here because the

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.909 
to throw so you see here because the
slot<00:04:16.760> receivers<00:04:17.239> are<00:04:17.419> manned<00:04:18.140> up<00:04:18.290> on<00:04:18.530> somebody

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
slot receivers are manned up on somebody

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.620 
slot receivers are manned up on somebody
that's<00:04:19.130> off<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.459> line<00:04:19.609> of<00:04:19.729> scrimmage<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that's off the line of scrimmage the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.659 
that's off the line of scrimmage the
wheelhouse<00:04:21.049> don't<00:04:21.349> quite<00:04:21.620> burn<00:04:21.919> man<00:04:22.250> coverage

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
wheelhouse don't quite burn man coverage

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.100 
wheelhouse don't quite burn man coverage
is<00:04:22.760> bad<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.210> they<00:04:23.300> don't<00:04:23.539> get<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.750> inside

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
is bad and they don't get the inside

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.940 
is bad and they don't get the inside
position<00:04:24.260> and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
position and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.830 
position and
really<00:04:26.250> makes<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.700> lot<00:04:26.910> more<00:04:26.970> difficult<00:04:27.690> to

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
really makes it a lot more difficult to

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.860 
really makes it a lot more difficult to
complete<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.320> pass<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.740> we<00:04:28.920> are<00:04:28.950> out<00:04:29.190> and

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
complete the pass to the we are out and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.150 
complete the pass to the we are out and
the<00:04:30.870> Purple's<00:04:31.260> actually<00:04:31.530> get<00:04:31.680> out<00:04:31.710> there<00:04:31.830> and

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
the Purple's actually get out there and

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.550 
the Purple's actually get out there and
kind<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.640> prevent<00:04:32.970> an<00:04:33.090> inside<00:04:33.390> pass<00:04:33.630> lead<00:04:33.960> you

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
kind of prevent an inside pass lead you

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.260 
kind of prevent an inside pass lead you
have<00:04:34.680> deep<00:04:34.950> blue<00:04:35.190> zone<00:04:35.460> on<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.640> outside<00:04:35.760> to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
have deep blue zone on the outside to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.390 
have deep blue zone on the outside to
prevent<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.630> from<00:04:36.660> getting<00:04:36.870> bombed<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.590> you

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
prevent you from getting bombed and you

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.070 
prevent you from getting bombed and you
will<00:04:38.640> be<00:04:38.760> user<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> guy<00:04:39.450> over<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.840> middle

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
will be user and a guy over the middle

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.780 
will be user and a guy over the middle
of<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.200> field<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.710> lurk<00:04:40.890> any<00:04:41.130> crossing<00:04:41.430> routes

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
of the field to lurk any crossing routes

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.220 
of the field to lurk any crossing routes
so<00:04:42.690> really<00:04:43.350> this<00:04:43.590> was<00:04:43.860> my<00:04:44.130> best<00:04:45.000> solution<00:04:45.600> to

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
so really this was my best solution to

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.150 
so really this was my best solution to
this<00:04:46.350> problem<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.980> that<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:47.610> play<00:04:47.910> cover<00:04:48.150> for

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
this problem and that is play cover for

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.850 
this problem and that is play cover for
man<00:04:50.160> up<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.550> wheel<00:04:50.760> routes<00:04:51.000> with<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:52.110> receiver

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
man up the wheel routes with a receiver

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.490 
man up the wheel routes with a receiver
that's<00:04:53.010> about<00:04:53.310> 10<00:04:53.490> yards<00:04:53.670> deep<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.320> then<00:04:55.320> go

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
that's about 10 yards deep and then go

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.590 
that's about 10 yards deep and then go
ahead<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.770> just<00:04:56.130> watch<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.670> guys<00:04:56.850> on<00:04:57.540> the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
ahead and just watch the guys on the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.080 
ahead and just watch the guys on the
outside<00:05:00.950> so<00:05:01.950> this<00:05:02.100> setup<00:05:02.310> we<00:05:02.490> won't<00:05:02.670> solve<00:05:02.910> all

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
outside so this setup we won't solve all

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.330 
outside so this setup we won't solve all
your<00:05:03.150> problems<00:05:03.480> but<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:04.110> will<00:05:04.290> make<00:05:04.500> defending

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
your problems but it will make defending

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.940 
your problems but it will make defending
wheel<00:05:05.520> routes<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:06.060> lot<00:05:06.780> easier<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.770> lot

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
wheel routes a lot easier and a lot

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.570 
wheel routes a lot easier and a lot
better<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:09.330> I'm<00:05:09.870> crazy<00:05:10.320> pays<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.950> that<00:05:11.310> is

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
better so I'm crazy pays and that is

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
better so I'm crazy pays and that is
