00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
overheated a nuclear reactor oh no no no

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.460 
overheated a nuclear reactor oh no no no
you<00:03:00.209> don't<00:03:00.330> even<00:03:00.510> need<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> nuclear<00:03:01.200> reactor

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you don't even need a nuclear reactor

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.000 
you don't even need a nuclear reactor
you<00:03:01.860> uh<00:03:02.390> there<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> recipe<00:03:03.989> which<00:03:04.500> they

you uh there is a recipe which they

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.860 
you uh there is a recipe which they
don't<00:03:05.190> want<00:03:05.370> public<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:05.850> i<00:03:05.880> won't<00:03:06.150> say<00:03:06.600> what<00:03:06.720> it

happened oh oh yeah um yeah just recipe
for<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:21.350> nuclear<00:03:22.350> bomb<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:23.549> wonderful

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
for a nuclear bomb and it's wonderful

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.370 
for a nuclear bomb and it's wonderful
oh<00:03:25.640> that's<00:03:26.330> too<00:03:26.480> bad<00:03:26.510> i<00:03:26.660> was<00:03:26.810> i<00:03:26.930> kinda<00:03:27.170> hoping

he would be bigger maybe I should try

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.480 
he would be bigger maybe I should try
exploding<00:03:28.970> more<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.300> them<00:03:29.480> than<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.870> one
