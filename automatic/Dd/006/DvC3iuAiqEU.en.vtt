system<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.879> not<00:02:16.269> just<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.750> upgrade

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
system and not just that the upgrade

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890 
system and not just that the upgrade
system<00:02:17.620> also<00:02:17.859> looks<00:02:18.370> really<00:02:18.939> cool<00:02:19.299> though<00:02:19.870> I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
system also looks really cool though I

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.229 
system also looks really cool though I
don't<00:02:20.109> understand<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.129> a<00:02:21.219> hundred<00:02:21.430> percent<00:02:21.939> so

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
don't understand it a hundred percent so

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.240 
don't understand it a hundred percent so
I'm<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.719> to<00:02:22.780> go<00:02:22.900> back<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.319> game<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.859> see

all of these abilities can be put
together<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.750> multiple<00:03:02.560> different<00:03:02.739> ways

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
together in multiple different ways

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.220 
together in multiple different ways
making<00:03:03.549> for<00:03:03.849> tons<00:03:04.269> of<00:03:04.480> different<00:03:04.719> play<00:03:05.200> styles

making for tons of different play styles
and<00:03:05.889> from<00:03:06.459> what<00:03:06.669> it<00:03:06.760> looks<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.569> longer

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and from what it looks like the longer

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300 
and from what it looks like the longer
you<00:03:07.930> use<00:03:08.079> something<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.919> more<00:03:09.099> this

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you use something the more this

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.369 
you use something the more this
percentage<00:03:09.909> goes<00:03:10.150> up<00:03:10.419> so<00:03:10.930> you'll<00:03:11.079> want<00:03:11.139> to

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
percentage goes up so you'll want to

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.440 
percentage goes up so you'll want to
switch<00:03:11.650> out<00:03:11.829> items<00:03:12.159> to<00:03:12.340> get<00:03:12.489> both<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.790> ability

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
switch out items to get both the ability

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.059 
switch out items to get both the ability
and<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.689> upgrades<00:03:14.440> up<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.829> one<00:03:15.040> hundred

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
and the upgrades up to one hundred

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.819 
and the upgrades up to one hundred
percent<00:03:15.540> I'm<00:03:16.540> not<00:03:16.750> sure<00:03:16.989> what<00:03:17.229> happens<00:03:17.650> when

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
percent I'm not sure what happens when

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.530 
percent I'm not sure what happens when
you<00:03:17.949> get<00:03:18.099> to<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> hundred<00:03:18.430> percent<00:03:18.729> but<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.389> is

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
you get to a hundred percent but that is

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.089 
you get to a hundred percent but that is
something<00:03:19.750> I'll<00:03:20.079> have<00:03:20.229> to<00:03:20.379> find<00:03:20.620> out<00:03:20.889> in<00:03:21.010> the

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
something I'll have to find out in the

something I'll have to find out in the
next<00:03:21.129> 30<00:03:21.669> minutes<00:03:25.290> first<00:03:26.290> off<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.769> correct

next 30 minutes first off to correct
myself<00:03:27.310> I've<00:03:27.760> learned<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.479> percentages

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
myself I've learned that the percentages

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.110 
myself I've learned that the percentages
shown<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:29.739> each<00:03:29.979> weapon<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.639> just<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
shown on each weapon is just the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.210 
shown on each weapon is just the
percentage<00:03:31.689> that<00:03:31.840> you've<00:03:32.049> used<00:03:32.379> that<00:03:32.560> item<00:03:33.010> as

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
that function and when you use the item

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.140 
that function and when you use the item
as<00:03:35.680> each<00:03:35.889> function<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.549> learn<00:03:36.790> more<00:03:37.060> about

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
as each function you learn more about

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.210 
as each function you learn more about
the<00:03:37.389> person<00:03:37.599> that<00:03:37.840> ability<00:03:38.409> is<00:03:38.530> attached<00:03:38.919> to

the person that ability is attached to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.249 
the person that ability is attached to
which<00:03:39.669> is<00:03:39.849> really<00:03:40.150> cool<00:03:40.479> when<00:03:40.810> wanting<00:03:41.169> to
