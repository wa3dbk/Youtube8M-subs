testing<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:16.780> new<00:03:17.290> traits<00:03:21.780> we've<00:03:22.780> got<00:03:22.959> our

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
testing for new traits we've got our

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.970 
testing for new traits we've got our
sample

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.500 

for<00:03:26.879> this<00:03:27.060> test<00:03:27.860> we<00:03:28.860> have<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.459> use<00:03:29.640> two<00:03:30.000> bottles

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
for this test we have to use two bottles

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.630 
for this test we have to use two bottles
from<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.810> kid<00:03:32.360> bottle<00:03:33.360> number<00:03:33.510> one<00:03:34.400> we<00:03:35.400> will

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
from the kid bottle number one we will

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.180 
from the kid bottle number one we will
add<00:03:35.910> ten<00:03:36.360> drops<00:03:36.390> bottle<00:03:37.200> number<00:03:37.319> two<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:38.040> will

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
add ten drops bottle number two we will

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.320 
add ten drops bottle number two we will
add<00:03:38.370> ten<00:03:38.879> drops<00:03:38.910> as<00:03:39.510> well<00:03:40.610> what<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.640> number<00:03:42.030> one

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
add ten drops as well what a number one

only to be shaken for a few seconds
before<00:03:44.849> use<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.890> then<00:03:47.130> we<00:03:47.370> open<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.880> bottle

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:02.210 

and<00:03:54.980> go<00:03:55.980> ahead<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> lot<00:03:56.549> 10<00:03:56.879> drops<00:04:01.010> make<00:04:02.010> sure

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and go ahead a lot 10 drops make sure

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.930 
and go ahead a lot 10 drops make sure
the<00:04:02.549> eleventh<00:04:03.209> drop<00:04:03.480> gets<00:04:04.110> sucked<00:04:04.500> back<00:04:04.680> in

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
the eleventh drop gets sucked back in

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.490 
the eleventh drop gets sucked back in
that's<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:07.849> now<00:04:08.849> we<00:04:08.910> will<00:04:09.060> cut<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.780> test<00:04:10.170> tube

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that's it now we will cut that test tube

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.490 
that's it now we will cut that test tube
and<00:04:10.829> shake<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.670> well<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.329> few<00:04:12.630> seconds<00:04:13.260> I

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.349 

will<00:04:16.500> leave<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.100> side<00:04:17.690> put<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.810> lid<00:04:18.989> on

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
will leave it on the side put the lid on

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.840 
will leave it on the side put the lid on
and<00:04:21.359> we're<00:04:21.630> gonna<00:04:21.810> take<00:04:22.639> bottle<00:04:23.639> with<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and we're gonna take bottle with the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.870 
and we're gonna take bottle with the
test<00:04:24.210> solution<00:04:24.870> number<00:04:25.050> two<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:26.460> is<00:04:26.639> very

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
test solution number two this is very

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.270 
test solution number two this is very
important<00:04:27.479> this<00:04:27.810> bottle<00:04:28.500> needs<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.830> be<00:04:28.979> shaken

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
important this bottle needs to be shaken

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.689 
important this bottle needs to be shaken
well<00:04:29.820> for<00:04:30.780> thirty<00:04:31.430> seconds<00:04:32.430> before<00:04:33.650> adding

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.209 

it's<00:04:39.389> not<00:04:39.629> gonna<00:04:39.810> shake<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.289> for<00:04:40.439> 30<00:04:40.650> seconds

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
it's not gonna shake it for 30 seconds

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:48.589 
it's not gonna shake it for 30 seconds
now<00:04:44.840> that's<00:04:45.840> down<00:04:46.699> going<00:04:47.699> back<00:04:47.969> to<00:04:48.120> our<00:04:48.150> sample

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
now that's down going back to our sample

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.739 
now that's down going back to our sample
we<00:04:49.289> opened<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.830> tube<00:04:50.099> and<00:04:50.400> we<00:04:50.460> had<00:04:50.939> ten<00:04:51.419> drops

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:51.749 
we opened the tube and we had ten drops

00:04:51.749 --> 00:05:01.809 
we opened the tube and we had ten drops
from<00:04:52.110> bottle<00:04:52.889> number<00:04:53.069> two

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.730 

now<00:05:02.819> we're<00:05:03.150> gonna<00:05:03.360> cap<00:05:03.629> the<00:05:03.810> bottle<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.349> shake

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
now we're gonna cap the bottle and shake

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.239 
now we're gonna cap the bottle and shake
it<00:05:04.770> well<00:05:05.249> for<00:05:05.580> one<00:05:05.999> minute<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.740> needed<00:05:07.979> to

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:08.249 
it well for one minute and I needed to

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:17.469 
it well for one minute and I needed to
stand<00:05:08.580> for<00:05:08.849> five<00:05:09.120> minutes

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.809 

now<00:05:18.479> we're<00:05:18.689> gonna<00:05:18.899> check<00:05:19.379> the<00:05:20.069> results<00:05:20.579> by

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
now we're gonna check the results by

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.729 
now we're gonna check the results by
matching<00:05:21.239> the<00:05:21.509> colors<00:05:21.899> that's<00:05:22.139> our<00:05:22.289> kill

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:22.739 
matching the colors that's our kill

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.179 
matching the colors that's our kill
first<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.399> put<00:05:23.639> ammonia<00:05:24.739> so<00:05:25.739> we're<00:05:26.069> gonna

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189 
first you put ammonia so we're gonna

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.579 
first you put ammonia so we're gonna
compare<00:05:26.609> it<00:05:26.729> with<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:26.909> color<00:05:27.269> strip<00:05:27.719> titled

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:28.589 
compare it with a color strip titled

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.349 
compare it with a color strip titled
ammonia<00:05:29.159> which<00:05:29.369> is<00:05:29.519> a<00:05:29.549> middle<00:05:29.789> one<00:05:30.059> on<00:05:30.119> the

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:30.359 
ammonia which is a middle one on the

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:36.109 
ammonia which is a middle one on the
chart<00:05:30.689> and<00:05:32.179> we<00:05:33.179> can<00:05:33.389> see<00:05:33.689> that<00:05:33.989> our<00:05:34.349> color<00:05:35.119> is

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:36.119 
chart and we can see that our color is

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:38.959 
chart and we can see that our color is
yellow<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:37.159> this<00:05:38.159> corresponds<00:05:38.729> with<00:05:38.789> the

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
yellow and this corresponds with the

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.299 
yellow and this corresponds with the
yellow<00:05:39.239> on<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.569> chart<00:05:39.869> which<00:05:40.199> is<00:05:40.229> zero<00:05:41.069> so

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
yellow on the chart which is zero so

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.349 
yellow on the chart which is zero so
that's<00:05:41.519> a<00:05:41.639> very<00:05:41.819> good<00:05:42.029> result<00:05:43.429> level<00:05:44.429> zero<00:05:44.729> for

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:45.359 
that's a very good result level zero for

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:49.129 
that's a very good result level zero for
ammonia<00:05:46.459> now<00:05:47.459> the<00:05:47.519> second<00:05:48.089> kill<00:05:48.419> post<00:05:48.719> meet

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
ammonia now the second kill post meet

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.509 
ammonia now the second kill post meet
writes<00:05:51.259> after<00:05:52.259> five<00:05:52.499> minutes<00:05:52.739> it's<00:05:53.129> still

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:53.519 
writes after five minutes it's still

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.659 
writes after five minutes it's still
below<00:05:53.789> light<00:05:54.659> blue<00:05:54.959> and<00:05:55.199> this<00:05:56.039> corresponds

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
below light blue and this corresponds

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.350 
below light blue and this corresponds
the<00:05:56.909> top<00:05:57.409> box<00:05:58.409> on<00:05:58.709> the<00:05:58.889> chart<00:05:59.219> so<00:05:59.519> yeah<00:06:00.089> we've

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
the top box on the chart so yeah we've

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.350 
the top box on the chart so yeah we've
got<00:06:00.569> zero<00:06:00.839> as<00:06:00.929> well<00:06:01.199> and<00:06:01.639> that<00:06:02.639> last<00:06:02.909> bottle

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
got zero as well and that last bottle

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.279 
got zero as well and that last bottle
was<00:06:03.479> new<00:06:03.809> traits<00:06:04.369> as<00:06:05.369> you<00:06:05.729> can<00:06:05.939> see<00:06:06.179> this<00:06:06.329> is<00:06:06.929> a

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
was new traits as you can see this is a

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.629 
was new traits as you can see this is a
red<00:06:07.619> now<00:06:07.949> so<00:06:08.339> this<00:06:08.549> is<00:06:08.789> down<00:06:09.119> this<00:06:09.499> stripe<00:06:10.639> and

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
red now so this is down this stripe and

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.609 
red now so this is down this stripe and
I<00:06:11.999> would<00:06:12.839> think<00:06:13.110> this<00:06:13.319> is<00:06:13.529> between<00:06:13.860> 20<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.639> 40

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:15.619 
I would think this is between 20 and 40

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:21.019 
I would think this is between 20 and 40
ppm<00:06:16.619> which<00:06:17.339> is<00:06:18.059> slightly<00:06:18.389> high<00:06:19.289> so<00:06:19.739> a<00:06:20.099> partial

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
ppm which is slightly high so a partial

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:28.689 
ppm which is slightly high so a partial
water<00:06:21.389> change<00:06:21.899> or<00:06:22.259> is<00:06:22.619> recommended
