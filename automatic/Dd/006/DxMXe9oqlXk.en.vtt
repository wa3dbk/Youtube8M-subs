00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.619 
going to do now is very simply going
down<00:01:01.050> thoughts<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.070> manually<00:01:02.879> type<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.449> in

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
down thoughts and manually type them in

down thoughts and manually type them in
into<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> spreadsheet<00:01:06.350> noise<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:07.830> bit

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.609 

make<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.799> little<00:01:11.950> bit<00:01:12.189> more<00:01:12.369> freedom<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.619> be

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
make it a little bit more freedom to be

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.859 
make it a little bit more freedom to be
able<00:01:15.219> to<00:01:15.820> see<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.740> side<00:01:17.740> by<00:01:17.770> side<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.429> and<00:01:18.939> this

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
able to see it side by side it and this

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.249 
able to see it side by side it and this
one<00:01:20.200> come<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:24.130> bit<00:01:25.079> direction

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
one come a little bit direction

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.370 
one come a little bit direction
okay<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.880> Real<00:01:28.060> Madrid<00:01:28.569> is<00:01:30.119> 1.72<00:01:31.119> back<00:01:31.360> as<00:01:32.079> we

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
okay so Real Madrid is 1.72 back as we

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.730 
okay so Real Madrid is 1.72 back as we
are<00:01:32.500> often<00:01:33.130> doing<00:01:33.340> lipids<00:01:33.969> I'm<00:01:34.509> choosing<00:01:35.200> here

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
are often doing lipids I'm choosing here

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.699 
are often doing lipids I'm choosing here
to<00:01:36.130> type<00:01:36.399> in<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.299> lay<00:01:37.450> prices<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:41.170> then<00:01:41.560> we

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
to type in the lay prices so then we

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.219 
to type in the lay prices so then we
need<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.340> scroll<00:01:42.970> down<00:01:43.030> we<00:01:43.630> don't<00:01:43.780> have<00:01:44.049> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
need to scroll down we don't have the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.609 
need to scroll down we don't have the
second<00:01:44.560> half<00:01:44.709> match<00:01:45.039> odds<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:46.630> have<00:01:46.840> half<00:01:47.200> time

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
second half match odds we have half time

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.059 
second half match odds we have half time
behalf<00:01:48.329> half<00:01:49.329> time<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.869> see<00:01:50.079> that<00:01:50.110> little<00:01:50.709> cup

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
behalf half time you see that little cup

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.729 
behalf half time you see that little cup
so<00:01:51.610> we<00:01:51.759> are<00:01:51.849> taking<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.670> middle<00:01:54.909> between<00:01:55.209> it

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:55.739 
so we are taking the middle between it

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.419 
so we are taking the middle between it
here<00:01:56.739> how<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.849> draw<00:01:58.329> half<00:01:58.599> time<00:01:59.049> again<00:01:59.590> taking

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
here how to draw half time again taking

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.160 
here how to draw half time again taking
the<00:02:01.360> middle<00:02:01.659> between<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:02.289> draw<00:02:03.039> no<00:02:03.280> bet<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:05.079> are

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the middle between it draw no bet we are

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.059 
the middle between it draw no bet we are
taking<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.709> highest<00:02:05.890> price<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.649> there's<00:02:08.890> a

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
taking the highest price so there's a

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.690 
taking the highest price so there's a
little<00:02:09.340> bit<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:10.599> experience<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.739> will<00:02:12.220> down

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
little bit with experience you will down

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.160 
little bit with experience you will down
this<00:02:13.180> time<00:02:14.069> which<00:02:15.069> odds<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:16.180> take<00:02:16.510> which<00:02:16.840> odds

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
this time which odds to take which odds

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.039 
this time which odds to take which odds
you<00:02:17.440> will<00:02:17.620> get<00:02:17.859> matched<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:19.269> course<00:02:19.600> your

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
you will get matched and of course your

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.030 
you will get matched and of course your
can<00:02:20.470> only<00:02:20.739> build<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.220> spreadsheet<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:23.040> data

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
can only build a spreadsheet with data

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.110 
can only build a spreadsheet with data
with<00:02:24.310> odds<00:02:24.549> you<00:02:24.910> have<00:02:24.970> actually<00:02:25.600> access<00:02:26.019> tone

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
with odds you have actually access tone

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.720 
with odds you have actually access tone
so<00:02:28.290> 2.82<00:02:30.900> 2175<00:02:31.900> I'm<00:02:32.350> looking<00:02:32.709> at<00:02:32.859> here<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.430> side

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
so 2.82 2175 I'm looking at here to side

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.979 
so 2.82 2175 I'm looking at here to side
here<00:02:34.500> five<00:02:35.880> six<00:02:36.880> point<00:02:37.299> six

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.690 

14:34<00:02:41.459> 24<00:02:42.810> 12

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
14:34 24 12

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.260 
14:34 24 12
so<00:02:46.390> I'm<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.930> goes<00:02:47.560> down<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.730> down<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.970> down

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
so I'm just goes down and down and down
