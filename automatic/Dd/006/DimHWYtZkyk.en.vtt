calling themselves as the true divas
that's<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.480> too<00:00:24.600> bad<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.900> name<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.820> this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that's not too bad of a name but this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.259 
that's not too bad of a name but this
match<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.240> kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.199> know<00:00:29.060> this<00:00:30.060> was

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
match was kind of just you know this was

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
match was kind of just you know this was
here<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.570> make<00:00:31.080> total<00:00:31.439> divas<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.949> focal<00:00:32.579> point

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
here to make total divas a focal point

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.610 
here to make total divas a focal point
and<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> did<00:00:33.809> its<00:00:33.930> job<00:00:33.989> it

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and I think that it did its job it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
and I think that it did its job it
wasn't<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.309> bad<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.780> it<00:00:36.780> could<00:00:37.020> have

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
wasn't actually as bad as it could have

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.160 
wasn't actually as bad as it could have
been<00:00:37.520> it<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.610> perfectly<00:00:38.969> fine<00:00:39.059> match<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.719> think

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
been it was perfectly fine match I think

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.540 
been it was perfectly fine match I think
that<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> main<00:00:40.620> reason<00:00:40.649> why<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.129> wasn't<00:00:41.370> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that the main reason why it wasn't as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.000 
that the main reason why it wasn't as
bad<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.210> kept<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.719> simple

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
bad is because they kept it very simple

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.670 
bad is because they kept it very simple
it<00:00:44.010> seemed<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:45.180> had<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:46.079> thing<00:00:46.440> for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it seemed like they had one thing for

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.569 
it seemed like they had one thing for
each<00:00:46.800> person<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> do<00:00:47.570> like<00:00:49.190> Nikki<00:00:50.190> doing<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
each person to do like Nikki doing the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.010 
each person to do like Nikki doing the
the<00:00:50.850> backbreaker<00:00:51.360> kind<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.600> thing<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.750> like

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the backbreaker kind of thing that like

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
the backbreaker kind of thing that like
the<00:00:52.140> torture<00:00:52.440> rack<00:00:52.590> thing<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> she<00:00:53.129> had<00:00:53.219> done

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the torture rack thing that she had done

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.500 
the torture rack thing that she had done
which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> apparently<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.149> her<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> finish

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
which is apparently like her to finish

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.479 
which is apparently like her to finish
her<00:00:54.710> Natalya<00:00:55.710> basically<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.250> doing<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
her Natalya basically just doing the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
her Natalya basically just doing the
Sharpshooter<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.960> went

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
Sharpshooter you know it kind of went

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
Sharpshooter you know it kind of went
like<00:00:58.230> back<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> forth<00:00:59.030> Cameron<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.480> not

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
like back and forth Cameron or not

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.110 
like back and forth Cameron or not
Cameron<00:01:00.960> Naomi<00:01:01.440> had<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> lemonade<00:01:02.460> Alicia<00:01:02.879> Fox

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
Cameron Naomi had a lemonade Alicia Fox

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.140 
Cameron Naomi had a lemonade Alicia Fox
very<00:01:03.449> early<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:04.729> she<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.820> done<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
very early on with she was done that to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
very early on with she was done that to
the<00:01:06.240> million<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.630> bright<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.110> think<00:01:07.860> she<00:01:08.280> didn't

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the million so bright I think she didn't

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.380 
the million so bright I think she didn't
win<00:01:08.790> salt<00:01:09.060> whatever<00:01:09.390> Cameron<00:01:09.720> no<00:01:10.290> Naomi<00:01:10.650> oh

win salt whatever Cameron no Naomi oh

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
win salt whatever Cameron no Naomi oh
maybe<00:01:12.390> she<00:01:13.140> had<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.950> Cameron

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
maybe she had the you know that Cameron

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.300 
maybe she had the you know that Cameron
spot<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:15.210> Cameron<00:01:15.600> didn't<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.869> shit<00:01:16.310> actually

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
spot now Cameron didn't do shit actually

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.530 
spot now Cameron didn't do shit actually

Rosa Mendes out of all people so whereas

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.450 
Rosa Mendes out of all people so whereas
in<00:01:28.290> Mendes<00:01:28.590> finally<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> pin<00:01:29.430> on

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
somebody I think this first time that's

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
somebody I think this first time that's
ever<00:01:30.780> happened<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.320> ten<00:01:31.530> years<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:32.820> uh

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
ever happened in like ten years but uh

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.679 
ever happened in like ten years but uh
you<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:34.140> finish<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.619> didn't<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.280> shit

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
you know then finish off didn't do shit

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.270 
you know then finish off didn't do shit
didn't<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.810> shit<00:01:36.990> finish<00:01:37.320> her<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.829> works<00:01:38.040> my

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
didn't do shit finish her it works my

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
didn't do shit finish her it works my
god<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.119> thought<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.380> pretty<00:01:40.560> decent

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
god I thought that it was pretty decent

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
god I thought that it was pretty decent
though<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> mean<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.490> expected<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
though I mean I expected this to be a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.719 
though I mean I expected this to be a
