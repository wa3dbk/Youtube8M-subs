device<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> switch<00:00:50.550> where<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.879> can

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
device we have a switch where we can

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
device we have a switch where we can
choose<00:00:51.239> between<00:00:51.469> omnidirectional<00:00:52.469> cardioid

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
choose between omnidirectional cardioid

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.130 
choose between omnidirectional cardioid
and<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.210> put<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> switch<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and if we put the switch right in the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
and if we put the switch right in the
middle<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.579> minus<00:00:56.850> 10<00:00:57.059> decibel<00:00:57.480> mode

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
middle it's a minus 10 decibel mode

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.709 
middle it's a minus 10 decibel mode
which<00:00:58.079> allows<00:00:58.109> us<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.699> record<00:01:00.059> basically

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
which allows us to to record basically

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.060 
which allows us to to record basically
just<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> few<00:01:01.440> inches<00:01:01.559> away<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
just a few inches away from the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369

only works one way camera which one that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.179 
only works one way camera which one that
is<00:01:30.350> but<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.530> look<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.860> side<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.070> the

device we actually have 3.5 millimeter

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
device we actually have 3.5 millimeter
plug<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.460> port<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.180> actually<00:01:36.600> monitor

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
plug in port so we can actually monitor

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
plug in port so we can actually monitor
in<00:01:37.259> real<00:01:37.439> time<00:01:37.710> everything<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:38.610> happening

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
have the USB this is a mini B USB that
actually<00:01:45.090> allows<00:01:45.630> us<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> gain<00:01:46.229> power<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
actually allows us to gain power and
