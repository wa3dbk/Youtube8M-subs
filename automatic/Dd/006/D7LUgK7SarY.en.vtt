00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and a level I can't describe as far as

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.910

what I think you need to do in bits and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
what I think you need to do in bits and
what<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> try<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> moment<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
what I try to do is have a moment of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.530 
what I try to do is have a moment of
discovery<00:01:12.799> he's<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.369> always<00:01:15.119> should<00:01:15.330> have

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
discovery he's like I always should have

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
discovery he's like I always should have
that<00:01:15.659> moment<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.409> where<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.220> used

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that moment in the bit where I go I used

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.570 
that moment in the bit where I go I used
to<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> realize<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to think this but now I realize it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.999 
to think this but now I realize it's
that<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.080> watch<00:01:22.229> patent<00:01:22.710> he<00:01:22.799> does

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that which if you watch patent he does

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.840 
that which if you watch patent he does
that<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> lot<00:01:23.369> man<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.290> 35<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.220> used<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that a lot man when I was 35 I used to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.370 
that a lot man when I was 35 I used to
think<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.320> he

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
10 seconds it's 20 times better a bit

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.170 
10 seconds it's 20 times better a bit
than<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.170> i<00:02:01.200> wrote<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.939> from

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
I have a lot of bits where I try to turn

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.050 
I have a lot of bits where I try to turn
it<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.569> myself<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:20.040> well<00:02:20.310> why<00:02:20.459> do<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.760> feel
