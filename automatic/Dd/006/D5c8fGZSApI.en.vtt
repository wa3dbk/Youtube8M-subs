 in new era games playstation games 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 3 playstation 4 and xbox the year in media 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.290
 digital 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.269
 My personal language is I'm Gaza, I'm here with 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 a blog I'm going to teach you today how 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 this armor I'm wearing here soon 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.510
 At the beginning of the game, let's just get 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.439
 here it there for us to see the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.050
 Hunter 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.720
 We have the hunter hat, the people. 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.760
 have the hunter gloves and we have the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050
 hunter pants sc type of armor 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.990
 That will help you a lot. 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.030
 mainly to take less damage and is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.219
 here exactly where we started 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.829
 very close to you already made a video 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 talking about the first boss and continue 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.710
 seeing old people right here 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.989
 When you start the game, get here. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 you open the stairs go up and open the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 First bulb ball show notes that the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.079
 people opened that gate and we're going 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.420
 on the right side to show you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.039
 it is more or less close to where the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.570
 people kill the first boss 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.160
 so if you've already seen the video you know 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 Where are you going? I'm going to take a 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.109
 shortcut here for us to get more at 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.629
 down a young actress here to see if 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.339
 he trots some stop that he does not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.100
 so we coming down here give 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.290
 just a curve yes in the return that people 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.840
 I was going to make it on the other side, it's already here. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.340
 and it arrives in that part of the fire can 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.439
 running around because we're not 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.439
 Looking for xv now looking for 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.950
 reach the place where you will have this 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.380
 armor is running good care with the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.170
 gun face there because he can 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 hit happens running around here I 'm 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.140
 making the whole journey because sometimes 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 You have not seen the other videos from 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.060
 bodyboard recommends that you see and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.590
 there you do not know this source your 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.250
 reference that guy hitting there 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.350
 also 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 You will have this ladder to climb on 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.310
 same way even as the first boss 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.950
 It's been good here . 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.970
 dog time I recommend killing because 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.310
 because we have to wait for the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.840
 quartet of if there is always important the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.180
 killing time is time 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.340
 that the guys go down wait because they 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 You'll climb in the rush, will you? 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.969
 find these guys they will 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.939
 stop and start fucking bullets 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.759
 is already goes to bag up here up here 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.659
 Have you ever seen this place going there? 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.890
 first voice 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.520
 we do not want to go there soon 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.750
 right back to this point and now people 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.210
 it's kind of lost 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.490
 let's go 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.320
 if we find the place here a 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.110
 another place that we can walk and such 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.270
 You 'll see there, you see the fire. 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.120
 single point of reference 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.570
 There are some people here, a lot of cash. 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.700
 and will break broke more boxes you 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.190
 It can be brutally here, but if you 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.560
 do not want to take the hit, just break this 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.870
 dog ac dc has a good staircase 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.670
 here you will go down this ladder by 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.920
 ball jumps to be faster has 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.930
 Another staircase here I do not know but it goes 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.360
 coming down good here will probably go 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.700
 The enemy is staying, so keep an eye on 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.320
 have an enemy descends once more note 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.010
 who is giggling and could have 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.110
 Been up the stairs from up there 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.270
 here's that big guy and he dies with 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.060
 the four hits came back with the gun on 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.650
 I liked the region, yes, I prefer it. 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.600
 because it gives a greater space for the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.930
 We can play our football. 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.520
 here and then destroy the whole world you dc 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.640
 fight specifically with these critters 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.280
 but it is recommended because it is never 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.410
 had in the bag yesterday another one on the side of 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.640
 here and another behind will also end 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.840
 with you 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.680
 we will fight because then O four hits him 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.360
 already dies 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.880
 depending on your statutes and will 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.990
 keep going here good you come here 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.030
 in this point 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.100
 If you want it can happen, you have to go down. 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.200
 pointing straight to fall here at the point 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.240
 for you have to catch some monsters 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.780
 things here you get that cold blood 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.090
 Weight 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.060
 Our goal is this one right here. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.260
 You 're going down and take a hit here. 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.390
 have an enemy 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.400
 this guy here you're gonna have to kill 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.820
 Beware of the mice behind note that the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.720
 people were almost surprised but it was not 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.660
 this time 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.640
 the rat died there with collateral damage 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.920
 kill and wolf here this giant thing 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.020
 will exchange something from a bottle of 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.000
 blood what you want to do is arrive 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.560
 in this body here it is 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.290
 When you arrive in this body is a 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.630
 Dead hunter, look, just realize that he 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.780
 will give you all the teams all the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.370
 four items just get fit and run 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.840
 for base beauty then I hope 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.430
 I like this video, it was just fast 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.680
 showing you how to get this 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.080
 armor to get you ahead enough because 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.270
 you can face the first boss and 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.710
 Kusano, it's going to get easier since I said 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.960
 For you, how do you get light? 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.750
 what forms the second boss using this 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.970
 armor will help you very much even 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.160
 and will make a video showing the second 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.360
 boss and so is this galera I hope so 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.009
