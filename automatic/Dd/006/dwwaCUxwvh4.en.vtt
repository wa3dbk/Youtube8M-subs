Danny<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:58.010> actually<00:03:58.340> seen<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.610> lot<00:03:58.850> of

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
Danny I have actually seen a lot of

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.930 
Danny I have actually seen a lot of
kittens<00:03:59.990> before<00:04:00.560> us<00:04:00.680> having<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.160> design<00:04:01.580> are

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
kittens before us having this design are

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.699 
kittens before us having this design are
wearing<00:04:02.390> dog<00:04:02.600> collars<00:04:02.989> which<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.350> really

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
wearing dog collars which is really

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.350 
wearing dog collars which is really
dangerous<00:04:03.950> because<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.670> they<00:04:04.790> get<00:04:04.970> hooked<00:04:05.209> on

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
dangerous because if they get hooked on

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.570 
dangerous because if they get hooked on
something<00:04:05.840> there's<00:04:06.050> no<00:04:06.200> safety<00:04:06.500> release<00:04:07.160> to

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
something there's no safety release to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.150 
something there's no safety release to
pull<00:04:07.910> over<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.360> counter<00:04:08.780> can<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.739> tell<00:04:09.980> us<00:04:10.010> a

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
pull over the counter can you tell us a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.610 
pull over the counter can you tell us a
bit<00:04:10.190> about<00:04:10.459> your<00:04:10.730> safety<00:04:11.030> release<00:04:11.620> absolutely

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
bit about your safety release absolutely

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.410 
bit about your safety release absolutely
this<00:04:12.950> is<00:04:13.010> probably<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.520> best<00:04:13.700> selling<00:04:14.120> point

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
this is probably the best selling point

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.590 
this is probably the best selling point
of<00:04:14.630> our<00:04:14.810> whole<00:04:15.050> cats<00:04:15.290> range<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:17.269> reason

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
of our whole cats range and the reason

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.360 
of our whole cats range and the reason
why<00:04:17.810> is<00:04:17.870> because<00:04:18.049> it's<00:04:18.380> got<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.590> variable<00:04:19.190> load

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
why is because it's got a variable load

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.000 
why is because it's got a variable load
lock<00:04:19.640> on<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:19.970> they<00:04:20.660> all<00:04:20.810> come<00:04:21.049> on<00:04:21.079> a<00:04:21.230> three<00:04:21.590> kilo

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
lock on it they all come on a three kilo

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.280 
lock on it they all come on a three kilo
standard<00:04:22.580> setting<00:04:22.970> which<00:04:23.180> makes<00:04:23.480> it<00:04:23.780> safe<00:04:24.050> for

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
standard setting which makes it safe for

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.159 
standard setting which makes it safe for
any<00:04:24.440> cat<00:04:24.740> or<00:04:24.919> keep<00:04:25.100> them<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.400> where<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:26.600> what

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
any cat or keep them to where and what

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.290 
any cat or keep them to where and what
that<00:04:27.350> means<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.800> once<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.310> cat<00:04:28.490> becomes<00:04:28.850> stuck

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
that means is once the cat becomes stuck

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.330 
that means is once the cat becomes stuck
or<00:04:29.510> attached<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.840> something<00:04:30.320> or<00:04:30.890> he<00:04:31.070> brushes
