line the back of your retaining wall

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.160 
line the back of your retaining wall
with<00:00:32.969> plastic<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.570> you're<00:00:33.690> doing<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.050> is

creating a dam so the biggest thing with

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
creating a dam so the biggest thing with
retaining<00:00:38.370> walls<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.059> make<00:00:39.210> sure<00:00:39.239> your

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
retaining walls is to make sure your

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.290 
retaining walls is to make sure your
drainage<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.020> right<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:41.309> we've<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.149> our

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
drainage is right if if we've got our

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
drainage is right if if we've got our
cut<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.690> which<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> wall<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.620> you've<00:00:44.040> got

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
cut here which is the wall if you've got

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.770 
cut here which is the wall if you've got
a<00:00:44.250> slope<00:00:44.550> coming<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> water<00:00:45.570> is

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
a slope coming down and the water is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.240 
a slope coming down and the water is
going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> come<00:00:46.200> down<00:00:46.320> behind<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.829> retaining

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
going to come down behind this retaining

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
going to come down behind this retaining
wall<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.360> water<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
wall you want that water to get in and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
wall you want that water to get in and
flow<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> banking<00:00:51.600> up

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
flow out you don't want it banking up

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.270 
flow out you don't want it banking up
behind<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> wall<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:52.980> increase

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
behind the wall that will increase

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.549 
behind the wall that will increase
weight<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> pressure<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.600> overtime<00:00:55.110> may

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
weight and pressure and overtime may

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.430 
weight and pressure and overtime may
push<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.070> wall<00:00:56.280> forward<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.930> important

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
push that wall forward so very important

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.810 
push that wall forward so very important
that<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> gap<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.670> we're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that you have the gap so what we're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.160 
that you have the gap so what we're
going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.090> first<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> line<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> back<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
going to do first is line the back of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
going to do first is line the back of
the<00:01:01.230> wall<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.590> our<00:01:01.710> GF<00:01:02.039> fabric<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.149> want

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the wall with our GF fabric so we want

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
the wall with our GF fabric so we want
to<00:01:03.390> cut<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> appropriate<00:01:04.290> length<00:01:04.439> just

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
to cut off the appropriate length just

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.350 
to cut off the appropriate length just
for<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> demonstration<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:06.060> only<00:01:06.180> going

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
for the demonstration we're only going

for the demonstration we're only going
to<00:01:06.420> show<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> section<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.619> two

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to show you a section of about two

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
to show you a section of about two
meters<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.180> we'll<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.479> lay<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.930> on

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
meters so we'll just lay that down on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.640 
meters so we'll just lay that down on
the<00:01:10.200> ground

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
the ground

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.440

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
okay so we have a GF fabric here so we

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.250 
okay so we have a GF fabric here so we
just<00:01:23.829> want<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.039> take<00:01:24.189> that<00:01:24.399> fabric

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.790 

put<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.800> down<00:01:27.830> behind<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.520> wall<00:01:32.320> we<00:01:33.320> want<00:01:33.680> to

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
put it down behind the wall we want to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.040 
put it down behind the wall we want to
be<00:01:33.890> able<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.220> fold<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.240> bottom<00:01:35.510> of<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.690> fabric

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
be able to fold the bottom of the fabric

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.899 
be able to fold the bottom of the fabric
up<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.560> around<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.979> pipe<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.460> some<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.820> the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
up and around the pipe and some of the

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.380 
up and around the pipe and some of the
gravel<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.390> we<00:01:38.479> put<00:01:38.659> that<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:40.090> we<00:01:41.090> get<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
gravel and we put that in so we get the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.650 
gravel and we put that in so we get the
fabric<00:01:41.600> down<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.820> whole<00:01:44.000> back<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.479> wall

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
fabric down the whole back of the wall

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.900 
fabric down the whole back of the wall
is<00:01:45.350> lined<00:01:45.740> with<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.040> fabric<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.729> will

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
is lined with the fabric and this will

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.210 
is lined with the fabric and this will
stop<00:01:47.119> any<00:01:47.360> fines<00:01:48.140> or<00:01:48.440> dirt<00:01:48.590> coming<00:01:48.979> through

geo fabric left to be able to fold over

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.130 
geo fabric left to be able to fold over
that<00:02:03.890> pipe<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.460> gravel<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.300> just<00:02:05.750> place<00:02:05.930> some

of<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.350> gravel<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:06.830> now<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:09.259> do<00:02:09.410> need<00:02:09.619> to

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
of this gravel in now you do need to

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.229 
of this gravel in now you do need to
take<00:02:09.979> your<00:02:10.130> time<00:02:10.310> here<00:02:10.610> because<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.060> as

gravel in there now over the top of the
pot<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:25.190> then<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.459> get<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.760> GFO<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.510> we<00:02:26.570> just

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
pot so then we get this GFO and we just

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.670 
pot so then we get this GFO and we just
fold<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.110> over<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.470> top

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
