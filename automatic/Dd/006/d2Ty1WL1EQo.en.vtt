00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
so i'm going to zoom in a little bit

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.060 
so i'm going to zoom in a little bit
more<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.189> distance<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:21.950> come<00:01:22.950> on

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
more to see at a distance of come on

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
more to see at a distance of come on
focus<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.320> come<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:27.710> why<00:01:29.450> come<00:01:30.450> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
focus you can do it come on why come on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.870 
focus you can do it come on why come on
you<00:01:30.750> ought<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.170> focus<00:01:31.439> piece<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.100> crap

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.719 

hey<00:01:37.450> come<00:01:37.750> on<00:01:37.899> so<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.560> guess<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:39.070> can't<00:01:39.280> focus<00:01:39.430> in

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
hey come on so I guess I can't focus in

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.200 
hey come on so I guess I can't focus in
the<00:01:39.820> distance<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.600> if<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.990> do<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
the distance really so if I do that it

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.660 
the distance really so if I do that it
doesn't<00:01:46.659> work<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:48.250> she's<00:01:48.460> at<00:01:48.579> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
doesn't work so so now she's at the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.300 
doesn't work so so now she's at the
distance<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.180> about<00:01:49.360> that's<00:01:50.289> better<00:01:50.470> she<00:01:51.189> has

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
distance of about that's better she has

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:06.120 
distance of about that's better she has
a<00:01:51.340> distance<00:01:51.729> about<00:01:52.000> 150<00:01:52.869> meter<00:01:53.079> so<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.860> now<00:02:06.009> I'm

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
a distance about 150 meter so so now I'm

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.089 
a distance about 150 meter so so now I'm
going<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.340> take<00:02:06.490> my<00:02:06.729> Oh<00:02:07.149> light<00:02:07.659> m2x<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:11.099> she's

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
going to take my Oh light m2x so she's

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.890 
going to take my Oh light m2x so she's
going<00:02:12.340> further<00:02:12.610> she's<00:02:13.269> going<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> go<00:02:13.630> back<00:02:13.870> to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
going further she's going to go back to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.789 
going further she's going to go back to
about<00:02:15.660> 200<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.870> can<00:02:17.110> see<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> distance

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
about 200 so you can see the distance

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.350 
about 200 so you can see the distance
now<00:02:17.860> assumed<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.549> like<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.120> pretty

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
now assumed in like that it's pretty

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.750 
now assumed in like that it's pretty
good<00:02:19.480> because<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.810> can<00:02:19.840> see<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:26.580> I'm<00:02:27.580> going<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
good because you can see so I'm going to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.880 
good because you can see so I'm going to
try<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.060> go<00:02:28.660> back<00:02:28.870> with<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.349> small<00:02:29.950> sons<00:02:31.890> so

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
try to go back with the small sons so

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.130 
try to go back with the small sons so
now<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.069> can<00:02:33.310> see<00:02:33.610> she's<00:02:34.269> at<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> distance<00:02:34.959> of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
now you can see she's at a distance of

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.839 
now you can see she's at a distance of
about<00:02:35.459> 150<00:02:36.459> 200<00:02:37.030> meters<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.530> I'm<00:02:39.519> gonna<00:02:39.640> let

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
about 150 200 meters so I'm gonna let

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.199 
about 150 200 meters so I'm gonna let
her<00:02:39.940> keep<00:02:40.120> going<00:02:40.540> she<00:02:41.049> can<00:02:41.230> go<00:02:41.380> up<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:42.209> this

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
her keep going she can go up to this

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.559 
her keep going she can go up to this
about<00:02:43.690> 300<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.470> 400<00:02:44.920> meters<00:02:45.190> here<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.359> is

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
about 300 to 400 meters here so this is

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.670 
about 300 to 400 meters here so this is
the<00:02:46.900> perfect<00:02:47.140> example<00:02:47.500> for<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:50.230> distance

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the perfect example for the distance

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.890 
the perfect example for the distance
measurements<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.459> I'm<00:02:51.670> gonna<00:02:51.880> let<00:02:52.090> her<00:02:52.239> keep

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
measurements so I'm gonna let her keep

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.789 
measurements so I'm gonna let her keep
going<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.350> little<00:02:53.470> bit<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:53.980> she<00:02:54.130> can<00:02:54.400> go<00:02:54.609> back<00:02:54.819> to

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
going a little bit so she can go back to

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.390 
going a little bit so she can go back to
150<00:02:56.799> meters<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.900> mean<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.230> almost<00:02:59.680> 300<00:03:00.130> meters

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
m2x so you guys can see the distance a

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.720 
m2x so you guys can see the distance a
little<00:03:56.269> bit<00:03:56.810> better<00:03:56.989> so<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.830> can<00:03:57.980> still<00:03:58.400> see

so with the car passing by I'm going to

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.339 
so with the car passing by I'm going to
let<00:05:26.809> the<00:05:26.899> car<00:05:27.110> pass<00:05:28.689> this<00:05:29.689> is<00:05:29.899> trying<00:05:30.169> too<00:05:30.319> hard

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
let the car pass this is trying too hard

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.939 
let the car pass this is trying too hard
to<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:31.069> film<00:05:31.339> on<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.639> small<00:05:31.939> road<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:32.949> she's

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
to the film on the small road so she's

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.809 
to the film on the small road so she's
going<00:05:34.069> to<00:05:34.159> bring<00:05:34.339> back<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.729> zoom<00:05:34.999> here<00:05:36.639> if<00:05:37.639> I

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
going to bring back the zoom here if I

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:39.730 
going to bring back the zoom here if I
might<00:05:38.029> be<00:05:38.149> stopping<00:05:38.449> just<00:05:38.809> to<00:05:38.899> ask<00:05:39.110> what's<00:05:39.499> up

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
might be stopping just to ask what's up

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.629 
might be stopping just to ask what's up
so<00:05:40.009> i<00:05:44.229> might<00:05:45.229> have<00:05:45.409> to<00:05:45.439> read<00:05:45.740> it<00:05:45.860> as<00:05:45.979> view<00:05:46.369> it's

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
so i might have to read it as view it's

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:54.070 
so i might have to read it as view it's
gonna<00:05:46.819> be<00:05:46.939> bitchy<00:05:47.149> if<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.479> Damon

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.260 

alright<00:05:55.080> not<00:05:55.530> solving<00:05:55.950> so<00:05:56.130> that's<00:05:56.340> good<00:05:56.550> all

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
alright not solving so that's good all

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.290 
alright not solving so that's good all
right<00:05:57.390> now<00:05:57.510> let's<00:05:57.780> see<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.050> distance<00:05:59.300> now

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
right now let's see the distance now

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.830 
right now let's see the distance now
this<00:06:00.780> is<00:06:00.840> my<00:06:01.110> m2x<00:06:01.740> now<00:06:02.430> you<00:06:02.490> can<00:06:02.790> see<00:06:03.210> at<00:06:03.510> a

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
this is my m2x now you can see at a

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.510 
this is my m2x now you can see at a
distance<00:06:04.880> she's<00:06:05.880> at<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.210> distance<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:06.780> about

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
distance she's at a distance of about

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.640 
distance she's at a distance of about
300<00:06:08.520> to<00:06:08.640> foreign<00:06:09.090> meters<00:06:09.510> so<00:06:09.780> gonna<00:06:10.380> try<00:06:10.590> to

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
300 to foreign meters so gonna try to

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.820 
300 to foreign meters so gonna try to
zoom<00:06:10.770> in<00:06:11.220> there<00:06:11.460> just<00:06:11.880> leave<00:06:12.390> the<00:06:12.830> camera

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
zoom in there just leave the camera

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.910 
zoom in there just leave the camera
right<00:06:13.980> there<00:06:14.930> try<00:06:15.930> to<00:06:15.990> keep<00:06:16.170> zooming<00:06:16.470> in<00:06:16.800> at

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
right there try to keep zooming in at

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.670 
right there try to keep zooming in at
that<00:06:17.040> distance<00:06:17.780> it's<00:06:18.780> hard<00:06:19.020> to<00:06:19.110> focus<00:06:19.320> with

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
that distance it's hard to focus with

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.210 
that distance it's hard to focus with
the<00:06:19.830> snow<00:06:20.100> and<00:06:20.130> stuff<00:06:20.580> but<00:06:21.440> yeah<00:06:22.440> I<00:06:22.470> can<00:06:22.740> barely

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
the snow and stuff but yeah I can barely

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.630 
the snow and stuff but yeah I can barely
see<00:06:24.980> I'm<00:06:25.980> try<00:06:26.310> to<00:06:26.370> zoom<00:06:26.460> back<00:06:27.950> so<00:06:28.950> you<00:06:29.040> can<00:06:29.310> see

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
see I'm try to zoom back so you can see

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.870 
see I'm try to zoom back so you can see
the<00:06:29.850> distance<00:06:30.300> the<00:06:30.860> small<00:06:31.860> dots<00:06:32.310> a<00:06:32.580> small

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
the distance the small dots a small

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.060 
the distance the small dots a small
speck<00:06:33.210> so<00:06:35.090> try<00:06:36.090> zooming<00:06:36.480> in<00:06:36.570> a<00:06:36.750> little<00:06:36.780> bit<00:06:37.110> you

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
speck so try zooming in a little bit you

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.830 
speck so try zooming in a little bit you
see<00:06:38.250> on<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.370> on<00:06:38.669> the<00:06:38.700> left<00:06:38.970> side<00:06:39.150> corner<00:06:39.540> there

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
see on the on the left side corner there

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
but I can't can make it out in the

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.940 
but I can't can make it out in the
distance<00:06:42.300> so<00:06:43.760> about<00:06:44.760> the<00:06:44.910> practical

video guys so I'm going to go back with

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.550 
video guys so I'm going to go back with
the<00:07:15.979> true<00:07:16.189> knight<00:07:16.400> and<00:07:16.639> the<00:07:16.699> m2x<00:07:17.659> just<00:07:18.379> for

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
the true knight and the m2x just for

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.070 
the true knight and the m2x just for
small<00:07:18.830> comparison<00:07:19.400> sake<00:07:19.599> this<00:07:20.599> is<00:07:20.659> the<00:07:20.900> true

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
small comparison sake this is the true

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.610 
small comparison sake this is the true
knight<00:07:21.229> on<00:07:21.379> full<00:07:21.650> and<00:07:22.810> this<00:07:23.810> is<00:07:23.960> the<00:07:24.110> m2x

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 
knight on full and this is the m2x

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.269 
knight on full and this is the m2x
whoops<00:07:25.039> p.m.<00:07:25.520> 2x<00:07:25.819> on<00:07:25.969> full<00:07:26.180> so<00:07:26.419> add<00:07:27.379> a<00:07:27.680> distance

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:28.279 
whoops p.m. 2x on full so add a distance

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:31.360 
whoops p.m. 2x on full so add a distance
of<00:07:28.400> about<00:07:28.550> 300<00:07:29.360> meters<00:07:30.099> so<00:07:31.099> it's<00:07:31.279> a<00:07:31.340> little

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.370 
of about 300 meters so it's a little

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.019 
of about 300 meters so it's a little
harder<00:07:31.939> to<00:07:32.060> tell<00:07:32.330> but<00:07:33.669> you<00:07:34.669> know<00:07:34.759> this

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:35.029 
harder to tell but you know this

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:36.969 
harder to tell but you know this
flashlight<00:07:35.479> is<00:07:35.870> a<00:07:35.900> little<00:07:36.229> bit<00:07:36.349> more<00:07:36.499> powerful

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:36.979 
flashlight is a little bit more powerful

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:38.980 
flashlight is a little bit more powerful
now<00:07:37.129> it<00:07:37.610> is<00:07:37.699> a<00:07:37.729> little<00:07:37.999> bit<00:07:38.120> more<00:07:38.360> spill<00:07:38.749> with

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 
now it is a little bit more spill with

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.659 
now it is a little bit more spill with
that<00:07:39.169> one<00:07:39.379> so<00:07:39.529> i'm<00:07:39.620> going<00:07:39.740> to<00:07:39.800> try<00:07:40.159> to<00:07:40.219> get<00:07:40.460> a

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:40.669 
that one so i'm going to try to get a

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.640 
that one so i'm going to try to get a
little<00:07:40.789> bit<00:07:40.999> forward<00:07:41.300> a<00:07:41.509> little<00:07:42.319> bit<00:07:42.409> more

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.650 
little bit forward a little bit more

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.149 
little bit forward a little bit more
spill<00:07:44.050> and<00:07:45.050> now<00:07:45.199> you<00:07:45.259> can<00:07:45.500> barely<00:07:45.800> see

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 
spill and now you can barely see

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.939 
spill and now you can barely see
anything<00:07:46.729> so<00:07:47.120> over<00:07:47.270> there<00:07:47.419> so<00:07:47.659> all<00:07:48.560> right<00:07:48.740> so

anything so over there so all right so
this<00:07:49.069> is<00:07:49.159> going<00:07:49.250> to<00:07:49.340> conclude<00:07:49.639> my<00:07:49.729> video<00:07:50.090> I'm

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:50.180 
this is going to conclude my video I'm
