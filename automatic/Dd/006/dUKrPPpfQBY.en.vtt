00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:14.520
 hello there is another knife for the company 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:19.600
 serki go today us on the model review 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.429
 16 carson design well and if you see this 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.130
 small modest production inscription 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.769
 it is despite being produced 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.680
 in Taiwan, the attitude to knives sirketi me 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:34.180
 what is that something close to the chinese and 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.920
 despite the general good in principle 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.590
 workmanship there are such 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.079
 such shoals that make appearance 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.969
 is it to push the floor with some such 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.430
 cheap, well, actually 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.129
 Now I will explain what is the matter well firstly 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.960
 let's talk about him 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 tactical and technical characteristics 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.390
 everything is done correctly 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.149
 blade length we have 10 centimeters at 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.699
 total length of 23 and a half centimeters then 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.670
 there is a knife not a small knife is pretty 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.990
 full size is the thickness of the butt 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.490
 here level 3 plan millimeters well and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.009
 this whole knife is also quite a lot 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.950
 since the design is absolutely no 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.140
 way not relieved then here we have 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.540
 steel liners 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.229
 lock liner lock and on top such here 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.759
 dice I'm afraid to say what it is 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.210
 there is it possible both wood and 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.000
 plastic's and university's image of such 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.100
 girls exterior view 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.430
 This is one of the reasons why this knife is for me. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.940
 I do not like the outside that's pretty 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.100
 massive blade but with such two 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.010
 cards if you can say so alone 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.800
 of which used as a flipper 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:51.750
 well if the remote can be pretty good at 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.660
 this is one of those things that me 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 always annoying is the presence of play 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.890
 which, however, cannot be eliminated without loss 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.710
 opening speed that is, I tried 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.130
 lubricate this knife and still play 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.630
 here is the backlash exactly 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.459
 transverse longitudinal play of course 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.970
 no mind contributes to here such here 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 best tradition stoppers implemented with 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.800
 two sides since the flipper in hyper 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.560
 fix they used no way 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 can because here they are actually 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.150
 are close to the dies of the handle then 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.520
 There is a hook out of here on the blade for the stock 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.090
 but very difficult and inconvenient absolutely not 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.060
 makes no sense 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.640
 nevertheless despite the good 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.260
 entry line-in liner despite 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.430
 I do not know what shaybochki will be 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.410
 can be seen on the second fluoroplastic 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.269
 metal 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.549
 there is an elevator and if you tighten the blade 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.060
 just stop flip that is well 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.910
 such 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 inevitable thing let's go to ipsy 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.720
 the clip is nice 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.690
 four-position ie wear a knife 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.640
 it is possible both for deprive and for right-handed 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.269
 very comfortable with the tips up. out 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.040
 collect at your discretion 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.470
 lining mounted on two points 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.329
 plus axial screw today with another 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.209
 parties we have them are just so flat 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:19.519
 the side accordingly is chewing the stock with 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.519
 one side centering film 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.610
 it feels good 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.760
 the clip is not very deep pretty 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.319
 intensely but at the same time this is the part 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.930
 the knife will stick out of pocket 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.690
 plus I will see the blade 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.140
 never natural if hung on the other 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.030
 parties 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.800
 the picture will be a little better but I don't 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.950
 imagine generally wearing this knife from 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.190
 these pocket clippers that is they just 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.930
 stick out in all directions and inevitably prevents 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.239
 that is, with a mobile phone in your pocket is not exactly 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.090
 by wear plus is likely to be 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.599
 pretty fucking your jeans 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.890
 castle castle 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.630
 well here liner lock is already clear but 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.250
 Now close this knife with one hand 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.660
 real pain in the ass because 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.530
 there is such a fuse here 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:10.030
 disable it can not and in order to 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.799
 click on the liner you must first click on 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.769
 gravity fuse it is also not that 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.690
 have we push after that we push 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.560
 on the liner let go of the lever 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.460
 and with one finger fold the blade and this 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.500
 big hemorrhoids in my opinion absolutely 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.520
 Do you need a feature that is not always 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.810
 it turns out to be done with one hand 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.780
 respectively, two hands on everything easier 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.630
 that is, everything just turns out well, I'm here 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.990
 such a knife is definitely not a bunch of you 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.979
 on here it is useless blade serrated 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.669
 plus tanto 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.340
 Well, such a lowering of the butt, that is, it 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.680
 basically a classic tanto shape 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.560
 but since there is literally here 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.940
 how many two centimeters of the serreytor we have 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.680
 chisel that is, there is a start but 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.770
 on the other hand that supply 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.120
 here it is simply artificial 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.510
 created by user 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.760
 that is, this knife was dragged initially 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.390
 there was a completely flat side 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.280
 I do not like this and wipe it home 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.870
 do evil well, work at least in this 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.960
 performance that is, I have already talked about it 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.930
 I like the tip in my videos 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.300
 pretty powerful i mean pick it up 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.070
 that it will be very convenient well and grip 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.750
 the knife is also completely different 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.340
 that is, in general, here's the ergonomics of me 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.320
 completely satisfied here you can 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.630
 use even fencing grip then 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.610
 there is here a finger rests on a 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.030
 a small tick on which by the way even 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.100
 there is a notch it is not clear what was 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.170
 the exact move is also very easy that is 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.560
 the knife is so powerful and generally have 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.560
 some kind of claim to how i even 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.520
 I do not know whether in the combat knife that's something that is 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.110
 performed in such army standards 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.070
 still it increased security to 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.710
 he did not close wear this extra here but 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.740
 In general, my verdict to this knife I would 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.660
 put points 5 out of 10 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.510
 to become here is simple, most likely 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.270
 aus-8 unfortunately mark they are written in 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.900
 blade but in appearance something in it 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.240
 kind of usually puts on such knives 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.330
 Well, on top of the coating is gray 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.990
 uniform which however is hardly 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.900
 will affect corrosion resistance and 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.790
 if you look at it at all 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.820
 look here right next to the icon 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:41.030
 sirketi can see so small 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.730
 little dots are nascent 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.540
 rust, that is, you need to be careful 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.130
 because this knife can in one wet 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.890
 day when bring you so unpleasant 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.220
 some kind of surprise here 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.160
 inconsistent review 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.570
 a little confusing to me even a 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.010
 I hope you were interested thank you all 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.010
 for watching luck and bye
