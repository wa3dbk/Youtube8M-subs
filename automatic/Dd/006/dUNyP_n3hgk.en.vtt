00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.270
 good morning my loves today is Friday and 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.120
 We are a one-day law for 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.120
 finish this challenge that we started now 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.190
 almost a month exactly and today 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.110
 I'm going to have something normal breakfast 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.279
 thought of making some protein pancakes 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.339
 and in nabai and because he had wishes and not 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.810
 It turns out that when I go to dinner I gave myself 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.749
 mind that I only had these 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.619
 two toasts in the package 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:32.149
 then already to walk it then a 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.850
 little bit of cheese too that my son 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.710
 they had left and this is a little bit of 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.120
 ham I said no no the thing is not 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.359
 waste you remember I told you 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.219
 my loves as always breakfast what 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.960
 have faster and closer do not 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.969
 complicate life so much this type of 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.339
 breakfast that I always do what can 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.809
 substitute these cookies do not have to 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.640
 be these this can also be 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.699
 substitute for whole wheat bread 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.489
 I said ok what happens is that for me 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.530
 version is much easier because I know 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.960
 mother of two toddlers still 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.309
 so I take this fast and I do not 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.530
 I have nothing to cut anything 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.180
 apart from that it does not make me hard if 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.490
 pan out for the 3 days I 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.560
 put hard and this gives the advantage for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.759
 this I use that ok but that does not mean 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.799
 that if you eat for bread 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.350
 comprehensive diet new function at 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.929
 number this does the same function as a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.820
 bread between integral the master if he has to 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.009
 be turkey ham and chicken has to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.229
 be cooked more or less something like that true 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.960
 because it turns out that he has less 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.880
 calories then I could also take 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.070
 a cup of coffee today on 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.350
 all for breakfast and let's eat 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.729
 burning already the yellow mesh wants to eat 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.729
 we are so many 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.620

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.180
 Girls are 2 in the afternoon and I'm done 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.580
 get friends early very big like that is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 I'm going to jump quickly to the gym 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.690
 that this week I could only go on 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.220
 Monday and Friday the rest of the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.650
 week I had to do home starts 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.270

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.310
 channel my husband has a new job 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.840
 and he's late so he can not do it anymore 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.950
 I can not get there early 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.020
 help me with the children so that I go 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.420
 to the gym so I have to take advantage 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.920
 the moment then I get the bar 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.500
 I'm going to the gym 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.470
 if they look at you too much tapadita because 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.470
 it turns out that it's getting cold here 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.550
 so it does not matter cold snow rain 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.140

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.880

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.960
 carbohydrates to replenish energy 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.600
