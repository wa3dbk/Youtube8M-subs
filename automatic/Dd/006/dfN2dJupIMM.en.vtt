00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
of the HTC touch diamond as you can see

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.420 
of the HTC touch diamond as you can see
this<00:00:15.930> looks<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.260> lot<00:00:16.410> like<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> original<00:00:17.160> euro

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this looks a lot like the original euro

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.340 
this looks a lot like the original euro
diamond<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.690> little<00:00:18.869> bit<00:00:19.050> thicker

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
diamond but it's a little bit thicker

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.990 
diamond but it's a little bit thicker
because<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.519> has<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> larger<00:00:21.150> battery<00:00:22.759> the<00:00:23.759> back

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
because it has a larger battery the back

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.070 
because it has a larger battery the back
is<00:00:24.380> matte<00:00:25.580> finish<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.419> doesn't<00:00:27.749> pick<00:00:27.839> up<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
is matte finish so it doesn't pick up a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.870 
is matte finish so it doesn't pick up a
million<00:00:28.349> fingerprints<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.279> still<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
million fingerprints it still has the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.640 
million fingerprints it still has the
diamond<00:00:30.240> faceted<00:00:30.749> back<00:00:30.929> though<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.499> looks

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
diamond faceted back though so it looks

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.680 
diamond faceted back though so it looks
very<00:00:31.740> cool<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.310> certainly<00:00:32.759> unique<00:00:35.690> that's
