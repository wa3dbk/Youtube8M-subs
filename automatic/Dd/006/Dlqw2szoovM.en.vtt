secondary market it's a nice figure I'm

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.720 
secondary market it's a nice figure I'm
not<00:03:43.080> sure<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.620> worth<00:03:43.709> paying<00:03:44.250> three<00:03:44.700> times

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
store not six months ago so I'm a little

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.370 
store not six months ago so I'm a little
torn<00:03:51.060> about<00:03:51.420> whether<00:03:51.569> or<00:03:51.690> not<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.959> recommend

you<00:03:52.800> go<00:03:52.980> out<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:53.580> this<00:03:53.850> because<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.390> you

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
you go out and get this because I you

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.500 
you go out and get this because I you
know<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:55.290> all<00:03:55.410> plastic<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:56.760> poses<00:03:57.030> really

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
know it's all plastic it poses really

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.590 
know it's all plastic it poses really
well

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.310 

and<00:04:02.670> all<00:04:03.670> those<00:04:03.880> everything's<00:04:04.330> tight<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.170> I'm

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
and all those everything's tight so I'm

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.060 
and all those everything's tight so I'm
having<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.680> hard<00:04:05.860> time<00:04:05.920> man<00:04:06.280> cable<00:04:06.700> and

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
having a hard time man cable and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.170 
having a hard time man cable and
ironically<00:04:09.070> if<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.250> want<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.460> turn<00:04:09.670> his<00:04:09.970> arm

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
ironically if you want to turn his arm

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.810 
ironically if you want to turn his arm
to<00:04:10.390> fire<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:11.290> example<00:04:11.800> I<00:04:11.830> like<00:04:12.100> how<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.400> sort

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
to fire for example I like how the sort

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.440 
to fire for example I like how the sort
of<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.000> wings<00:04:13.620> move<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:15.700> almost<00:04:15.940> reminds<00:04:16.300> me

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
of the wings move it almost reminds me

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.000 
of the wings move it almost reminds me
of<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.600> cartoon<00:04:17.140> how<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.470> wings<00:04:17.739> would

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
of the cartoon how the wings would

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.740 
of the cartoon how the wings would
always<00:04:18.280> just<00:04:18.459> not<00:04:18.700> be<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.150> way<00:04:19.330> for<00:04:19.660> the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
always just not be in the way for the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.010 
always just not be in the way for the

released<00:04:57.220> in<00:04:57.400> these<00:04:57.520> waves<00:04:57.760> because<00:04:57.970> there's

some lace figures and I think a lot of
folks<00:04:59.770> missed<00:05:00.040> out<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.310> these<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:01.540> there<00:05:02.380> you
