hole right there now when I pulled the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.439 
hole right there now when I pulled the
timing<00:00:15.330> cover<00:00:15.480> off<00:00:16.400> I<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.880> able<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.300> grab

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
timing cover off I was able to just grab

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.000 
timing cover off I was able to just grab
that<00:00:18.720> ball<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.170> fingers<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.710> thread<00:00:19.920> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
that ball with my fingers and thread it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.370 
that ball with my fingers and thread it
out<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.730> wasn't<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.020> corroded

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
out so it wasn't like it was corroded

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.990 
out so it wasn't like it was corroded
into<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> block<00:00:23.310> or<00:00:24.180> whatever<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.750> bad<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
into the block or whatever so bad that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.700 
into the block or whatever so bad that
was<00:00:27.000> finger<00:00:27.359> tight<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.810> mean<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.080> destroyed<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
was finger tight I mean I destroyed it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
was finger tight I mean I destroyed it
because<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.010> had<00:00:29.130> drilled<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> from<00:00:30.150> back

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
because I had drilled into it from back

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.669 
because I had drilled into it from back
here<00:00:30.330> by<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> timing<00:00:31.140> cover<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.529> had

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
here by the timing cover and I had

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.950 
here by the timing cover and I had
marred<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> timing<00:00:32.579> cover<00:00:32.700> too<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.809> look

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
marred up the timing cover too but look

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.819 
marred up the timing cover too but look
it's<00:00:34.559> fine<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> great<00:00:36.719> news<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> thorn

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
really need all ready bought the timing

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
really need all ready bought the timing
gears<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> chain<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> stuff

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
this off with the new one on is that bad

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.380 
this off with the new one on is that bad
right<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.050> other<00:01:01.140> side

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.650 

about<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.170> same<00:01:05.379> as<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.770> side<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.390> it's<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
about the same as this side so it's a

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.690 
about the same as this side so it's a
new<00:01:07.870> one<00:01:08.080> that's<00:01:08.560> Lackey<00:01:09.010> or<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.520> new<00:01:09.670> one

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
kinds of green I don't know if you can

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.880 
kinds of green I don't know if you can
see<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.460> key<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:16.780> they<00:01:16.990> look<00:01:17.260> like<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.740> that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
see the key what they look like is that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.440 
see the key what they look like is that
I<00:01:18.160> can't<00:01:18.490> see<00:01:18.700> what<00:01:18.850> you're<00:01:18.880> seeing<00:01:19.240> let<00:01:19.390> me

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
I can't see what you're seeing let me

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.060 
I can't see what you're seeing let me
get<00:01:19.600> my<00:01:19.690> new<00:01:19.900> finder<00:01:20.290> set<00:01:20.530> up<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.920> those

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
get my new finder set up there are those

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.180 
get my new finder set up there are those
teeth<00:01:24.370> good<00:01:24.670> bad<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.860> normal<00:01:27.340> abnormal<00:01:27.880> I

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
teeth good bad that normal abnormal I

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.570 
teeth good bad that normal abnormal I
don't<00:01:30.190> know

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
don't know

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.120 
don't know
never<00:01:31.000> seen<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.300> before<00:01:31.450> yeah<00:01:32.020> they<00:01:32.860> say

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
never seen that before yeah they say

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.070 
never seen that before yeah they say
that<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.370> have<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.700> leave<00:01:33.940> that<00:01:34.600> yet<00:01:34.810> take

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
that you have to leave that yet take

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.840 
that you have to leave that yet take
that<00:01:35.290> bolt<00:01:35.680> out<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.310> thing<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.640> where<00:01:36.790> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
that bolt out this thing is where the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.700 
that bolt out this thing is where the
harmonic<00:01:37.330> balancer<00:01:37.360> puts<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.259> there<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.650> I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
harmonic balancer puts in there and I

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.460 
harmonic balancer puts in there and I
tried<00:01:39.190> for<00:01:39.490> an<00:01:39.550> hour<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.869> figure<00:01:41.080> out<00:01:41.290> that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
tried for an hour to figure out that

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.530 
tried for an hour to figure out that
gear<00:01:41.770> puller<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.700> pull<00:01:42.940> that<00:01:43.090> harmonic

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
gear puller to pull that harmonic

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.749 
gear puller to pull that harmonic
balancer<00:01:44.020> off<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.650> whole<00:01:44.830> time<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.430> should

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
balancer off the whole time I should

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.550 
balancer off the whole time I should
have<00:01:45.970> just<00:01:46.090> left<00:01:46.300> this<00:01:46.509> bolt<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:47.080> because<00:01:47.440> it

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
have just left this bolt in because it

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.080 
have just left this bolt in because it
wasn't<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.070> rod<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.700> have<00:01:48.790> anything<00:01:49.000> to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
wasn't in that rod to have anything to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.730 
wasn't in that rod to have anything to
