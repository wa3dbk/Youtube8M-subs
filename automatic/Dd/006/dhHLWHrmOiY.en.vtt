 portugal a long time ago 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.810
 I started working with fabrics first in those Pernambuco when I 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.950
 I was 17 years old and I started with the fabrics making 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.970
 also leaves a little seam I ended up getting involved with this not a few of the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.960
 tissues then minister and recognize at age 17 with 4 years and was predicted predicts 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 that the previous one of são paulo and I came here with 19 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.760
 considered the victims of this murderous desire that I have seen many attackers 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.050
 being estimated from men's fashion 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.790
 and to the question of the surgery having to create a waistline in a frame of a month 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.060
 the latter in the figure of man 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.930
 it was almost one by one 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.340
 a joke that also 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.330
 the clowns of this commission as an argument also demands from it a 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.289
 jokes to create a strange idea same idea of ​​this collection was ugly 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.620
 but for me it's a milestone at the moment in my work 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.860
 how to create an indefinite strangeness in different people would like it or not 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.130
 to like or not but the question was to create strangeness to create this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.070
 same type 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.590
 it is possible to change to be and rita 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.320
 know if note can be more rounded can be a disaster so block the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.320
 culture then it is a matter of this collection is this 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:16.219
 It's a checking account to go to the breeder's house. 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.269
 send a boom 95 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.009
 andré had an office of his in the gallery of the end 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.000
 when I also had a store too 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.170
 so I started there to make André's head miserable until I convinced him 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.389
 takes a while 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.860
 but this is how a wave appears he asked to see a Corsican was that the uncle 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.590
 mounted from a collection 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.590
 sami cost of inflation 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.039
 in the meantime wounded sequence this reasoning of the feminine because I wanted 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.619
 to work on the counterpoint of the past collection, or a 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:59.359
 collection a flamboyant Florida collection and that's what I did on the bias that 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.269
 it was a technique 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.290
 the acts committed 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.929
 on the women's 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:04.870
 full of faith 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.219
 these fragments fall at the headquarters of the deic 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.299
 and to justify also that the doors and we have captive to be more face of the 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:11.940
 people 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.309
 due story 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.289
 and how he was working with a counterpoint and male and female 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.019
 level also hit counterpoints also rich brent type 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.609
 which is also the audience is also very strong within my work 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.449
 because it's part of my story, know time. 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.769
 it is very hard for gini to accept how fashion maker is 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.030
 result of a family 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.240
 very simple and I could not 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.410
 It's at home this is not in this fashion thing that is a little more he had this 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.499
 is not the equation 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.049
 footloose this thing that the more expensive the better the richer the better 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.969
 then I will have my work developed that counterpoint also 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.370
 We have knowledge 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.509
 this type of vehicle 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.900
 so hickory and they must remake this counterpoint with fashion, even if fashion 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.120
 what to do can not be missed the contract provided you to play exactly 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.120
 with a stimulating and strong effect 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.769
 she brings me a collection I go I intend to do a year and a half in 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.380
 these are the ones that have made it very playful then and it does 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.320
 of leader of a fragile and almost childlike man 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.160
 the deadline began trying to work a man more 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.189
 strong plus male I think in fact the increase he is without option 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.250
 Brazilians I think like 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.340
 three stylists are dedicated to making a difference and this 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.670
 focus on this issue of the commercial so I believe that man and 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.550
 lili even has this will 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.780
 but he does not have the options of what we buy negociata 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.190
 No, not abroad, you? 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.650
 millions of shares of people freaking out every day because the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.979
 hospital is the market is more open in the 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.319
 and here does not have a I believe the lack of product option is what the 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.370
 leads to this thing still very caught up in the boys but things are a little 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.970
 more complex than everything that looks like then I'm also a one brand 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.580
 hector timerman 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.190
 so this already makes things a little difficult for your associates to not 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.700
 makes both 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.590
 and my commercial uncle also he is a bit to him a little 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.410
 smaller than the conceptual understood then these are things that I still 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.629
 I have to solve anything is nothing but in my career to be able to evolve 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.960
 really my job and go to another weeks of more commercial fashion 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.629
 p with those we have our dear ones 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.139
 are happening
