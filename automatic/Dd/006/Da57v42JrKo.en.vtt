 The Pope wants to buy better safely 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.509
 price and many payment options 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.099
 then access the fifa link with zone 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.770

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.630
 cohesion and recommends 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.410
 and there everything is right here talking and 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.630
 Welcome, but you challenge here in the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 today we will be challenged by the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.950
 daniel beyond the home tab to david 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.750
 Who does not know how the show works? 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.820
 It's very simple, you have 90 minutes to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.710
 win me if you win me I'll 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 paid the value of the player who in the case here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.700
 today is homeless and if you lose or 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 tie you do not even have to pay anything 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.950
 Tranquility, but I take risks here. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.280
 in the series it was very difficult to find someone 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.440
 to play here for the xbox guys already'm the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.720
 45 minutes waiting to get 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.490
 record the video because the first 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.009
 person who answered me that is where 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.479
 I do there on twitter, it 's the draw I 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.250
 I talk about it to deceive myself that the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.509
 first person who answered it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.650
 stayed 20 minutes trying not to 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.810
 we got 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.330
 then I went for six more people 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.729
 who had responded in the sequence or 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.990
 no answer was not at home or etc. 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.300
 etc etc 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.649
 it was very difficult for them to find 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.770
 people here on xbox 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.960
 I always talk about it and I do not have it 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.509
 so much time to be available 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.069
 to record the videos here on the non- channel 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 cheering said humbly or something of the kind 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.000
 I hope you understand and maybe 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.490
 Geez, I can do more. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.429
 sporadically xbox do not want to prioritize 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.069
 playstation 4 but it's very much 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.350
 complicated the issue of xbox first 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.080
 platform that is not the best 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.509
 my seeing always gives problem does not always give 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.289
 to go first to find the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.990
 person 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.690
 the second because it is the majority of people 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.179
 that follow me on twitter at least they 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.520
 playstation and is much simpler 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.009
 do by playstation then i have 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.420
 seriously thought about the continuation 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.640
 here at least in the series 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.890
 current events throughout the week there 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.380
 raffle in xbox might reduce it to two 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.050
 times a month and six times a month in the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.060
 playstation 4 maybe more anyway have to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.220
 think about it but I already share with 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.260
 Here you are, what I feel here when I 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.830
 I come to play in xbox. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.980
 The other thing is that if you want 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.209
 It's very simple, it's just you. 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.770
 follow on twitter 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.299
 I'll ask you here, challenge me. 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.519
 first person to respond 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.379
 She comes to play with me, remembering. 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.900
 that I have sham the first person does not 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.510
 can 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.250
 gabriel did not work here 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.209
 platform that google fully 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.620
 tried five times was not and then 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.360
 remembering that I tried to play against the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.610
 people and do not get good 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.439
 after all this introduction here three 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.450
 rolling minutes I hope you guys 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.670
 understand as I said let's go to the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.620
 I play pro game against daniel com 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.620
 this team has on the screen a team of 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.640
 connects abip al ahli in the rear and in front of 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.189
 a team from the series 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.709
 There and there is Daniel's team. 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.019
 a team of guys together with biptel diego 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.269
 Coast story sandro mangala 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.599
 I felt really interesting though . 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.599
 game 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:25.269
 Beautiful ball and tevez beautiful ball in tevez 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.359
 I dominated too bad but the ball entered a 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.879
 strange shape magnets very strange that 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.370
 goal there with the time go of the mass too 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.439
 I should hardly have run and hit the goal 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.750
 even so the goal there that we did 1 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:42.340
 0 in a home and does not hit Rossi 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.620
 put in front rossi is advancing 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.549
 Rossi can hit Rossi where he made the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.500
 defense almost rebounds to 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.620
 ball is coming coming in July and hit 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.959
 was dangerous 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.709
 It should be left Marquisio maicon 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.299
 marquisio already has marquinhos going to hit 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:07.930
 marquise and managed to block in front 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:11.560
 at the time her mother's ball and send it there 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.000
 bangela our defender did the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.370
 second goal of our team for us 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.799
 stay a little quieter 30 minutes 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.690
 two to zero hours on top of him and 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.380
 first time we are better in the game 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.789
 we have more 92% finalizations in accuracy 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.789
 in the pass is to continue like this for us 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.710
 leave with the victory 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.620
 andrade has already drawn the ball or brought 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.699
 square can drop the foot on top of 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.880
 howard 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.560
 the ball arrives good arrival of our team 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.830
 We already led the tevez gave a stop. 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.650
 we brought 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.510
 mano daniel put his team looks like 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.940
 that the old boom is very difficult 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.110
 Stick the lock here is very difficult. 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.730
 also for him to attack my team, right? 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.790
 but let's see if we can get anything 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:01.880
 quicoli there looks there looks there was 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.930
 prevented the goal the ball I've hit 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.400
 get out 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.990
 the referee blows the final game and won 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.420
 daniel by match 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.490
 still right there several guys 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.530
 wins a long time I lose I do not think 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.000
 they already do maybe ten episodes here 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.670
 that not at least I do not remember having 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.430
 lost in the last ten episodes to 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.470
 people coming to play you challenge the 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.750
 our best in the field so it was Rossi 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.290
 with note 8.8 while the highlight was 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.240
 tim howard with note 8.1 we will give a 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.180
 look at the statistics we dominate the game 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.770
 left say to 1 we had half of the possession 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.590
 Ball and 89 percent accuracy in 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.720
 pass against 77 galley 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.970
 have you heard and voiced about the xbox 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.100
 I'll keep trying but stay well. 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.590
 Of course I can not lose a 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.280
 hour and a half two hours to record one 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.200
 simple a simple need chips 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.730
 start and it takes 20 minutes 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.950
 I hope you understand my side. 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.540
 we will also continue to try, but if 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.640
 continue in this way probably 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.540
 I will have to review some things gives 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.460
