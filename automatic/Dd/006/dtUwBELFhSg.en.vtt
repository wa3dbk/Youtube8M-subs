out of that I felt that felt wonderful

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.029 
out of that I felt that felt wonderful
all<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.090> way<00:00:27.300> through<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:28.439> always<00:00:28.830> thought

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
all the way through I've always thought

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.339 
all the way through I've always thought
oh<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.429> must<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.840> something<00:00:30.840> else<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
oh there must be something else that I

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.639 
oh there must be something else that I
could<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.769> made<00:00:31.949> better<00:00:32.540> but<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.660> 1992<00:00:34.380> on

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
could have made better but in 1992 on

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.440 
could have made better but in 1992 on
Georgio<00:00:35.070> me<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> did<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> Grand<00:00:36.210> Prix

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
Georgio me when I did the Grand Prix

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.780 
Georgio me when I did the Grand Prix
this<00:00:37.170> has<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.500> start<00:00:37.739> perfect<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.250> me<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.489> think

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
this has to start perfect for me I think

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.220 
this has to start perfect for me I think
possibly<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.600> didn't<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> huge

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
possibly because I didn't have a huge

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
possibly because I didn't have a huge
knowledge<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.680> those<00:00:40.829> days<00:00:41.070> either<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
knowledge in those days either but the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
knowledge in those days either but the
horse<00:00:42.239> felt<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.629> air<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.379> he<00:00:43.620> didn't<00:00:43.860> make<00:00:43.920> any

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
horse felt on air and he didn't make any

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.670 
horse felt on air and he didn't make any
mistakes<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.000> he<00:00:45.690> won<00:00:45.899> by<00:00:46.110> quite<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> large

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
mistakes and he won by quite a large

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.910 
mistakes and he won by quite a large
margin<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.870> was<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.320> absolutely

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
margin and it was just absolutely

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
margin and it was just absolutely
brilliant<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.239> feeling<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
brilliant and then the feeling that I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
brilliant and then the feeling that I
