technologies<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.550> we<00:00:40.360> have<00:00:40.480> come<00:00:41.020> up<00:00:41.170> with

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
technologies and we have come up with

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.790 
technologies and we have come up with
idea<00:00:41.710> that<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.550> e<00:00:42.579> matrix<00:00:43.350> sub<00:00:44.350> lady<00:00:44.590> of

idea that the e matrix sub lady of

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.590 
idea that the e matrix sub lady of
rejuvenation<00:00:45.370> would<00:00:45.730> be<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.180> best<00:00:46.390> for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
rejuvenation would be the best for

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.350 
rejuvenation would be the best for
mikela<00:00:47.020> has<00:00:47.230> been<00:00:47.610> numbed<00:00:48.610> for<00:00:48.880> about<00:00:49.090> 30

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
mikela has been numbed for about 30

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.540 
mikela has been numbed for about 30
minutes<00:00:49.600> with<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.320> topical<00:00:50.770> numbing<00:00:50.920> cream

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
minutes with the topical numbing cream

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.930 
minutes with the topical numbing cream
this<00:00:51.940> has<00:00:52.149> been<00:00:52.329> now<00:00:52.480> wiped<00:00:52.750> off<00:00:52.989> her<00:00:53.230> skin<00:00:53.590> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this has been now wiped off her skin and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.479 
this has been now wiped off her skin and
we<00:00:54.940> will<00:00:55.090> be<00:00:55.210> using<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.719> e<00:00:56.140> matrix<00:00:56.469> using<00:00:57.309> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
we will be using the e matrix using the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.100 
we will be using the e matrix using the
64<00:00:58.739> pulse<00:00:59.880> handpiece<00:01:00.880> and<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.809> should<00:01:01.960> be<00:01:02.079> a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
64 pulse handpiece and this should be a

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.429 
64 pulse handpiece and this should be a
very<00:01:02.290> simple<00:01:02.610> treatment<00:01:03.610> for<00:01:04.829> as<00:01:05.829> you<00:01:06.640> can<00:01:06.790> see

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
very simple treatment for as you can see

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.160 
very simple treatment for as you can see
mikela<00:01:08.439> is<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:09.659> skin<00:01:10.659> type

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
mikela is a skin type

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.239 
mikela is a skin type
-<00:01:11.380> she's<00:01:12.039> a<00:01:12.090> white<00:01:13.090> skin<00:01:13.539> type<00:01:13.780> -<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:14.439> this

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
- she's a white skin type - and this

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.819 
- she's a white skin type - and this
machine<00:01:15.999> will<00:01:16.299> work<00:01:16.479> for<00:01:16.689> her<00:01:16.749> very<00:01:16.929> well<00:01:17.139> we

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
machine will work for her very well we

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.190 
machine will work for her very well we
use<00:01:18.009> this<00:01:18.189> machine<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:18.909> lot<00:01:19.509> for<00:01:19.749> people<00:01:19.990> who

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
use this machine a lot for people who

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.429 
use this machine a lot for people who
are<00:01:20.350> darker<00:01:20.829> skin<00:01:21.189> like<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.999> type<00:01:22.240> 3<00:01:22.600> 4<00:01:23.079> or<00:01:23.409> 5

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
are darker skin like the type 3 4 or 5

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.620 
are darker skin like the type 3 4 or 5
or<00:01:24.039> even<00:01:24.069> 6<00:01:25.319> because<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:27.630> radiofrequency

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
or even 6 because the radiofrequency

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.160 
or even 6 because the radiofrequency
that<00:01:29.340> spares<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.520> epidermis<00:01:31.090> therefore<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
that spares the epidermis therefore the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.690 
that spares the epidermis therefore the
chances<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.770> getting<00:01:32.920> post<00:01:33.399> inflammatory

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
chances of getting post inflammatory

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.480 
chances of getting post inflammatory
hyperpigmentation<00:01:34.289> and<00:01:35.369> essentially<00:01:36.369> any

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
hyperpigmentation and essentially any

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.550 
hyperpigmentation and essentially any
kind<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.759> pigmentation<00:01:37.209> is<00:01:37.450> very<00:01:37.659> small<00:01:37.990> so

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
kind of pigmentation is very small so

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.519 
kind of pigmentation is very small so
for<00:01:38.770> darker<00:01:39.159> skin<00:01:39.189> patients<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:41.170> acne

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:41.529 
for darker skin patients with acne

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:44.399 
for darker skin patients with acne
scarring<00:01:41.829> or<00:01:42.389> just<00:01:43.389> to<00:01:43.509> improve<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.899> texture

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
scarring or just to improve the texture

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.399 
scarring or just to improve the texture
tone<00:01:44.829> color<00:01:45.249> pigmentation<00:01:46.139> just<00:01:47.139> to<00:01:47.259> give

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
tone color pigmentation just to give

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.499 
tone color pigmentation just to give
them<00:01:47.529> a<00:01:47.619> brighter<00:01:47.919> skin<00:01:48.399> for<00:01:49.119> darker<00:01:49.479> skin

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
them a brighter skin for darker skin

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.680 
them a brighter skin for darker skin
this<00:01:49.899> is<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> very<00:01:50.319> safe<00:01:50.619> machine<00:01:51.069> to<00:01:51.219> use

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.480 

so<00:01:56.170> now<00:01:56.290> Kelly<00:01:56.470> we're<00:01:56.620> going<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.830> just<00:01:57.310> start

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
so now Kelly we're going to just start

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:07.800 
so now Kelly we're going to just start
this<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:58.330> may<00:01:58.540> or<00:01:58.690> may<00:01:58.720> not<00:01:58.810> feel<00:01:59.260> these

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.229 

as<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:08.530> can<00:02:08.649> see<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.130> procedure<00:02:10.000> is

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
as you can see this procedure is

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.250 
as you can see this procedure is
extremely<00:02:10.989> simple<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.410> perform<00:02:12.630> these<00:02:13.630> pulses

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
extremely simple to perform these pulses

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.600 
extremely simple to perform these pulses
are<00:02:14.819> put<00:02:15.819> side<00:02:16.120> by<00:02:16.150> side<00:02:16.630> there<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.050> about<00:02:17.260> 10%

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
are put side by side there is about 10%

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.530 
are put side by side there is about 10%
overlap<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:20.319> will<00:02:20.560> treat<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.310> entire<00:02:21.640> skin<00:02:22.390> of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
overlap we will treat the entire skin of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.809 
overlap we will treat the entire skin of
her<00:02:22.690> face<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:24.069> good<00:02:24.250> thing<00:02:24.400> about<00:02:24.430> this

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
her face the good thing about this

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.710 
her face the good thing about this
machine<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.480> we<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:26.019> also<00:02:26.230> use<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.650> off<00:02:27.010> face

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
machine is we can also use it off face

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.979 
machine is we can also use it off face
so<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.590> treat<00:02:29.860> Sun<00:02:30.730> damaged<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.360> laxity

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989
