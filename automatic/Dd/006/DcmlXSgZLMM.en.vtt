00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello now I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.170
 a cascade braid 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.970
 Well, let's start 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.970
 let's make 3 k of jose 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.369
 three horses 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.369
 let's trade the first 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.530
 let's grab it on the top 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.220
 and from this charge above we will leave 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:42.620
 a little bit down like this 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.620
 and we will continue weaving 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.630
 another piece 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.490
 another that I leave 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.280
 As you can see it is leaving a k 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 digit of each box above that 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.150
 jalen are going to leave one down 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.710
 I will not give you from day to day 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.710
 no hair pulling loose 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.010
 I do not know, you can look good like that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.929
 and they leave it another alley 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.610
 look how it is looking 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.620
 You can look at how it is becoming 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.220
 Well, look, here I'm going to finish with 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.860
 my braid 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.890
 and here is the last 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.690
 what I'm going to do 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.930
 I will continue weaving the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.930
 shore 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.329
 Y 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.770
 will return a little mus so you do not 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.750
 me 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.590
 that has shorter tips for 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.590
 that is not spent or 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.070
 everything until finishing 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.729
 so I'm going to put the twine 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.590
 or what 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.320
 now 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.320
 I'm going to roll it up 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.960
 figuring a little flower 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.270
 try to hide the line that is not 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.270
 note 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:57.110
 and if it's like that I 'm pressured 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.110
