hello viewers of this video I have

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.740 
hello viewers of this video I have
created<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.310> section<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.359> Panama<00:00:06.660> Canal

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
created a section of the Panama Canal

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.880 
created a section of the Panama Canal
for<00:00:07.290> my<00:00:07.440> brother

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
for my brother

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.520 
for my brother
and<00:00:08.450> this<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.630> what<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:09.900> turned<00:00:10.170> out<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> be

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
and this is what it's turned out to be

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.680 
and this is what it's turned out to be
it's<00:00:11.010> not<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.940> whole<00:00:12.059> Panama<00:00:12.480> Canal

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
it's not like the whole Panama Canal

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.900 
it's not like the whole Panama Canal
it's<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:12.990> one<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.349> little<00:00:13.639> units<00:00:14.639> I

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it's just one of the little units I

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.390 
it's just one of the little units I
guess<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.299> could<00:00:15.450> call<00:00:15.570> him<00:00:15.949> where<00:00:16.949> book<00:00:17.190> goes

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
guess you could call him where book goes

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.290 
guess you could call him where book goes
in<00:00:17.580> rises<00:00:18.119> up<00:00:18.330> goes<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> next<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.300> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
in rises up goes on to the next and it

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.950 
in rises up goes on to the next and it
has<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.660> doors<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.199> either<00:00:22.380> end<00:00:23.630> that<00:00:24.630> open

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
has the doors on either end that open

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.210 
has the doors on either end that open
and<00:00:25.050> close<00:00:25.760> just<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:26.910> magic<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.220> then

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and close just like magic and then

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
and close just like magic and then
there's<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> other<00:00:30.119> side<00:00:30.330> right

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and then the water begins to rise like

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.660 
and then the water begins to rise like
that<00:00:54.320> except<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that except not really like that in the

that except not really like that in the
real<00:00:56.820> Panama<00:00:57.210> Canal<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:58.280> real<00:00:59.280> life

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
real Panama Canal because real life

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
real Panama Canal because real life
isn't<00:00:59.760> minecraft<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.840> minecraft<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.590> real

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
isn't minecraft and minecraft is in real

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.620 
isn't minecraft and minecraft is in real
life<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:03.750> sucks<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.290> um<00:01:04.850> anyway<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.420> water

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
life so it sucks so um anyway the water

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.310 
life so it sucks so um anyway the water
will<00:01:06.810> rise<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.670> boat<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.090> up

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
will rise and then the boat will get up

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
will rise and then the boat will get up
to<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.740> level<00:01:11.130> where<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> water<00:01:12.390> will

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to about this level where the water will

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.520 
to about this level where the water will
stop<00:01:12.990> rising<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.820> this<00:01:14.820> door<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:15.240> open

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
stop rising in this door will open

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
stop rising in this door will open
sending<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> next<00:01:17.250> unit<00:01:17.490> where

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
sending out on to the next unit where

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.030 
sending out on to the next unit where
that<00:01:18.420> door<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.780> become<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> door<00:01:19.530> but

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that door would become this door but

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
that door would become this door but
would<00:01:20.220> come<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> whole<00:01:21.689> thing<00:01:21.900> all
