gig of ram version the four gigs is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.270 
gig of ram version the four gigs is
going<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:21.740> cost<00:01:22.009> 199<00:01:22.550> or<00:01:23.119> not<00:01:24.039> but<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.130> phone

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
going to cost 199 or not but the phone

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.070 
going to cost 199 or not but the phone
costs<00:01:25.520> 199<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.300> I'm<00:01:26.420> guessing<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:26.899> they

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
costs 199 so I'm guessing that they

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.370 
costs 199 so I'm guessing that they
might<00:01:27.289> change<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.100> up<00:01:28.599> and<00:01:29.599> you<00:01:29.929> know<00:01:30.050> make<00:01:30.259> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
might change it up and you know make it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.940 
might change it up and you know make it
a<00:01:30.440> little<00:01:30.590> bit<00:01:30.800> more<00:01:31.039> for<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.729> four<00:01:32.000> gig<00:01:32.240> but

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
a little bit more for the four gig but

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.350 
a little bit more for the four gig but
really<00:01:33.950> won't<00:01:34.099> matter<00:01:34.190> even<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.759> costs<00:01:35.000> 250

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
really won't matter even if it costs 250

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
be a 2.3 version which is probably the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.440 
be a 2.3 version which is probably the
four<00:02:06.530> gig<00:02:06.770> version<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.940> have<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.239> one

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
four gig version and you have the one

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.320 
four gig version and you have the one
point<00:02:08.720> eight<00:02:08.840> gig<00:02:09.080> version<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.910> 580

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
point eight gig version so it's the 580

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.860 
point eight gig version so it's the 580
and<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.569> 560<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.390> going<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.780> an

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
and the 560 so this is going to be an
