00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

some<00:00:00.299> think<00:00:00.570> outer<00:00:00.810> space<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.380> beautiful<00:00:02.010> and

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
some think outer space is beautiful and

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.460 
some think outer space is beautiful and
others<00:00:02.639> may<00:00:02.879> find<00:00:03.210> it<00:00:03.419> cold<00:00:03.780> dark<00:00:04.230> and

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
others may find it cold dark and

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.950 
others may find it cold dark and
terrifying<00:00:05.160> but<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.730> think<00:00:06.060> one<00:00:06.359> thing<00:00:06.600> we<00:00:06.660> can

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
terrifying but I think one thing we can

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.740 
terrifying but I think one thing we can
all<00:00:07.109> agree<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:08.010> we<00:00:08.700> know<00:00:08.970> too<00:00:09.450> little

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
all agree on is that we know too little

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.200 
all agree on is that we know too little
about<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.800> instrument<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.639> we<00:00:11.759> utilize

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
about it one instrument that we utilize

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.539 
about it one instrument that we utilize
to<00:00:12.240> give<00:00:12.599> us<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.870> glimpse<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.740> cosmos<00:00:14.309> is

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
to give us a glimpse of the cosmos is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.939 
to give us a glimpse of the cosmos is
the<00:00:14.910> Hubble<00:00:15.299> telescope<00:00:15.540> which<00:00:16.289> has<00:00:16.560> been<00:00:16.830> in

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the Hubble telescope which has been in

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.490 
the Hubble telescope which has been in
operation<00:00:17.100> since<00:00:17.850> 1990<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.350> was

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
operation since 1990 when it was

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.279 
operation since 1990 when it was
launched<00:00:20.010> into<00:00:20.250> low<00:00:20.670> Earth<00:00:20.970> orbit<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> for

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
launched into low Earth orbit and for

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.500 
launched into low Earth orbit and for
the<00:00:22.350> last<00:00:22.560> 25<00:00:23.130> years<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.699> has<00:00:23.970> provided

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the last 25 years it has provided

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.779 
the last 25 years it has provided
humanity<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.560> beautiful<00:00:26.130> interstellar

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
humanity with beautiful interstellar

humanity with beautiful interstellar
images<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.510> outer<00:00:27.750> space<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.349> unravel<00:00:29.279> at

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
images of outer space that unravel at

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.999 
images of outer space that unravel at
least<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.760> little<00:00:30.060> bit<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.840> mysteries<00:00:31.410> beyond

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
least a little bit the mysteries beyond

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
least a little bit the mysteries beyond
the<00:00:32.250> solar<00:00:32.489> system<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.090> here's<00:00:33.390> an

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the solar system and here's an

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
the solar system and here's an
interesting<00:00:33.750> fact<00:00:33.989> images<00:00:34.829> taken<00:00:35.070> by<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
interesting fact images taken by the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
interesting fact images taken by the
Hubble<00:00:35.730> Space<00:00:35.760> Telescope<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.020> black<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
Hubble Space Telescope are in black and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.450 
Hubble Space Telescope are in black and
white

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
white

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
white
not<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:38.940> space<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.690> colorless<00:00:40.230> but

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
not because space is colorless but

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.350 
not because space is colorless but
because<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> Hubble<00:00:41.489> does<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.180> any

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
because the Hubble does not have any

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
because the Hubble does not have any
natural<00:00:42.660> color<00:00:43.170> cameras<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.040> essence

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
natural color cameras so in essence

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.610 
natural color cameras so in essence
these<00:00:44.730> photos<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.390> photoshopped<00:00:45.930> because

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
these photos are photoshopped because

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.430 
these photos are photoshopped because
the<00:00:46.800> good<00:00:46.980> folks<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.460> NASA<00:00:47.670> has<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.450> add<00:00:48.719> colors

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the good folks at NASA has to add colors

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
the good folks at NASA has to add colors
to<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.710> photos<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.340> analyzing<00:00:50.910> wavelengths

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to these photos by analyzing wavelengths

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
to these photos by analyzing wavelengths
of<00:00:51.750> light<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.320> different<00:00:52.649> elements<00:00:53.100> emit<00:00:53.489> in

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
of light that different elements emit in

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
of light that different elements emit in
space<00:00:54.059> anyways<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.960> looking<00:00:55.289> through

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
space anyways I was looking through

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
space anyways I was looking through
these<00:00:55.620> photos<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.520> found<00:00:56.820> them

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
these photos and I really found them

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.880 
these photos and I really found them
hauntingly<00:00:57.600> beautiful<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.410> wanted<00:00:58.770> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
hauntingly beautiful so I wanted to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.799 
hauntingly beautiful so I wanted to
share<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.719> are

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
share them with all of you so here are

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.930 
share them with all of you so here are
some<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> most<00:01:01.440> striking<00:01:02.039> images<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
some of the most striking images the

the last 25 years all right guys take a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.680 
the last 25 years all right guys take a
look<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.670> I'll<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> later
