oh hey guys this is JD 1824 here today
with<00:00:18.279> a<00:00:18.310> quick<00:00:18.580> test<00:00:18.910> of<00:00:19.090> the<00:00:19.210> notifier<00:00:19.660> as<00:00:19.869> a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
with a quick test of the notifier as a

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.240 
with a quick test of the notifier as a
p2<00:00:20.500> 404<00:00:21.310> um<00:00:21.730> fire<00:00:22.420> alarm<00:00:22.660> control<00:00:22.960> panel<00:00:23.250> um

here's the outside of it has a black
cabinet<00:00:28.000> um<00:00:28.240> white<00:00:29.230> controls<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.009> yeah<00:00:30.820> it's

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
cabinet um white controls and yeah it's

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.040 
cabinet um white controls and yeah it's
um<00:00:31.390> really<00:00:32.169> just<00:00:32.980> a<00:00:33.250> rebranded<00:00:35.220> ms4<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.870> let's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
um really just a rebranded ms4 so let's

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:47.389 
um really just a rebranded ms4 so let's
open<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.530> up<00:00:38.590> really<00:00:38.830> fast<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:44.760> alright<00:00:45.760> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
open it up really fast and go alright so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.619 
open it up really fast and go alright so
as<00:00:48.399> you<00:00:48.550> can<00:00:48.670> see<00:00:48.940> we<00:00:49.210> have<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.750> typical

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
as you can see we have the typical

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.660 
as you can see we have the typical
instructions<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.989> door<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:54.190> then<00:00:54.370> coming

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
instructions on the door and then coming

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.990 
instructions on the door and then coming
in<00:00:54.760> here<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.800> each<00:00:57.100> one<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.760> zones

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
in here for each one of the zones

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.540 
in here for each one of the zones
there's<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.390> fire<00:00:58.809> alarm<00:00:59.079> supervisory<00:01:00.039> trouble

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
there's a fire alarm supervisory trouble

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.660 
there's a fire alarm supervisory trouble
and<00:01:00.730> maintenance<00:01:01.030> light<00:01:01.420> on<00:01:01.660> them<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.670> then

and maintenance light on them and then
down<00:01:04.089> here<00:01:04.390> we<00:01:04.690> have<00:01:04.930> all<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.229> indicator

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
down here we have all the indicator

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.580 
down here we have all the indicator
lights<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:07.149> can<00:01:07.330> see<00:01:07.479> that<00:01:07.660> I<00:01:07.690> have<00:01:07.960> a<00:01:07.990> system

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
lights you can see that I have a system

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.310 
lights you can see that I have a system
power<00:01:08.890> trouble<00:01:09.460> for<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.789> battery<00:01:10.320> honest

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
power trouble for the battery honest

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.920 
power trouble for the battery honest
right<00:01:11.500> now<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.770> moving<00:01:15.399> on<00:01:15.550> here<00:01:16.090> all<00:01:16.270> here

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
the programming on right now I have it

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.620 
the programming on right now I have it
set<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.860> system<00:01:24.429> sensors<00:01:24.759> sync<00:01:25.060> protocol

set to a system sensors sync protocol

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.040 
set to a system sensors sync protocol
and<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:25.929> have<00:01:26.050> selected<00:01:26.229> silent<00:01:26.890> turned<00:01:27.190> on<00:01:28.050> and

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
then up here we have I'm just using some

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.919 
then up here we have I'm just using some
old<00:01:31.720> wires<00:01:32.050> for<00:01:32.319> this<00:01:32.470> system<00:01:32.830> but<00:01:33.429> uh<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.780> have

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
old wires for this system but uh we have

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.730 
old wires for this system but uh we have
our<00:01:35.140> two<00:01:35.380> Bell<00:01:35.649> circuits<00:01:36.190> um<00:01:37.470> four<00:01:39.060> four<00:01:40.060> zones

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
our two Bell circuits um four four zones

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740 
our two Bell circuits um four four zones
right<00:01:41.740> now<00:01:41.890> what<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.160> have<00:01:42.369> hooked<00:01:42.610> up<00:01:42.789> is<00:01:43.509> on<00:01:43.660> my

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
I'm just going to I test the walk test

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.640 
I'm just going to I test the walk test
feature<00:03:41.130> on<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.549> panel<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:45.350> got<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.470> hold

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
feature on this panel so I got to hold

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.670 
feature on this panel so I got to hold
it<00:03:46.769> for<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.010> second<00:03:50.480> there<00:03:51.480> we<00:03:51.510> go

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
it for a second there we go

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:14.319 
it for a second there we go
um<00:03:53.069> yeah<00:03:54.000> go<00:03:54.569> ahead<00:03:54.689> and<00:03:54.930> open<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.260> up

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.529 

alright<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:16.680> closed<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.940> go<00:04:18.329> ahead<00:04:18.419> and

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
alright and that closed so go ahead and

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:24.620 
alright and that closed so go ahead and
reset<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.139> again<00:04:23.060> there<00:04:24.060> we<00:04:24.150> go

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
reset this again there we go

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.270 
reset this again there we go
it's<00:04:25.320> kind<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.500> hard<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> push<00:04:25.979> down<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
it's kind of hard to push down the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:35.510
