00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.630
 tell him about those children 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.120
 doctor yes 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.470
 and already aware of everything 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:54.940
 she has kidnapped children's minds 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.409
 better accept indoctrination i 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.489
 their bodies are more suitable 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:04.360
 the increase was the result 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.119
 the super soldier and thanks to ours 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.659
 Successful smoke ready to invade the gods 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:17.140
 covenant doctor she interprets the 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.460
 story in his favor and knows he created 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.080
 the spartans to crush one 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.080
 human rebellion not for covenants 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.340
 when one world after another falls 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.970
 when my spartans were in the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.860
 poised between humanity and extinction 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.159
 no one minded why they had been 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:43.250
 originally created then believes that 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:46.420
 his choices were justified or 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.420
 saved the human race 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.909
 the lack of a spartan life is 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.909
 was helpful 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.619
 what other people try to say 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.880
 before her they were intelligence 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.890
 naval but she is very different from the reports 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.869
 indicate that some Spartans showed 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.930
 periodically sociopathic tendencies 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.550
 difficulty reports indicate an excellent one 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.500
 performance in dangerous situations i 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.080
 I have provided the tools for this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.760
 efficiency believes that master chief has 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.510
 succeeded because after all it was 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.720
 bad john what has everything to do with it 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.720
 this 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.680
 she intends to replace it 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:48.430
 master chief and his dead file says 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:51.260
 who died catherine 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.959
 spartans never die 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.950
 his mistake is to consider spartans 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.950
 tools of war 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.250
 my spartans are evolution 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.250
 mankind 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.390
 the next step 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.689
 should not be underestimated 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.510
 but most of all 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.510
 should not be underestimated
