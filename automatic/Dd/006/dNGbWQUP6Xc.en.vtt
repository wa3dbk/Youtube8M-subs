00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.990 
looking I then connected that point to
the<00:04:29.020> inner<00:04:29.199> part<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.620> my<00:04:29.770> eyebrow<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.520> both

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
the inner part of my eyebrow on both

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.540 
the inner part of my eyebrow on both
sides<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.660> then<00:04:32.229> just<00:04:32.410> drew<00:04:32.860> right<00:04:33.100> over<00:04:33.430> my

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
sides and then just drew right over my

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.700 
sides and then just drew right over my
eyebrow<00:04:33.940> since<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.509> part<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.199> wing

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.840 

going<00:04:38.710> from<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:38.949> arch<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.550> went<00:04:39.729> straight

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
going from the arch I just went straight

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:48.490 
going from the arch I just went straight
to<00:04:40.300> my<00:04:40.600> temple

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.230 

and<00:04:48.590> then<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.310> made<00:04:49.520> sure<00:04:49.580> they<00:04:49.850> were<00:04:49.880> even

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
and then I made sure they were even

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.080 
and then I made sure they were even
before<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:50.900> connected<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.830> my<00:04:51.980> hairline<00:04:55.090> now

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
before I connected it to my hairline now

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.280 
before I connected it to my hairline now
