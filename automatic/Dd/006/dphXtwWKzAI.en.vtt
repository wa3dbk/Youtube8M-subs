 he controlled a fool was all and 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.950
 welcome a new video on the channel 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.200
 I am a body and as always 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.610
 bringing them a new video and by the 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.350
 people welcome to a new video of 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.480
 plants against zombies gardens warfare 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.970
 of opening stickers I already know that I have 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.200
 past opening stickers and stickers and 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.050
 stickers to see is that I became addicted 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.310
 open those envelopes and cough and maybe I would 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.500
 they have brought many character videos 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.440
 special characters new games and 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.090
 all that but decided due to all 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.500
 the comments that leave me in the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.060
 videos plants against zombies action one 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.830
 kind of mix I have not been told that 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.920
 spend more coins in the videos of 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.960
 opening stickers and that we're going to do and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.490
 they have also told me that they would like 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.430
 see opening the sachets of 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.750
 characters without knowing which characters 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.430
 you already know why the title comes 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.020
 name of the character that does come 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.460
 obviously the miniature and all that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.010
 then what are we going to do in the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.110
 Today's video is to open four stickers 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.480
 we are going to open 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.350
 a premium envelope sticker a 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.930
 amazing plant envelope sticker and a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.610
 of the vengeful zombie after opening 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.740
 these three we are going to open one of 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.500
 spectacular characters in such a way 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.010
 that we will spend a hundred to a thousand coins in 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.110
 these sachets and this obviously in 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.610
 look for that here if we complete some 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.620
 of the five pieces because it can leave us 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.880
 a special character and if not then of 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.380
 we all have a character 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.670
 special for the next video and also 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.160
 we will be looking for what is coming 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.110
 the skills of the characters that 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.300
 obviously help us improve in 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 questions of possibilities of winning 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.200
 games and obviously we become a 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.670
 little more effective so well then 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.960
 people I hope you like the idea 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.380
 here in the comments if you like that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.840
 let's continue like this and then agent tenths that 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.759
 if we are going to start well the first 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.500
 sticker that is the over prize what 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.510
 we open 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.450
 and we are going to open what is being this 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.130
 in a mix so let's go 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.440
 all the pounds and we're going to open the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.660
 envelope 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.539
 ok well right now, let's go 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.510
 see how much did not come out 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.329
 they should leave us we have the first 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.790
 parts of two characters that had 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:21.269
 gone nowhere and it is this that is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.069
 the jumping land that ninja we have what 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.329
 what is being this is not the electric 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.370
 and we have the electric cactus ok we have 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.200
 skewer and grass pricking extinction more 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.010
 damage to the is ok is like a kind of 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.470
 improvement in our command a beard 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.020
 we have a 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.330
 every time a good tank we have a like 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.100
 it is called a helmet more small and one I think 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.200
 that his ability for green ones are 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.700
 improvements and skills and dwellings 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.650
 I think they are releasing skills is 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.640
 almost guarantees that the weapon does not 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.460
 overheating with this modification 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.650
 they install although pretty well a 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.720
 popcorn mask and omit stars 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.010
 retouch good the truth is that I fall 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.960
 quite well because many challenges of 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.520
 suddenly quite difficult or quite 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.890
 tedious is more than anything and good 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.030
 obviously one for more that I want it 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.980
 do if you do not have the plant to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.230
 plant the or if you do not like to know a 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.390
 character in question of being using 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.490
 so only the sunflower 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.440
 well that helps quite a lot 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.080
 enough so let's open the envelope 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.910
 incredible plant that the truth here should 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.459
 go out through the plants and go 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.350
 to see what comes out and I hope with these 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.820
 but about quoted to complete some of the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.110
 people that I already have enough parts 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.110
 but I do not know if I 'm so lucky 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.840
 ok they did not come out they looked at us two 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.220
 pinches roots no mames came out a root 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.840
 of a sunflower I think that sergio areas 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.780
 where the fire of the sun I do not know what it will be 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.270
 we have 960 fire that this then does not 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.640
 I know what it is today we have the face of 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.080
 fire sunflower we have super jump 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.880
 pea says super jump instant you 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.340
 allows the remaining reach sites to 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.660
 where I could not before but losing 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.020
 speed ok 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.670
 quite interesting to finish in the race 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.050
 says the vain career during the first 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.210
 faster death came down will you or these 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.820
 we are going to serve a lot of hands 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.730
 solar good stuff takes out a beanie 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.060
 pretty enough or 10 omit challenge not 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.380
 it can be I already have like pinches 30 me the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.500
 I'm going to be getting the challenge to get there 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.580
 to some character at the top level and then 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.470
 obviously play with the character 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.540
 special is frozen though this 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.310
 it helped a lot and green mouth did not 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.450
 interesting the green mouth we're going to 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.270
 open 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.980
 ok the third envelope that is the one 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.110
 vengeful zombie so purely leave 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.790
 in peace the good vibes and let's see 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.460
 and hopefully if we can finish some 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.930
 character that we have already started to 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.670
 well, we do not have much time 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.350
 opening this kind of stickers that 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.350
 I do not know if there is a head behind 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.790
 another head pure things so couples for 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.410
 have an engineer's head we have 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.210
 the head of another engineer notice that 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.930
 nothing came out of what has been 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.930
 the scientist 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.940
 and we plant all good has 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.030
 left more or less clouds exceeds these to 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.680
 ok this is a kind of improvement I think 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.840
 put the word super before any 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.639
 thing the improvement is obviously not hard 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.229
 both can fix super damage ok this 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.220
 it helps a lot I really like to use 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.289
 of soldier so that's not going to help 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.940
 increases ammunition capacity due 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.590
 to a did for whom for the 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.090
 scientist ok perfect ammo 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.900
 augmentation we have a beard we have a 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.270
 coffin 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.180
 we have pirate maps a few glasses and 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.320
 a good mask these things to me the 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.210
 it does not really move me all of a sudden 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.820
 we follow quite gaseous rules 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.270
 but I feel that they generate so much with so much 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.889
 beard and mustache and girls and everything like that 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.020
 that we possibly do not complete any 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.240
 special character but we have this 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.530
 about guaranteed that will show us some 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.940
 character that we can use in the 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.710
 next video of special characters 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.199
 and well, let's open up the truth 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.449
 I would like it to be a character that 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.889
 it could be a scientist or in the nose 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.449
 before 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.370
 of lost a cactus 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.840
 a soldier, a soldier, it seems good to me 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.990
 well then well let's see 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.759
 surely none is a sunflower and it is 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.129
 the good electric sunflower makes 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.839
 very much that I do not get a sunflower 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.189
 I hope it's pretty good and because this 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.360
 sunflower we will try it in the next 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.529
 video of plants contractions of 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.210
 special characters and well then 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.860
 I hope you liked it much 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.479
 video remember to leave zulay that helps 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.210
 much to the channel destroy that button of me

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.689
 people tell them that social networks are 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.830
