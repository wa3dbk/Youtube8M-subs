00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.620
 geronimo it took long enough 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.690
 almost one and a half hours we have on 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.210
 Chairman keep the teeth but vomited 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
 now it is our second 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.990
 weekend of the press beta of the elder 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.089
 scrolls online went to the pvp 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 battlefields and that was the truest 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.890
 sense of the word a huge fun times 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.830
 discreetly apart from the gigantic 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 extent that the pvp areal has quite so 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.320
 in this case, it has huge 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.310
 do not have to be 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 roger ryff who the rem versus realm 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 patties from dark age of camelot or 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.280
 of the world girls world slaughter 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.530
 guild wars 2 knows himself in the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.379
 Faction fight in Aces in no time 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.000
 nothing at home feels a worth mentioning 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.590
 but differed consists say 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 that one is not under the banner of one 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.850
 servers for his faction 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.219
 but a pvp campaign connection 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 so do not work with individual servers 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 but with a server mega cluster 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.350
 a pvp campaign should be based on current 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 status saddle will take three months as in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 dark age or guild wars 2 want too 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.539
 conquered enemy castles in jesu 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.339
 but without muddling 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.229
 but comparatively clear 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.580
 front lines with the lines here on 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.860
 The map, first of all, only the fast 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.570
 transport network represent it is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 The six bends around the capital too 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.430
 conquer and hold to your own 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.380
 fractional bonuses to cobbler 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.969
 and personally to level or new 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.979
 deep and armor 1 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.320
 who particularly excels in pvp 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.939
 the chance to become imparato and thus 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.530
 not just a cool title but 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.399
 also a special skills at 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.649
 to pocket 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.450
 that you were up to date even then 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.509
 do not lose it when it's over 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.310
 to the imperator and the imperator resp 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.020
 the imperators themselves are with many 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.939
 do not fight so easy too 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.890
 crack as you see here if you look 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.740
 show exactly on the games above 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.539
 pay attention as in dark age or guild wars 2 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.030
 will also be in mesum with big ones 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.890
 warfare device fought with appropriate 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.220
 effects on enemies and on opponents 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.049
 castle walls this is already a big show 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.670
 even cooler, however, are the man 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.500
 against man battles in which one is 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.909
 also first of all the missing one still has 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.679
 but it has to get used to 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.420
 we do not want to claim that 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.310
 larger zerg mandatory for such 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.739
 Opportunities Wins A Lot Also Hangs In The 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.569
 pvp of asse from the skill of the individual 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.780
 but a decent man strength makes 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.700
 in such always battles something out of who 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.930
 prefer to fight alone builds 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.849
 maybe a shadow sound with 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.980
 partial function and lurks low-level 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.870
 stupid noses the us on the on the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 shortest route to battle rushing without 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.400
 to look right and left 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.260
 Right and left look like that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.299
 we were able to get that right 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.370
 pvp during our limited beta 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.930
 Do not look at access yet 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.630
 Above all, we ask ourselves one 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.690
 three month old pvp dogs not bad long 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.489
 but is our first impression of the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.010
 Player against player Kloppereien is 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.079
 a consistently positive so far not 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.810
 lastly because he does it so well 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.220
 with many people on a spot 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.959
 comparatively fluid to run with 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.959
