steering on the ground was an issue

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.940 
steering on the ground was an issue

the drag increases rapidly in the flare

the drag increases rapidly in the flare
which<00:04:07.390> means<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.200> have<00:04:08.290> put<00:04:08.500> down<00:04:08.709> more<00:04:09.250> less

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
means you do have to have your wits
