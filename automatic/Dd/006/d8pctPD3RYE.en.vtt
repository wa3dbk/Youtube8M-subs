00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:51.050
 so we see the indesit fridge after 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.470
 repair worked two months result 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.300
 which was completely icing 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:03.739
 on this grille means you 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.640
 out of the situation as a service call 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:14.869
 center and service center changed us here 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:20.570
 this relay timer relay is also here 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:23.540
 contacts were checked verified alive 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.970
 or not the spin that warms this 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.009
 the grille after turning off the engine and 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.490
 one sensor checked 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.680
 2 daughters checked and verified 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.130
 here it is 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.500
 means task based in order not to 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.440
 there was frostbite system no frost 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.390
 worked on need to leave 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.159
 open grill for two hours 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.590
 open door to water 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.710
 glass service engineer will tell you that 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.090
 You did it 48 hours, but I think that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.860
 better open the lid and remove probably 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.830
 togetherness for two hours rather than 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.540
 wait 48 hours products excuse us 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:17.870
 very expensive means connecting here 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.269
 this setting to produce green 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.510
 contacts up i see it 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.670
 green contact up here we are in 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.650
 In principle, the connector is, in principle, possible and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.930
 confuse so and how do you know 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.730
 what is not working on the Internet system no 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.180
 frost 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.920
 you'll hear after everyone is here 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.870
 freezes the hall gets to 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.450
 fan and fan starts strongly 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.130
 make noise see this fan he when 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.959
 starts to turn around he starts 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.400
 make a lot of noise 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.880
 the same thing happens here on the world for 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.130
 her here right here and on the walls 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.840
 right here going on the world for her like 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.329
 just saw what happened on the world behind 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.609
 call her customer service to 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:09.350
 so that they perform a service replacement here 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:13.389
 This timer in another case may be 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.829
 what is this pace 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.320
 Well, I read on the Internet that he sometimes 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.199
 burns it either works incorrectly 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.989
 sensor 1 or 2 ring you always 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:26.150
 here you can see on contact 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.359
 cables come out you can always 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.410
 call as this is a sensor sensor 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:38.720
 by the way here is something and we have written hader 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.480
 some kind of Turkish so but to business now 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.459
 I will not say that here and Kadir well, in principle 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.760
 if u will be interested write 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.560
 do likes we will arrange you more 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.040
 so I want to note that the refrigerator 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.410
 worked for two months on average 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.299
 refrigerator compartment temperature was 7 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:05.570
 degrees below zero and the timer is actually 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.699
 he probably factory and went faulty so 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.690
 as the refrigerator began to use an example 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:13.760
 respectively, if so held it 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.430
 and the engine is covered that engine 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.060
 It works non-stop and this is also one 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.010
 of the reasons well, rather, one of the consequences 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.050
 if you see that you have an engine 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.690
 constantly working does not turn off means 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.570
 you flew system no frost 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.169
 the so -called well and accordingly 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:37.540
 the refrigerator is made in Russia often to you 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.540
 I'll show more here it is our indesit 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.760
 accordingly draw conclusions well, I think 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:48.020
 that imported can be exactly the same 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.889
 done let's see see how much 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.810
 will work 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:56.600
 With a new relay, our stop is to close 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.510
 in reverse order that is you inserted 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:05.150
 and such a lattice top attached 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.840
 so it will be inside your fridge 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.660
 stand here so nothing can be seen here 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.240
 but the sound you will hear if the spirit that 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.500
 will break 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.120
 thanks for watching I hope my analysis 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.590
 flying someone will help fix 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.580
 the refrigerator if you can not 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:31.970
 call the service bridge then look here 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.750
 this timer timer is called team 01 ash 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.510
 dash 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:42.039
 vb and to thank you all for your attention 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.039
 all in all good
