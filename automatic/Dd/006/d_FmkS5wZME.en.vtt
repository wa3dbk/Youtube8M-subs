00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
this guy as far as hardware goes I use a

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.609 
this guy as far as hardware goes I use a
standard<00:01:02.500> Shorty's<00:01:03.250> hardware<00:01:03.609> I<00:01:03.640> think<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.989> I

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
standard Shorty's hardware I think and I

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.410 
standard Shorty's hardware I think and I
don't<00:01:05.950> really<00:01:06.100> care<00:01:06.280> what<00:01:06.430> hardware<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:06.850> use<00:01:07.119> if

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
don't really care what hardware I use if

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.930 
don't really care what hardware I use if
it's<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.869> screw<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.890> bolt<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.820> can

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
it's a screw and a bolt and you can

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.179 
it's a screw and a bolt and you can
screw<00:01:10.180> together<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.630> like<00:01:11.259> it<00:01:11.439> but<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.890> do
