 grains every year a rebirth 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 because everything almost disappeared under the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.270
 regime of the Khmer Rouge in the years 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
 70 was driven from our lands by the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.700
 Khmer Rouge 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.040
 when we came back after ten years 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 everything was overgrown with vegetation and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.170
 pepper was gone our farms 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.140
 were destroyed 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.420
 it had to start from scratch since each 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.490
 year the farmers exports three tons 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 pepper of which more than half to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.220
 the hexagon especially thanks to this French 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:43.439
 it markets the production of 120 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:46.619
 local growers and so the grains 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.090
 yes are beautiful this year he liked 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.180
 we will have a better harvest than 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.350
 last year before ending up 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.259
 in the plate of the French 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.570
 peeled pepper here for a few 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 years each grain is inspected and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.600
 thrown at the slightest defect 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.800
 almost one out of two goes to the trash 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.660
 the quality of the clusters the quality of the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.430
 the general maintenance of the farm is 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.700
 much better we have a bit better 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.980
 quality that we pay more and so 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.990
 farmers have a much better income 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.490
 that they had at the time but all the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.800
 world does not have the same requirement as him 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.530
 all the grains produced here do not 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.240
 would not deserve their reputation 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.040
 it's not the final quality that we 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.360
 give kampot pepper a little bit of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.760
 do they have so many moldy grains 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.650
 it's not consistent with the quality we 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 would she want her to be described by 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.400
 the f1 the specifications 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.920
 despite its imperfections every year 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.510
 the producers of kampot exports 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.810
 always more pepper in the world
