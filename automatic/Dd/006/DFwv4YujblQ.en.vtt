00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and just kind of even take people on our

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.409 
and just kind of even take people on our
forwards<00:02:49.859> were<00:02:50.010> having<00:02:50.730> shots<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.389> getting

in<00:02:51.659> dangerous<00:02:51.989> positions<00:02:52.169> and<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:52.919> I<00:02:52.949> think<00:02:53.219> it

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310
