00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
add a camera hold down a shift to press

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.609 
add a camera hold down a shift to press
a<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:09.119> add<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> new<00:01:09.420> object<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> camera<00:01:12.619> move

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
a to add a new object go to camera move

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
a to add a new object go to camera move
the<00:01:13.860> camera<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> cube<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.659> it's

hiding inside that cube there by
pressing<00:01:17.670> G<00:01:18.210> X<00:01:19.700> G<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> grab<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.450> rather<00:01:22.409> G<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
pressing G X G to grab a rather G to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
pressing G X G to grab a rather G to
move<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.490> X<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.600> course<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> x<00:01:25.320> axis<00:01:26.090> G<00:01:27.090> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
move and X of course for the x axis G is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
move and X of course for the x axis G is
Z<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.170> moving<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> z<00:01:29.759> axis<00:01:30.710> alt

view click view cameras set active

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
view click view cameras set active
object<00:03:55.770> as<00:03:55.890> camera<00:03:56.670> click<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.980> there<00:03:58.980> we<00:03:59.190> are

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
object as camera click that there we are

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.820 
object as camera click that there we are
so<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.880> did<00:04:00.150> set<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.780> camera<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> active

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
so it did set that camera to the active

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.160 
so it did set that camera to the active
object<00:04:01.950> as<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.730> said<00:04:02.940> before<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.510> other<00:04:03.690> camera

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
object as I said before the other camera

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.690 
object as I said before the other camera
is<00:04:04.350> default<00:04:05.960> default<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.410> active<00:04:07.860> camera<00:04:08.070> so

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
is default default the active camera so

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.920 
is default default the active camera so
you<00:04:08.820> actually<00:04:09.000> have<00:04:09.240> to<00:04:09.360> tell<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.780> other

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
you actually have to tell the other

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.070 
you actually have to tell the other
camera<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.560> active<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.690> yet<00:04:12.690> again<00:04:12.930> this

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
is after you mark the frame with the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
is after you mark the frame with the
camera<00:04:16.890> selected<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.810> not<00:04:19.020> bound

now we want to click view and bind
camera<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.450> markers<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:35.370> as<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.580> can<00:04:35.670> see<00:04:35.730> when

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
as you can see it works try it in some

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.940 
as you can see it works try it in some
of<00:05:27.480> your<00:05:27.660> animations<00:05:28.230> it<00:05:28.410> makes<00:05:28.590> things<00:05:28.770> look

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
of your animations it makes things look

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.280 
of your animations it makes things look
a<00:05:29.190> lot<00:05:29.370> more<00:05:29.820> interesting<00:05:30.540> when<00:05:30.690> you're<00:05:31.110> using

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
a lot more interesting when you're using

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.480 
a lot more interesting when you're using
more<00:05:31.560> than<00:05:31.770> one<00:05:31.890> camera<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.340> can<00:05:32.460> see

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
more than one camera you can see

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.190 
more than one camera you can see
different<00:05:32.850> angles<00:05:33.360> without<00:05:33.480> having<00:05:33.990> to

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
different angles without having to

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.860 
different angles without having to
circle<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.220> whole<00:05:35.340> object<00:05:35.940> because<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:36.720> can

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
circle the whole object because that can

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.020 
circle the whole object because that can
be<00:05:36.900> rather<00:05:37.320> annoying<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:38.190> animate<00:05:38.730> and

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
be rather annoying to animate and

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.090 
be rather annoying to animate and
annoying<00:05:39.630> to<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.020> users<00:05:40.350> to<00:05:40.380> see<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:40.950> one

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
annoying to the users to see that one

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.820 
annoying to the users to see that one
camera<00:05:41.460> slowly<00:05:41.820> circling<00:05:42.480> the<00:05:42.690> object<00:05:43.140> so

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
camera slowly circling the object so

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.650 
camera slowly circling the object so
hope<00:05:44.070> this<00:05:44.100> helps<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:44.640> out<00:05:44.670> the<00:05:45.330> depth<00:05:45.510> of
