00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.200
 ah 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.870
 that all friends is a pleasure to greet you 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.430
 as always and much more because I 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.090
 I find with getting here that how is this 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.070
 city 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.710
 Spaniards have always been 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.410
 characterized by being conquerors and 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.750
 well, they made huge trips for the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.100
 Atlantic to America but they signed a 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.989
 treated that is shown all in 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.239
 tordesillas with portugal and they gave them 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.739
 the right to conquer Brazil but 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.960
 I think that this time Spain does not 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.120
 think to rest or treatment to anyone 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.150
 more answer thank you the truth is that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.780
 you know a lot of history but, yes, it is 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.210
 true that we will try to get there 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.830
 to Brazil and win we know of the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.540
 difficulty that entails then the power 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.030
 win a world cup even more so when 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.950
 we come from winning in 2010 that we come from 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.680
 win two Euro Cups also followed like this 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.570
 that people are going to want the channel and 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.130
 we will want to overcome the only objective 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.590
 is to try to reach the final and start 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.140
 hence it is clear to know how 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.289
 do so that a strategy that has 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.910
 worked so much do not wear 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.009
 logically there have been many who have 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.780
 studied how to play both the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.340
 barcelona like of the Spanish selection 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.060
 how to get that power to follow 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.880
 improvise 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.340
 and even if they know your style of play is not 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.750
 can neutralize everyone knows 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.250
 we like to have the ball we like 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.810
 have the procession and from there 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.329
 you can generate chances to try 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.939
 put goals yes it is true that each 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.710
 more time then the teams that try 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.770
 play try to have the ball then 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.420
 they are more penalized because there are many 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.520
 teams that pose you a game is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.170
 very defensive all behind and from 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.300
 there you can try to find the contra e 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.789
 get a goal just with one chance but 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.900
 well I think in the end we have to 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.640
 remain true to our philosophy 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 we have achieved many successes starting 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.380
 of football in this way and I think that 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.670
 we have to keep trying if we 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.769
 we put to defend with these players 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.140
 we will not get anywhere the life of 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.060
 a footballer is like that not knowing that his 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.069
 body is a temple that has to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.580
 stay perfect because if not the thing 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.769
 normal if it is what makes us perform in 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.440
 the field at the end is our work and 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.200
 we know that having the body prepared 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.900
 physically to endure then 90 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.100
 minutes and the effort of each match is 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.170
 what in the end gives us then 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.170
 succeed in our our profession
