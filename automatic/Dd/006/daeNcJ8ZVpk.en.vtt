00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
and then they split off and they create

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.959 
and then they split off and they create
a<00:00:41.230> bunch<00:00:41.590> of<00:00:41.739> little<00:00:42.010> skeletons<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.670> come<00:00:42.850> at

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
a bunch of little skeletons that come at

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.360 
a bunch of little skeletons that come at

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
you the best way to do it is don't get

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.500 
you the best way to do it is don't get
impact<00:00:45.760> like<00:00:45.879> those<00:00:46.059> guys<00:00:46.210> are<00:00:46.390> pretty

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
impact like those guys are pretty

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.180 
impact like those guys are pretty
squishy<00:00:46.780> for<00:00:47.109> most<00:00:47.379> weapons<00:00:47.590> other<00:00:47.890> than<00:00:48.010> the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
squishy for most weapons other than the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.700 
squishy for most weapons other than the
ones<00:00:48.340> that<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.489> have<00:00:48.760> obviously<00:00:49.000> so<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:50.350> lot<00:00:50.680> of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
ones that I have obviously so a lot of

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.689 
ones that I have obviously so a lot of
people<00:00:50.859> weren't<00:00:51.039> in<00:00:51.160> here<00:00:51.250> they'll<00:00:51.430> just<00:00:51.550> kill

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
people weren't in here they'll just kill

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:52.979 
people weren't in here they'll just kill
those<00:00:51.850> guys<00:00:51.969> really<00:00:52.180> fast<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.660> then<00:00:52.719> they<00:00:52.870> get

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
those guys really fast and then they get

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.959 
those guys really fast and then they get
overwhelmed<00:00:53.559> by<00:00:54.010> really<00:00:54.460> difficult

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
overwhelmed by really difficult

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.240 
overwhelmed by really difficult
skeletons<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:56.170> main<00:00:56.350> thing<00:00:56.379> I<00:00:56.920> recommend

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
skeletons the main thing I recommend

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.430 
skeletons the main thing I recommend
doing<00:00:57.670> is<00:00:58.030> killing<00:00:58.449> them<00:00:58.690> in<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:58.899> certain<00:00:59.109> order

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
doing is killing them in a certain order

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.160 
doing is killing them in a certain order
so<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:01.210> main<00:01:01.420> one<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:01.839> want<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:02.019> kill

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.190 
trouble by the way you can kill it any
way<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.090> like<00:01:43.210> honestly<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.840> first<00:01:43.960> time<00:01:44.140> I

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
way you like honestly the first time I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.160 
way you like honestly the first time I
came<00:01:44.320> in<00:01:44.470> here<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.830> killed<00:01:45.840> everything<00:01:46.840> all<00:01:47.140> at

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
came in here I killed everything all at

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.870 
came in here I killed everything all at
once<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.070> was<00:01:48.100> really<00:01:48.430> difficult<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.850> I

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
once and it was really difficult and I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.920 
once and it was really difficult and I
just<00:01:49.030> barely<00:01:49.390> beat<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.900> but<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.550> most

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
just barely beat it but for the most

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.470 
just barely beat it but for the most
safe<00:01:52.930> approach<00:01:53.320> just<00:01:54.160> do<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.310> like<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.700> just

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
safe approach just do it like this just

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.660 
safe approach just do it like this just
kill<00:01:55.720> off<00:01:55.900> one<00:01:55.930> at<00:01:56.260> a<00:01:56.320> time<00:01:56.590> wait<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.520> ads

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
kill off one at a time wait for the ads

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.580 
kill off one at a time wait for the ads
to<00:01:57.880> pop<00:01:58.060> out<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.510> then<00:01:58.690> clear<00:01:58.930> those<00:01:59.140> guys<00:01:59.350> out

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
to pop out and then clear those guys out

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.380 
to pop out and then clear those guys out
and<00:02:00.100> once<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.430> ads<00:02:00.610> are<00:02:00.790> gone<00:02:00.970> then<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.270> can

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
and once the ads are gone then you can

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.730 
and once the ads are gone then you can
finish<00:02:01.570> off<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.960> next<00:02:02.140> guy<00:02:02.290> you<00:02:02.320> can<00:02:02.590> stand
