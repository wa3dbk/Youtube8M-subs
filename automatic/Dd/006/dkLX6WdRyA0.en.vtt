00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.260 

my<00:00:16.800> overall<00:00:17.160> impression<00:00:17.280> is<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.000> doesn't

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
my overall impression is that it doesn't

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.300 
my overall impression is that it doesn't
give<00:00:18.420> an<00:00:18.510> accurate<00:00:18.660> portrayal<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.590> subjects

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
give an accurate portrayal the subjects

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
give an accurate portrayal the subjects
it<00:00:20.490> doesn't<00:00:20.849> give<00:00:21.359> both<00:00:21.570> sides<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> issue

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
it doesn't give both sides of the issue

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.580 
it doesn't give both sides of the issue
it<00:00:23.269> presents<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.539> Bible<00:00:24.960> that's<00:00:25.109> perfectly

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it presents a Bible that's perfectly

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.259 
it presents a Bible that's perfectly
established<00:00:26.130> by<00:00:26.279> archaeology<00:00:26.910> which<00:00:27.150> is

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
established by archaeology which is

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.120 
established by archaeology which is
false<00:00:27.509> and<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.439> book<00:00:28.589> of<00:00:28.679> mormon<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
false and a book of mormon that is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
false and a book of mormon that is
totally<00:00:29.490> refuted<00:00:29.970> by<00:00:30.000> archaeology<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:30.929> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
totally refuted by archaeology which is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.140 
totally refuted by archaeology which is
also<00:00:31.349> false<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.279> creates<00:00:32.580> a<00:00:32.700> simplistic

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
also false so it creates a simplistic

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.600 
also false so it creates a simplistic
and<00:00:33.720> on<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.990> whole<00:00:34.140> fairly<00:00:34.860> disingenuous

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and on the whole fairly disingenuous

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.900 
and on the whole fairly disingenuous
picture<00:00:36.860> distinctly<00:00:37.860> unimpressed<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.670> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
picture distinctly unimpressed with it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.049 
picture distinctly unimpressed with it
but<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.809> basic<00:00:40.200> reason<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.850> had

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
but the basic reason was that you had

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.020 
but the basic reason was that you had
the<00:00:42.210> illusion<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.760> giving<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> some

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the illusion of giving you some

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.850 
the illusion of giving you some
scholarly<00:00:45.449> information<00:00:45.690> without<00:00:46.320> actually

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
scholarly information without actually

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.180 
scholarly information without actually
doing<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.969> made<00:00:48.239> things<00:00:48.570> seem<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.980> they

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
doing it it made things seem that they

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
doing it it made things seem that they
were<00:00:50.250> answering<00:00:50.760> certain<00:00:51.239> questions<00:00:51.690> or

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
were answering certain questions or

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.130 
were answering certain questions or
providing<00:00:52.710> certain<00:00:52.949> types<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> information

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
providing certain types of information

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.189 
providing certain types of information
when<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> wasn't<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.219> accurate<00:00:56.730> as

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
when actually it wasn't as accurate as

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.990 
when actually it wasn't as accurate as
it<00:00:58.199> ought<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.680> been<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.670> there<00:00:59.789> were<00:00:59.879> too

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it ought to have been so there were too

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.569 
it ought to have been so there were too
many<00:01:00.120> places<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.190> much<00:01:02.399> more

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
many places in it where it was much more

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.939 
many places in it where it was much more
illusion<00:01:03.090> than<00:01:03.239> reality<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.530> much

be shocked if they did I would expect

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.869 
be shocked if they did I would expect
that<00:02:24.569> they<00:02:24.780> have<00:02:25.019> some<00:02:25.769> passing<00:02:26.370> acquaintance

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
that they have some passing acquaintance

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.210 
that they have some passing acquaintance
with<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.269> whether<00:02:28.170> their<00:02:28.409> acquaintance<00:02:28.920> came

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
with it whether their acquaintance came

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.430 
with it whether their acquaintance came
just<00:02:29.519> because<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:30.060> had<00:02:30.299> heard<00:02:30.599> something<00:02:30.959> or

because whoever was doing the film gave

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.600 
because whoever was doing the film gave
them<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.379> little<00:02:34.530> bit<00:02:34.739> of<00:02:34.860> information<00:02:35.129> I

that<00:02:39.209> they<00:02:39.360> had<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.569> passing<00:02:40.049> acquaintance<00:02:40.440> now

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
that they had a passing acquaintance now

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.649

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
from what they said it is very easy to

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.240 
from what they said it is very easy to
take<00:03:15.180> true<00:03:16.049> statements<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.859> put<00:03:17.010> them<00:03:17.159> in

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
take true statements and put them in

take true statements and put them in
such<00:03:17.459> contexts<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.359> even<00:03:19.109> though<00:03:19.200> they<00:03:19.379> are

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
such contexts that even though they are

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.379 
such contexts that even though they are
true<00:03:19.829> they<00:03:20.129> seem<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.459> say<00:03:20.819> something<00:03:21.269> that
