manages<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:36.000> resources<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> computer<00:01:36.840> so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
manages the resources of the computer so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.039 
manages the resources of the computer so
well<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.540> doesn't<00:01:39.540> need<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
well that actually doesn't need that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.109 
well that actually doesn't need that
much<00:01:40.290> power<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> run<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> OS<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> gives

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
much power just to run the OS that gives

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.030 
much power just to run the OS that gives
you<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.390> power<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.840> run<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.110> programs<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you more power to run your programs you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
you more power to run your programs you
don't<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> worry<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:45.000> operating

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
don't have to worry about an operating

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.270 
don't have to worry about an operating
system<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.720> takes<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:46.380> resources<00:01:47.189> from

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
system that takes so much resources from

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.560 
system that takes so much resources from
your<00:01:47.399> computer<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> run<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.299> turn<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
your computer to run that in turn you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
your computer to run that in turn you
don't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.810> enough<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.710> run<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.220> programs

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
don't have enough to run your programs

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.899 
don't have enough to run your programs
so<00:01:51.329> basically<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.829> got<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> more

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so basically you just got a more

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
so basically you just got a more
powerful<00:01:54.090> PC<00:01:54.750> without<00:01:55.049> actually<00:01:55.530> increasing

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
powerful PC without actually increasing

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.980 
powerful PC without actually increasing
the<00:01:55.950> specifications<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.060> operating<00:01:57.780> system

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the specifications the operating system

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.770 
the specifications the operating system
runs<00:01:58.170> lighter<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.159> simpler<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.540> turn

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
runs lighter it's simpler and in turn

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
runs lighter it's simpler and in turn
everything<00:02:01.320> works<00:02:01.740> faster<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.369> much<00:02:02.670> much

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
everything works faster and is much much

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
everything works faster and is much much
quicker<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.180> let's<00:02:03.899> go<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> quick<00:02:04.290> torch

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
quicker so let's go for a quick torch

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
quick look at the back of this thing

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.160 
quick look at the back of this thing
show<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.300> where<00:02:45.450> everything<00:02:45.510> plugs<00:02:45.960> in<00:02:46.110> and

appears your power supply so this is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.540 
appears your power supply so this is
basically<00:02:49.830> where<00:02:50.010> your<00:02:50.130> power<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.460> to

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
you have to DIMM slots over here so like

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.140 
you have to DIMM slots over here so like
I<00:04:04.920> said<00:04:04.980> earlier<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.400> upgradable<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.060> have

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
I said earlier it is upgradable you have

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.090 
I said earlier it is upgradable you have
a<00:04:06.209> 1/2<00:04:06.780> gigabyte<00:04:07.200> card<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.709> there<00:04:07.890> 1<00:04:08.070> 2

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
a 1/2 gigabyte card in there 1 2

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.310 
a 1/2 gigabyte card in there 1 2
gigabyte<00:04:08.520> dim<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:09.180> have<00:04:09.270> 1<00:04:09.480> 1<00:04:09.720> gigabyte<00:04:10.080> in

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
gigabyte dim you have 1 1 gigabyte in

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.870 
gigabyte dim you have 1 1 gigabyte in
giving<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.680> total<00:04:10.800> three<00:04:11.160> gigabytes<00:04:11.430> this

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
giving you a total three gigabytes this

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.410 
giving you a total three gigabytes this
is<00:04:12.110> PC<00:04:13.110> 6400<00:04:14.040> memory<00:04:14.310> or<00:04:14.520> 800<00:04:15.150> megahertz

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
is PC 6400 memory or 800 megahertz

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.770 
is PC 6400 memory or 800 megahertz
memory<00:04:15.840> there's<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.590> simpler<00:04:16.890> way<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.600> say<00:04:18.600> that

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
memory there's a simpler way to say that

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.120 
memory there's a simpler way to say that
and<00:04:18.870> basically<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.770> wanted<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.010> upgrade

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
and basically if you wanted to upgrade

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.740 
and basically if you wanted to upgrade
you<00:04:20.430> could<00:04:20.580> remove<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.970> one<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> replace<00:04:21.510> it

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
you could remove the one and replace it

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
you could remove the one and replace it
with<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> 2<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.350> would<00:04:22.500> give<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> total

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
with a 2 and that would give you a total
