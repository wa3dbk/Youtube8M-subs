Osiris<00:00:16.920> at<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> level<00:00:17.340> 34<00:00:17.820> gear<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.660> all

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
Osiris at a level 34 gear I have all

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.870 
Osiris at a level 34 gear I have all
pieces<00:00:19.410> including<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> class<00:00:20.250> item<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
pieces including the class item so I

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.220 
pieces including the class item so I
figured<00:00:21.150> I'm<00:00:21.240> running<00:00:21.480> through<00:00:21.689> show<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
figured I'm running through show you

they look like with the respective

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.140 
they look like with the respective
shaders<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:26.160> let's<00:00:26.340> start<00:00:26.490> off<00:00:26.670> by<00:00:26.820> taking<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
shaders so let's start off by taking a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
look at the prison of elders sit

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.349 
look at the prison of elders sit
this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.189> beset<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.939> buy<00:00:30.060> from

this is beset that you can buy from

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.540 
this is beset that you can buy from
barracks<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> weekly<00:00:31.199> basis<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.189> now

barracks on a weekly basis and I do now
luckily<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.390> pieces<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
luckily have all pieces one of the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.170 
luckily have all pieces one of the
pieces<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.410> got<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> judgment<00:00:35.160> package<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
pieces I got from a judgment package and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
disgusting strength roller so I will be

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
disgusting strength roller so I will be
rebus<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.960> these<00:00:40.110> pieces<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.800> when<00:00:40.920> they

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
rebus on these pieces as I'm when they

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
rebus on these pieces as I'm when they
become<00:00:41.160> available<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
become available but this is what it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
become available but this is what it
looks<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> armor

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
looks like now as with all the armor

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.680 
looks like now as with all the armor
sets<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.149> least<00:00:45.270> all<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> red<00:00:45.660> ones

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
sets right now at least all the red ones

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
sets right now at least all the red ones
they<00:00:46.440> tend<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.039> orb<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.309> rusty

Brown<00:00:47.969> looking<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> base<00:00:48.660> color<00:00:48.899> but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
Brown looking kind of base color but

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
Brown looking kind of base color but
that's<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> problem<00:00:49.980> given<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that's not really a problem given that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.700 
that's not really a problem given that
you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.640> obviously<00:00:50.969> apply<00:00:51.090> shades<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.809> top<00:00:52.050> so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you can obviously apply shades on top so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
you can obviously apply shades on top so
speaking<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.070> shaders<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
speaking of shaders this right here is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
speaking of shaders this right here is
what<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> looks<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> Queensway<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
what it looks like with the Queensway of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.740 
what it looks like with the Queensway of
shader<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> shader<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.449> from

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
shader which is the shader you get from

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
shader which is the shader you get from
completing<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> level<00:00:58.590> 35<00:00:59.010> version<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
completing the level 35 version of the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
completing the level 35 version of the
prison<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.000> elders<00:01:00.030> once<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> defeat

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
prison of elders once you defeat

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.599 
prison of elders once you defeat
scholars<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.920> down<00:01:02.070> into<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
scholars and you go down into the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.830 
scholars and you go down into the
Queen's<00:01:02.789> boroughs<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.329> open<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.629> chest

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
Queen's boroughs and you open that chest

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
Queen's boroughs and you open that chest
you<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.549> does<00:01:05.760> look<00:01:05.939> pretty

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you then get this it does look pretty

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.890 
you then get this it does look pretty
cool

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
cool

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450

bulb gloss cloak it does actually look
pretty<00:01:14.130> cool<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.060> cloak<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.540> well

against<00:02:47.209> fallen<00:02:47.599> but<00:02:48.109> there<00:02:48.470> are<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.620> few

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
against fallen but there are a few

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.080 
against fallen but there are a few
options<00:02:49.069> that<00:02:49.250> will<00:02:49.430> obviously<00:02:49.519> benefit<00:02:50.000> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
options that will obviously benefit you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.280 
options that will obviously benefit you
where<00:02:50.239> fights<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.599> things<00:02:50.659> like<00:02:50.810> hive<00:02:51.109> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
where fights and things like hive and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.599 
where fights and things like hive and
potentially<00:02:51.709> even<00:02:51.769> cabal<00:02:52.129> I<00:02:52.159> haven't<00:02:52.489> seen

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
potentially even cabal I haven't seen

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.069 
potentially even cabal I haven't seen
them<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:52.879> yet<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.269> imagine<00:02:53.389> they<00:02:54.019> do

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
them just yet but I imagine they do

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.339 
them just yet but I imagine they do
exist<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.680> some<00:02:54.950> form<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.959> lastly<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.109> we<00:02:57.200> move

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
exist in some form and lastly if we move

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.660 
exist in some form and lastly if we move
over<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.799> take<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> look<00:02:58.069> at<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> class

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
over here and take a look at the class

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.160 
over here and take a look at the class
item<00:02:59.030> actually<00:02:59.629> really<00:02:59.810> like<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.019> because

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
new trials of Osiris so I actually got

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.970 
new trials of Osiris so I actually got
the<00:03:32.180> helmets<00:03:32.510> from<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.019> twins<00:03:33.379> package<00:03:33.769> and

the helmets from the a twins package and
the<00:03:34.310> rest<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.609> it<00:03:34.699> I<00:03:34.790> bought<00:03:34.970> on<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.239> weekly

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
the rest of it I bought on a weekly

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.659 
the rest of it I bought on a weekly
basis<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.169> let's<00:03:37.010> go<00:03:37.099> down<00:03:37.250> here<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.519> take<00:03:37.639> a

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
basis so let's go down here and take a

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.309 
basis so let's go down here and take a
look<00:03:37.790> at<00:03:37.909> some<00:03:38.060> shaders<00:03:38.359> first<00:03:38.599> this<00:03:39.109> is<00:03:39.169> what

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
look at some shaders first this is what

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.780 
look at some shaders first this is what
the<00:03:39.470> armor<00:03:39.680> looks<00:03:39.829> like<00:03:39.949> without<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.400> shader

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the armor looks like without a shader

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.250 
the armor looks like without a shader
apply<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.389> as<00:03:41.449> you<00:03:41.510> can<00:03:41.599> see<00:03:41.659> it<00:03:41.870> doesn't<00:03:42.019> have

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
apply so as you can see it doesn't have

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.990 
apply so as you can see it doesn't have
the<00:03:42.349> kind<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.530> generic<00:03:42.799> crowns<00:03:43.220> or<00:03:43.459> rusty<00:03:43.849> look

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
the kind of generic crowns or rusty look

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.550 
the kind of generic crowns or rusty look
it<00:03:44.120> actually<00:03:44.239> has<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.540> really<00:03:44.599> cool<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.199> gold

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
it actually has a really cool like gold

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.140 
it actually has a really cool like gold
and<00:03:45.620> white<00:03:45.799> bandage<00:03:46.220> look<00:03:46.430> somebody's<00:03:47.090> got

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
and white bandage look somebody's got

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.460 
and white bandage look somebody's got
the<00:03:47.299> Egyptian<00:03:47.629> theme<00:03:47.780> running<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.199> this<00:03:48.319> is

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the Egyptian theme running and this is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.250 
the Egyptian theme running and this is
also<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.829> class<00:03:49.040> item<00:03:49.459> as<00:03:49.519> well<00:03:50.260> now

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
also the class item as well now

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.990 
also the class item as well now
unfortunately<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.799> don't<00:03:51.889> actually<00:03:52.310> have<00:03:52.609> the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
unfortunately I don't actually have the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520 
unfortunately I don't actually have the
trials<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.329> osiris<00:03:53.720> shader<00:03:53.930> just<00:03:54.169> yet

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
trials of osiris shader just yet

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.599 
trials of osiris shader just yet
so<00:03:54.680> for<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.859> time<00:03:55.010> being<00:03:55.220> let<00:03:55.370> me<00:03:55.430> show<00:03:55.549> you

so for the time being let me show you

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.009 
so for the time being let me show you

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
this with the Queen's web shader which

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.659 
this with the Queen's web shader which
is<00:03:57.139> obviously<00:03:57.379> as<00:03:57.620> mentioned<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.430> one<00:03:58.549> you

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
get from completing the prison of elders

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.050 
get from completing the prison of elders
on<00:04:00.139> level<00:04:00.500> 35<00:04:00.919> I'm<00:04:01.519> not<00:04:01.639> sure<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:01.940> the
