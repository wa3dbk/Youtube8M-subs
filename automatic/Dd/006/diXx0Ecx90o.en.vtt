Taekwondo<00:00:36.030> Lu<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.329> pretty<00:00:36.630> well<00:00:37.550> but<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.700> don't

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
Taekwondo Lu is pretty well but we don't

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.440 
Taekwondo Lu is pretty well but we don't
know<00:00:39.030> why<00:00:39.239> these<00:00:39.300> kids<00:00:39.719> are<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.260> effective

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.729 

even<00:00:45.450> our<00:00:45.690> instructor<00:00:46.230> can't<00:00:46.440> explain

even our instructor can't explain

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
even our instructor can't explain
everything<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> we're<00:00:50.670> gonna<00:00:50.789> investigate

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
everything so we're gonna investigate

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.930 
everything so we're gonna investigate
kicking<00:00:51.809> power<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.260> ourselves<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:58.350> question

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
kicking power for ourselves the question

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.729 
kicking power for ourselves the question
why<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.000> tackle<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:00.930> kicks<00:01:01.199> work<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
why you tackle on your kicks work so

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.250 
why you tackle on your kicks work so
well<00:01:02.930> hmm

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
well hmm

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
well hmm
what<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.040> real<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> work<00:01:06.210> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
what you see is real it's the work of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.250 
what you see is real it's the work of
science<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.280> makes<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.700> strong<00:01:08.909> kick<00:01:09.299> well

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
science so what makes a strong kick well

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.200 
science so what makes a strong kick well
I<00:01:10.590> guess<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.549> positioned<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I guess we have to be positioned a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
I guess we have to be positioned a
certain<00:01:12.570> way<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.590> our<00:01:13.830> muscle<00:01:14.369> power

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
certain way so we use our muscle power

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.280 
certain way so we use our muscle power
and<00:01:14.729> coordination<00:01:15.360> without<00:01:15.869> falling<00:01:16.229> over

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
and coordination without falling over

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.480 
and coordination without falling over
but<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.500> take<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> wrong<00:01:19.979> way

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
but if you take the wrong way

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
but if you take the wrong way
either<00:01:20.820> fall<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.299> hurt<00:01:21.689> our<00:01:21.840> foot<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.259> Miss

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
either fall down hurt our foot so Miss

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.999 
either fall down hurt our foot so Miss
Ike<00:01:22.590> Ike

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.670 

so<00:01:31.490> what<00:01:31.670> can<00:01:31.789> we<00:01:31.880> touch<00:01:32.140> we<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.320> see<00:01:33.500> how<00:01:33.649> our

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
so what can we touch we can see how our

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.560 
so what can we touch we can see how our
foot<00:01:34.130> position<00:01:34.549> affects<00:01:34.850> our<00:01:35.000> kicks<00:01:35.270> power

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
foot position affects our kicks power

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.980 
foot position affects our kicks power
and<00:01:35.960> stability<00:01:36.229> ready<00:01:37.219> begin<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.960> can

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
and stability ready begin you can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:57.459 
and stability ready begin you can
exercise<00:01:39.380> for<00:01:39.920> time<00:01:56.140> we're<00:01:57.140> guessing<00:01:57.319> that

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
exercise for time we're guessing that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.350 
exercise for time we're guessing that
our<00:01:57.740> stability<00:01:57.979> has<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.549> lot<00:01:58.819> to<00:01:58.850> do<00:01:59.060> with<00:01:59.179> how

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
our stability has a lot to do with how

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.649 
our stability has a lot to do with how
our<00:01:59.509> feet<00:01:59.689> are<00:01:59.840> planted<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.939> see<00:02:02.240> exactly

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
our feet are planted so to see exactly

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.210 
our feet are planted so to see exactly
how<00:02:02.899> our<00:02:02.959> weight<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.349> pressing<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.799> our<00:02:03.979> feet

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
how our weight is pressing on our feet

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.070 
how our weight is pressing on our feet
we'll<00:02:04.670> use<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.849> high-tech<00:02:05.119> foot<00:02:05.599> pressure<00:02:05.810> pad

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
we'll use a high-tech foot pressure pad
