00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
has to say about this new creation well

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.250 
has to say about this new creation well
it's<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.680> up<00:00:25.920> there<00:00:29.660> alright<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.230> we

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
it's going up there alright so here we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.970 
it's going up there alright so here we
are<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.660> also<00:00:33.660> explain<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.800> got

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
are here is also explain what we got

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.670 
are here is also explain what we got
here

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 

you<00:00:41.550> might<00:00:41.730> want<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> bring<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> computer

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
you might want to bring the computer

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.090 
you might want to bring the computer
over<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> headset<00:00:43.559> can't<00:00:43.950> go

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
over here because the headset can't go

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
over here because the headset can't go
that<00:00:44.250> far<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.700> calm<00:00:45.500> okay

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that far it's calm okay

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.540 
that far it's calm okay
you<00:00:47.579> bring<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> computer<00:00:48.210> over<00:00:48.420> seeking<00:00:52.550> all

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you bring the computer over seeking all

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.090 
you bring the computer over seeking all
right<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.680> four-stroke<00:00:55.680> engine

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
right so this is a four-stroke engine

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.240 
right so this is a four-stroke engine
with<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> seven<00:00:57.480> cylinders<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.039> switch

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
with a seven cylinders so this switch

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.490 
with a seven cylinders so this switch
starts<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:02.300> if<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> compression<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
starts it if you use the compression and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.130 
starts it if you use the compression and
power<00:01:04.710> stroke<00:01:05.100> cycle<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.960> intake<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
power stroke cycle and the intake and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460 
power stroke cycle and the intake and
exhaust<00:01:07.229> cycle<00:01:08.810> ensuing<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> valves<00:01:10.260> down

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
exhaust cycle ensuing the valves down

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.710 
exhaust cycle ensuing the valves down
the<00:01:11.159> combustion<00:01:11.580> cycle<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.180> active<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.659> can

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the combustion cycle is active you can

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.310 
the combustion cycle is active you can
see<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.170> light<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.490> comes<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
see this light up here comes on on the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
see this light up here comes on on the
power<00:01:16.500> stroke<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.310> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> cool<00:01:17.930> back

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
power stroke which is kind of cool back

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
power stroke which is kind of cool back
here<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.950> Redstone

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
here you can see all the Redstone

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
here you can see all the Redstone
workings<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.659> back<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> clock<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
workings and back here is the clock I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.810 
workings and back here is the clock I
see<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:24.150> controls<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> speed<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.820> quote

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
see that controls the speed or quote

you<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> call<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:34.610> it's<00:01:35.610> all

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you want to call it and it's all

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.420 
you want to call it and it's all
controlled<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.930> got<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> dead<00:01:37.350> a
