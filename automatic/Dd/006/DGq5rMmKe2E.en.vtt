00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.120 
want to say they're both water wave
before<00:06:00.000> whatever<00:06:00.479> reason<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.320> feel<00:06:01.590> like<00:06:01.890> the

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
before whatever reason I feel like the

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.730 
before whatever reason I feel like the
curl<00:06:02.400> pattern<00:06:02.970> is<00:06:03.150> different<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.260> darker

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
curl pattern is different in the darker

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.219 
curl pattern is different in the darker
ones<00:06:04.919> than<00:06:05.729> it<00:06:05.910> is<00:06:06.060> in<00:06:06.300> this<00:06:06.570> light<00:06:07.050> one<00:06:07.410> I<00:06:09.229> want

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
ones than it is in this light one I want

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.350 
ones than it is in this light one I want
to<00:06:10.350> say<00:06:10.560> that<00:06:10.800> I<00:06:10.979> want<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.340> say<00:06:11.550> that<00:06:11.850> the<00:06:12.060> curl

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
to say that I want to say that the curl

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.190 
to say that I want to say that the curl
millimeters<00:06:13.320> are<00:06:13.820> smaller<00:06:14.820> in<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.660> light<00:06:15.870> one

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
millimeters are smaller in the light one

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.490 
millimeters are smaller in the light one
just<00:06:16.650> slightly<00:06:16.979> smaller<00:06:17.220> than<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.479> is<00:06:18.630> in<00:06:18.960> the

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
just slightly smaller than it is in the

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.430 
just slightly smaller than it is in the
darker<00:06:20.370> hair<00:06:20.669> and<00:06:20.970> you'll<00:06:21.840> see<00:06:22.080> that<00:06:22.229> on

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
darker hair and you'll see that on

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.990 
darker hair and you'll see that on
certain<00:06:22.620> websites<00:06:23.220> you<00:06:23.460> know<00:06:23.580> when<00:06:23.729> they<00:06:23.820> talk

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
certain websites you know when they talk

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.969 
certain websites you know when they talk
about<00:06:24.030> you<00:06:24.510> know<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.780> curl<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.350> then<00:06:25.740> it's

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
about you know the curl and then it's

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.890 
about you know the curl and then it's
got<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.220> little<00:06:26.250> mmm<00:06:26.850> my<00:06:27.030> it<00:06:27.090> would<00:06:27.330> be<00:06:27.450> like<00:06:27.600> 6

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
got the little mmm my it would be like 6

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.590 
got the little mmm my it would be like 6
mm<00:06:28.350> 8<00:06:28.590> mm<00:06:29.070> you<00:06:29.520> know<00:06:29.640> it's<00:06:29.669> just<00:06:30.060> talking<00:06:30.390> about

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
mm 8 mm you know it's just talking about

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.260 
mm 8 mm you know it's just talking about
the<00:06:30.810> size<00:06:31.260> of<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:32.070> curl<00:06:32.340> and<00:06:32.729> I<00:06:32.850> just<00:06:33.060> feel

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
the size of the curl and I just feel

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.120 
the size of the curl and I just feel
like<00:06:33.479> this<00:06:33.720> is<00:06:35.240> smaller<00:06:36.740> than<00:06:37.740> other<00:06:37.950> ones

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
like this is smaller than other ones

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.800 
like this is smaller than other ones
doesn't<00:06:38.550> mean<00:06:38.640> that<00:06:38.760> I<00:06:38.849> don't<00:06:39.030> like<00:06:39.300> it

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
doesn't mean that I don't like it

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.440 
doesn't mean that I don't like it
means<00:06:40.050> that<00:06:40.260> it<00:06:40.380> just<00:06:40.560> looks<00:06:41.060> different<00:06:42.060> you

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
means that it just looks different you

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.110 
means that it just looks different you
know<00:06:42.570> you<00:06:43.100> you'll<00:06:44.100> be<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.460> judge<00:06:44.700> you<00:06:45.030> judge

know you you'll be the judge you judge
for<00:06:45.450> yourself

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
you get your chains you know how rolls
