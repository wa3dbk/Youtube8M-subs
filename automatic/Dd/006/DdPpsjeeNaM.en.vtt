00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 let be 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 ten years have passed since the release of the original 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.829
 parts fable very first 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.379
 the one about which peter is for her 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.390
 said it would be a breakthrough genre 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.089
 role-playing games that this will be a breakthrough genre 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 adventure general all the while this 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.449
 the game we developed the line actively 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.430
 put us in the brain the idea that his game 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.890
 there will be a revolution in not only in the genre a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 generally break all computer game 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.390
 when the game came out 10 years ago it became 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.699
 it is clear that the moulin principle love 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.799
 lying on one side before fable was 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.540
 very good game on the other hand 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.900
 no revolution in the role-playing genre 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 no adventure happened just 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.329
 made a very good adventure 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 role-playing game, and now, after 10 years out 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.650
 fable anniversary 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 essentially restarting the very game 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.100
 on the modern engine it would seem 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.659
 10 years, I had to shamelessly outdated 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.909
 him clio save the new engine 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.360
 thunder do the last part of the game was not 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.120
 quite clear it turned out that moving well 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.780
 let's say it went with some problem 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.780
 hiv 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.020
 majesty because you can however makenna &amp; 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.549
 tile we have a tensor 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.320
 anti years and after passing fable 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.840
 university it becomes clear that with 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.220
 one hand mechanic and interesting 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.649
 fable after 10 years 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.079
 well, almost not lost here 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.439
 interesting good role system 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.270
 here is an interesting plot here unusual 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.819
 characters and very interesting 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.160
 Now this whole adventure line at 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.200
 games don't take away like 10 years ago this 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.599
 looked good and now it 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.780
 looks not bad on the other hand there is 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.709
 two powerful problems the first problem is 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.900
 surprisingly 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.540
 size of locations after the second and third 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.790
 fable where locations were already huge 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.590
 habitual for role-playing games of modern 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.950
 genre itself though by the way did not reach 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.110
 the size of the location in the first fable looks 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.000
 well, just a very depressing trial 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.680
 small spaces constantly 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.599
 there is a download path well, that is, you 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.970
 there run a few tens of seconds in 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.370
 one side tom went under boot 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.310
 it annoys well that is translating 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.810
 game on a modern engine in principle 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.670
 nothing prevented developers from spending 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.920
 a little more money and time and these 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.650
 Here are some small locations to combine 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.510
 into larger spaces now in 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.069
 the era of modern games in runet gene 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.109
 completely unreasonable existence 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.900
 it hinders such small spaces 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.000
 the game but okay if only it unfortunately 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.010
 when porting a game to a new engine 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 the developers have added well just 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.540
 an incredible amount of bugs 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.609
 periodically opponents get stuck in 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.250
 stones you stick systems not 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.019
 You can continue to periodically play 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.450
 starts plug slow down in those 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.190
 places where you ask the game for decades 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.620
 prescription cannot brake purely 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.290
 theoretically this porting problem 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.260
 this is obviously understandable but the developers 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.390
 For some reason, not before polished transferred 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.490
 A new game engine is such a strange 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.220
 hitch 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.220
 you even cool something and rolling ice 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.220
 you to anyone's letters here and finally more 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.820
 one problem that does not immediately rush 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.780
 in the eyes 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.320
 1 fable was very bright juicy beautiful 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.290
 play 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.450
 the palette was really very very 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.280
 bright and due to this the game remained in 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.000
 memory well I donâ€™t know what a rainbow 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.040
 candy 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.770
 you look at her and execute all these 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.990
 beautiful woods coppice fields due 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.720
 In order that the contrast of colors and very high 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.190
 when moving to a new version of the engine all 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.530
 such bright pictures 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.870
 they suddenly seemed to blur their 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.120
 so slightly diluted to the engine 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.280
 the last fibula he is about such 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.710
 he is not so bright not so juicy 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.240
 but really it was impossible to do more 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.880
 bright textures could not be 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.690
 somehow work the light to 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.180
 transferred to the new engine 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.940
 The game of the SSU also changed somehow the most 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.800
 brooches which we saw 10 years ago no 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.800
 unfortunately this is not happening 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.770
 auto mail.ru 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.560
 how to send with 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.150
 what happens on the one hand fans 1 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.740
 facebook who probably wanted to 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.680
 play this part on a new engine 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.000
 got essentially the same game then 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.860
 there is really here in terms of 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.080
 location locations of objects and other things 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.789
 moved everything up to a meter if 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.500
 there was a pebble and there will be a pebble 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.810
 if there was an opponent and there will be 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.449
 the enemy if there were trees growing and 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.849
 here it grows exactly in the same place but 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.400
 at the same time, they overcame the problem with the gods and 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.310
 rather strange visual palette 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.210
 It is worth going well if you really love 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.889
 fable then surely yes you can go but here 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.830
 straight really only for those fans 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.900
 who have been waiting so long for the fairies 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.340
 was exactly on the engine and new players 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.740
 which 1 fable did not see they got 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.599
 good role-playing adventure game 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.789
 which in terms of organization 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.840
 location of playing space for those 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.430
 most 10 years out of date and in principle 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.740
 lack of adventure role-playing 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.840
 games now it is not observed for the sake of 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.289
 what to the person who never played 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.419
 fable 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.949
 install it and go through here now 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.699
 this here is a game a decade ago on 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.180
 new engine 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:08.280
 I personally do not quite understand why my 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.280
 score of 6 points
