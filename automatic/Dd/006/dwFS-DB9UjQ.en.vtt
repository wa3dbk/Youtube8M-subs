forward I sucked to the left side and

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.029 
forward I sucked to the left side and
there<00:05:06.509> are<00:05:06.659> guys<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:07.229> will<00:05:07.379> come<00:05:07.620> out<00:05:07.740> on<00:05:07.949> the

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
there are guys that will come out on the

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:08.959 
there are guys that will come out on the
right-hand<00:05:08.400> side

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
right-hand side

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.629 
right-hand side
pulse<00:05:09.659> firing<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.289> good<00:05:10.530> with<00:05:10.740> this<00:05:10.949> assault

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
pulse firing is good with this assault

rifle noscope hip firing or not noscope

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.249 
rifle noscope hip firing or not noscope
I<00:05:16.710> guess<00:05:17.039> we<00:05:17.190> do<00:05:17.310> have<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.490> scope<00:05:17.789> on<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:17.969> so<00:05:18.569> it

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
I guess we do have a scope on it so it

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.680 
I guess we do have a scope on it so it
is<00:05:19.409> technically<00:05:20.039> no<00:05:20.190> scoping<00:05:20.639> so<00:05:21.479> come

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
is technically no scoping so come

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.809 
is technically no scoping so come
