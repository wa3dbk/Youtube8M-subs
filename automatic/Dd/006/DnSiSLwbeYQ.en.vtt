00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.889 
out of the paint can't get B baseline
but<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> live<00:01:44.939> drill<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.420> think

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
but it's a live drill I think

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.440 
but it's a live drill I think
communication<00:01:46.229> takes<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> dip<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.180> think

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
communication takes a dip and I think

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.789 
communication takes a dip and I think
that<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> detail<00:01:49.320> stuff<00:01:49.590> like

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that some of the detail stuff like

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.499 
that some of the detail stuff like
throwing<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:50.189> hands<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> closeout<00:01:51.000> some

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
throwing your hands on a closeout some

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.240 
throwing your hands on a closeout some
of<00:01:51.600> those<00:01:51.689> things<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.079> away<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:53.100> you're

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
of those things go away because you're

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.590 
of those things go away because you're
going<00:01:53.369> live<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> players<00:01:54.420> are

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
going live now and all the players are

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.940 
going live now and all the players are
thinking<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.290> got<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> keep<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
thinking about it say I got to keep it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.410 
thinking about it say I got to keep it
out<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> paint<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.520> can't<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.880> B<00:01:57.000> baseline

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
out of the paint I can't get B baseline

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020 
out of the paint I can't get B baseline
it<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.290> about<00:01:58.530> those<00:01:58.740> details<00:01:58.950> though<00:01:59.490> that's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
it is about those details though that's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.870 
it is about those details though that's
where<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.360> team<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:00.990> better

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
where your team is going to get better

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.130 
where your team is going to get better
make<00:02:02.880> sure<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.210> closeout<00:02:03.600> both<00:02:03.810> hands<00:02:04.020> go

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
make sure on the closeout both hands go

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.139 
make sure on the closeout both hands go
high<00:02:04.350> okay<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.790> go<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.060> more

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
high okay all right here we go one more

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.429 
high okay all right here we go one more
time<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.540> we'll<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> competitive

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
time then we'll do it as a competitive

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.580 
time then we'll do it as a competitive
drill<00:02:08.629> good

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.890 

the<00:02:18.640> question<00:02:18.970> was<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.390> point<00:02:19.660> for<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the question was is that a point for the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.460 
the question was is that a point for the
defense<00:02:20.290> it's<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.490> drill<00:02:22.290> we've<00:02:23.290> got
