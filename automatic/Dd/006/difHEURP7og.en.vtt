00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.200
 best mood with maxi glue 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.960
 although he is in the meantime 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.320
 media training in bonn as white balance 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.990
 had to serve and also at the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.970
 other german national players 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.869
 There was a relaxed mood after 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.789
 the sovereign victory against luxembourg 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.400
 since monday evening , this is preparing 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.210
 dbb team in bonn on the important game 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.579
 against the poland on wednesday evening 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 in telekom dome should be a big one 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.730
 step in things em qualification 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.730
 be made 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 but before the game is after the game 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.600
 or something like that and the half-time of the em 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.480
 Quali reason enough a small balance too 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.449
 pull 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.699
 well she is not consistently positive me 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.890
 find the game against poland that have 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.710
 we unnecessarily lost and against 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 Austria we have the first 30 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.320
 minutes did not play well at the end 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.630
 which I am very positive 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.549
 was positive that we were 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 against Austria a very large 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.540
 have accomplished militant performance 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.680
 the last ten minutes even if it is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.970
 actually not at all before that 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 So we looked at ourselves 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.869
 out of the hole, so to speak 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.600
 rausgeholt in which we ourselves purely 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 have formed and found against Luxembourg 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 I have very much concentrated 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 played intensively and that actually 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.979
 the almost the entire game over and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.780
 have not let up 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.909
 I found that very positive and also 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 now you can see the poles in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.960
 have lost Austria and neither with 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.930
 You have won 14 points then you can 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.950
 that relativize sometimes and then 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.810
 you may find that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.860
 Austria is not as bad as it is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.189
 is claimed by many as two 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.259
 stay for days coach emir mutapcic 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.250
 the team's recipe for victory against 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.930
 to mediate the poles of the first 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.060
 could gallop up the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.990
 press representatives on monday evening itself 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.990
 to take a picture 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.800
 sweat for the big performance 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.680
 then everyone in the team wants to be the best 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.050
 give and to the spectators in bonn 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 The game also delivers the good 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.240
 roleplayer and hotmaker in the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.110
 Team are in demand tomorrow 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.070
 the federal trainer yesterday the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.750
 press conference again 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.950
 pointed out that you as one of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.360
 Players do not play games that much 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.100
 important function and role in the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.530
 team has how do you go with it yourself 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.480
 that you give a lot to the team 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.280
 outside although relatively rare on the outside 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.650
 field stands 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.900
 yes I mean I knew in advance 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.040
 that I'm probably quali at the em 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.840
 not gonna play that much 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.860
 was there from the beginning then have 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.660
 played at the beginning more yes is now 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.530
 already my third summer and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.480
 try a lot from the bank 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.030
 to bring passion and emotions 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.130
 and to motivate the boys and im 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.260
 training to give everything and I think 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.110
 that I am doing the role quite well 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.510
 can fill in and thereby some boys 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.000
 even better in training we do 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.350
 are fully motivated and we know that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.600
 there is something good to do there 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.489
 We always have to be awesome when in Bonn 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.820
 atmosphere is we know that from the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.280
 except league and therefore it will be 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.500
 It will be a great game and the fans 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.480
 can be on a good fight 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.000
 set focused and with that 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.120
 Focus on Wednesday prepares the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.250
 dbb selection continues 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.989
 the necessary ease the goal in 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.989
 the boys have to attack 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.890
 besides, the captain demands 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.180
 we have to fight until we fall over 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.379
 I think if we do that then 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.510
 We will always be one 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.390
 and then we will 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.129
 hopefully also use the important 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.129
 game against poland can come
