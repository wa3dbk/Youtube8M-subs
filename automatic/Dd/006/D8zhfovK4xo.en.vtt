bar<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.879> half<00:03:50.120> go<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:50.569> do<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.720> now<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:52.069> could

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
bar is half go and do it now you could

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.129 
bar is half go and do it now you could
even<00:03:52.579> wait<00:03:52.939> until<00:03:53.060> it's<00:03:53.419> really<00:03:53.599> low<00:03:53.870> but

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
even wait until it's really low but

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.659 
even wait until it's really low but
that's<00:03:54.409> just<00:03:54.530> really<00:03:54.769> risky<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.400> mean<00:03:55.579> I

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
that's just really risky I mean I

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.490 
that's just really risky I mean I
remember<00:03:56.239> I<00:03:56.269> lost<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.870> lot<00:03:57.049> of<00:03:57.139> times<00:03:57.379> just

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
remember I lost this a lot of times just

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.439 
remember I lost this a lot of times just
because<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:58.099> would<00:03:58.609> wait<00:03:58.760> till<00:03:59.000> it's<00:03:59.120> too<00:03:59.239> low

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
because I would wait till it's too low

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.259 
because I would wait till it's too low
also<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.530> enemies<00:04:00.889> randomly<00:04:01.579> hit<00:04:01.819> your<00:04:02.000> board

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
also the enemies randomly hit your board

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.089 
also the enemies randomly hit your board
so<00:04:02.629> even<00:04:02.959> if<00:04:03.079> they<00:04:03.199> hit<00:04:03.319> one<00:04:03.590> spot<00:04:03.889> on<00:04:04.069> your

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
so even if they hit one spot on your

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.490 
so even if they hit one spot on your
battleship<00:04:04.790> they<00:04:05.269> won't<00:04:05.599> hit<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.989> rest<00:04:06.199> of<00:04:06.349> it

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
battleship they won't hit the rest of it

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.129 
battleship they won't hit the rest of it
because<00:04:07.069> it's<00:04:07.220> randomly<00:04:07.810> generated<00:04:08.810> at<00:04:08.959> which

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
because it's randomly generated at which

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.189 
because it's randomly generated at which
spot<00:04:09.409> they<00:04:09.560> hit<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.329> if<00:04:11.329> they<00:04:11.479> hit<00:04:11.629> it<00:04:11.689> once<00:04:12.049> you

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
spot they hit so if they hit it once you

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.420 
spot they hit so if they hit it once you
don't<00:04:12.379> have<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.530> worry<00:04:12.680> about<00:04:12.799> losing<00:04:13.099> because

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
don't have to worry about losing because

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.270 
don't have to worry about losing because
they<00:04:13.759> will<00:04:13.939> keep<00:04:14.840> randomly<00:04:15.199> shooting<00:04:15.590> then

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
they will keep randomly shooting then

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.080 
they will keep randomly shooting then
once<00:04:16.820> you've<00:04:17.030> got<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.329> done<00:04:17.570> your<00:04:17.900> finish<00:04:18.289> and

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
once you've got it done your finish and

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.140 
once you've got it done your finish and
your

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
five things to do and since you can do

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.510 
five things to do and since you can do
ten<00:06:08.270> tricks<00:06:08.630> you<00:06:08.810> will<00:06:09.020> have<00:06:09.199> to<00:06:09.409> do<00:06:09.560> multiple

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
ten tricks you will have to do multiple

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.339 
ten tricks you will have to do multiple
repeatedly<00:06:11.449> so<00:06:12.550> keep<00:06:13.550> that<00:06:13.580> in<00:06:13.849> mind<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:15.080> if

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
repeatedly so keep that in mind so if

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.010 
repeatedly so keep that in mind so if
you're<00:06:15.500> just<00:06:15.770> here<00:06:15.979> for<00:06:16.010> XP<00:06:16.550> then<00:06:17.020> you're

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
you're just here for XP then you're

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.600 
you're just here for XP then you're
doing<00:06:18.289> all<00:06:18.440> ten<00:06:18.740> won't<00:06:19.190> give<00:06:19.400> you<00:06:19.490> an

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
doing all ten won't give you an

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.670 
doing all ten won't give you an
advantage<00:06:19.880> over<00:06:20.120> doing<00:06:20.449> all<00:06:20.570> five<00:06:20.840> but<00:06:21.650> I

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
advantage over doing all five but I

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.080 
advantage over doing all five but I
don't<00:06:22.010> really<00:06:22.099> know<00:06:22.280> why<00:06:22.460> they<00:06:22.669> did<00:06:22.849> that<00:06:22.880> but

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
don't really know why they did that but

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.210 
don't really know why they did that but
I<00:06:23.360> guess<00:06:23.659> it's<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:24.169> give<00:06:24.470> you<00:06:24.560> a<00:06:24.620> chance<00:06:24.860> at<00:06:25.130> the

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
I guess it's to give you a chance at the

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.200 
I guess it's to give you a chance at the
ringmaster<00:06:25.789> why<00:06:26.360> because<00:06:26.720> I<00:06:26.960> did<00:06:27.500> 50<00:06:28.010> I<00:06:28.580> didn't

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
ringmaster why because I did 50 I didn't

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.810 
ringmaster why because I did 50 I didn't
all<00:06:29.330> all<00:06:29.599> five<00:06:29.960> of<00:06:29.990> the

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
all all five of the

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.110 
all all five of the
the<00:06:32.150> possible<00:06:32.720> actions<00:06:33.290> twice<00:06:33.890> and<00:06:34.250> I<00:06:34.760> managed

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
the possible actions twice and I managed

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.380 
the possible actions twice and I managed
to<00:06:35.210> score<00:06:35.450> 920<00:06:36.320> on<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.560> performance<00:06:37.390> so

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
to score 920 on the performance so

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.900 
to score 920 on the performance so
imagine<00:06:38.780> just<00:06:39.140> doing<00:06:39.410> the<00:06:39.860> level<00:06:40.100> 90<00:06:40.550> and<00:06:40.820> then

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
imagine just doing the level 90 and then

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.790 
imagine just doing the level 90 and then
doing<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.180> mountain<00:06:41.630> level<00:06:41.870> 90<00:06:42.200> a<00:06:42.230> mote<00:06:42.530> it<00:06:42.710> be

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
doing the mountain level 90 a mote it be

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.650 
doing the mountain level 90 a mote it be
really<00:06:43.220> really<00:06:43.460> easy<00:06:43.760> to<00:06:43.910> get<00:06:44.030> ringmaster

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
really really easy to get ringmaster

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.100 
really really easy to get ringmaster
that<00:06:44.870> way<00:06:45.020> so<00:06:46.300> that's<00:06:47.300> good<00:06:47.480> and<00:06:47.660> the<00:06:47.720> XP<00:06:48.020> is

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
that way so that's good and the XP is

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.290 
that way so that's good and the XP is
pretty<00:06:48.320> good<00:06:48.470> too<00:06:48.530> I<00:06:48.920> got<00:06:49.100> 12<00:06:49.460> k<00:06:49.700> XP<00:06:50.030> and<00:06:50.180> I'm

pretty good too I got 12 k XP and I'm
level<00:06:50.810> 80<00:06:51.080> thieving<00:06:51.670> now<00:06:52.960> obviously<00:06:53.960> you

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
level 80 thieving now obviously you

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.020 
level 80 thieving now obviously you
could<00:06:54.680> get<00:06:54.770> more<00:06:55.040> with<00:06:55.190> a<00:06:55.220> higher<00:06:55.490> thieving

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
could get more with a higher thieving

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.530 
could get more with a higher thieving
level<00:06:56.300> but<00:06:56.810> for<00:06:57.350> 80<00:06:57.590> I<00:06:57.740> got<00:06:58.190> 12<00:06:58.670> k<00:06:58.790> XP<00:06:59.120> so<00:06:59.360> that's
