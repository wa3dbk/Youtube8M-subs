00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.379
 commenting today I bring you as you see the 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.729
 title the presentation of a new 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:09.970
 series for the channel I think very 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.770
 expected and good many people because 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.800
 that I had asked for it interests him then 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.480
 a lot to know the subject of respawn this 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.700
 course than the maps and so good 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.170
 I have this first gameplay in principle 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.760
 to present the series to talk to you 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.140
 about her and also because I'm going to 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.720
 take advantage when it's just 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.430
 present the series and all that to talk 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.780
 of how to also predict a little 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.730
 Responses are confirmed especially in 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.020
 this map so you can get an idea of 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.339
 how will the series go though good the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.929
 series of principles said wang be 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.030
 private games as he says warfare 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.129
 3 explaining where to start moving 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.409
 in a domain and good game 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.420
 explaining the different response and the 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.550
 zones of different danger is not to say 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.519
 how much probability do you have that you 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.780
 come out enemies or die for an area 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.609
 on the other hand, not what is the most 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.859
 advantageous to turn the map by 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.859
 well then say it good before 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.600
 start to explain the series a bit 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.709
 I wanted to solve a few doubts that 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 you have put me in the comments 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.530
 lately that I have seen during 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.059
 repeated and well one of them I think that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.790
 comes from that this is the other day uploaded 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.500
 the statistics of your profile and many 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.800
 I wanted to see my statistics that appeared 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 above you in the ranking of 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.080
 statistics so good a month ago or 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.430
 a month and I went up to the channel as the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.780
 last prestige the prestige teacher 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.820
 for things also that you tell me that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.470
 you have that I have the jaco so good what 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.870
 you have in the channel perfectly 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.120
 explained how to pass to prestige 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.700
 teacher and you can also have my 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.670
 statistics ratio of victories of 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.880
 low teaches the casualties taught also 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.350
 I think a little the gusts and good for 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.869
 look for the channel also you have to put 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.640
 simply in the youtube search engine 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.770
 then you put ok and prestige teacher and I 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.479
 I think it will work out and then also 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.800
 you asked for a tutorial of my emblem 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.180
 not that it is the emblem that takes us now 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.830
 same in the placed weapon but good is 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.500
 the weapon is the emblem that I have in the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.180
 profile which is that of it is assumed the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.310
 of the channel no more or less similar and 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.509
 well you also have a tutorial if 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.550
 Also look for the channel, because you 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.990
 all the emblem shock and also in the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.290
 youtube search engine and I think it will come out 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.670
 ok is a complete student of how 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.990
 make them the emblem if you want you can 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.520
 change the name and all that that like 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.580
 You want that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.620
 and I tell you how the shield is the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.180
 such a skull and then you all 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 you can change it as you want with all 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.700
 freedom to use the emblem as you wish and 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 well finally I was also wondering and 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.020
 I also read that gasco 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.760
 So I used the helmets I did a review 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.590
 you also have by the description the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.320
 review of the helmets in which he explained 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.700
 how are tau tacos and those of the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.350
 quality they have etc 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 so it's good to spend also for that 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.980
 video if you are curious to know 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.760
 what is the helmets are you using yesterday 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.930
 in the in 2.0 and well before you start 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.150
 to Athens and I will also talk a little 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.560
 of the game in general is a game 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.110
 very good that only dies once 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.970
 I was trying not to die it is 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.170
 trying to control well the response of 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.450
 what the series is going to deal with so that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.770
 come - how do you do it? 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.480
 moving around the map so I'm going 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.400
 little bit to sack but more than anything I'm 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.950
 focused on trying not to get killed 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.930
 try to have control of the backups 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.640
 then well let's start talking a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.080
 little of the series as you see in the title 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.560
 Well, it's going to be treated like I said 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.790
 series of respawn strategies of how 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.350
 learn respawn or how 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.520
 control them and good in this case has 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.400
 put streaks where you can 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.260
 exactly how the rest works 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.390
 is the being with which we see all the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.340
 map the entire ship and we see that the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.620
 enemies begin to be reborn 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.810
 in the part at the tip of the ship that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.510
 would be the bow if I'm wrong and then 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.100
 back in the stern then those mistakes 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.320
 with principals that happens that according to 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.600
 fellow mt is to say or look at the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.100
 response are going to change is to say if 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.900
 example the partners are at the tip 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.880
 of the boat they will do in the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.570
 another on the other side of the ship and if so 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.100
 to be 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.960
 there are partners on both sides you are 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.430
 you as in this case the enemies 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.930
 they will start doing the middle part 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.790
 of the boat worth is a bit random that 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.380
 they will start doing so they can even 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.120
 do in domains and that are born quite 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.490
 on the side of the ship that catwalk that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.800
 have to the left that I go too 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.540
 can do near the house that 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.849
 right there I'm not pointing 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.060
 It is advisable that you always leave 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.290
 them a respawn zone for example in 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.519
 this map what I was trying was 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.409
 all the time move it by this the the 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.269
 boat trying to get away a lot and that 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.650
 the comrades were gone okay they were not 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.500
 teammates until juande me 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.820
 alone but try to make the companions 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.289
 they were at another end of the ship to 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.699
 to be able to catch comfortably is here the 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.810
 backing you do not see that from time to time 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.000
 He took a look, although his companions 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.770
 they started to leave they had been reborn back 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.419
 and good now is when the companions 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.500
 they start to put in the enemy base and 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.360
 when will you start to change the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.370
 answer a little then well you see 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.840
 As I go back, one came 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.979
 down you also see how it is already 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.750
 changing the answer we said 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.979
 as long as the partners advance the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.380
 I am responsible for everything and I tell you 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.750
 confirmed will change and a lot so 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.880
 you have to be very careful here 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.370
 We were in a dangerous situation 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.280
 I was super red trying to escape 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.900
 pulling lv sad and good with the bone then 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.389
 You also see very well where the 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.190
 enemies and if you have too much 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.380
 curiosity for example to learn 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.479
 ourselves responsible for what 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.919
 whether you get into the cinema mode of the 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.199
 heading and choose the option of 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.070
 commentators and you give the button x in the 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.070
 xbox or square 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.949
 in which you will see at all times 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.239
 where are people born so also 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.039
 you can learn a little bit of respawn 

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:16.330
 there, however, as I have told you, I am going to 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.979
 start making the series of guides 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.989
 respawn and as I said you are going to 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.089
 consist of private items as in 

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:26.289
 the modern warfare 3 in which good in 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:27.399
 the ones that I'm going to show you where 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.989
 I move and just start the 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:31.479
 domain items is because 

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:32.889
 routes as I said before going what is the 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.869
 probability that I 'm taking you for 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.729
 there etcetera not because since you always 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:39.849
 I say it 's a way of playing where 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.740
 apart from the ability other than well of 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.179
 the aim that you have the callus that 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.949
 you have in the game counts a lot 

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:47.080
 intelligence and injustice resides in 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.879
 know the responsible how to move and 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.369
 know where the enemy is coming from and 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.019
 that's like more than 50% of the 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:55.779
 games know when the enemy has sold 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.729
 because much more advantage than reaching a 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:59.110
 friend in front that you catch the one of 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.209
 backs do not catch them in the back 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.649
 he knew much more important so good 

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:04.360
 that is the big difference that marks the 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:06.309
 with the people in charge where they are born in 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.709
 all your enemies and what you 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:09.939
 is going to lead to big games and 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.369
 good is going to be going to consist 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:15.039
 simply in that the series not without more to 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:15.729
 learn where depends where you are 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.259
 placed 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.089
 and your partners depend on 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.680
 flags that you have will do in about 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.939
 then another site will go analyzing 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.449
 each map as I said in batches 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:25.789
 private 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.740
 I keep teaching because I join 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.360
 like russia that 's fine then one thing 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.059
 who is interested that he was very interested 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.460
 where to go for the response 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:36.409
 without danger to change the stomata and a 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.939
 domain that in low confirmed because in 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:41.300
 Low confirmed to the response 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:42.680
 they are quite more changing because of the theme 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.050
 that there is no specific objective and 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.219
 remaining depend on where your 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.900
 companions as I said and where are you 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:49.939
 you always to be born in the zones 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.389
 free of the map on this boat 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:55.129
 this case at the tip and at the stern 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.360
 of the boat and then if they are both 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:58.039
 covered as I said national in the 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.449
 sideways so good as I've seen a 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.240
 little I was at the beginning there were many 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.110
 enemies and they end up killing me but good 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.939
 47 one at the end I hope you liked it 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.379

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:07.339
