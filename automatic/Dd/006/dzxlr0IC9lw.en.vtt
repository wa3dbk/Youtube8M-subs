00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the drills back that is consistent never

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.760 
the drills back that is consistent never
had<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> problem<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.840> them<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
labor do is doing more than clean up

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.610 
labor do is doing more than clean up
more<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> breaking<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.050> concrete<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
more of the breaking the concrete and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.870 
more of the breaking the concrete and
stuff<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.130> that's<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> did<00:02:14.760> I

tool right now I'm out shooting a video
with<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.650> i-th<00:02:25.920> 182<00:02:26.580> yeah<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.270> kind

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
with the i-th 182 yeah and this is kind

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.150 
with the i-th 182 yeah and this is kind
of<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.569> same<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:28.290> right<00:02:28.500> except<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.069> you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
of the same thing right except that you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.830 
of the same thing right except that you
can<00:02:29.280> put<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.550> actual<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.150> like<00:02:30.360> driver

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
can put it in actual it's like driver

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.420 
can put it in actual it's like driver
all<00:02:31.080> right<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.740> basically<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.250> exact

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
all right this is basically the exact

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.580 
all right this is basically the exact
same<00:02:32.459> thing<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> i-th<00:02:33.569> 22<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.380> might

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
same thing is the i-th 22 this might

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.370 
same thing is the i-th 22 this might
have<00:02:34.800> more<00:02:35.010> torque<00:02:35.280> though<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:36.030> might<00:02:36.420> except

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
have more torque though it might except

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.589 
have more torque though it might except
we<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.799> play<00:02:37.920> DOD<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> same<00:02:38.640> motor<00:02:38.939> well
