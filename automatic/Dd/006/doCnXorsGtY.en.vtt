00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
think that stuff you know when I was a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
think that stuff you know when I was a
kid<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.140> didn't<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.790> seems<00:02:06.060> like

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
kid we didn't have it and it seems like

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.119 
kid we didn't have it and it seems like
we<00:02:06.390> had<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:06.810> fun<00:02:07.200> than<00:02:07.469> kids<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.920> today

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
we had a lot more fun than kids do today

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.140 
we had a lot more fun than kids do today
but<00:02:08.849> maybe<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.390> my<00:02:09.860> perception

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
but maybe that's just my perception

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.700

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
little bit about and probably which is

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.640 
little bit about and probably which is
going<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:33.910> be<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.630> hardest<00:05:34.660> one<00:05:35.170> to<00:05:35.200> find<00:05:35.470> if

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650
