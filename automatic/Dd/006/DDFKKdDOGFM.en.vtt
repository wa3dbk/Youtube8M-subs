00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:36.289 

and<00:01:31.969> back<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.219> it's<00:01:35.219> sometimes<00:01:35.609> called<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.060> bar

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and back and it's sometimes called a bar

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
and back and it's sometimes called a bar
increase<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.469> increase<00:01:37.979> actually

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
increase because the increase actually

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.319 
increase because the increase actually
leaves<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.450> little<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:40.369> little<00:01:41.369> bar<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.759> there

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
leaves a little a little bar right there

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.050 
leaves a little a little bar right there
so<00:01:43.109> it's<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.469> an<00:01:43.770> invisible<00:01:44.369> increase<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
so it's not an invisible increase but

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.339 
so it's not an invisible increase but
it's<00:01:45.209> a<00:01:45.270> pretty<00:01:45.479> easy<00:01:45.719> increase<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:48.349> and

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
it's a pretty easy increase to do and

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.559 
it's a pretty easy increase to do and
it's<00:01:49.530> often<00:01:49.890> abbreviated<00:01:50.609> in<00:01:50.849> your<00:01:51.000> pattern

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
it's often abbreviated in your pattern
