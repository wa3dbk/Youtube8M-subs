???: Due to budget constraints,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.720
we have developed a slightly less ambitious but equally challenging competition.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.400

Tovar: Yikes! That's to hard.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.260

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.720
Dr.Chalmers: Huh, I'm offended,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.360

Dr.Chalmers: Why don't we just cook the damn sandwiches?

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.020
Catherine: By the way, I'm going to have to skip the eating part of the competition.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.660
Too many carbs.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:14.520

Griggs: Wha- Huh?!

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.220
Griggs: Not you, why don't you leave me alone?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.540

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.400
Griggs: All right, just this once,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.800

Can't barely hear myself think.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.200
Griggs: What do you mean there's not much to hear?

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.380
Griggs: Oh yeah that's funny!

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.340
(Laughter)

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.380
Griggs: Hey, wait a minute,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.440
stupid leprechaun.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.140
Sam: Well, this was a complete disaster.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.440
???:Team Number 1, how did you do?

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.260
Sam: Not so great,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.260
we had a little accident during the cooking portion of the event.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.560
Tovar: Tovar make crunching sound,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.960
when moving body, (unintelligible gibber).

Wade: I need lotion, lot's of lotion!

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.500
Sam: But we did eat all of the other team's sandwiches.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.600
???: Team Number 2, explain.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.360
Dr.Chalmers: I'm allergic to cheese,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.980
when I eat cheese like when I get backed up something awful.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.040
Catherine: Those sandwiches just weren't on my diet.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.780
Dutchmiller: Cheessee, woof.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.240
How about an alternative?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.240
hmm, I'm thinking soy kerns. Delish!

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.880
???: So both teams have failed the competition?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.880
Typical.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.480
Wade: Dude, next time we should try something easier, like Baked Alaska, man.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.520
Catherine: How exactly is that easier?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.840
Wade: If it's baked,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.360
I'm all for it man.
