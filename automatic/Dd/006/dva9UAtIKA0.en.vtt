00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:11.850
 The reason why the Tokyo marathon was held 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.850
 It started in 2007 of the Tokyo marathon and has been held twice so far 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.790
 Also 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:24.279
 I honestly I Tokyo Marathon Kedomo I opened it three times that 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:29.110
 Well there was a champion when Governor Ishihara talked about going 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.070
 Of course I want to say that it's exciting now , but before I do it 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.340
 Cormorants and Need 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.380
 I like such a main road use main road 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:45.310
 Toka also to stop such time what or 6 hours 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:48.070
 It is necessary not to dispel various things in the opposite way, but there is also a trap like in the Tokyo marathon or the like 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.130
 I met that I'm going to do this 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.180
 If what you do is was I a little absolutely Tokyo 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.890
 Hey hey you have to open that marathon 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.840
 I mean I'm talking about now I think we had a reason 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.740
 First of all, I have to say that I had to do something about the Tokyo marathon course 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.000
 I want you to aim at everyone 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.020
 2Rose Village Competition is Berlin and London is a marathon competition 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.290
 Straight course 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 'M often whether a circuit course I think it's so 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:28.350
 A linear enzyme is a type and a cheap circuit course is easy to see in a variety of places. 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.990
 Once Ishihara I I've been following the course has changed in Ichijoin I Tokyo Marathon in Tokyo 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.590
 I'm saying in the name that I want you to see various places of 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 But 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.950
 Hey certain Toka on One will run first 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:48.830
 Since Murakami it's shaped like a cross 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:55.160
 It is a course that is crawling while saying that I want you to look around various business cards 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:58.450
 It invited the crowd Toka congestion also here from 9 intentionally come just for Tteyuu middle many times 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.100
 I always made a sound course that does not think only say kana not you 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.439
 I would have configured this cross- shaped by sound 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.340
 In fact, selfish story This is what is not it there is a reason that must be opened this marathon consideration 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:15.680
 Though 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.680
 Pizza marathon participants are more than various schools 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.880
 People of the day called Broad can participate, but there are men and women full marathon of course, but half 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.990
 After that there marathon 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.760
 Tteyuu Toka people with disabilities can participate in wheelchair 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.280
 Cosplay also rare different do the various people I should'm stem there is it that can participate at 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.430
 It Kedomo that to the people all of us 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.450
 ic chip and ic chip yes 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.290
 Well Kedomo I have been told since you can see by the time if Ko' 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.630
 It is said that they understand what movement they are 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.990
 When considering this that little it all 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.410
 Are you trying to make a pupil in the middle bother 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.590
 Running a wide variety of people 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.650
 You can check the limit by checking the movement of the ic chip 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.060
 Actually, the place where you are making this middle person crowd is 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:13.930
 It is Japanese central Kasumigaseki 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:16.569
 Such a thing of Tteyuu reason for the is actually when the Tokyo Metropolitan Government of emergency this around the Kasumigaseki 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:23.230
 Human being 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:28.620
 When you move a lot , what kind of band situation and what kind of action you take 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.140
 You do wonder that the data sample has been told if I do not want to just people 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.740
 I need a sample 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.730
 What happens if a lot of people move the important part of Japan, Kasumigaseki there 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.940
 right 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.460
 What will usually happen? What is the road vibration? 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.960
 How easy it is to move in a way that all the people after 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:55.880
 That's why actually a Nee that drove a lot of people who 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:04:01.560
 The Tonankai just after the first sound was opened 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:05.680
 I have been published that disaster road simulation Neun 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:10.870
 Well say in case of emergency please be released like this 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.310
 Cracking as so was the so-called simulation So what that marathon 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.299
 Say it was necessary to 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:21.370
 It's a rumor here but I drank it 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:25.000
 It is said that the second trial to Tokyo that is also said to come around 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.280
 It is said that this is still close 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.980
 Surely such before the earthquake come 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.980
 Say Tokyo Toka or not you wanted to leave the simulation
