00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it and see it should be about halfway

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.370 
it and see it should be about halfway
through<00:01:32.180> should<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.360> turned<00:01:33.659> color<00:01:33.990> look

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
through should have turned color look

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
through should have turned color look
more<00:01:34.680> cooked<00:01:35.009> looking<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> make

sure that you're using a very thin

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.520 
sure that you're using a very thin
spatula<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.689> want<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.320> wide

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
spatula you don't want to have a wide

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.859 
spatula you don't want to have a wide

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
spatula making it more possible that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
spatula making it more possible that
you're<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> tear<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:43.740> fish<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
other thing is give it a little test

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.380 
other thing is give it a little test
like<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.530> hot<00:01:50.280> clean<00:01:51.090> oil

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
like that if you have hot clean oil

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.160 
like that if you have hot clean oil
grids<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.340> did<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> does<00:01:54.600> what

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
grids and it just did and it does what

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
grids and it just did and it does what
it<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.409> did<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> me<00:01:55.829> where<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.399> sort<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it just did to me where it just sort of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.370 
it just did to me where it just sort of
it<00:01:57.180> doesn't<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> come<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.110> it's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
it doesn't really want to come up it's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.060 
it doesn't really want to come up it's
not<00:01:58.560> ready<00:01:58.799> yet

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
not ready yet

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
not ready yet
let<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.640> cook<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.909> little<00:02:00.030> bit<00:02:00.119> longer<00:02:00.210> it'll

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
let it cook a little bit longer it'll

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.810 
let it cook a little bit longer it'll
caramelize<00:02:01.290> under<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.280> release<00:02:02.670> from

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
caramelize under there and release from

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.370 
caramelize under there and release from
the<00:02:02.939> grids<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> would<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.719> easier<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the grids and then it would be easier to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.180 
the grids and then it would be easier to
turn<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:06.240> we'll<00:02:06.719> check<00:02:06.930> them<00:02:07.049> again<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.590> see

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
turn now we'll check them again you see

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.609 
turn now we'll check them again you see
how<00:02:08.450> they're<00:02:09.450> releasing<00:02:09.810> fairly<00:02:10.379> easily

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
how they're releasing fairly easily

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:20.710 
how they're releasing fairly easily
they're<00:02:11.610> ready<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> be<00:02:12.030> turned

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.030
