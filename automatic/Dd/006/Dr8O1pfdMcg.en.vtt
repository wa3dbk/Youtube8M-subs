much<00:01:07.030> better<00:01:07.330> than<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:08.500> bronze<00:01:09.010> one<00:01:10.140> we're

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140

second<00:01:37.270> attack<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.869> then<00:01:38.020> we're<00:01:38.740> going<00:01:39.070> to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
second attack and then we're going to

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.410 
second attack and then we're going to
swap<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:40.690> new<00:01:40.960> battle<00:01:41.580> where<00:01:42.580> we<00:01:42.790> can<00:01:43.060> see

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
swap to a new battle where we can see

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:53.249

her<00:01:43.600> final<00:01:43.960> attack<00:01:50.850> okay<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:51.910> I'll<00:01:52.090> just<00:01:52.259> swap

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
her final attack okay so I'll just swap

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.200 
her final attack okay so I'll just swap
out<00:01:53.470> here<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.860> then<00:01:53.950> uses<00:01:54.340> her<00:01:54.550> second<00:01:54.910> attack

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.010 
out here and then uses her second attack
which<00:01:58.530> okay<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.910> was<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.030> part<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.600> was

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
which okay so that was the part that was

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.480 
which okay so that was the part that was
the<00:02:02.080> first<00:02:02.319> time<00:02:02.470> I've<00:02:02.619> thrown<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:03.009> dynamite

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the first time I've thrown that dynamite

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.120 
the first time I've thrown that dynamite
usually<00:02:04.360> if<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.840> row<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.410> your<00:02:05.679> card

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
usually if you get a row that your card

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.110 
usually if you get a row that your card
they<00:02:06.280> do<00:02:06.429> something<00:02:06.670> very<00:02:07.210> different<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
they do something very different so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.900 
they do something very different so
let's<00:02:13.660> look<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.200> more<00:02:14.530> difficult<00:02:14.860> team<00:02:15.400> so

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
let's look for a more difficult team so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.600 
let's look for a more difficult team so
the<00:02:16.900> other<00:02:17.410> parties<00:02:17.860> doesn't<00:02:18.220> die<00:02:18.370> that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the other parties doesn't die that

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:42.780 
the other parties doesn't die that
quickly

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.420
