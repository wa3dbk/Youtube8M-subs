lot of money for the players because it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.270 
lot of money for the players because it
no<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.870> every<00:00:40.230> size<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.710> nobody

does have them call Susan its booth on

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.319 
does have them call Susan its booth on
the<00:00:48.750> goalkeeper<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> might<00:00:50.969> go<00:00:51.149> after

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the goalkeeper I think we might go after

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
the goalkeeper I think we might go after
a<00:00:51.570> goalkeeper<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.440> he<00:00:52.559> would<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.770> very

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
a goalkeeper I think he would be very

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340 
a goalkeeper I think he would be very
expensive<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:54.090> thinking<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.780> our<00:00:55.110> wave

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
expensive I thinking what our wave

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.319 
expensive I thinking what our wave
structure<00:00:55.739> would<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> little

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
structure would have to go up a little

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.979 
structure would have to go up a little
with<00:00:57.600> him<00:00:57.899> he's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> fantastic<00:00:58.500> goalkeeper<00:00:59.070> but

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
with him he's a fantastic goalkeeper but

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
with him he's a fantastic goalkeeper but
I<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> wait<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.609> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
I think we just have to wait to see on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:15.260 
I think we just have to wait to see on
that<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:12.110> think<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.640> he's<00:01:14.640> definitely<00:01:14.850> got

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that one I think you he's definitely got

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
that one I think you he's definitely got
ability<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.869> mean<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.530> he<00:01:16.770> looks<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.070> bit

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
ability I mean in time he looks a bit

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.490 
ability I mean in time he looks a bit
sluggish<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.240> sometimes<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
sluggish and then sometimes you get the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
sluggish and then sometimes you get the
boarding<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.070> right<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.150> think

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
boarding just right the one and I think

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
boarding just right the one and I think
you're<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.290> most<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> players<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you're probably most of the players that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.570 
you're probably most of the players that
have<00:01:23.939> actually<00:01:24.030> come<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.630> awesome<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> set
