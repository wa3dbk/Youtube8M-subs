the potential of this hybrid is a huge

the potential of this hybrid is a huge
one<00:01:52.840> because<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.560> can<00:01:53.799> reduce<00:01:54.520> fuel

by forty five percent and odd again

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.719

because<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.990> seems<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.710> be<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.159> much<00:02:06.340> lighter

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
because it seems to be so much lighter

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.650

somewhere down the road replace all the
battery<00:02:15.910> hybrids<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.750> think<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:18.700> hybrid<00:02:19.450> will

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
battery hybrids I think this hybrid will

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.990 
battery hybrids I think this hybrid will
not<00:02:19.959> replace<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.650> battery<00:02:20.950> hybrid<00:02:21.610> because

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
not replace the battery hybrid because

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.680 
not replace the battery hybrid because
the<00:02:22.209> battery<00:02:22.510> hybrids<00:02:22.930> will<00:02:23.230> be<00:02:23.709> one<00:02:24.670> step<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the battery hybrids will be one step to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.340 
the battery hybrids will be one step to
electrification<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.550> car<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.350> battery

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
electrification of the car so battery

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.070 
electrification of the car so battery
hybrids<00:02:29.769> will<00:02:30.010> be<00:02:30.220> an<00:02:30.430> intermediate<00:02:31.300> step<00:02:31.480> to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
hybrids will be an intermediate step to

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.670 
functional we've improved in fact the
functionality<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:30.050> there's<00:04:30.500> more

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
functionality of it so there's more

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.530 
functionality of it so there's more
interior<00:04:30.890> room<00:04:31.190> on<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.430> inside<00:04:31.550> for<00:04:32.210> both<00:04:32.360> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
interior room on the inside for both the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.870 
interior room on the inside for both the
front<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.050> rear<00:04:33.169> passengers<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.250> also

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
front and the rear passengers and also

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.970 
front and the rear passengers and also
the<00:04:35.060> opening<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.990> trunk<00:04:36.200> opening<00:04:36.620> from<00:04:36.860> the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
the opening the trunk opening from the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.560 
the opening the trunk opening from the
coop<00:04:37.190> is<00:04:37.370> actually<00:04:37.669> two<00:04:37.880> half<00:04:38.090> inches<00:04:38.330> wider

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
coop is actually two half inches wider

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.900 
coop is actually two half inches wider
so<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.260> makes<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.590> much<00:04:39.740> easier<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.460> be<00:04:40.580> able<00:04:40.669> to

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
so it makes it much easier to be able to

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.640 
so it makes it much easier to be able to
load<00:04:41.120> things<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.630> we've<00:04:41.930> also<00:04:42.110> increased<00:04:42.440> the
