00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
system and what happens is if you have a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.069 
system and what happens is if you have a
gear<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.100> opinion<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:48.540> opinion<00:01:48.570> is

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
gear like I do opinion my opinion is

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
gear like I do opinion my opinion is
2060<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.030> there

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
2060 right in there

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.620 
2060 right in there
it's<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.960> 2060<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.790> mean<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.180> quite<00:01:54.360> high

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it's a 2060 so I mean it's quite high

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.380 
it's a 2060 so I mean it's quite high
and<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.710> happens<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.280> your<00:01:56.520> motor<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:57.180> go

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and what happens is your motor will go

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.560 
and what happens is your motor will go
over<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> hundred<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.560> sixty<00:01:58.950> degrees

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
over a hundred and sixty degrees

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
over a hundred and sixty degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:01.530> heat<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.790> will<00:02:03.030> cause

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
Fahrenheit of heat and that will cause

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.200 
Fahrenheit of heat and that will cause
the<00:02:03.540> magnets<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.380> dibond<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the magnets to dibond that's that's the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
the magnets to dibond that's that's the
sad<00:02:06.420> part<00:02:06.450> about<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.459> motor

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
sad part about it and then your motor

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.979 
sad part about it and then your motor
will<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.899> mean<00:02:10.530> mine<00:02:10.890> keeps<00:02:11.610> running<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.870> it

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
will I mean mine keeps running but it

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
will I mean mine keeps running but it
makes

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
makes

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.750 
makes
loud<00:02:14.070> whistle<00:02:14.820> noise<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.310> very<00:02:17.580> weak

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
loud whistle noise and it is very weak

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.320 
loud whistle noise and it is very weak
if<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.570> were<00:02:18.750> barely<00:02:19.020> move<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.850> will<00:02:21.090> show

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330

you what I'm talking about let me just

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.380 
you what I'm talking about let me just
turn<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.620> speed<00:02:25.620> controller<00:02:26.120> my<00:02:27.120> switch

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
turn on the speed controller my switch

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.160 
turn on the speed controller my switch
is<00:02:27.540> loose<00:02:27.780> wish<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.410> was<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.980> assembling<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
is loose wish I was on assembling it and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.680 
is loose wish I was on assembling it and
but<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.200> had<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.890> mounted<00:02:32.100> right<00:02:33.000> there<00:02:33.300> my

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
but I had it mounted right there my

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.260 
but I had it mounted right there my
switch<00:02:33.960> okay<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> turn<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.550> speed

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
switch okay so I turn on the speed

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.210 
switch okay so I turn on the speed
controller<00:02:38.180> now<00:02:39.230> I'm<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> turn<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.860> my

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.310 

transmitter<00:02:44.960> put<00:02:45.960> in<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.110> floor<00:02:46.490> okay<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
transmitter put in the floor okay so you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.840 
transmitter put in the floor okay so you
can<00:02:49.470> see<00:02:49.590> everything<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.340> all<00:02:50.610> good<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.940> go<00:02:52.850> but

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
can see everything is all good to go but

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.350 
can see everything is all good to go but
when<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> hit<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.560> throttle<00:02:55.800> range<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:57.150> heard

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
when I hit the throttle range you heard

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.910 
when I hit the throttle range you heard
that<00:02:57.390> whistle<00:02:57.750> noise<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.260> mean<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> will<00:02:58.680> keep

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
that whistle noise I mean it will keep

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.940 
that whistle noise I mean it will keep
moving<00:02:59.100> but<00:03:00.030> not<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.300> same<00:03:00.510> as<00:03:00.660> before<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.590> if

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
moving but not the same as before and if

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.270 
moving but not the same as before and if
I<00:03:02.130> put<00:03:02.640> my<00:03:02.670> foot<00:03:03.060> on<00:03:03.090> there<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.660> then<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.680> hit

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
I put my foot on there and then I hit

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.960 
I put my foot on there and then I hit
the<00:03:05.370> truck<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.930> can<00:03:07.140> hear<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> okay<00:03:08.100> let<00:03:08.700> me<00:03:08.820> go

the truck you can hear it okay let me go

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.750 
the truck you can hear it okay let me go
and<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.300> not<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.600> gear<00:03:09.980> at<00:03:10.980> first<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.550> thought

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
and it's not the gear at first I thought

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.260 
and it's not the gear at first I thought
it<00:03:11.820> was<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> gear<00:03:12.860> but<00:03:13.860> it's<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> gear<00:03:17.270> as

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
it was the gear but it's not the gear as

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.940 
it was the gear but it's not the gear as
you<00:03:18.330> saw<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.690> gears<00:03:19.050> are<00:03:19.200> not<00:03:19.230> even<00:03:19.680> moving

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
you saw the gears are not even moving

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:29.410 
you saw the gears are not even moving
right<00:03:20.340> there<00:03:20.580> let<00:03:21.270> me<00:03:21.360> show<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.600> again

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.660 

alright<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.720> noisy<00:03:31.260> here<00:03:31.560> comes<00:03:32.340> from<00:03:32.550> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
alright that noisy here comes from the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
alright that noisy here comes from the
motor<00:03:32.850> okay<00:03:33.420> is<00:03:33.570> not<00:03:33.780> your<00:03:33.990> gears<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.770> not

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
motor okay is not your gears is not

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.020 
motor okay is not your gears is not
anything<00:03:36.690> else<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.590> actually<00:03:37.950> your<00:03:38.430> motor<00:03:38.670> and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
anything else is actually your motor and

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.670 
anything else is actually your motor and
as<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.300> matter<00:03:39.540> fraction<00:03:40.200> when<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.350> turn<00:03:40.590> off<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
as a matter fraction when I turn off the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.980 
as a matter fraction when I turn off the
the<00:03:43.680> transmitter<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.420> motor<00:03:45.870> just

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
the transmitter and the motor just

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.410 
the transmitter and the motor just
starts<00:03:46.950> vibrating<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.730> way<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.209> saw

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
starts vibrating the way you just saw

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.080 
starts vibrating the way you just saw
see<00:03:49.110> let<00:03:49.350> me<00:03:49.380> turn<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.650> off<00:03:49.920> I'm<00:03:50.670> going<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> show

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
see let me turn it off I'm going to show

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.920 
see let me turn it off I'm going to show
you<00:03:51.260> okay<00:03:52.290> I'm<00:03:52.920> going<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.190> turn<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.459> off<00:03:53.930> and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
we'll get your house start racing by

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.730 
we'll get your house start racing by
turn<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.460> back<00:03:59.610> on<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.540> stops<00:04:00.780> okay<00:04:01.530> that

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
turn it back on and it stops okay that

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.160 
turn it back on and it stops okay that
means<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.280> am<00:04:03.240> pretty<00:04:03.510> sure<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:03.780> not<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
means I am pretty sure it's not the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.670 
means I am pretty sure it's not the
speed<00:04:04.380> controller<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:05.160> am<00:04:06.000> quite<00:04:06.630> confident<00:04:07.410> is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
speed controller I am quite confident is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.940 
speed controller I am quite confident is
the<00:04:07.740> motor<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.120> motors<00:04:09.480> no<00:04:09.750> good<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.740> guys

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
the motor if the motors no good the guys

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.090 
the motor if the motors no good the guys
I<00:04:11.340> mean<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.670> one<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.300> got<00:04:12.540> was<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
I mean the one that I got was the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.850 
I mean the one that I got was the
brushless<00:04:14.510> leopard<00:04:15.620> leopard<00:04:16.620> brushless

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
brushless leopard leopard brushless

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.340 
brushless leopard leopard brushless
motor<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.140> 3300<00:04:19.140> KB<00:04:20.840> but<00:04:21.840> again<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.110> mean

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
motor this is a 3300 KB but again I mean

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.190 
motor this is a 3300 KB but again I mean
this<00:04:22.530> little<00:04:22.890> motors<00:04:23.340> they<00:04:24.350> happen<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.380> be

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
this little motors they happen to be

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.510 
this little motors they happen to be
cheap<00:04:28.200> quality<00:04:28.460> okay<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:30.240> already<00:04:30.900> bought<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
cheap quality okay so I already bought a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.100 
cheap quality okay so I already bought a
tack<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:33.350> 4300<00:04:34.350> kb<00:04:34.800> motor<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.970> I'll<00:04:36.390> be<00:04:36.660> putting

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
tack on 4300 kb motor so I'll be putting

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.280 
tack on 4300 kb motor so I'll be putting
that<00:04:37.290> on<00:04:38.090> once<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.240> get<00:04:39.420> it<00:04:39.570> okay<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.020> should

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
that on once I get it okay I should

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.130 
that on once I get it okay I should
should<00:04:40.770> be<00:04:40.800> getting<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.280> soon<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:42.330> once<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:42.720> do<00:04:42.780> I

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
should be getting it soon so once I do I

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.290 
should be getting it soon so once I do I
will<00:04:43.620> install<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.610> let<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.910> guys<00:04:45.060> know

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
will install it and let you guys know

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.530 
will install it and let you guys know
how<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.540> does<00:04:45.750> okay<00:04:46.410> but<00:04:46.620> so<00:04:46.770> far<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.310> got<00:04:47.910> no

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
how it does okay but so far I got no

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.080 
how it does okay but so far I got no
other<00:04:48.750> option<00:04:49.230> for<00:04:49.260> keeping<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.100> speed

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
other option for keeping the speed

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.180 
other option for keeping the speed
controller<00:04:51.540> and<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.470> programming<00:04:52.890> car

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
controller and the programming car

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.580 
controller and the programming car
because<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.670> motor<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:54.270> basically<00:04:55.080> garbage

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
because the motor is basically garbage

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.010 
because the motor is basically garbage
the<00:04:56.010> motor<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.610> mean<00:04:57.270> it's<00:04:57.420> just<00:04:57.540> too<00:04:57.870> much<00:04:57.960> work

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
the motor I mean it's just too much work

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.380 
the motor I mean it's just too much work
to<00:04:58.530> fix<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:59.040> it's<00:04:59.250> not<00:04:59.430> really<00:04:59.670> worth<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.210> I

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
to fix it it's not really worth it I

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.900 
to fix it it's not really worth it I
mean<00:05:01.170> not<00:05:01.350> not<00:05:01.680> that's<00:05:02.220> just<00:05:02.580> my<00:05:03.330> opinion<00:05:04.910> but

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
mean not not that's just my opinion but

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.240 
mean not not that's just my opinion but
again<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.210> mean<00:05:06.360> other<00:05:06.840> than<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.530> RC<00:05:08.040> bug

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
again I mean other than that the RC bug

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.590 
again I mean other than that the RC bug
itself<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:10.550> good<00:05:11.550> quality<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:12.180> know<00:05:12.480> I've

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600
