on my hand if i try to remember him in

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.440 
on my hand if i try to remember him in
my<00:03:57.040> head<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:57.490> doesn't<00:03:57.790> seem<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.090> work<00:03:58.180> so

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
my head that doesn't seem to work so

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.990 
my head that doesn't seem to work so
well<00:03:58.800> i'm<00:03:59.800> not<00:03:59.950> going<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.190> call<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:00.490> perfect

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
well i'm not going to call that perfect

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.400 
well i'm not going to call that perfect
but<00:04:01.270> close<00:04:01.510> enough<00:04:06.870> okay<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.020> piece<00:04:08.200> of

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
but close enough okay the piece of

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.720 
but close enough okay the piece of
paneling<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.950> was<00:04:09.070> up<00:04:09.220> here<00:04:09.460> wasn't

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
paneling that was up here wasn't

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.430 
paneling that was up here wasn't
salvageable<00:04:10.390> because<00:04:10.750> all<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.020> holes<00:04:11.230> were

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
salvageable because all the holes were

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.500 
salvageable because all the holes were
in<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.710> wrong<00:04:11.830> spot<00:04:12.250> because<00:04:13.030> they<00:04:13.150> moved<00:04:13.330> to

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
in the wrong spot because they moved to

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.870 
in the wrong spot because they moved to
switch<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.110> moved<00:04:14.260> an<00:04:14.410> outlet<00:04:14.770> so<00:04:15.640> we<00:04:15.730> went

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
switch and moved an outlet so we went

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.080 
switch and moved an outlet so we went
ahead<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.239> got<00:04:16.360> a<00:04:16.420> piece<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:16.750> new<00:04:17.440> paneling<00:04:18.090> of

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
ahead and got a piece of new paneling of

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.640 
ahead and got a piece of new paneling of
course<00:04:19.360> obviously<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.080> color<00:04:20.290> is<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> lot

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
course obviously the color is a lot

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.810 
course obviously the color is a lot
different<00:04:20.830> that's<00:04:21.250> not<00:04:21.370> going<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.670> matter

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
different that's not going to matter

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.760 
different that's not going to matter
here<00:04:22.180> in<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.330> little<00:04:22.450> while<00:04:22.720> what<00:04:23.260> does<00:04:23.470> matter

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
here in a little while what does matter

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.810 
here in a little while what does matter
is<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.180> pattern<00:04:25.420> is<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.720> same<00:04:26.820> we

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
is that the pattern is the same we

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.040 
is that the pattern is the same we
wanted<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.180> drywall<00:04:28.510> this<00:04:28.900> room<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:30.550> due<00:04:30.760> to

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
wanted to drywall this room but due to

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.170 
wanted to drywall this room but due to
time<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.410> money<00:04:33.190> constraints<00:04:33.580> we're<00:04:34.000> not

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
time and money constraints we're not

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.220 
time and money constraints we're not
we're<00:04:34.390> just<00:04:34.540> going<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.720> paint<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> paneling

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
we're just going to paint the paneling

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.650 
we're just going to paint the paneling
for<00:04:35.680> now<00:04:38.670> maybe<00:04:39.670> sometime<00:04:40.270> in<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.480> future

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
for now maybe sometime in the future

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.380 
for now maybe sometime in the future
will<00:04:41.050> grow<00:04:41.260> all<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:42.030> maybe<00:04:43.030> not

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.050 

okay<00:04:47.470> that's<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.710> new<00:04:48.920> paneling<00:04:49.460> put<00:04:49.640> up<00:04:49.790> over

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
of looking like a five-year plan so if

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.390 
of looking like a five-year plan so if
if<00:05:33.080> we're<00:05:33.290> still<00:05:33.470> here<00:05:33.530> in<00:05:33.740> five<00:05:33.980> years<00:05:34.250> we'll

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
if we're still here in five years we'll

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.760 
if we're still here in five years we'll
reevaluate
