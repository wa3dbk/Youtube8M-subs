arrows you click on to get more and more

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.170 
arrows you click on to get more and more
stuff<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:12.060> we'll<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.480> back<00:02:12.510> here

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
stuff so we'll go back here

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.929 
stuff so we'll go back here
and<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:14.260> reason<00:02:14.590> why<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:15.189> makes<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> little

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
and the reason why like makes a little

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.179 
and the reason why like makes a little
circle<00:02:16.239> blue<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:17.230> because<00:02:18.040> you're

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
circle blue like that is because you're

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.610 
circle blue like that is because you're
like<00:02:18.310> highlighting<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.150> basically<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.930> then

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
like highlighting it basically and then

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.860 
like highlighting it basically and then
to<00:02:20.769> get<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.099> files<00:02:21.610> from<00:02:21.909> this<00:02:22.180> side<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.720> this

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
to get the files from this side to this

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.140 
to get the files from this side to this
side<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.620> view<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:24.159> code<00:02:24.370> itself<00:02:24.849> as

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
side so you can view the code itself as

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.750 
side so you can view the code itself as
an<00:02:25.780> HTML<00:02:26.379> editor<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.549> highlight
