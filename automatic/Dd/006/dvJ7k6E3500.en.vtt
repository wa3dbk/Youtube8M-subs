it's<00:00:29.610> like<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.910> nut<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.989> we<00:00:31.079> clobber<00:00:31.410> all

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
it's like on the nut then we clobber all

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's like on the nut then we clobber all
out<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:31.710> our<00:00:31.829> hammer<00:00:32.070> shops<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
out of our hammer shops at it

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
out of our hammer shops at it
or<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> special<00:00:34.590> fork<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.160> listen

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
or you can get a special fork to listen

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.979 
or you can get a special fork to listen
there<00:00:35.670> which<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.329> okay<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:36.809> replacing

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
there which is okay if you're replacing

there which is okay if you're replacing
this<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.829> you'll<00:00:38.129> cut<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> rubber

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this because you'll cut the rubber

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.959 
this because you'll cut the rubber
nearly<00:00:39.059> every<00:00:39.449> time<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.550> want<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
nearly every time but if you want it to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
nearly every time but if you want it to
be<00:00:42.120> used<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> track<00:00:42.629> again<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> keep

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
be used to track again if you keep

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.810 
be used to track again if you keep
hitting<00:00:43.800> their<00:00:44.010> our<00:00:44.190> hammer<00:00:44.399> eventually

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
hitting their our hammer eventually

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
hitting their our hammer eventually
it'll<00:00:44.910> pop<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.929> you<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.170> damage<00:00:46.379> your

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it'll pop and you don't damage your

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.329 
it'll pop and you don't damage your
rubber<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.510> right<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.890> count<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
rubber then right you can count the

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.979 
rubber then right you can count the
number<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.609> turns<00:00:50.879> once<00:00:51.239> you've<00:00:51.420> slack<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
number of turns once you've slack in the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
number of turns once you've slack in the
lock<00:00:52.140> nut<00:00:52.379> off<00:00:52.589> you<00:00:52.769> can<00:00:52.920> unscrew<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> tackled

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
lock nut off you can unscrew the tackled

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.579 
lock nut off you can unscrew the tackled
and<00:00:54.149> off<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.780> count<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> number<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.379> turn

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
and off you count the number of turn

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.259 
and off you count the number of turn

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.670 
the net 104 millimeter on much booty
glance<00:01:06.630> that's<00:01:07.050> what<00:01:07.290> they're<00:01:07.409> meant<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.620> be

glance that's what they're meant to be

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.880 
glance that's what they're meant to be
set<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.280> after<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.300> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
set up it after that you can go to a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.810 
set up it after that you can go to a
reptile<00:01:11.280> tire<00:01:11.700> place<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.330> he<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:13.820> fine-tune

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
reptile tire place and he will fine-tune

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.140 
reptile tire place and he will fine-tune
it<00:01:15.120> till<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> right<00:01:19.130> toe<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.520> Toyota's

it till the right toe in or Toyota's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.970 
it till the right toe in or Toyota's
achieved<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> therefore<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.410> tires<00:01:22.620> don't

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
achieved and therefore your tires don't

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.850 
achieved and therefore your tires don't
get<00:01:23.190> ruined<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:24.300> this<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.290> wasn't<00:01:25.500> sick

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
get ruined because this one wasn't sick

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.670 
get ruined because this one wasn't sick
could<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.190> be<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> last<00:01:26.730> time<00:01:27.860> or<00:01:29.420> whatever

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
could it be the last time or whatever

could it be the last time or whatever
we've<00:01:31.680> been<00:01:31.830> traveling<00:01:32.280> before<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.670> the

we've been traveling before all the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.980 
we've been traveling before all the
pleats<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.330> couldn't<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> area

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pleats in there couldn't be in that area

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
pleats in there couldn't be in that area
the<00:01:34.200> tire<00:01:34.440> it's<00:01:35.340> scuffed<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.210> safe<00:01:36.510> it's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the tire it's scuffed and then safe it's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480 
the tire it's scuffed and then safe it's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
slide it and it should be one hundred

one<00:05:41.169> remember<00:05:41.709> the<00:05:41.800> rubber<00:05:41.979> was<00:05:42.159> split<00:05:42.459> to<00:05:42.490> the

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
one remember the rubber was split to the

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.579 
one remember the rubber was split to the
last<00:05:42.879> Amity<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.869> had<00:05:44.050> only<00:05:44.169> been<00:05:44.349> a<00:05:44.499> few

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589 
last Amity and had only been a few

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.570 
last Amity and had only been a few
months<00:05:44.860> before<00:05:45.159> so<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:46.119> guy<00:05:46.270> glued<00:05:46.599> it<00:05:46.749> and

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
months before so the guy glued it and

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.159 
months before so the guy glued it and
funny<00:05:48.580> enough<00:05:48.849> it's<00:05:49.089> still<00:05:49.180> held<00:05:49.659> actually<00:05:50.139> I

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
funny enough it's still held actually I

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.350 
funny enough it's still held actually I
thought<00:05:50.349> it<00:05:50.439> was<00:05:50.529> a<00:05:50.559> split<00:05:50.889> but<00:05:51.819> I<00:05:52.089> mean<00:05:52.240> it

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
thought it was a split but I mean it

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.989 
thought it was a split but I mean it
feels<00:05:52.539> a<00:05:52.719> bit<00:05:52.749> rough<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.229> says<00:05:53.439> I<00:05:53.789> assume<00:05:54.789> that

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:54.999 
feels a bit rough and says I assume that

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.159 
feels a bit rough and says I assume that
in<00:05:55.149> the<00:05:55.240> time<00:05:55.449> it<00:05:55.629> was<00:05:55.809> but<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.349> dark<00:05:56.559> Pippin

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
in the time it was but the dark Pippin

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.559 
in the time it was but the dark Pippin
probably<00:05:59.169> would<00:05:59.339> take<00:06:00.339> care<00:06:00.490> of<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.699> scrape<00:06:00.969> and

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
probably would take care of a scrape and

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.119 
probably would take care of a scrape and
probably<00:06:01.930> would<00:06:02.020> have<00:06:02.080> done<00:06:02.259> a<00:06:02.529> good<00:06:02.979> quail

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
probably would have done a good quail

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.489 
probably would have done a good quail
