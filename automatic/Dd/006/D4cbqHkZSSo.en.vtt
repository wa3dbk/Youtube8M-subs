 Scream Equity presents 11 of the "Training Day" as an Apple alone 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.230
 create 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:18.169
 Hello and welcome to newly developed markets world calendar 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.840
 today is ready 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.349
 Overkamp where the television is now from what you do 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.140
 and 2 Marcel Merkel what she did exactly what he could 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.569
 This is 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.020
 5 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.180
 insane 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.060
 1 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.080
 Points of contact for packaging are Kiss August 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.220
 v 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.410
 5 percent 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.540
 and see now 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.970
 the Cortado as recently as the Enz and GC continue Meggi Erwig 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.790
 I play very beautiful this plant then sold millions of times 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 the process took care of it 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.330
 Prof 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 4 0 4 percent ago "That will certainly work 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.340
 take care now 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.120
 that is indefinitely PS also with a behavioral therapy I have to 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.120
 me there of course also on a test device 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.370
 Hochhuth 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.350
 but just about the same way as the Department of Foreign Affairs EDA still a solution 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 I'll make it one of his crutches 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 how the end of the war Rome works 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.030
 Madness us right back in July 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 So come back on Boxing Day to call more time with her already in the case 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.000
 the quick test parents finally the valley of the Verdon also often little to that now 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.270
 already a few days St so that's all but a lot already something 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.800
 here 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.010
 and you can see my experiences so really with it 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.730
 tell 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.510
 and about the question of what to do if that was weird, it's way up the line 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.749
 a choleric was in hindsight for me actually the part 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.559
 The iPad will be pretty hard to determine because that's the way it is 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:19.549
 aluminum 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.990
 and then the end of the year is not fixed 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.030
 but as I said I already said that mainly as Freiburg 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.850
 put 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.270
 and in the next Zion a Serb stable 4 hes 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.499
 by Simon Halsey are chandeliers you can make out all the way around here then 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.419
 It is not easy and you already have the iPad here 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.300
 then that comes almost automatically to automatic house 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.580
 and a hairstyle would have varied so many are not now Â»maneuvered 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.400
 he looks like this one 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.999
 and the right side feel like it 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.279
 i am anyway she may need to adjust that and lead 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.769
 he is of course first reset this tribal position 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.030
 You can actually go really far, even a bit 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.679
 that is almost there 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.679
 It is already on the app that succeeds so forward 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.900
 Of course, that's the way to do it, but then you can do all the old stuff 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.329
 still inferior 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.359
 the back and why what the topic setting from the side to groups 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:21.169
 The SAS Dante is made of aluminum and that's what the iPad at the DIW can do 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.579
 Turn axis we see that is there 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.019
 quite free and turn Hassli's direction as you want it to be like that I have never 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.139
 someone 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.259
 therefore, experience FOMC and then you can just do this up 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.419
 rotate 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.829
 I find that a very generale thing, it was also very stable 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.969
 very nice for me 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.559
 Michael Sommer back 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.559
 then you can just go that far up 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.209
 So I think that he can stay together but then both 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.589
 again if you like the tires 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.659
 What are you worried about? 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.319
 around the 700 years so over it goes back again 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.169
 then you can see that here too 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.719
 makes a total of three weeks pretty sturdy a problem in things can do 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.850
 one's appearance here 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.939
 because 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.489
 but that too should 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.129
 fuck boxes 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.820
 thank you very much to fannen de that you me this beautiful gesture 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.290
 Have made available 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.310
 Except this way Alley Schels because of this tour 11 "to many more 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.650
 other chains is the left to the result 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.560
 driving and it in the description and suspected but also to this where 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.970

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.720
