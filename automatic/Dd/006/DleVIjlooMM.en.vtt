you'll<00:00:59.340> need<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.030> make<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> pattern<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you'll need to do is make up a pattern I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
you'll need to do is make up a pattern I
just<00:01:01.710> grabbed<00:01:01.890> an<00:01:02.010> odd<00:01:02.160> sheet<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.520> newspaper

just grabbed an odd sheet of newspaper

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.870 
just grabbed an odd sheet of newspaper
and<00:01:03.270> measured<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.960> 48<00:01:04.589> centimeter<00:01:05.309> square
