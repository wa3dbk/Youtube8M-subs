00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
biggest concern with cooking this was

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.510 
biggest concern with cooking this was
that<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.690> wouldn't<00:04:29.020> have<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.070> kind<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
that it wouldn't have the kind of the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.330 
that it wouldn't have the kind of the
crunch<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.390> texture<00:04:31.810> but<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.800> kangaroo

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
crunch and the texture but the kangaroo

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.200 
crunch and the texture but the kangaroo
is<00:04:33.370> actually<00:04:33.850> quite<00:04:34.120> chewy<00:04:35.430> but<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.700> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
is actually quite chewy but the the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.240 
is actually quite chewy but the the
crispy<00:04:37.630> salami<00:04:37.900> bits<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.590> just<00:04:38.770> giving<00:04:39.100> it

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
crispy salami bits is just giving it

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.620

this really nice crunch when you bite
into<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.140> so<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.560> actually<00:04:41.680> replicates<00:04:42.400> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
into it so it actually replicates the
