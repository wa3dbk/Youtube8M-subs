 Contact

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.310
 me me 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.780
 Fine design 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.950
 La Peter with light shaping that can be output clearly 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.950
 Nobel 1.0 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.990
 Achieves high accuracy even at 25 microns 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.300
 Smooth and precise shaping is possible by stereolithography 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.300
 Create a free-thinking design 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.550
 The maximum output size is the air width 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:59.600
 App at 128 mm height 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:01.180
 A large modeling output is possible which greatly exceeds the existing stereolithography 3d printer 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.340
 Hmm 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:10.090
 Pneumatically When the sensor to monitor the drawdown of the resin tank 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:16.140
 Automatically fill resin from resin bottle 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.140
 There is no need for the user to add resin during output 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.500
 The laser beam operated by the galva meter passes through two mirrors from the lower part of the main body. 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.500
 Irradiation to the resin 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.520
 We model by Tsurusaki method 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.890
 Configuration of Density 25 microns 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.580
 Equipped with an automatic compensation function is the easiest to obtain 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.470
 Stereolithography sla printer 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.470
