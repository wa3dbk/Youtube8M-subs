00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
you have to start pulling apart the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.240 
you have to start pulling apart the
track<00:03:59.140> basically<00:04:02.970> these<00:04:03.970> bits<00:04:04.299> here

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
track basically these bits here

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:15.469 
track basically these bits here
separated<00:04:06.250> three<00:04:06.549> parts<00:04:09.299> like<00:04:10.299> so<00:04:13.920> these<00:04:14.920> bits

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
separated three parts like so these bits

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.319 
separated three parts like so these bits
take<00:04:16.479> these<00:04:16.600> end<00:04:16.750> pieces<00:04:16.989> off<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:18.150> they<00:04:19.150> go

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
take these end pieces off and they go

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.840 
take these end pieces off and they go
together<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:20.769> form<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> top<00:04:21.340> part<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.669> leg

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850

together to form the top part of the leg
they<00:04:22.750> got<00:04:22.930> H<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.380> G<00:04:24.030> yeah<00:04:25.030> HTG<00:04:26.220> these<00:04:27.220> two<00:04:27.460> are

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
they got H and G yeah HTG these two are

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.219 
they got H and G yeah HTG these two are
C<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.510> D<00:04:28.860> they<00:04:29.860> separate<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.340> they<00:04:30.520> become

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
C and D they separate and they become

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.850 
C and D they separate and they become
you<00:04:32.229> know<00:04:32.669> front<00:04:33.669> of<00:04:33.789> the<00:04:33.880> leg<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:35.500> keep<00:04:35.710> them

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
you know front of the leg you keep them

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.560 
you know front of the leg you keep them
together<00:04:36.720> then<00:04:37.720> we<00:04:37.750> do<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.169> got<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.830> same<00:04:39.010> here
