you<00:01:49.920> create<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:51.149> how<00:01:51.450> does<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:52.350> create

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030

scientists<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.149> proven<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.930> matter

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
scientists have proven that all matter

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.170 
scientists have proven that all matter
is<00:01:55.560> made<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.009> molecules<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.880> all

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
is made up of molecules and all

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.719 
is made up of molecules and all
molecules<00:01:57.659> are<00:01:58.079> made<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> atoms<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.369> all

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
molecules are made up of atoms and all

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.420 
molecules are made up of atoms and all
atoms<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.750> made<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> energy<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:02.250> your

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
atoms are made up of energy as your

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.249 
atoms are made up of energy as your
thoughts<00:02:02.670> carry<00:02:03.030> information<00:02:03.270> through<00:02:04.110> your

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
thoughts carry information through your

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.319 
thoughts carry information through your
neural<00:02:04.740> network<00:02:05.189> energy<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.090> produced

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
neural network energy is produced

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.199 
neural network energy is produced
therefore<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> natural<00:02:07.860> conclusion<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
therefore the natural conclusion is that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.330 
therefore the natural conclusion is that
the<00:02:09.509> energy<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.989> your<00:02:10.140> thoughts<00:02:10.440> create<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
the energy of your thoughts create the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.309 
the energy of your thoughts create the
atoms

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
atoms

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.380 
atoms
which<00:02:12.439> create<00:02:12.799> the<00:02:12.950> molecules<00:02:13.489> which<00:02:13.999> create

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
which create the molecules which create

which create the molecules which create
the<00:02:14.540> matter<00:02:14.780> sounds<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.799> little<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.069> Star
