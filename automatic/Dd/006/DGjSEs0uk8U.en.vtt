00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.659
 the scallops brio but also other countries in france news of 105 and 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.820
 sold for 190 kilometers hour this top speed 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.720
 the place very well against the other small European sporting fractions 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.470
 it's a little slower 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.519
 the turbo delta the fight me everywhere golf gti 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.470
 but it's faster than the youngest I was happy but this cortex r3 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.179
 mersen capital 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.570
 back to 205 105 horsepower plates I believe that every day did not shoot everything 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.570
 what we could from the injection engine 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.190
 but at 205 to other assets it is light 250 kilos 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.470
 and weight is as important as power for performance 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.840
 on the kilometer start stopped after thirty-one seconds this is the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.950
 same time as the old golf gti 16 cents 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.420
 I hoped the new Peugeot better but significantly cheaper than the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 good 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.630
 the first thing I noticed technically is the break 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.630
 and it's very important in a sports car 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.620
 and with the seedlings that equipped 205 gti 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.110
 we are very well rated laterally and that's very important if we want 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.460
 grow up sportily 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.140
 the engine if it must be compared to our engine is obviously that of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.090
 the east coast of the country that serves as a reference for all these cars 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.460
 they are comparable but I would say that the new Peugeot is a little bit 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.620
 softer more progressive less violent than golf 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.620
 both a quality and a defect 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.970
 a sports staging of mans regarding the three reports we are 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.090
 son when driving for example very quickly in the mountains 2nd 3rd and 4th test 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 three reports its perfectly staged 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 the 205 in my opinion to pull before the less sure 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.390
 when you get to the wheel without forgetting that it's a traction I 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.640
 speaks of 150 general and the gti is no exception 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.509
 you have to ride in the wet everything that has happened is really very healthy 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.509
 to get to find understeer and again it's incredibly online 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.929
 I think we can say a big congratulations peugeot technicians for the train 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:18.579
 before 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.619
 not you a pleasure I had fun to make her survive she makes cement on 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.689
 control panned in the car 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.790
 to counter-point because the direction in many right trouble as often on 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.599
 the little one he immediately returns to understeer in sum I would say that the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.120
 bigger pic very effective with a lot of motricity a very big 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.899
 maneuverability exceptional leasing thanks to a super favorite
