in<00:00:53.160> front<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.520> me<00:00:53.670> slowed<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
in front of me slowed down and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.600 
in front of me slowed down and
unfortunately<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.070> front<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.460> me

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
unfortunately the one in front of me

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.630 
unfortunately the one in front of me
must<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.059> slowed<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.600> quite<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.899> lot<00:00:58.640> which

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
must have slowed down quite a lot which

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.459 
must have slowed down quite a lot which
then<00:01:00.030> caused<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.660> hit<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> back<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.320> him

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
then caused me to hit the back of him

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.640 
then caused me to hit the back of him
become<00:01:01.920> airborne<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.960> then<00:01:03.960> start<00:01:04.320> cart

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
become airborne and then start cart

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.850 
become airborne and then start cart
wheeling<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> street<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.780> guess<00:01:07.590> it's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
wheeling down the street I guess it's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
wheeling down the street I guess it's
probably<00:01:08.070> about<00:01:08.670> 80<00:01:09.000> miles<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.479> hour<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
probably about 80 miles an hour but it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260 
probably about 80 miles an hour but it's
difficult<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.439> say<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.490> not<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.939> doing<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
difficult to say it's not to be doing a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.399 
difficult to say it's not to be doing a
racing<00:01:12.720> car<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:15.119> probably<00:01:15.409> awake

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
racing car and so I was probably awake

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.859 
racing car and so I was probably awake
my<00:01:17.009> eyes<00:01:17.280> were<00:01:17.520> open<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.970> could<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.299> tarmac

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
my eyes were open I could see tarmac

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
my eyes were open I could see tarmac
close<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.439> head<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.950> my<00:01:20.130> helmet<00:01:20.520> hit<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
close to my head is my helmet hit the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.350 
close to my head is my helmet hit the
side<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.860> again<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.460> continuing
