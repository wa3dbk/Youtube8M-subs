00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550 

this<00:00:00.359> morning<00:00:00.690> we're<00:00:00.810> just<00:00:01.020> kind<00:00:01.260> of<00:00:01.319> walking

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
this morning we're just kind of walking

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.640 
this morning we're just kind of walking
through<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.949> vineyard<00:00:02.370> that's<00:00:02.610> being<00:00:03.650> with

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
through a vineyard that's being with

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.950 
through a vineyard that's being with
some<00:00:04.830> new<00:00:05.040> canopy<00:00:05.580> management<00:00:05.790> techniques<00:00:06.720> as

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
some new canopy management techniques as

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.540 
some new canopy management techniques as
you<00:00:07.109> can<00:00:07.259> see<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> fruit<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.250> very

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
you can see that the fruit is very

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.820 
you can see that the fruit is very
exposed<00:00:09.030> especially<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.469> call<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
exposed especially on what we call the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.820 
exposed especially on what we call the
morning<00:00:11.250> side<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> canopy<00:00:12.330> for<00:00:12.840> air

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
morning side of the canopy for air

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.330 
morning side of the canopy for air
circulation<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.730> get<00:00:14.849> around<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> clusters

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
circulation to get around the clusters

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.830 
circulation to get around the clusters
it's<00:00:17.340> very<00:00:17.550> important<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.090> well<00:00:18.300> as<00:00:18.510> spray

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
it's very important as well as spray

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
it's very important as well as spray
penetration<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.070> don't<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.400> any

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
penetration so we don't have any

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.470 
penetration so we don't have any
incidences<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.779> mildew<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.710> rot<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:24.090> cane<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
incidences of mildew or rot this cane I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.779 
incidences of mildew or rot this cane I
got<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.930> my<00:00:25.050> hand<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.769> approximately<00:00:26.580> three

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
got in my hand is approximately three

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.019 
got in my hand is approximately three
feet<00:00:26.820> long<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.830> it<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:28.980> stopped<00:00:29.310> growing<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
feet long and it has stopped growing the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.880 
feet long and it has stopped growing the
shoot<00:00:30.240> tip<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.660> still<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.710> it's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
shoot tip is still right here but it's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950 
shoot tip is still right here but it's
not<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.489> advance<00:00:32.610> same<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.780> one

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
not going to advance same with this one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.979 
not going to advance same with this one
here<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.469> look<00:00:35.430> at<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> well<00:00:36.360> balanced

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
here I look at this as a well balanced

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
here I look at this as a well balanced
vine<00:00:37.290> there<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.920> no<00:00:38.160> need<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.760> any<00:00:38.940> topping

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
vine there was no need to do any topping

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.170 
vine there was no need to do any topping
or<00:00:39.780> cutting<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> Canes<00:00:40.739> which<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.059> of

or cutting of the Canes which a lot of
vineyards<00:00:42.649> vineyard<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.660> again<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
vineyards vineyard is do again if the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.860 
vineyards vineyard is do again if the
canopy<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> crop<00:00:47.370> load<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.210> sync<00:00:48.719> with

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
canopy and the crop load is in sync with

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
canopy and the crop load is in sync with
each<00:00:49.050> other<00:00:49.289> there's<00:00:49.620> no<00:00:49.680> need<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.820> any

each other there's no need to do any

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.830 
each other there's no need to do any
topping<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.660> hedging<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.660> see

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
topping or hedging and you can see

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.410 
topping or hedging and you can see
through<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> Cabernet<00:00:56.430> we're<00:00:57.300> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
through here this is Cabernet we're in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
through here this is Cabernet we're in
the<00:00:57.539> lag<00:00:57.809> phase<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:58.890> berry<00:00:59.340> development<00:01:00.059> in

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the lag phase of berry development in

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
the lag phase of berry development in
other<00:01:00.300> words<00:01:00.660> we're<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> point<00:01:02.070> where<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
other words we're at the point where the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.600 
other words we're at the point where the
berries<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:02.969> starting<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> size<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.610> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
berries are starting the size up and I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179 
berries are starting the size up and I
would<00:01:05.790> say<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.450> probably<00:01:07.049> roughly<00:01:07.740> 50%

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
would say these are probably roughly 50%

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
would say these are probably roughly 50%
of<00:01:08.909> their<00:01:09.270> size<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.810> other<00:01:09.930> words<00:01:10.170> they'll

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
of their size in other words they'll

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.980 
of their size in other words they'll
double<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.430> size<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.970> next<00:01:12.210> month

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
double in size in the next month

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.649 
double in size in the next month
irregardless<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.280> how<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:14.640> water<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.240> given

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
irregardless of how much water is given

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
irregardless of how much water is given
and<00:01:15.810> fertilize<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.619> anything<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.040> it's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and fertilize or anything like that it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.550 
and fertilize or anything like that it's
just<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.150> natural<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> they'll<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
just a natural thing that they'll do a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
just a natural thing that they'll do a
size<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.549> clusters<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.270> much

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
size up the clusters will get much

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
size up the clusters will get much
tighter<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.400> berries<00:01:23.790> start<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:25.220> fill<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
tighter as the berries start to fill in

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
tighter as the berries start to fill in
much<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.150> putting<00:01:27.299> basketballs<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.470> box

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
much like putting basketballs in a box

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 
much like putting basketballs in a box
you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.850> won't<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.090> too<00:01:30.270> much<00:01:30.360> air

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you know there won't be too much air

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.390 
you know there won't be too much air
space<00:01:30.869> between<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:31.799> why<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
space between that so that's why it's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.179 
space between that so that's why it's
very<00:01:32.579> important<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.619> good<00:01:34.979> aeration

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
very important to have good aeration

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.760 
very important to have good aeration
good<00:01:35.909> openness<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> clusters<00:01:37.380> especially

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
good openness in the clusters especially

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
good openness in the clusters especially
on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> morning<00:01:38.280> side<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> reason<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
on the morning side the reason we do the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.830 
on the morning side the reason we do the
morning<00:01:39.689> side<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.829> canopies<00:01:41.840> primarily

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
morning side of the canopies primarily

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.090 
morning side of the canopies primarily
is<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.530> way

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
is so that way

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.730 
is so that way
in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:45.119> late<00:01:45.329> hot<00:01:45.630> afternoons<00:01:46.259> we're<00:01:46.590> not

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
in the late hot afternoons we're not

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.929 
in the late hot afternoons we're not
exposing<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.490> fruit<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.119> potential<00:01:48.810> sunburn

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
exposing this fruit to potential sunburn

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.600 
exposing this fruit to potential sunburn
if<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.180> expose<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.930> fruit<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.009> afternoon

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
if we expose the fruit on the afternoon

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.440 
if we expose the fruit on the afternoon
side<00:01:54.020> there's<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.170> risk<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.950> risk<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.909> a

sunburn on the fruit which is damaging
the<00:02:00.509> balanced<00:02:01.020> vineyard<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.430> fact<00:02:02.700> that

has a lot of going on in here but I
don't<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.750> anything<00:02:32.050> that's<00:02:32.320> excessive<00:02:33.010> we

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
don't see anything that's excessive we

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.760 
don't see anything that's excessive we
see<00:02:33.880> very<00:02:34.180> very<00:02:34.270> few<00:02:34.510> clusters<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.530> ground

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
see very very few clusters on the ground

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.400 
see very very few clusters on the ground
and<00:02:36.070> that's<00:02:36.490> just<00:02:36.730> again<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:37.660> our<00:02:37.780> early<00:02:38.140> past

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
and that's just again for our early past

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.070 
and that's just again for our early past
now<00:02:38.800> there<00:02:39.010> may<00:02:39.190> be<00:02:39.220> another<00:02:39.880> thinning<00:02:40.780> pass

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
now there may be another thinning pass

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.290 
now there may be another thinning pass
coming<00:02:41.860> up<00:02:42.100> later<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.550> what<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.060> call<00:02:43.270> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
coming up later on what we call the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.630 
coming up later on what we call the
green<00:02:43.690> phase<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.470> that's<00:02:45.100> when<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.459> ver

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
green phase and that's when the ver

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.670 
green phase and that's when the ver
asian<00:02:46.120> which<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.720> color<00:02:46.959> change<00:02:47.350> or<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
asian which is the color change or the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.330 
asian which is the color change or the
berry<00:02:47.920> softening<00:02:49.350> phase<00:02:50.350> starts<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.100> happen

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
berry softening phase starts to happen

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.250 
berry softening phase starts to happen
and<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.850> fruit<00:02:52.090> actually<00:02:52.269> starts<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.780> take<00:02:53.050> on

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
and the fruit actually starts to take on

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.400 
and the fruit actually starts to take on
the<00:02:53.590> reds<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> pink<00:02:54.610> colors<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:56.080> at<00:02:56.200> that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
the reds and the pink colors and at that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.440 
the reds and the pink colors and at that
point<00:02:56.739> is<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.100> time<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.880> will<00:02:58.090> come<00:02:58.420> through

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
point is a time that will come through

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.840 
point is a time that will come through
once<00:02:59.110> again<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.769> remove<00:03:00.040> anything<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.760> is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
once again and remove anything that is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.810 
once again and remove anything that is
lagging<00:03:01.150> behind<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.830> will<00:03:03.130> also<00:03:03.400> leg

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
lagging behind because it will also leg

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.090 
lagging behind because it will also leg
behind<00:03:04.300> at<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.810> time<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.170> harvest<00:03:05.410> when<00:03:05.920> it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
behind at the time of harvest when it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.180 
behind at the time of harvest when it
comes<00:03:06.310> from<00:03:06.519> maturity<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.860> will

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
comes from maturity and that will

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.970 
comes from maturity and that will
probably<00:03:09.370> happen<00:03:09.730> sometime<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.600> late<00:03:11.470> August

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
probably happen sometime in late August

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.300 
probably happen sometime in late August
at<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.160> point<00:03:12.580> at<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.820> point<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.209> time<00:03:14.310> but

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
at the point at this point in time but

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.789 
at the point at this point in time but
for<00:03:15.519> now<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.790> crew<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.570> just<00:03:16.600> opening<00:03:17.530> up<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
for now the crew is just opening up the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.080 
for now the crew is just opening up the
clusters<00:03:18.190> looking<00:03:18.519> for<00:03:18.700> things<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:18.970> are

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
clusters looking for things that are

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.440 
clusters looking for things that are
going<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.269> be<00:03:19.360> obviously<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.320> problem

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
going to be obviously a problem

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.940 
going to be obviously a problem
removing<00:03:22.450> clusters<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.019> very<00:03:23.230> short<00:03:23.620> shoots

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
removing clusters on very short shoots

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.319 
removing clusters on very short shoots
that<00:03:24.160> are<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.430> going<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.640> mature<00:03:24.970> them<00:03:25.150> as

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
that are not going to mature them as

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.360 
that are not going to mature them as
well<00:03:25.570> even<00:03:26.140> though<00:03:26.470> these<00:03:26.620> are<00:03:26.829> very<00:03:27.040> large

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
well even though these are very large

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.910 
well even though these are very large
clusters<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.180> are<00:03:28.239> being<00:03:28.480> dropped<00:03:28.860> they<00:03:29.860> are

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
clusters that are being dropped they are

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.400 
clusters that are being dropped they are
too<00:03:30.640> close<00:03:30.910> together<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.570> their<00:03:31.900> neighboring

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
too close together to their neighboring

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.410 
too close together to their neighboring
clusters<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.160> we're<00:03:33.340> doing<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.760> thinning<00:03:34.060> pass

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
clusters so we're doing a thinning pass

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.930 
clusters so we're doing a thinning pass
just<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.019> remove<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.560> excess<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.340> crop<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
just to remove the excess of crop and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.569 
just to remove the excess of crop and
open<00:03:37.900> up<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.200> clusters<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.950> they're<00:03:39.400> in

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
open up the clusters and they're in

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.030 
open up the clusters and they're in
their<00:03:39.790> positions<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:41.019> can<00:03:41.170> see<00:03:41.410> here<00:03:41.769> there's

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
their positions you can see here there's

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.340 
their positions you can see here there's
a<00:03:42.100> gentleman<00:03:43.090> who<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.299> making<00:03:43.959> sure<00:03:44.140> there's

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
a gentleman who is making sure there's

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.280 
a gentleman who is making sure there's
good<00:03:44.500> separation<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.670> fruit<00:03:45.880> zone<00:03:46.290> any

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
good separation in the fruit zone any

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.800 
good separation in the fruit zone any
second<00:03:47.769> crop<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.220> might<00:03:48.430> be<00:03:48.610> there<00:03:48.910> he's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
second crop that might be there he's

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.110 
second crop that might be there he's
removing<00:03:50.560> clusters<00:03:50.980> around<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.640> little<00:03:51.790> bit

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
