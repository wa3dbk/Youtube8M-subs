crucial mistakes that there were that we

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.770 
crucial mistakes that there were that we
let<00:00:53.470> them<00:00:53.560> have<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.800> lane<00:00:54.520> swap<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.570> we

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
let them have the lane swap and that we

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.530 
let them have the lane swap and that we
messed<00:00:56.680> up<00:00:56.860> ay-ay<00:00:57.010> freeze<00:00:57.940> in<00:00:58.240> one<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.420> the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
messed up ay-ay freeze in one of the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.910 
messed up ay-ay freeze in one of the
sidelines<00:00:58.930> so<00:00:59.380> these<00:00:59.650> this<00:01:00.250> lid<00:01:00.610> into

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
sidelines so these this lid into

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
sidelines so these this lid into
gangplank<00:01:02.920> having<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.250> huge<00:01:04.239> advantage<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.750> cs

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
gangplank having a huge advantage of cs

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.550 
gangplank having a huge advantage of cs
compared<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.270> lulu<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.690> this<00:01:08.200> kind<00:01:08.409> of

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
compared to lulu and this kind of

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.890 
compared to lulu and this kind of
snowball<00:01:09.130> we<00:01:09.250> had<00:01:09.370> to<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:10.210> scale<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.780> they

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
snowball we had to to scale and they

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.770 
snowball we had to to scale and they
just<00:01:11.170> had<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.440> super<00:01:12.010> strong<00:01:12.159> mid<00:01:12.430> game<00:01:12.580> also<00:01:13.300> on

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
just had a super strong mid game also on

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.320 
just had a super strong mid game also on
this<00:01:14.650> was<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.040> game<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.280> they<00:01:15.580> had<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:16.030> virus

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
this was the game that they had a virus

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.969 
this was the game that they had a virus
here<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:19.390> being<00:01:19.600> able<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.990> put<00:01:20.560> lutheran

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
here so not being able to put lutheran

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.200 
here so not being able to put lutheran
in<00:01:21.070> strong<00:01:21.280> position<00:01:21.400> maiden<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.030> they

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
in strong position maiden that they

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.670 
in strong position maiden that they
could<00:01:22.390> split<00:01:22.690> push<00:01:22.840> forever<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.380> they<00:01:23.500> could

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
could split push forever and they could

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.440 
could split push forever and they could
actually<00:01:23.860> sit<00:01:24.250> without<00:01:24.430> us<00:01:24.850> having<00:01:25.150> nothing

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
actually sit without us having nothing

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.260 
actually sit without us having nothing
gauge<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:26.050> it<00:01:26.620> was<00:01:26.800> just<00:01:26.830> that<00:01:27.130> we<00:01:27.700> did<00:01:27.880> this<00:01:27.909> to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
gauge so it was just that we did this to

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.670 
gauge so it was just that we did this to
critical<00:01:28.659> mistakes<00:01:28.990> with<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.170> composition

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
critical mistakes with a composition

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.310 
critical mistakes with a composition
that<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:29.950> cannot<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:31.600> these<00:01:32.020> kind<00:01:32.200> of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
that we cannot take these kind of

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.110 
that we cannot take these kind of
mistakes<00:01:32.409> because<00:01:32.830> if<00:01:33.159> they<00:01:33.549> get<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:33.880> on<00:01:34.030> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
mistakes because if they get that on the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.730 
mistakes because if they get that on the
chin<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.420> in<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.990> early<00:01:35.200> game<00:01:35.380> they<00:01:35.560> will<00:01:35.710> be

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
chin the in the early game they will be

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.910 
chin the in the early game they will be
able<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.159> sit<00:01:36.520> for<00:01:36.549> free<00:01:36.880> okay<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.440> wasn't

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
able to sit for free okay so it wasn't

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.060 
able to sit for free okay so it wasn't
like<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.960> faker<00:01:40.960> complex<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:41.680> which<00:01:41.830> you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
like the the faker complex in which you

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.680 
like the the faker complex in which you
become<00:01:42.370> so<00:01:42.610> good<00:01:42.850> you're<00:01:43.060> no<00:01:43.090> longer<00:01:43.330> afraid

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
become so good you're no longer afraid

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.320 
become so good you're no longer afraid
of<00:01:43.930> other<00:01:44.049> opponent<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.729> fact<00:01:45.970> we<00:01:46.119> are<00:01:46.180> not

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
of other opponent in fact we are not

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.930 
of other opponent in fact we are not
afraid<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.659> we<00:01:47.590> were<00:01:47.710> not<00:01:47.860> afraid<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.190> them<00:01:48.490> but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
afraid of we were not afraid of them but

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.660 
afraid of we were not afraid of them but
we<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:50.140> lost<00:01:50.680> because<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.130> miss<00:01:52.030> played<00:01:52.330> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
we just lost because we miss played and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.120 
we just lost because we miss played and
yeah<00:01:54.670> it's<00:01:54.820> it's<00:01:55.150> basically<00:01:55.659> this<00:01:55.840> okay<00:01:56.560> we

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130

trigger this was the pattern can they
understand<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.420> then<00:05:04.630> next<00:05:05.080> time<00:05:05.290> they

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
understand it and then next time they

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.490 
understand it and then next time they
were<00:05:05.530> better<00:05:05.740> prepared<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:07.210> take<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:08.050> okay

their<00:05:45.760> old<00:05:45.880> tricks<00:05:46.500> has<00:05:47.500> this<00:05:47.770> made<00:05:48.010> it<00:05:48.040> easier

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
their old tricks has this made it easier

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.310 
their old tricks has this made it easier
to<00:05:48.730> pull<00:05:48.940> off<00:05:49.060> some<00:05:49.240> kind<00:05:49.420> of<00:05:49.510> place<00:05:49.720> because<00:05:50.110> I

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
to pull off some kind of place because I

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.390 
to pull off some kind of place because I
mean<00:05:50.440> obviously<00:05:50.680> they<00:05:50.860> already<00:05:51.130> know<00:05:51.370> each

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
mean obviously they already know each

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.980 
mean obviously they already know each
other<00:05:51.730> and<00:05:51.880> they<00:05:52.000> kind<00:05:52.210> of<00:05:52.270> have<00:05:52.540> this<00:05:52.690> energy

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
other and they kind of have this energy

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.130 
other and they kind of have this energy
going<00:05:53.430> yes<00:05:54.430> it's<00:05:54.700> actually<00:05:55.120> way<00:05:55.660> more<00:05:55.690> easier

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
going yes it's actually way more easier

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.070 
going yes it's actually way more easier
because<00:05:56.920> um<00:05:59.190> both<00:06:00.190> both<00:06:00.820> players<00:06:01.240> really<00:06:01.960> know

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
because um both both players really know

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.560 
because um both both players really know
each<00:06:02.230> other<00:06:02.410> so<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.550> synergy<00:06:04.000> between<00:06:04.150> both

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
each other so the synergy between both

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.800 
each other so the synergy between both
of<00:06:04.600> them<00:06:04.930> is<00:06:05.250> extremely<00:06:06.250> high<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:06.810> even

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
of them is extremely high and even

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.390 
of them is extremely high and even
though<00:06:07.900> still<00:06:07.960> backwash<00:06:08.470> a<00:06:08.590> what's<00:06:09.160> a<00:06:09.250> good

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
though still backwash a what's a good

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.120 
though still backwash a what's a good
good<00:06:09.880> ADC<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.720> synergy<00:06:11.380> is<00:06:11.590> like<00:06:11.860> nothing

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
good ADC the synergy is like nothing

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.480 
good ADC the synergy is like nothing
compared<00:06:12.670> it's<00:06:13.000> like<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:15.130> amount<00:06:15.340> of

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
compared it's like the the amount of

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.700 
compared it's like the the amount of
like<00:06:16.180> I<00:06:16.420> was<00:06:17.050> going<00:06:17.230> to<00:06:17.290> say<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.470> amount<00:06:17.620> of

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
like I was going to say the amount of

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.840 
like I was going to say the amount of
place<00:06:17.920> but<00:06:18.070> it's<00:06:18.220> not<00:06:18.340> really<00:06:18.490> the<00:06:18.580> mountain

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
place but it's not really the mountain

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.520 
place but it's not really the mountain
places<00:06:19.180> like<00:06:19.360> how<00:06:19.780> they<00:06:19.930> play<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.230> laning

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
places like how they play the laning

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.660 
places like how they play the laning
phase<00:06:20.710> how<00:06:20.890> they<00:06:21.040> transition<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:21.520> the

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
phase how they transition to the

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.880 
phase how they transition to the
mid-game<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.210> roaming<00:06:22.600> game<00:06:22.720> of<00:06:23.080> yellow<00:06:23.620> star

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
mid-game the roaming game of yellow star

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.390 
mid-game the roaming game of yellow star
on<00:06:23.980> how<00:06:24.130> Martin<00:06:24.940> adapts<00:06:25.390> to<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:26.140> team<00:06:26.320> it<00:06:26.980> just

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
on how Martin adapts to the team it just

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.910 
on how Martin adapts to the team it just
it's<00:06:28.150> so<00:06:28.330> much<00:06:28.480> easier<00:06:28.510> to<00:06:28.870> play<00:06:29.020> the<00:06:29.530> strength

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
it's so much easier to play the strength

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.040 
it's so much easier to play the strength
of<00:06:30.040> our<00:06:30.160> bottling<00:06:30.670> having<00:06:31.060> reckless<00:06:31.870> and

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
of our bottling having reckless and

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.720 
of our bottling having reckless and
dealer<00:06:32.230> star<00:06:32.440> is<00:06:32.800> hired<00:06:33.100> just<00:06:33.370> because<00:06:33.580> the

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
dealer star is hired just because the

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.370 
dealer star is hired just because the
seniority<00:06:34.000> is<00:06:34.210> so<00:06:34.360> high<00:06:34.540> and<00:06:34.780> because<00:06:35.260> the

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
seniority is so high and because the

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.400 
seniority is so high and because the
synergy<00:06:35.740> was<00:06:35.890> so<00:06:36.070> high<00:06:36.250> since<00:06:36.970> he<00:06:37.690> seems

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
synergy was so high since he seems

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.450 
synergy was so high since he seems
