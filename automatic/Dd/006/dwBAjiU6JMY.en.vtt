it's near and dear to my heart because I
was<00:00:11.580> very<00:00:11.820> confused<00:00:12.090> about<00:00:12.660> movement<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
was very confused about movement to the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.950 
was very confused about movement to the
net<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> long<00:00:14.639> time<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.269> studied<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> lot

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
net for a long time and I studied a lot

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.630 
net for a long time and I studied a lot
of<00:00:16.139> video<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.470> lot<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.859> serving<00:00:17.190> volley<00:00:17.400> errs

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of video a lot of serving volley errs

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
of video a lot of serving volley errs
and<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.850> realized<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.859> conventional

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and I realized that conventional

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.980 
and I realized that conventional
traditional<00:00:20.130> teaching<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.210> messing<00:00:21.600> all<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
traditional teaching was messing all of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.859 
traditional teaching was messing all of
us<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.250> what's<00:00:23.760> happening<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> I

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
us up and so what's happening and I

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.109 
us up and so what's happening and I
actually<00:00:25.019> saw<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:26.099> video<00:00:26.310> earlier<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.060> year

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
actually saw one video earlier this year

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.300 
actually saw one video earlier this year
of<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> player<00:00:27.840> pretty<00:00:28.619> good<00:00:28.800> player<00:00:29.039> actually

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
of a player pretty good player actually

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.110 
of a player pretty good player actually
that<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.840> serving<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.410> volleying<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.120> they

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that was serving and volleying and they

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.720 
that was serving and volleying and they
were<00:00:33.180> hitting<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> serve<00:00:34.230> literally<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
were hitting the serve literally this is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.720 
were hitting the serve literally this is
no<00:00:35.880> joke<00:00:36.180> hitting<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> serve<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.739> then

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
no joke hitting the serve and then

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
no joke hitting the serve and then
taking<00:00:39.270> about<00:00:40.160> 10<00:00:41.160> steps<00:00:41.660> maybe<00:00:42.660> 12<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
taking about 10 steps maybe 12 to the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
taking about 10 steps maybe 12 to the
net<00:00:44.190> before<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> split<00:00:44.940> step<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> course

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
net before a split step now of course

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
net before a split step now of course
this<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> choreographed<00:00:47.160> video

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this was kind of a choreographed video

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150 
this was kind of a choreographed video
so<00:00:48.420> he<00:00:48.510> wasn't<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.870> playing<00:00:49.230> points<00:00:49.649> but

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so he wasn't really playing points but

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.939 
so he wasn't really playing points but
the<00:00:50.309> fact<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.539> concept<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> practicing

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the fact that the concept of practicing

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.360 
the fact that the concept of practicing
taking<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:54.090> 10<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.930> steps<00:00:55.280> split<00:00:56.280> at

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
taking you know 10 little steps split at

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
taking you know 10 little steps split at
the<00:00:56.489> service<00:00:56.910> line<00:00:57.149> then<00:00:57.809> turn<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> run<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the service line then turn and run to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.369 
the service line then turn and run to
the<00:00:59.010> ball<00:00:59.300> it's<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> most<00:01:00.719> ridiculous

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the ball it's one of the most ridiculous

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
the ball it's one of the most ridiculous
things<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.770> I've<00:01:01.859> ever<00:01:01.890> seen<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> tennis<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
things that I've ever seen in tennis it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.550 
things that I've ever seen in tennis it
is<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.229> absolutely<00:01:05.189> setting<00:01:05.610> tennis<00:01:05.939> back

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
is it is absolutely setting tennis back

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.870 
is it is absolutely setting tennis back
lightyears<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:08.010> might<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> back<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lightyears we might as well go back to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
lightyears we might as well go back to
the<00:01:08.970> prehistoric<00:01:09.210> dinosaur<00:01:09.810> days<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the prehistoric dinosaur days of this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.219 
the prehistoric dinosaur days of this
one<00:01:10.830> okay<00:01:11.330> here's<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> deal<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> serve

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
one okay here's the deal with a serve

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.510 
one okay here's the deal with a serve
and<00:01:13.260> volley<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.890> course<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.210> playing

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
and volley of course if you are playing

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
and volley of course if you are playing
slow<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> 3.5<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.320> if

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
slow if you're a 3.5 if you're not if

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.740 
slow if you're a 3.5 if you're not if
the<00:01:20.009> ball<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.490> traveling<00:01:21.030> fast<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.540> will

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the ball is not traveling fast you will

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.890 
the ball is not traveling fast you will
be<00:01:21.930> taking<00:01:22.320> more<00:01:22.470> steps<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> net<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.750> as

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
be taking more steps to the net but as

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.780 
be taking more steps to the net but as
the<00:01:25.200> speeds<00:01:25.530> increase<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.220> will<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.430> taking

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the speeds increase you will be taking

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.749 
the speeds increase you will be taking
less<00:01:27.150> steps<00:01:27.659> before<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.409> split<00:01:28.680> step<00:01:29.040> for

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
less steps before you split step for

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.020 
less steps before you split step for
example<00:01:30.450> Pete<00:01:31.110> Sampras<00:01:31.680> 125<00:01:32.640> mile<00:01:32.850> an<00:01:32.970> hour

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
example Pete Sampras 125 mile an hour

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
example Pete Sampras 125 mile an hour
serve<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.570> volleyer<00:01:33.930> okay<00:01:34.380> he's<00:01:34.740> hitting

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
serve and volleyer okay he's hitting

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.359 
serve and volleyer okay he's hitting
bombs<00:01:35.310> here's<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:36.450> would<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:37.130> he's<00:01:38.130> going

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
bombs here's what he would do he's going

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.300 
bombs here's what he would do he's going
to<00:01:38.460> land<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.939> his<00:01:39.119> front<00:01:39.390> foot<00:01:39.600> take<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.829> step

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
to land on his front foot take one step

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
to land on his front foot take one step
and<00:01:41.990> then<00:01:42.990> he's<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> split<00:01:44.540> no<00:01:45.540> joke

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and then he's going to split no joke

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.899 
and then he's going to split no joke
he's<00:01:46.619> basically<00:01:47.220> landing<00:01:49.100> taking<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.520> step

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
he's basically landing taking one step

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.999 
he's basically landing taking one step
and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.360> splitting<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.649> looks<00:01:52.860> something

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and then splitting so it looks something

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.510 
and then splitting so it looks something
like<00:01:53.220> this

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.560 

that's<00:01:58.520> all<00:01:58.759> there<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.270> it

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
that's all there is to it

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
that's all there is to it
now<00:01:59.810> as<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.170> was<00:02:00.290> growing<00:02:00.470> up

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.489 

you
