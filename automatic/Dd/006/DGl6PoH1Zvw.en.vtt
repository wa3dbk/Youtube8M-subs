which<00:00:43.530> website<00:00:43.950> were<00:00:44.370> putting<00:00:44.730> online<00:00:45.059> and

which website were putting online and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.630 
which website were putting online and
it's<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.140> fast<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.920> broadband

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860

traditional<00:00:50.550> let's<00:00:51.120> say<00:00:51.239> mobile<00:00:51.690> data

so<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.379> optimized<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:55.920> speed<00:00:56.309> all

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
