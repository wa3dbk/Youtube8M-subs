00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
this tent has a little less mesh so it's

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.700 
this tent has a little less mesh so it's
great<00:05:36.699> for<00:05:36.729> colder<00:05:37.240> weather<00:05:37.360> but<00:05:38.110> by<00:05:38.469> the<00:05:38.529> same

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
great for colder weather but by the same

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.529 
great for colder weather but by the same
token<00:05:38.789> this<00:05:39.789> door<00:05:40.210> is<00:05:40.919> all<00:05:41.919> mesh<00:05:42.389> so<00:05:43.389> you're

token this door is all mesh so you're
getting<00:05:43.750> tons<00:05:43.990> of<00:05:44.080> ventilation<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:44.860> if<00:05:45.279> you

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
getting tons of ventilation and if you

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.670 
getting tons of ventilation and if you
have<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:46.120> vestibule<00:05:46.779> set<00:05:47.379> up<00:05:49.529> where<00:05:50.529> it's

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
have the vestibule set up where it's

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.480 
have the vestibule set up where it's
open<00:05:50.949> or<00:05:51.490> partially<00:05:51.969> open<00:05:52.919> it's<00:05:53.919> just<00:05:54.129> a<00:05:54.219> great

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
open or partially open it's just a great

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.909 
open or partially open it's just a great
ventilation<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.150> little<00:05:56.139> bit<00:05:56.259> a<00:05:56.469> little<00:05:56.800> bit

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
ventilation a little bit a little bit

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.670 
ventilation a little bit a little bit
heavier<00:05:57.310> than<00:05:58.319> then<00:05:59.319> some<00:05:59.469> of<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.620> other

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
heavier than then some of the other

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.839 
heavier than then some of the other
tents<00:06:00.069> its<00:06:00.189> size<00:06:00.539> but<00:06:02.069> between<00:06:03.069> the<00:06:03.339> function

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
tents its size but between the function

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.379 
tents its size but between the function
and<00:06:03.969> durability<00:06:04.360> I<00:06:04.569> think<00:06:04.779> it's<00:06:04.900> worth<00:06:05.050> it<00:06:06.389> I

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
and durability I think it's worth it I

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.950 
and durability I think it's worth it I
think<00:06:07.839> that's<00:06:07.960> gonna<00:06:08.259> be<00:06:08.349> it<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.659> our<00:06:10.659> number

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
think that's gonna be it so our number

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.219 
think that's gonna be it so our number
one<00:06:11.110> kick<00:06:11.940> for<00:06:12.940> design<00:06:13.870> ease<00:06:14.529> of<00:06:14.770> setup<00:06:16.229> for

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
one kick for design ease of setup for

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.200 
one kick for design ease of setup for
backpacking<00:06:17.889> was<00:06:18.069> the<00:06:18.279> the<00:06:18.729> missing<00:06:18.879> link

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
backpacking was the the missing link

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.079 
backpacking was the the missing link
just<00:06:19.659> a<00:06:19.949> three<00:06:20.949> minute<00:06:21.099> pitch<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:21.759> you're<00:06:21.969> in

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
just a three minute pitch and you're in

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:24.570 
just a three minute pitch and you're in
it<00:06:22.139> single<00:06:23.139> wall<00:06:23.319> I<00:06:23.650> don't<00:06:24.250> think<00:06:24.400> it's<00:06:24.490> gonna

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
it single wall I don't think it's gonna
