hello everyone welcome we're going to be
playing<00:00:10.419> some<00:00:10.870> team<00:00:11.110> fortress<00:00:11.530> 2<00:00:11.799> x<00:00:12.099> 10<00:00:13.950> right

playing some team fortress 2 x 10 right

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.630 
playing some team fortress 2 x 10 right
now<00:00:15.070> I'm<00:00:15.219> playing<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:16.090> spy<00:00:16.510> with<00:00:17.400> kunai<00:00:18.400> and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
now I'm playing the spy with kunai and

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.060 
now I'm playing the spy with kunai and
tf2<00:00:19.030> x10<00:00:19.480> is<00:00:19.510> really<00:00:19.870> cool<00:00:20.050> because<00:00:20.350> it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
tf2 x10 is really cool because it

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.360 
tf2 x10 is really cool because it
multiplies<00:00:21.580> all<00:00:21.880> your<00:00:22.090> stats<00:00:22.360> about<00:00:22.630> 10<00:00:23.370> so

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
multiplies all your stats about 10 so

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.480 
multiplies all your stats about 10 so
like<00:00:24.640> any<00:00:24.970> any<00:00:25.360> item<00:00:25.720> stats<00:00:26.050> you'll<00:00:26.590> get<00:00:26.770> 10<00:00:27.460> of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
like any any item stats you'll get 10 of

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.790 
like any any item stats you'll get 10 of
i'm<00:00:28.270> using<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.660> Ambassador<00:00:29.380> lack<00:00:29.560> sure<00:00:29.740> i

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
i'm using the Ambassador lack sure i

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.549 
i'm using the Ambassador lack sure i
can't<00:00:30.070> because<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:31.000> twenty<00:00:31.360> percent<00:00:31.559> firing

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
can't because the twenty percent firing

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.770 
can't because the twenty percent firing
speed<00:00:32.910> really<00:00:33.910> makes<00:00:34.210> it<00:00:34.390> bad<00:00:34.539> and<00:00:34.570> like

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
speed really makes it bad and like

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.399 
speed really makes it bad and like
because<00:00:35.469> mote<00:00:35.769> any<00:00:36.070> any<00:00:36.579> item<00:00:37.199> multiplied<00:00:38.199> the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
because mote any any item multiplied the

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.340 
because mote any any item multiplied the
stats<00:00:38.649> by<00:00:38.829> 10<00:00:39.449> so<00:00:40.449> that's<00:00:40.659> why<00:00:40.809> I'm<00:00:41.019> using<00:00:41.170> the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
stats by 10 so that's why I'm using the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.040 
stats by 10 so that's why I'm using the
