00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.869 
luxury touring motorcycle the thing I
like<00:02:39.200> about<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.590> motorcycle<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.340> most<00:02:40.580> is

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
like about this motorcycle the most is

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.140 
like about this motorcycle the most is
probably<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.569> engine<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:43.310> got<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.849> little

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
probably this engine it's got a little

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.420 
probably this engine it's got a little
bit<00:02:44.330> more<00:02:44.360> mid-range<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.530> little<00:02:46.040> more<00:02:46.160> top<00:02:46.400> end

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
bit more mid-range a little more top end

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.270 
bit more mid-range a little more top end
power<00:02:46.730> than<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.360> harley-davidson<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:49.010> course

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
power than the harley-davidson of course

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.589 
power than the harley-davidson of course
it's<00:02:49.459> liquid<00:02:49.670> cooled<00:02:50.000> compared<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
it's liquid cooled compared to the

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.270 
it's liquid cooled compared to the
air-cooled<00:02:51.319> engine<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.769> Harley<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.190> it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
air-cooled engine and Harley so it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.259 
air-cooled engine and Harley so it
probably<00:02:52.430> should<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.940> little<00:02:53.090> bit<00:02:53.180> more

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
probably should have a little bit more

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.660 
probably should have a little bit more
power<00:02:53.480> but<00:02:53.750> definitely<00:02:54.200> mid-range<00:02:55.010> top-end<00:02:55.519> a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
power but definitely mid-range top-end a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.880 
power but definitely mid-range top-end a
little<00:02:55.849> bit<00:02:55.940> stronger<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:57.170> nimble<00:02:57.410> like<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
little bit stronger it's nimble like the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.539 
little bit stronger it's nimble like the
Harley<00:02:58.130> Davidson

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
Harley Davidson

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.400 
Harley Davidson
turned<00:02:58.819> side<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.239> side<00:02:59.450> very<00:02:59.750> effortlessly

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
turned side to side very effortlessly

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.259 
turned side to side very effortlessly
but<00:03:00.920> when<00:03:01.099> you<00:03:01.190> set<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.579> corner<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.030> just

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
but when you set in the corner it just

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.580 
but when you set in the corner it just
doesn't<00:03:02.569> have<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.870> same<00:03:03.200> level<00:03:03.440> of

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
doesn't have that same level of

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.520 
doesn't have that same level of
confidence<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.430> do<00:03:04.880> on<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.090> Harley<00:03:05.450> plus<00:03:06.110> the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
confidence you do on the Harley plus the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.410 
confidence you do on the Harley plus the
ground<00:03:06.769> clearance<00:03:07.069> on<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.549> is<00:03:07.670> really<00:03:08.090> really

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
ground clearance on it is really really

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.270 
ground clearance on it is really really
not<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:08.900> good<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.380> leaning<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.069> over<00:03:10.250> a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
not so good like leaning it over a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.830 
not so good like leaning it over a

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
cargo no anything it was a little bit

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.960 
cargo no anything it was a little bit
pokey<00:03:24.560> when<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.069> hit<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> jump<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:25.730> kind<00:03:25.879> of

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
little bit unstable so I can only

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.000 
little bit unstable so I can only
imagine<00:03:29.150> how<00:03:29.510> much<00:03:29.750> worse<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.500> could<00:03:30.650> be<00:03:30.799> if

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
imagine how much worse it could be if

the<00:04:29.780> Kawasaki<00:04:30.229> pedal<00:04:30.620> pulses<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.700> but<00:04:31.970> it's

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
the Kawasaki pedal pulses to but it's

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.620 
the Kawasaki pedal pulses to but it's
it's<00:04:32.630> a<00:04:32.780> lot<00:04:32.990> less<00:04:33.200> intrusive<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:35.360> bike

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
it's a lot less intrusive and the bike

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.820 
it's a lot less intrusive and the bike
actually<00:04:36.140> stops

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
actually stops

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.260 
actually stops
quicker<00:04:37.400> we

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270
