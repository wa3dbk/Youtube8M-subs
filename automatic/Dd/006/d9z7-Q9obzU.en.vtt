with the travel time except that this

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.529 
with the travel time except that this
weapon<00:00:22.560> has<00:00:22.590> acidic<00:00:23.250> infused<00:00:23.760> needles<00:00:24.330> that

has toxic damage at his core now believe
it<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.060> weapon<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
it or not this weapon was one of the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.839 
it or not this weapon was one of the
best<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.740> best<00:00:28.920> weapons<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> game

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
best if not the best weapons in the game

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.609 
best if not the best weapons in the game
back<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.300> damage<00:00:30.689> 1<00:00:30.869> point<00:00:31.109> 0<00:00:31.199> because<00:00:31.410> back

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
back in damage 1 point 0 because back

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.260 
back in damage 1 point 0 because back
then<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.920> was<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> armor<00:00:33.000> ignore

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
then it was all about the armor ignore

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
then it was all about the armor ignore
because<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.840> armor<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.410> broken<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.950> enemies

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
because the armor was broken the enemies

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
because the armor was broken the enemies
we<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.579> scale<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.149> much<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.390> unless<00:00:36.780> he

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
we just scale up so much that unless he

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
we just scale up so much that unless he
brought<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.350> weapon<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:37.770> could<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.070> chunk

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
brought a weapon they could just chunk

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.010 
brought a weapon they could just chunk
right<00:00:38.640> through<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.910> completely<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
right through that completely you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.750 
right through that completely you
basically<00:00:40.350> did<00:00:40.590> nothing<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:41.190> terms<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
basically did nothing in terms of the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.310 
basically did nothing in terms of the
late<00:00:41.940> game<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.600> since<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> removal

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
late game but you know since the removal

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.049 
late game but you know since the removal
of<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.710> damage<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> point<00:00:44.460> o<00:00:44.579> this

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
of that with damage to point o this

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
of that with damage to point o this
weapon<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> lost<00:00:45.960> his<00:00:46.200> muster<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> lot

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
weapon kind of lost his muster a lot

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.290 
weapon kind of lost his muster a lot
because<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.520> being<00:00:47.550> kind<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> low

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because of it being kind of the low

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
because of it being kind of the low
damage<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.590> fact<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.950> other<00:00:50.250> weapons

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
damage and the fact that other weapons

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.760 
damage and the fact that other weapons
just<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.360> DP<00:00:51.750> ested<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> question

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
just really out DP ested so the question

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
just really out DP ested so the question
is<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> weapon<00:00:53.489> even<00:00:53.789> viable<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
is is the weapon even viable or is it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.180 
is is the weapon even viable or is it
even<00:00:54.660> worth<00:00:54.690> picking<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.590> anymore<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
even worth picking up at all anymore and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
even worth picking up at all anymore and
although<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> will<00:00:56.730> admit<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.090> definitely<00:00:57.449> not

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
although I will admit is definitely not

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
although I will admit is definitely not
a<00:00:57.600> top<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.260> weapon<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> few

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
a top to your weapon there are a few

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.260 
a top to your weapon there are a few
things<00:00:59.370> about<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> mention

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
things about it I want to mention

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
things about it I want to mention
especially<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.109> those<00:01:01.199> diehard<00:01:01.500> fans<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
especially for those diehard fans and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.770 
especially for those diehard fans and
the<00:01:02.460> coolest<00:01:02.760> thing<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the coolest thing I really like about it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
the coolest thing I really like about it
is<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.320> fact<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.010> hundred<00:01:05.309> percent

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
is the fact that in a hundred percent

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850 
is the fact that in a hundred percent
toxic<00:01:06.210> proc<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> toxic<00:01:07.080> prox<00:01:07.320> basically<00:01:07.710> do

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
toxic proc and toxic prox basically do

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.010 
toxic proc and toxic prox basically do
fifty<00:01:08.220> percent<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> initial<00:01:09.210> damage<00:01:09.450> for

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
fifty percent of the initial damage for

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
fifty percent of the initial damage for
nine<00:01:10.229> ticks<00:01:10.560> over<00:01:10.950> eight<00:01:11.159> seconds<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
nine ticks over eight seconds and it

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.179 
nine ticks over eight seconds and it
bypasses<00:01:12.810> shields<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.500> proto<00:01:13.740> she'll<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
bypasses shields and proto she'll is a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
bypasses shields and proto she'll is a
really<00:01:14.430> good<00:01:14.549> corpus<00:01:14.970> killer<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.540> there

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
really good corpus killer right there

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.050 
really good corpus killer right there
just<00:01:15.960> based<00:01:16.110> off<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.439> plus<00:01:17.130> its<00:01:17.460> stack<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
just based off of that plus its stack so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
just based off of that plus its stack so
you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.360> quite<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> few<00:01:18.780> extra<00:01:19.170> dps<00:01:20.130> just

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you can get quite a few extra dps just

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.249 
you can get quite a few extra dps just
off<00:01:20.610> firing<00:01:21.030> multiple<00:01:21.360> needles<00:01:21.930> into<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
off firing multiple needles into a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
off firing multiple needles into a
target<00:01:22.500> also<00:01:23.070> does<00:01:23.250> perfect<00:01:23.729> accuracy<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
target also does perfect accuracy so the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
target also does perfect accuracy so the
needles<00:01:24.750> being<00:01:24.990> fired<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.530> travel<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.009> a

this<00:02:13.230> will<00:02:13.350> give<00:02:13.380> me<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.620> little<00:02:13.800> bit<00:02:13.950> more

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
this will give me a little bit more

the tool dual status ailments will

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.140 
the tool dual status ailments will
bought<00:02:19.290> me<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> 50<00:02:20.040> point<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.790> percent

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
bought me up to a 50 point one percent

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.570 
bought me up to a 50 point one percent
status<00:02:21.540> chance<00:02:21.810> which<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.470> fine<00:02:22.860> by<00:02:23.069> my<00:02:23.280> books

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
status chance which is fine by my books

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.309 
status chance which is fine by my books
and<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.880> also<00:02:24.120> factors<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> multi<00:02:25.140> shot

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
and this also factors in the multi shot

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.650 
and this also factors in the multi shot
but<00:02:25.860> again<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> more<00:02:26.910> top-end<00:02:27.180> damage

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
but again I like the more top-end damage

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.270 
but again I like the more top-end damage
just<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.380> makes<00:02:28.530> use<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.100> one

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
just because it makes use of that one

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.920 
just because it makes use of that one
hundred<00:02:29.459> percent<00:02:29.580> toxic<00:02:30.180> proc<00:02:30.420> which<00:02:30.810> is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
hundred percent toxic proc which is

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.390 
hundred percent toxic proc which is
already<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> weapon<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.190> thing<00:02:32.340> I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
already on the weapon but one thing I

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.340 
already on the weapon but one thing I
will<00:02:32.459> say<00:02:32.580> though<00:02:32.910> is<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.570> do<00:02:33.750> want<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.020> run

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
will say though is if you do want to run

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.040 
will say though is if you do want to run
the<00:02:34.500> full<00:02:34.680> status<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.490> all<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the full status like if you have all the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.270 
the full status like if you have all the
exclusive<00:02:37.050> dual<00:02:37.200> status<00:02:37.440> mods<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:38.160> can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
exclusive dual status mods you can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.860 
exclusive dual status mods you can
definitely<00:02:38.610> use<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.239> weapon<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.690> only

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
definitely use this weapon with only

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110 
definitely use this weapon with only
three<00:02:40.230> formas<00:02:40.680> only<00:02:40.920> three<00:02:41.190> B's<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.000> can

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
three formas only three B's and you can

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.400 
three formas only three B's and you can
run<00:02:42.330> those<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.720> get<00:02:42.810> away<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.230> but

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
run those and get away with that but

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.780 
run those and get away with that but
this<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.770> personal<00:02:44.280> preference<00:02:44.489> thing

will give us that radiation this will

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.580 
will give us that radiation this will
obviously<00:02:57.150> when<00:02:57.989> approximately<00:02:58.530> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
obviously when approximately that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
confusion effect but it's really good

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.460 
confusion effect but it's really good

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
poison will give us that viral which

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.340 
poison will give us that viral which

when<00:03:46.200> blast<00:03:46.560> prox<00:03:46.920> it's<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> really<00:03:47.670> good

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910

three of these mods though and you

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.180 
three of these mods though and you
basically<00:03:53.040> want<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.760> first<00:03:54.180> look<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:55.190> jolt

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190

basically want to first look for jolt
which<00:03:56.489> again<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.329> be<00:03:57.390> an

exclusive<00:03:58.290> mod<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:58.709> this<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:58.980> really<00:03:59.310> going

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
exclusive mod but this is really going

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.250 
exclusive mod but this is really going
to<00:03:59.549> be<00:03:59.670> your<00:03:59.820> best<00:03:59.970> loadout<00:04:00.390> if<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.989> have

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
to be your best loadout if you do have

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.310 
to be your best loadout if you do have
it<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:02.030> jolt<00:04:03.030> pass<00:04:03.329> your<00:04:03.570> rounds<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.019> actually

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
it so jolt pass your rounds and actually

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.470 
it so jolt pass your rounds and actually
put<00:04:04.410> jolt<00:04:04.709> up<00:04:04.920> in<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.250> hand<00:04:05.489> corner<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.000> then

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
put jolt up in that hand corner and then

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.210 
put jolt up in that hand corner and then
we're<00:04:06.690> going<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.840> want<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.290> our<00:04:07.500> scorch<00:04:08.010> as

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
we're going to want on our scorch as

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.890 
we're going to want on our scorch as
well<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.940> basically<00:04:09.299> this<00:04:09.540> will<00:04:09.720> give<00:04:09.870> us

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
well and basically this will give us

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.289 
well and basically this will give us
just<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.560> as<00:04:10.769> much<00:04:11.280> corrosive<00:04:11.820> damage<00:04:12.090> as<00:04:12.180> we

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
just like as much corrosive damage as we

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.270 
just like as much corrosive damage as we
can<00:04:12.390> get<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.660> weapon<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.230> then<00:04:13.590> fire<00:04:13.980> on

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
can get on the weapon and then fire on

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.039 
can get on the weapon and then fire on
its<00:04:14.459> own<00:04:14.640> which<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.480> know<00:04:15.510> better<00:04:15.870> than

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
its own which is you know better than

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.509 
its own which is you know better than
ice<00:04:16.320> against<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.829> heavy<00:04:16.979> gunners<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.430> we're

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
ice against the heavy gunners so we're

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.680 
ice against the heavy gunners so we're
getting<00:04:17.700> really<00:04:17.940> good<00:04:18.060> focused<00:04:18.450> damage

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
getting really good focused damage

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.940 
getting really good focused damage
against<00:04:18.900> them<00:04:19.079> because<00:04:19.229> they're<00:04:19.440> like<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
against them because they're like the

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.190 
against them because they're like the
tankies<00:04:20.370> targets<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.940> voids<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.810> if<00:04:22.019> you

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
tankies targets in the voids but if you
