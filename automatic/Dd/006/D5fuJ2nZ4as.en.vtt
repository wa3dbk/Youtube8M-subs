00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
using it I said actually oh yeah the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.420 
using it I said actually oh yeah the
cygnus<00:01:22.200> knights<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> use<00:01:23.220> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
cygnus knights all right but I use this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.210 
cygnus knights all right but I use this
this<00:01:23.880> gun<00:01:24.060> instead<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.479> cows<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.130> said<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
this gun instead the cows I said it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.910 
this gun instead the cows I said it
correctly<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.049> I<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> say<00:01:28.350> yes<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
correctly then and I have to say yes it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
correctly then and I have to say yes it
is<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> gun<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.020> reload<00:01:31.590> times

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
is about a gun but the reload times

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
is about a gun but the reload times
longer<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.880> by<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> few<00:01:33.689> milliseconds<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
longer I think by a few milliseconds the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
longer I think by a few milliseconds the
fire<00:01:36.630> rate<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> faster<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.560> recoil<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> bit

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
fire rate is faster the recoil is a bit

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.819 
fire rate is faster the recoil is a bit
more<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> burst<00:01:39.840> by<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> bit<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.500> well<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
more when you burst by a bit as well it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.520 
more when you burst by a bit as well it
recoils<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.880> than<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> Cygnus<00:01:42.630> nine<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
recoils more than a Cygnus nine so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.950 
recoils more than a Cygnus nine so
actually<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.009> sigmas<00:01:44.310> 9<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.759> best<00:01:45.060> arranged

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
actually the sigmas 9 is best arranged

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
actually the sigmas 9 is best arranged
and<00:01:46.170> there's<00:01:46.350> gone<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and there's gone that's what I'm the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.859 
and there's gone that's what I'm the
conclusion<00:01:48.329> I've<00:01:48.450> got<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.750> is

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
conclusion I've got to but I'm this is

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.179 
conclusion I've got to but I'm this is
more<00:01:52.170> than<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.500> gun<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.890> use<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
more than one gun you can use in this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.800 
more than one gun you can use in this
game<00:01:53.430> thank<00:01:53.790> God<00:01:54.000> because<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.420> Goldeneye
