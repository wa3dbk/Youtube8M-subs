00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
composition because like it has to bury

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.500 
composition because like it has to bury
is<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.640> know<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:33.879> almost<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.330> it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
is you know it's almost like it's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.360 
is you know it's almost like it's
abstract<00:02:34.900> even<00:02:35.530> though<00:02:35.650> i'm<00:02:35.800> using<00:02:36.190> all

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
abstract even though i'm using all

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.580 
abstract even though i'm using all
representational<00:02:37.240> imagery<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.840> seems<00:02:38.080> almost

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
representational imagery it seems almost

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.229 
representational imagery it seems almost
those<00:02:38.860> totally<00:02:39.340> abstract<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:39.940> hard<00:02:40.120> to

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
those totally abstract it's hard to

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.270 
those totally abstract it's hard to
focus<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:40.989> or<00:02:41.170> even<00:02:41.319> figure<00:02:41.709> out<00:02:41.739> exactly

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
focus on this or even figure out exactly

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.550 
focus on this or even figure out exactly

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
here which i always think is the most

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.589 
here which i always think is the most
interesting<00:02:48.489> thing<00:02:48.700> because<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.940> shows<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
interesting thing because it shows the

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.920 
interesting thing because it shows the
the<00:02:50.500> back<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.040> two-dollar<00:02:51.340> bill<00:02:51.670> shows<00:02:52.090> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
the back of a two-dollar bill shows the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.030 
the back of a two-dollar bill shows the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
Independence which I've always felt is

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.240 
Independence which I've always felt is
one<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.170> strangest<00:02:56.410> parties<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.099> ever
