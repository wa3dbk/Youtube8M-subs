00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.030
 very good girls very good guys and 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.080
 always all are in a new 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.240
 news of xbox 720 and is that you already know 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.210
 that in the absence of official confirmation of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 that is done by Microsoft the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.420
 announcement of his next console is rumored 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.870
 or it was said you already know that it was at the end of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 April but still nothing is known and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.570
 you know that this last week gamestop 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.149
 has talked about the playstation 4 and also 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 was going to be less than the xbox not so 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.929
 so much Paul Raines the president of the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 microsoft company 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.190
 has commented the following to some 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.819
 statements to a media outlet 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.460
 led game is the industry and I quote 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.949
 textually so as not to miss detail of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.229
 these statements are making a 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.600
 very good work we have spent a lot 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.850
 time with microsoft but we'll have to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.040
 let them take the floor in 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.350
 any case will be a console that we 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 It will be very horny and it will be very 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 competitive remember guys girls that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.469
 days ago gamestop already manifested itself in the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.950
 same line with playstation 4 and that 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.469
 it can be statements for 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.140
 increase the hype for consumers 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.479
 so you can want to work well 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.610
 sales although I believe that it is not necessary 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.009
 what is clear is that paul raines and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.500
 has seen the material that will have are and the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.109
 material that will have microsoft and that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 really will be two very good consoles 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.170
 excellent consoles so let's see 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.659
 what then direction they take so already 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.670
 you know they get horny in gamestop 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.219
 so literal because they have said literal 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.530
