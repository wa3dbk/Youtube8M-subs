00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
by three by seven from cute for you and

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.560 
by three by seven from cute for you and
in<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.709> video<00:00:13.949> I'm<00:00:14.430> going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.090> give<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.539> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
in this video I'm going to give you a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.920 
in this video I'm going to give you a
demo<00:00:15.959> solve<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.560> three<00:00:16.920> by<00:00:17.070> three<00:00:17.310> by<00:00:17.460> seven

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
demo solve of three by three by seven

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.439 
demo solve of three by three by seven
now<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:20.250> see<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.789> scrambled<00:00:21.089> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
now as you can see it's scrambled and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.519 
now as you can see it's scrambled and
I'm<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> solve<00:00:23.429> it<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.529> this

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I'm just going to solve it and this

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
I'm just going to solve it and this
puzzle<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.980> quite<00:00:26.249> old<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:27.089> two<00:00:27.660> years<00:00:27.929> now

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
puzzle is quite old it's two years now

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.159 
puzzle is quite old it's two years now
and<00:00:28.699> I'm<00:00:29.699> just<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.089> to<00:00:30.210> give<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> demo<00:00:30.839> solve

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
and I'm just going to give a demo solve

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:38.540 
and I'm just going to give a demo solve
right<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:35.660> basically<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.710> 3x3

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
right now and basically it's just a 3x3

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
right now and basically it's just a 3x3
rubik's<00:00:38.970> cube<00:00:39.530> with<00:00:41.090> with<00:00:42.090> another<00:00:43.040> extra

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
rubik's cube with with another extra

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.480 
rubik's cube with with another extra
layers<00:00:44.720> for<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.840> height<00:00:46.080> so<00:00:46.830> it's<00:00:47.100> seven

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
layers for the height so it's seven

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.810 
layers for the height so it's seven
layers<00:00:48.320> which<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.440> why<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.100> name<00:00:50.340> i<00:00:50.520> name<00:00:50.790> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
layers which is why you name i name it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.250 
layers which is why you name i name it
they<00:00:51.690> name<00:00:51.900> it<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.230> by<00:00:52.350> three<00:00:52.590> by<00:00:52.710> seven<00:00:53.090> so

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
they name it to be by three by seven so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.010 
they name it to be by three by seven so
first<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.500> i<00:00:55.800> need<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.550> turn<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.570> cube

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
first of all i need to turn this cube

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.400 
first of all i need to turn this cube
into<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.770> cuboid<00:00:59.550> shape<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.570> i<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:01.080> move

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
into the cuboid shape so i can move

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.090 
into the cuboid shape so i can move
around<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.550> inner<00:01:02.850> layers<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:04.830> can

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
around all the inner layers and i can

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.779 
around all the inner layers and i can
rearrange<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:08.009> will<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.490> fully

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
rearrange them so it will be fully

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.730 
rearrange them so it will be fully
solved<00:01:10.820> now<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:11.999> you<00:01:12.149> can<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.359> the<00:01:13.049> way<00:01:13.259> i<00:01:13.289> saw

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
solved now as you can see the way i saw

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.969 
solved now as you can see the way i saw
is<00:01:14.640> first<00:01:15.149> i'm<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> pretend<00:01:16.499> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
is first i'm just going to pretend that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
is first i'm just going to pretend that
a<00:01:17.520> three<00:01:18.060> by<00:01:18.240> three<00:01:18.270> by<00:01:18.719> three

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a three by three by three

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.649 
a three by three by three
i<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:20.189> solve<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:20.999> a<00:01:21.060> three<00:01:21.329> by<00:01:21.479> three<00:01:21.509> by

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
i just solve it like a three by three by

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.010 
i just solve it like a three by three by
three<00:01:22.079> and<00:01:22.289> i<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.399> solve<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.819> cross<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.450> i'm

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
three and i just solve the cross and i'm

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.899 
three and i just solve the cross and i'm
on<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.439> way<00:01:25.469> to<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.920> corner<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.490> second

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
on my way to the corner in the second

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.059 
on my way to the corner in the second
layer<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.390> well<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.079> I'm<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.469> to<00:01:28.590> use<00:01:28.770> I'm

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
layer as well so I'm going to use I'm

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.309 
layer as well so I'm going to use I'm
going<00:01:29.249> to<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.299> f12<00:01:30.899> method<00:01:32.329> for<00:01:33.329> some

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
going to see the f12 method for some

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.359 
going to see the f12 method for some
reason<00:01:34.889> cuz<00:01:35.249> it's<00:01:35.969> faster<00:01:36.920> yeah<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.249> I'm<00:01:38.340> just

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
reason cuz it's faster yeah so I'm just

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
reason cuz it's faster yeah so I'm just
going<00:01:38.789> to<00:01:38.850> use<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> f12<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.899> now<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.889> ll<00:01:42.200> yep

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
going to use the f12 and now they ll yep

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.169 
going to use the f12 and now they ll yep
now<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.249> if<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.639> you<00:01:44.819> can<00:01:44.999> see

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
now you can see if you can you can see

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.569 
now you can see if you can you can see
now<00:01:45.359> I<00:01:45.659> get<00:01:46.319> started<00:01:46.619> back<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:47.189> cuboid

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
now I get started back to the cuboid

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
now I get started back to the cuboid
type<00:01:49.880> yeah<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:54.289> just<00:01:55.289> turn<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.619> back<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
type yeah I just turn it back to the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.789 
type yeah I just turn it back to the
cubed<00:01:56.310> shape<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.799> now<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:59.039> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.459> do<00:01:59.639> is

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
cubed shape and now I'm going to do is

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.239 
cubed shape and now I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.279> solve<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.499> most<00:02:04.799> inner

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
I'm going to solve the the most inner

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.600 
I'm going to solve the the most inner
layer<00:02:06.139> the<00:02:07.139> inner<00:02:07.439> layer<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.859> a<00:02:07.920> small<00:02:08.280> inner

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
layer the inner layer is a small inner

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.800 
layer the inner layer is a small inner
layer<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.209> start<00:02:10.140> from<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.580> bottom<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.939> bottom

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
layer I start from the bottom at bottom

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.260 
layer I start from the bottom at bottom
corners<00:02:13.290> upper<00:02:14.280> edge<00:02:14.459> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
corners upper edge and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.410 
corners upper edge and
corners<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:17.660> we<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:18.990> I'm<00:02:19.140> solving<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
corners so we can see I'm solving the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.560 
corners so we can see I'm solving the
I'm<00:02:21.420> solving<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.900> upper<00:02:22.800> edges<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:26.570> I'm

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
I'm solving the upper edges now and I'm

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.760 
I'm solving the upper edges now and I'm
just<00:02:27.630> apply<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.670> cuboid<00:02:29.670> concept<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:31.440> solve

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
just apply the cuboid concept to solve

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.400 
just apply the cuboid concept to solve
it<00:02:31.980> based<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.000> cuboid<00:02:33.360> concept<00:02:33.840> because

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
it based on the cuboid concept because

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.900 
it based on the cuboid concept because
it's<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.680> cuboid<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.520> now<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.820> have<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.210> parity

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
it's a cuboid and now I have a parity

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.070 
it's a cuboid and now I have a parity
yeah<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.120> I'm<00:02:39.210> just<00:02:39.270> going<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.660> solve<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
yeah so I'm just going to solve the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.860 
yeah so I'm just going to solve the
parity<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.910> type<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.360> puzzle<00:02:42.600> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
parity for this type of puzzle the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.310 
parity for this type of puzzle the
cuboid<00:02:43.230> shape<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.980> puzzle<00:02:44.540> now<00:02:45.540> let<00:02:45.990> me<00:02:46.080> show

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
cuboid shape of puzzle now let me show

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.850 
cuboid shape of puzzle now let me show
you<00:02:46.380> what<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.860> meant<00:02:47.190> by<00:02:47.900> layers<00:02:48.930> seven<00:02:49.620> layers

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
you what I meant by layers seven layers

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.570 
you what I meant by layers seven layers
now<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:50.640> saw<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.240> three<00:02:52.110> layers<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
now I just saw the three layers the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.370 
now I just saw the three layers the
center<00:02:54.030> layers<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> two<00:02:55.080> inner<00:02:55.470> layers

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
center layers and the two inner layers

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.590 
center layers and the two inner layers
you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.560> see<00:02:58.800> now<00:02:58.980> yeah<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.730> rearranged<00:03:00.420> it

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
you can see now yeah I rearranged it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.810 
you can see now yeah I rearranged it
already<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.200> now<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.460> rearrange<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
already and now I have to rearrange the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.560 
already and now I have to rearrange the
needs<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.960> both<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> layer<00:03:07.920> there<00:03:08.570> so

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
needs the the both of the layer there so

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.380 
needs the the both of the layer there so
I'm<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:09.990> start<00:03:10.370> inside<00:03:11.370> out<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.910> it's

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
I'm going to start inside out and it's

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.350 
I'm going to start inside out and it's
just<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.750> solve<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.140> inside<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.850> just

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
just to solve it inside out and I just

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.670 
just to solve it inside out and I just
finished<00:03:15.990> solved<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.970> inner<00:03:18.110> part<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.440> and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
finished solved the inner part of it and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.310 
finished solved the inner part of it and
now<00:03:20.130> I'm<00:03:20.160> going<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.670> solve<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.690> outer<00:03:21.870> part

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
now I'm going to solve it the outer part

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.890 
now I'm going to solve it the outer part
of<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.560> layers<00:03:23.330> now<00:03:24.330> I'm<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.660> going<00:03:24.870> to

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
of the layers now I'm just going to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.660 
of the layers now I'm just going to
apply<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> same<00:03:25.770> concept<00:03:26.610> same<00:03:27.410> algorithm

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
apply the same concept same algorithm

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:37.510 
apply the same concept same algorithm
algorithm<00:03:29.670> yeah<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:32.300> just<00:03:33.300> solved<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:36.140> the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
algorithm yeah I just solved the the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.740 
algorithm yeah I just solved the the
corner<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:42.060> now<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.750> can<00:03:43.050> see<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:44.360> need<00:03:45.360> to

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
corner and and now you can see I need to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.100 
corner and and now you can see I need to
solve<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:47.330> upper<00:03:48.330> edges<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.840> upper

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
solve the the upper edges and upper

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.570 
solve the the upper edges and upper
corners<00:03:49.880> for<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.970> inner<00:03:51.240> pieces<00:03:52.020> of<00:03:52.200> layers

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
corners for the inner pieces of layers

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.800 
corners for the inner pieces of layers
still<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.730> inner<00:03:53.880> one<00:03:55.550> yep<00:03:58.700> so<00:03:59.700> this<00:04:00.390> puzzle

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
still the inner one yep so this puzzle

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.830 
still the inner one yep so this puzzle
is<00:04:00.930> quite<00:04:01.230> rare<00:04:01.560> two<00:04:01.890> years<00:04:02.100> ago<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.690> took

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
is quite rare two years ago and it took

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.050 
is quite rare two years ago and it took
me<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.050> lot<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.380> quite<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:04.980> lot<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.250> time<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.790> solve

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
me a lot of quite a lot of time to solve

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.080 
me a lot of quite a lot of time to solve
it<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.750> find<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.140> solution<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.820> play

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
it to find the solution for that to play

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.520 
it to find the solution for that to play
around<00:04:09.330> with<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.810> find<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.110> solution<00:04:10.350> for

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
around with it and find a solution for

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.240 
around with it and find a solution for
that<00:04:10.770> but<00:04:11.520> yeah<00:04:12.360> it's<00:04:12.959> pretty<00:04:13.230> damn<00:04:13.650> easy<00:04:13.830> for

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
that but yeah it's pretty damn easy for

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.430 
that but yeah it's pretty damn easy for
now<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:14.880> if<00:04:15.630> you<00:04:15.840> understand<00:04:16.350> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
now because if you understand the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.650 
now because if you understand the
concept<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.950> puzzle<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.640> will<00:04:17.820> get<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.120> and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
concept just puzzle you will get it and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.229 
concept just puzzle you will get it and
now<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.410> can<00:04:19.560> see<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.430> solve<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.060> outer

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
now you can see you solve the outer

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.270 
now you can see you solve the outer
layers<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:23.030> rearranged<00:04:24.030> them<00:04:24.300> all<00:04:24.600> green<00:04:25.410> red

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
layers I rearranged them all green red

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.480 
layers I rearranged them all green red
and<00:04:27.110> all<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.590> them<00:04:28.770> are<00:04:28.979> we

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
and all of them are we

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.219 
and all of them are we
range<00:04:29.699> back<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.330> I'm<00:04:30.539> going<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.810> stop<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
range back and I'm going to stop the

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.070 
range back and I'm going to stop the
last<00:04:31.440> two<00:04:31.889> layers<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.610> outer<00:04:32.789> pose<00:04:33.419> part<00:04:33.870> of

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
last two layers the outer pose part of

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.620 
last two layers the outer pose part of
the<00:04:34.289> layers<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:35.099> puzzle<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.580> I'm<00:04:39.300> going<00:04:39.599> to

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
the layers the puzzle so I'm going to

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.330 
the layers the puzzle so I'm going to
start<00:04:40.080> with<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.349> edges<00:04:40.680> then<00:04:44.000> now<00:04:45.530> after<00:04:46.530> I've

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
start with the edges then now after I've

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
start with the edges then now after I've
solved<00:04:47.759> the<00:04:47.940> edges<00:04:49.160> I'm<00:04:50.160> going<00:04:50.819> to<00:04:50.970> stop<00:04:51.210> the

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
solved the edges I'm going to stop the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.990 
solved the edges I'm going to stop the
corners<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:54.349> in<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.500> few<00:04:55.800> seconds<00:04:56.520> I'm<00:04:56.729> going

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
corners and in a few seconds I'm going

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.559 
corners and in a few seconds I'm going
to<00:04:57.180> skip<00:04:57.889> skip<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:59.130> I'm<00:04:59.759> going<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.150> skip<00:05:00.389> this

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
to skip skip it I'm going to skip this

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.779 
to skip skip it I'm going to skip this
the<00:05:00.960> rest<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.889> soul<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:03.630> I'm<00:05:04.259> just<00:05:04.789> finish

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
the rest of the soul and I'm just finish

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.140 
the rest of the soul and I'm just finish
it<00:05:05.940> off<00:05:06.530> okay<00:05:07.530> because<00:05:07.860> all<00:05:08.280> of<00:05:08.370> them<00:05:08.789> just<00:05:09.030> the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
it off okay because all of them just the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.779 
it off okay because all of them just the
same<00:05:09.270> concept<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.680> I'll<00:05:11.069> just<00:05:11.280> finish<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.669> off

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
same concept and I'll just finish it off

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:12.350 
same concept and I'll just finish it off
now

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
now

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.930 
now
and<00:05:13.819> here<00:05:14.819> you<00:05:14.940> go<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.770> just<00:05:16.770> solved<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.490> three

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
and here you go I just solved the three

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.309 
and here you go I just solved the three
by<00:05:18.120> three<00:05:18.449> by<00:05:18.479> seven<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.669> it<00:05:20.669> solved<00:05:21.319> this

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
by three by seven and it solved this

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.149 
by three by seven and it solved this
