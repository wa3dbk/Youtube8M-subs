00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:44.630 
was pretty much a mere polished edge on
there<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.330> not<00:02:33.330> perfectly<00:02:33.900> mirrored

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520 

so<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.270> really<00:02:45.450> kind<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.810> stinks<00:02:46.080> having<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.410> do

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
so it really kind of stinks having to do

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.940 
so it really kind of stinks having to do
this<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.020> say<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> got<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> whole<00:02:49.770> bunch

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
this but like I say I got a whole bunch

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.820 
this but like I say I got a whole bunch
of<00:02:50.130> stuff<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.520> want<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.760> buy<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:52.350> will<00:02:52.620> give<00:02:52.800> me
