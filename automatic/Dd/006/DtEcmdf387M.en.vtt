change anything else yeah take a look at
the<00:02:34.489> pictures<00:02:34.849> because<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.269> see<00:02:35.569> very

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
the pictures because you can see very

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.870 
the pictures because you can see very
clearly<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.920> difference<00:02:37.400> she<00:02:37.670> might<00:02:37.849> be

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
clearly the difference she might be

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.610 
clearly the difference she might be
clenching<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.540> little<00:02:38.750> bit<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.080> first<00:02:39.230> one

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
clenching a little bit in the first one

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.490 
clenching a little bit in the first one
sometimes<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.549> looks<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:40.970> yes<00:02:41.569> yes<00:02:41.780> but<00:02:42.380> you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
sometimes it looks like yes yes but you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.380 
sometimes it looks like yes yes but you
can<00:02:42.709> see<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.130> it's<00:02:43.250> much<00:02:43.489> more<00:02:43.700> contoured<00:02:44.209> in

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
can see that it's much more contoured in

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.850 
can see that it's much more contoured in
the<00:02:44.420> after<00:02:44.840> picture<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.680> see<00:02:45.830> a

the after picture so you can see a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.380 
the after picture so you can see a
really<00:02:46.250> good<00:02:46.400> difference<00:02:46.820> there<00:02:47.090> that's

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
really good difference there that's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.240 
really good difference there that's
really<00:02:47.660> good<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.079> also<00:02:48.440> that's<00:02:48.650> not<00:02:48.950> invasive

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
really good and also that's not invasive

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.620 
really good and also that's not invasive

of shoes and hopefully holding yourself

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.400 
of shoes and hopefully holding yourself
better<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:52.940> well<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.870> don't<00:02:54.019> walking

are called fit flops and they have
something<00:03:05.660> you'll<00:03:05.870> love<00:03:06.049> this<00:03:06.200> called<00:03:06.530> micro

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
something you'll love this called micro

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.770 
something you'll love this called micro
wobble<00:03:07.280> board<00:03:07.459> technology<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.420> course<00:03:08.540> they

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
wobble board technology of course they

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.849 
wobble board technology of course they
do<00:03:08.900> yeah<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.310> these<00:03:10.940> are<00:03:11.150> gained<00:03:11.389> contoured<00:03:12.049> so

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
do yeah so these are gained contoured so

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.379 
do yeah so these are gained contoured so
it's<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.160> way<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.489> it's<00:03:13.549> holding<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.090> feet

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:15.910 
it's the way that it's holding the feet
the<00:03:14.720> way<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.079> then<00:03:15.230> you're<00:03:15.500> holding

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
the way that then you're holding

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.979 
the way that then you're holding
yourself<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.519> them<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.359> is<00:03:17.420> really<00:03:17.810> kind

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
yourself in them so this is really kind

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.870 
yourself in them so this is really kind
of<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.170> summer<00:03:18.410> alternative<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.489> wanted

same<00:03:37.940> kind<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.269> tipping<00:03:38.690> effect<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.889> the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
same kind of tipping effect that the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.770 
same kind of tipping effect that the
Chung<00:03:40.220> cheese<00:03:40.459> did<00:03:40.670> they<00:03:40.790> don't<00:03:41.030> quite<00:03:41.329> but
