00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.480
 so people today had something completely new 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.680
 I do not have to go in that way, too 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.389
 I have never confessed honestly 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.880
 made because he is so I think 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:18.600
 rather direction bodybuilding prevented 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 Standing barbell row the technique 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.449
 please do not imitate because yourself 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 I do not have that much experience yet 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.660
 the exercise i do a name crew then 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.429
 So first only watch if 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.399
 People are the ones out of money 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.050
 you would have to give me some tips 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.570
 this is not an educational video but 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.579
 really a self-experiment for the first 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 25 times the big ones sounded the pole 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.480
 and then again five slices from 100 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.239
 are 70 kilos 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 I worked my way up with ten 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.879
 kilo times 12 20 km 12 30 kilo times 12 and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.710
 so on and so on always a tenth 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.649
 paced with twelve repetitions 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 there is also an exercise so i would 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.770
 we are more likely to say direction 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.480
 Bodybuilding does not mean too much 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.810
 weight but something more 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.970
 repetitions also put why because 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 it is easy to bend over like 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.820
 The position can not be said yet 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820
 improve 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.360
 the knees should be stable slightly 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.159
 I would just say something more 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.299
 to grab as knee wide and then the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.340
 Stange I say direction between 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.049
 belly button and chest and where to 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 keep pulling and therefore that 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.400
 one has this position is something dangerous 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.700
 for the back there not necessarily now 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.030
 Pack 200 kilo on it or so slowly 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.960
 high work so now enough babble 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.960
 embarrass a round now 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.769
 As I said, I do not think so now 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.790
 absolutely one hundred percent correct 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.959
 has expired when people are there 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.069
 to know a bit already 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.349
 few tips will be asked in any case 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.389
 I 've never had the exercise myself 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:06.519
 made here today for the first time 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:22.129
 decide company and in there 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:31.750
 25 from this normal translucent good comes the 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:34.819
 First of all a human being as I said 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.720
 not necessarily now 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.400
 imitate 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.859
 you can go to the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.190
 comments read a few people 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.019
 He is so bodybuilding 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.479
 make direction and exercise more often 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.370
 make a little bit of knowledge since couple 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.470
 give tips 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.870
 yes, I think I 'll still 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.530
 increase ten times twenty kilos 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.629
 but continue that should times as 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.859
 first try you were, so to speak 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.519
 you do not want too much now either 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.430
 weight take it somehow that way 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.419
 and rough clean you have to video 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.680
 not too long 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.590
 as it would be cool if you have a few 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.389
 tips dallas guys like i said 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.340
 even two if you look crucified 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.989
 the first videos I made 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.259
 something with a cross I believe 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.229
 110 kilo occasion or 100 110 somehow 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.449
 so we have to watch my first one 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.430
 Try to be funny too 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.800
 Apart from that, check out some of them 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.110
 older videos on are some funny things 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.400
 In any case, I have but 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.380
 Nevertheless , I put it in anyway 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.120
 not to the variety as always up to 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.710
 train for perfection or until 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.270
 is going to create heavy weight someday 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.620
 and then only put the things in 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.870
 but I think so too 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.820
 interesting as I said now if you 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.680
 the first time something does synonymous if 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.260
 so funny or funny looks like that 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.840
 circus clown moderately wrong versions 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.190
 Whatever comes online as I said 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.350
 the adolescents are not necessarily 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.699
 imitate but wait until I am 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.139
 I also improved with the technology 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.889
 and then maybe you can 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.500
 what to watch 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.240
 ok thanks for watching i will also like 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.340
 said the days go to the gym 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.510
 Do some new exercises again 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.160
 I have not done so far 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.260
 my youtube channel must be back 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.550
 come forward and I do not have you 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.289
