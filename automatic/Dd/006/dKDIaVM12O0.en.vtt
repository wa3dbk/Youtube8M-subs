00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
say but let's try and get on with it and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.910 
say but let's try and get on with it and
so<00:02:25.769> first<00:02:26.099> indeed<00:02:26.340> put<00:02:26.489> off<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.700> gum<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.769> about

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
so first indeed put off of gum so about

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.589 
so first indeed put off of gum so about
the<00:02:29.010> camera<00:02:29.340> angles<00:02:29.580> son's<00:02:29.819> blaring<00:02:30.420> through

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
the camera angles son's blaring through

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.070 
the camera angles son's blaring through
window<00:02:31.640> right<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.330> first<00:02:33.480> thing<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.959> tells

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
window right so the first thing it tells

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.690 
window right so the first thing it tells
you<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.349> do<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.890> filed<00:02:35.099> away<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.280> lining<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
you to do we filed away the lining it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.490 
you to do we filed away the lining it
first<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.209> fold<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:38.150> hold<00:02:39.150> them<00:02:39.269> in

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
first you just fold it up hold them in

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.800 
first you just fold it up hold them in
and<00:02:40.500> then<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.220> take<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.790> front<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.660> front

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and then you take this front the front

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.150 
and then you take this front the front
part<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.700> fold<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.120> back<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.709> pegs<00:02:49.980> in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
part and fold it back like so it pegs in

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.759 
part and fold it back like so it pegs in
a<00:02:50.250> little<00:02:50.489> bit<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.730> thing<00:02:51.000> yeah<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.690> goes<00:02:52.560> in

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
a little bit of thing yeah this goes in

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.339 
a little bit of thing yeah this goes in
a<00:02:52.829> little<00:02:53.069> clip<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.430> holds<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.849> in<00:02:53.970> place<00:02:54.349> so

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
a little clip that holds it in place so

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.039 
a little clip that holds it in place so
you<00:02:55.379> got<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:55.950> position<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.930> you

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
you got it in this position then you

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.839 
you got it in this position then you
spin<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.470> baby<00:02:58.769> around<00:02:59.010> and<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.700> unpack<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
spin this baby around and you unpack the

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.270 
spin this baby around and you unpack the
arms<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.959> tells<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.379> these<00:03:04.560> structures<00:03:04.980> to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
arms it tells you these structures to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.970 
arms it tells you these structures to
hold<00:03:05.459> them<00:03:05.640> up<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:05.970> for<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
hold them up like this for now this is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.940 
hold them up like this for now this is
so<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:09.379> separate<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.500> leg<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
so that you can separate the leg and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.400 
so that you can separate the leg and
pull<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.190> down<00:03:12.799> click<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.069> then<00:03:15.139> you<00:03:16.139> get<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
pull it down click so then you get the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.890 
pull it down click so then you get the
foot<00:03:16.680> open<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.549> push<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.510> bit<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
foot open it up push the little bit of a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.259 
foot open it up push the little bit of a
heel<00:03:19.109> out<00:03:19.459> foot<00:03:20.569> he'll<00:03:22.730> straighten<00:03:23.730> them<00:03:23.910> then

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
heel out foot he'll straighten them then

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.720 
heel out foot he'll straighten them then
this<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.139> good<00:03:25.590> thing<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.950> push<00:03:26.190> up<00:03:26.489> on

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
this is the good thing you push up on

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.170 
this is the good thing you push up on
the<00:03:26.790> legs<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.299> waist<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.910> get<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
sound effect of the transformation and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.589 
sound effect of the transformation and
his<00:03:32.250> eyes<00:03:32.459> light<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:35.299> pretty<00:03:36.299> cool-looking

even click in but they still are not

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.220 
even click in but they still are not
quite<00:04:10.739> good<00:04:11.489> enough<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:12.450> stay<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:13.019> know<00:04:13.139> you

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
quite good enough to stay you know you

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.759 
quite good enough to stay you know you
stay<00:04:13.410> at<00:04:13.470> least<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:13.889> very<00:04:14.190> well<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.519> just

stay at least and very well it just
right<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.039> let's<00:04:17.760> get<00:04:17.909> on<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.030> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
right so let's get on with the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.020 
right so let's get on with the
differences<00:04:18.690> move<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.799> their<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.190> some

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
differences move it to their to some

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.670 
differences move it to their to some
stop<00:04:21.780> smoking<00:04:22.079> right<00:04:22.410> right<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.350> don't

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
stop smoking right right and I don't

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.260 
stop smoking right right and I don't
know<00:04:25.800> too<00:04:25.860> much<00:04:26.130> about<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.610> original<00:04:26.790> but

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
know too much about the original but

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.190 
know too much about the original but
this<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.320> nicer<00:04:28.740> red<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.389> it's<00:04:30.389> it's<00:04:30.690> you

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
this is a nicer red and it's it's you

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.040 
this is a nicer red and it's it's you
know<00:04:31.320> it's<00:04:31.350> really<00:04:32.040> nice<00:04:32.310> red<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:33.630> noticed

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
know it's really nice red and I noticed

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.440 
know it's really nice red and I noticed
on<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.230> box<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:35.040> these<00:04:35.310> inner<00:04:35.790> bits<00:04:36.150> here

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
on the box that these inner bits here

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.240 
on the box that these inner bits here
are<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:37.230> different<00:04:37.740> color<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.150> red<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
are a different color to the red on the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.720 
are a different color to the red on the
American<00:04:41.250> version<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:43.470> know<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.520> said

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
American version you know I like I said

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.060 
American version you know I like I said
I<00:04:44.760> can't<00:04:45.000> tear<00:04:45.210> Zach<00:04:45.450> differences<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.080> don't

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
I can't tear Zach differences I don't
