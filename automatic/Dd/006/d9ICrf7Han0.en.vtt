and<00:00:47.780> I'll<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:49.200> through<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> second<00:00:49.920> but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and I'll go through that in a second but

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.470 
and I'll go through that in a second but
let's<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> look<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> construction<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
let's take a look at the construction to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
let's take a look at the construction to
begin<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.140> we've<00:00:52.289> got<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.829> sturdy

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
begin with so we've got very very sturdy

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.779 
begin with so we've got very very sturdy
very<00:00:53.610> nicely<00:00:54.149> designed<00:00:55.340> earpieces<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.640> these

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
very nicely designed earpieces and these

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.340 
very nicely designed earpieces and these
looked<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> lot<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.660> normal<00:00:57.750> Bluetooth

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
looked a lot like a normal Bluetooth

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.810 
looked a lot like a normal Bluetooth
headset<00:00:58.949> would<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> took<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.730> away

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
headset would do if you took one away

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
headset would do if you took one away
this<00:01:00.539> may<00:01:00.719> look<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:00.930> bit<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this may look a little bit like the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.720 
this may look a little bit like the
Plantronics<00:01:01.800> Voyager<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.460> you'd<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
microphone piece coming out but in this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.899 
microphone piece coming out but in this
we<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> microphone<00:01:05.189> there<00:01:05.670> on

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
we have to have a microphone there on

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.859 
we have to have a microphone there on
the<00:01:06.030> front<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.070> fully<00:01:08.729> adjustable<00:01:08.869> this
