00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.550 
the numbers I hear things like 35 to 105
I<00:02:03.869> hear<00:02:04.380> things<00:02:04.590> 28<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.850> 280<00:02:06.689> all<00:02:07.049> these<00:02:07.259> things

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
I hear things 28 to 280 all these things

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.639 
I hear things 28 to 280 all these things
and<00:02:07.799> these<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.459> known<00:02:08.819> as<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.119> zoo

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
and these would be known as the zoo

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.920 
and these would be known as the zoo
range<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.879> just<00:02:11.060> want<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.269> explain<00:02:11.629> where

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
range and I just want to explain where

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.470 
range and I just want to explain where
those<00:02:12.110> numbers<00:02:12.470> are<00:02:12.620> drive<00:02:12.860> from<00:02:13.159> again<00:02:13.970> as<00:02:14.239> I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
those numbers are drive from again as I

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.509 
those numbers are drive from again as I
mentioned<00:02:14.510> earlier<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.470> zoom<00:02:15.829> lens<00:02:15.860> really

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
mentioned earlier the zoom lens really

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.089 
mentioned earlier the zoom lens really
became<00:02:16.909> popular<00:02:17.629> with<00:02:17.840> 35<00:02:18.590> millimeter<00:02:19.010> film

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
became popular with 35 millimeter film

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.420 
became popular with 35 millimeter film
cameras<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:21.230> numbers<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.709> people<00:02:22.250> got

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
cameras and the numbers that people got

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.520 
cameras and the numbers that people got
used<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.970> were<00:02:23.329> referred<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.110> focal

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
used to were referred to the focal

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.550 
used to were referred to the focal
length<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:25.549> those<00:02:25.879> lenses<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.109> when<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:27.409> talk

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
length of those lenses so when we talk

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.860 
length of those lenses so when we talk
about<00:02:27.620> focal<00:02:28.310> lengths<00:02:28.609> on<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.819> digital<00:02:29.629> camera

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
about focal lengths on a digital camera

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.869 
about focal lengths on a digital camera
we<00:02:30.170> actually<00:02:30.590> convert<00:02:31.519> them<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.730> a

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
we actually convert them to a

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.539 
we actually convert them to a
35-millimeter<00:02:32.659> equivalent<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.310> without

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
35-millimeter equivalent so without

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.580 
35-millimeter equivalent so without
worrying<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.299> much<00:02:35.329> about<00:02:35.569> what<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.379> number

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
worrying so much about what that number

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.770 
worrying so much about what that number
means<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:37.370> why<00:02:37.489> did<00:02:37.670> they<00:02:37.790> convert<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.299> 35

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
means and why did they convert it to 35

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.170 
means and why did they convert it to 35
millimeter<00:02:39.170> equivalency<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.970> want<00:02:41.120> to

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
millimeter equivalency I just want to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.879 
millimeter equivalency I just want to
focus<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> couple<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.170> basics<00:02:42.650> when<00:02:42.799> you

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
focus on a couple of basics when you

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.720 
focus on a couple of basics when you
hear<00:02:43.159> these<00:02:43.280> numbers<00:02:43.730> 35<00:02:44.329> 100<00:02:45.170> 200<00:02:45.709> when<00:02:46.579> you

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
hear these numbers 35 100 200 when you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.449 
hear these numbers 35 100 200 when you
think<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.269> 50<00:02:47.780> millimeter<00:02:47.959> lens<00:02:48.470> what<00:02:49.340> you

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
think of a 50 millimeter lens what you

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.839 
think of a 50 millimeter lens what you
should<00:02:49.519> think<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.299> a<00:02:51.310> lens<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.579> sees

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
should think of is a lens that sees

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.449 
should think of is a lens that sees
roughly<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.599> same<00:02:53.810> perspective<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.739> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
roughly the same perspective as the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.490 
roughly the same perspective as the
human<00:02:55.790> eye<00:02:55.939> sight<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.930> if<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.109> look<00:02:57.290> through<00:02:57.319> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
human eye sight so if I look through a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.860 
human eye sight so if I look through a
50<00:02:57.829> millimeter<00:02:57.980> lens<00:02:58.430> something<00:02:59.420> looks<00:02:59.629> just

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
50 millimeter lens something looks just

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.750 
50 millimeter lens something looks just
as<00:02:59.989> far<00:03:00.230> away<00:03:00.349> as<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.709> does<00:03:00.889> in<00:03:00.920> real<00:03:01.159> life<00:03:01.549> to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
as far away as it does in real life to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.470 
as far away as it does in real life to
me<00:03:01.879> okay<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.859> I<00:03:04.069> know<00:03:04.129> that<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:05.180> number

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
me okay so if I know that and the number

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.119 
me okay so if I know that and the number
gets<00:03:05.629> smaller<00:03:05.989> let's<00:03:06.319> say<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.500> have<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> 28

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
gets smaller let's say I have a 28

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.979 
gets smaller let's say I have a 28
millimeter<00:03:07.549> lens<00:03:07.760> well<00:03:08.329> what<00:03:08.480> happens<00:03:08.840> when

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
millimeter lens well what happens when

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.349 
millimeter lens well what happens when
the<00:03:09.079> number<00:03:09.349> is<00:03:09.379> smaller<00:03:09.920> than<00:03:10.159> 50<00:03:10.579> is<00:03:10.760> that

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
the number is smaller than 50 is that

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.309 
the number is smaller than 50 is that
the<00:03:11.989> angle<00:03:12.859> of<00:03:12.980> view<00:03:13.159> widens<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.000> my<00:03:14.810> subjects

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
the angle of view widens and my subjects

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.860 
the angle of view widens and my subjects
get<00:03:15.440> pushed<00:03:15.769> further<00:03:16.040> away<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.359> the<00:03:17.660> lens

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
get pushed further away and so the lens

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.900 
get pushed further away and so the lens
a<00:03:18.049> wide<00:03:18.319> angle<00:03:18.530> lens<00:03:18.919> so<00:03:19.099> anything<00:03:19.489> lower<00:03:19.790> than

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
a wide angle lens so anything lower than

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.990 
a wide angle lens so anything lower than
50<00:03:20.599> millimeter<00:03:21.500> equivalent<00:03:22.069> is<00:03:22.220> technically

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
50 millimeter equivalent is technically

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.539 
50 millimeter equivalent is technically
getting<00:03:23.389> wider<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.870> wider<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.379> wider<00:03:24.650> as<00:03:25.040> you

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
getting wider and wider and wider as you

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.339 
getting wider and wider and wider as you
go<00:03:25.669> lower<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.060> lower<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.510> lower<00:03:26.659> now

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
go lower and lower and lower now

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.039 
go lower and lower and lower now
conversely<00:03:27.889> to<00:03:28.129> that<00:03:28.419> when<00:03:29.419> I<00:03:29.449> have<00:03:29.629> a<00:03:29.659> 50

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
conversely to that when I have a 50

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.869 
conversely to that when I have a 50
millimeter<00:03:30.199> lens<00:03:30.650> again<00:03:31.099> that<00:03:31.340> starts<00:03:31.730> with

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
millimeter lens again that starts with

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.750 
millimeter lens again that starts with
my<00:03:32.090> normal<00:03:32.840> naked<00:03:33.199> eye<00:03:33.319> perspective<00:03:33.829> when<00:03:34.730> I

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
my normal naked eye perspective when I

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.000 
my normal naked eye perspective when I
start<00:03:35.060> going<00:03:35.209> higher<00:03:35.720> than<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.199> I<00:03:36.470> get

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
start going higher than that I get

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.399 
start going higher than that I get
narrower<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.849> my<00:03:38.329> subject<00:03:38.780> gets<00:03:38.989> compressed

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
narrower and my subject gets compressed

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.050 
narrower and my subject gets compressed
or<00:03:39.769> brings<00:03:39.979> in<00:03:40.159> closer<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.669> me<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:40.849> that's

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
or brings in closer to me and that's

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.059 
or brings in closer to me and that's
referred<00:03:41.479> to<00:03:41.690> as<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> telephoto<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:43.449> really

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
referred to as a telephoto so really

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.649 
referred to as a telephoto so really
when<00:03:46.069> we<00:03:46.159> talk<00:03:46.370> about<00:03:46.400> 35<00:03:47.239> millimeter

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
when we talk about 35 millimeter

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:48.819 
when we talk about 35 millimeter
equivalents<00:03:48.109> just<00:03:48.260> remember<00:03:48.620> everything

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
equivalents just remember everything

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.939 
equivalents just remember everything
below<00:03:49.220> 50<00:03:49.699> wide-angle<00:03:50.690> everything<00:03:51.290> above<00:03:51.530> 50

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
below 50 wide-angle everything above 50

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.000 
below 50 wide-angle everything above 50
telephoto<00:03:52.729> the<00:03:53.389> extent<00:03:54.049> of<00:03:54.229> that<00:03:54.319> number

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
telephoto the extent of that number

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.189 
telephoto the extent of that number
would<00:03:55.190> say<00:03:55.609> well<00:03:55.790> how<00:03:56.000> wide<00:03:56.329> angle<00:03:56.720> is<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.049> or

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
would say well how wide angle is it or

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.339 
would say well how wide angle is it or

how telephoto is it the other numbers
that<00:04:01.040> we<00:04:01.159> have<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.549> think<00:04:01.760> about<00:04:01.940> with<00:04:02.239> zooms

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
that we have to think about with zooms

five times five times low for me I mean
if<00:04:17.040> we<00:04:17.280> equate<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.510> back<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.050> to<00:04:19.650> 35mm

equivalent<00:04:20.790> see<00:04:21.360> I<00:04:21.390> assume<00:04:21.990> that<00:04:22.260> a

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
equivalent see I assume that a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.160 
equivalent see I assume that a
three-time<00:04:23.270> zoom<00:04:24.270> camera<00:04:24.690> like<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:24.870> one

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
three-time zoom camera like this one

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.060 
three-time zoom camera like this one
here<00:04:25.640> you<00:04:26.640> know<00:04:26.760> ranges<00:04:27.060> from<00:04:27.150> 35<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.720> 105<00:04:28.470> and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
here you know ranges from 35 to 105 and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.700 
here you know ranges from 35 to 105 and
if<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.220> guess<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.670> divide<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.240> number<00:04:30.440> 105<00:04:31.440> by

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
if I guess I divide that number 105 by

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.700 
if I guess I divide that number 105 by
35<00:04:32.640> I<00:04:32.850> would<00:04:32.970> get<00:04:33.120> three<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.840> that's<00:04:34.110> three

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
35 I would get three and that's three

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.290 
35 I would get three and that's three
times<00:04:34.740> exactly<00:04:35.580> where<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:35.790> get<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.060> number

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
times exactly where to get that number

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.600 
times exactly where to get that number
so<00:04:36.810> whatever<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.590> most<00:04:38.040> telephoto

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
so whatever the the most telephoto

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.700 
so whatever the the most telephoto
setting<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.420> lens<00:04:39.570> divide<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.290> divide

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
setting is on the lens divide it divide

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.920 
setting is on the lens divide it divide
it<00:04:40.890> rather<00:04:41.070> by<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.430> most<00:04:41.790> wide<00:04:42.120> angle<00:04:42.570> setting

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
it rather by the most wide angle setting

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.890 
it rather by the most wide angle setting
and<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.530> will<00:04:43.710> get<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.980> your<00:04:44.010> 3<00:04:44.460> x<00:04:44.700> 5<00:04:45.060> x<00:04:45.330> 10<00:04:45.690> x

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
and that will get you your 3 x 5 x 10 x

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.550 
and that will get you your 3 x 5 x 10 x
number<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:47.270> essentially<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.450> three-time<00:04:49.200> zoom

on how strong of a zoom you absolutely

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.370 
on how strong of a zoom you absolutely
don't<00:05:11.820> take<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.090> look<00:05:12.240> at<00:05:12.330> one<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:12.480> these<00:05:12.660> three

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
don't take a look at one of these three

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.620 
don't take a look at one of these three
times<00:05:13.650> room<00:05:13.860> cameras<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.550> we<00:05:14.640> have<00:05:14.850> here's<00:05:15.540> a

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
times room cameras that we have here's a

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.440 
times room cameras that we have here's a
status<00:05:16.140> shot<00:05:16.410> let's<00:05:17.100> shot<00:05:17.460> at<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.610> widest

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
status shot let's shot at the widest

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.570 
status shot let's shot at the widest
angle<00:05:18.630> possible<00:05:18.990> right<00:05:19.380> camera<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:19.950> here's

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
angle possible right camera and here's

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.970 
angle possible right camera and here's
its<00:05:21.030> equivalent<00:05:21.570> three<00:05:22.020> times<00:05:22.260> zoom<00:05:22.500> okay<00:05:22.920> so

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
its equivalent three times zoom okay so

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.950 
its equivalent three times zoom okay so
I'm<00:05:23.220> bringing<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.610> subject<00:05:24.030> in<00:05:24.240> I'm<00:05:24.630> going<00:05:24.900> to

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
I'm bringing the subject in I'm going to

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.630 
I'm bringing the subject in I'm going to
say<00:05:25.170> a<00:05:25.200> little<00:05:25.560> bit<00:05:25.740> closer<00:05:26.040> with<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.340> three

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
say a little bit closer with a three

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.400 
say a little bit closer with a three
times<00:05:26.880> yes<00:05:27.060> so<00:05:27.420> let's<00:05:27.630> talk<00:05:27.810> about<00:05:27.870> something

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
times yes so let's talk about something

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.260 
times yes so let's talk about something
more<00:05:28.560> powerful<00:05:28.860> then<00:05:29.280> okay<00:05:29.760> we<00:05:29.910> have<00:05:30.030> another

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
more powerful then okay we have another

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.080 
more powerful then okay we have another
camera<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.870> can<00:05:31.050> range<00:05:31.260> up<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.610> 10<00:05:32.610> times<00:05:32.880> you

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
camera that can range up to 10 times you

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.600 
camera that can range up to 10 times you
myself<00:05:33.360> in<00:05:33.660> particular<00:05:34.110> camera<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:35.280> goes<00:05:35.490> to

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
myself in particular camera it goes to

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.240 
myself in particular camera it goes to
about<00:05:35.700> 270<00:05:36.480> millimeters<00:05:37.020> equivalent<00:05:37.770> to<00:05:37.860> 35

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
about 270 millimeters equivalent to 35

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.680 
about 270 millimeters equivalent to 35
right<00:05:38.520> let's<00:05:38.760> see<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:38.940> picture<00:05:39.210> with<00:05:39.510> that

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
right let's see a picture with that
