00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
for quite a while we've been pushing her

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.890 
for quite a while we've been pushing her
so<00:05:16.199> hard

so hard
haven't<00:05:18.900> been<00:05:19.020> taking<00:05:19.319> good<00:05:19.500> enough<00:05:19.710> care<00:05:20.009> of
