Hi, my name's Rebecca Gill and I'm here representing the Advertiser.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.110
Hi I'm Tom Baxter from the Zoo.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.160
Phil Morton, managing partner of Morton Phillips, parent group for MPS People Solutions,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.180
proud sponsor of tonight's event

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.210
UniSA Network Now.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.230
Lots of people were talking about it, especially the lecturers.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.260
This is the second time I'm attending it, I attended Network Now last year as well.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.280
It's a good opportunity to network and meet new people.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.740
This is the best opportunity for me to network with different people here.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.760
I actually won a competition from UniSA.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.780
I actually won it on the CareerShop.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.590
I was one of the winners for the highschools.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.970
My son came to one of the careers expos or careers days

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.990
for the business marketing and communication course

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.030
and of course he's applied for that, but he went into a competition

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.040
which he was one of four, I think four students,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.270
who actually won.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.300
I have listed a couple of questions before I attend this networking session

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.320
so I've got like one week to prepare those questions and hopefully I'll get

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.110
my answers to those questions.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.140
Last year I was not at all prepared as in, you know, how to talk to the experts

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160
and how to get their guidelines, but this time I've got a fair bit of an idea, you know.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.190
I know what I'm doing, I know what my expertise are and I know

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.210
you know, how to meet, how to greet and

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.230
how to actually talk regarding the right stuff at the right time.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.260
I'm hoping like I'll meet new people, looking at the profile I found

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.300
like pretty interesting. They have pretty good experience, would like to share

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.330
some of their thoughts about how they have achieved this place

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.350
after so many years and I would like to get some motivation from them.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.370
I just want to familiarise with many of the people I've just seen on the TV

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.380
and I've just heard of them so I would like to really meet them.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
I'm hoping to get a lot of experience from this

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.410
learn what to do and what not to do in a professional setting

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.430
and maybe get a few contacts, that would be good.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.450
I'm hoping to get a job, realistic, and then on top of that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.460
I'm looking for the experts advice to apply

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.500
in my life basically, you know.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.520
Just maybe get some business connections before I even enter so I'm a step ahead of everyone.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.540
Don't turn it into a social event. Have a set agenda

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.550
of what you actually want to achieve and what you want to get out of the night.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.570
Target specific industries or people from particular industries.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.600
Have your list of questions that you want to ask them.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.630
But also more importantly, have a list of benefits that

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.650
you could actually help those potential businesses or organisations

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.670
that you're hoping to get into. Coming prepared and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.690
having your ammunition just helps tremendously to make it

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.720
not only an enjoyable night, but a very successful night for you careerwise as well.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.750
The Network Now event is something unique in the marketplace.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.760
No one else is doing this, there are other events that

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.790
happen but they are much more at the professional end and they don't cater for

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.810
graduates, recent graduates, to go out and find a way into the market

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.820
at the level that we're dealing at tonight.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.850
Certainly been a lot of business cards thrown around

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.870
mostly from the students and quite a few people from the industry as well.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.890
Most of the questions I've been getting from students have been "Can they get a job"

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.920
and "What do I think of the giant panda's arrival at the zoo"

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.940
Most of the students just want to know how I got to the position where I am.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.950
I've spoken to a number of students this evening that I think have

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.980
huge potential out there in the marketplace.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
They really just need their first chance, and that's the hardest part

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.020
Clients I know are looking for graduates, but they look for graduates with

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.040
two years experience. How the hell are they supposed to get a job if they haven't got

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.070
two years experience? It's up to employers to take a chance on some of these people,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.090
take them on, give them a go and then give them that

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.100
experience that gives them a great start in their career.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.120
I've been actually surprised by the amount of students that have just bowled up to us and had a chat

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.140
and they have lots of questions to ask and yeah, it's been

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.150
really good. They haven't been shy, so good on you guys.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.180
I can't actually reveal some of the people that I'll be approacing after tonight

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.200
but there will certainly be a few people receiving an email tomorrow morning.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.230
I think I've given people some good ideas about where to go and

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.250
what to do next and certainly they can always get in contact with me

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.270
and I can give them some career guidance if that's what they may want.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.290
Sensational. I've actually

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.310
got to catch up with a number of people who I've heard around the business circuit

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.380
that I've actually never had an opportunity to deal with and I got

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.830
to meet three of those people tonight which was absolutely sensational.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.870
It was absolutely fantastic. I got to meet a couple

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.920
of guests who were absolute experts.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.940
It was really good. We got a lot of people to talk to and we

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.940
always sort of knew people always on websites and TV shows

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.960
but here we got to get them to speak personally

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.990
one on one and it was a really good experience to talk to them.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.020
I got a couple of business cards and given out a couple so it's good.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.050
It's always a pleasure to meet experts from various industries

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.070
but the best thing was I met the experts from the industry

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.090
where I want to work. So I got the experts from

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.110
human resource management and got a couple of cards and I'm going to mail

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.140
them tommorrow and going to sit for a cup of coffee soon with them.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.180
Specifically I would like to thank Elaine from DFEEST

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.200
I had a pretty good chance to chat with her

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.220
maybe ten minutes, ten or fifteen minutes but it was really helpful and she guided me a lot on

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.250
how to go ahead with my career transition.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.270
She was in my hit list and I had that opportunity to grab it. It was really lucky for me.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.300
I had the best networking night I've had in ages.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.310
A lot of business will come out of this evening and

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.320
a lot of support for UniSA as well for putting on such an event.
