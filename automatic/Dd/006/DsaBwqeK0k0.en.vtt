00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello everybody, I'm a navy grandchild developed 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.549
 sailing team lock for boats 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.400
 google and today let's talk about a new 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.279
 tape and android 4.4 that was oscar 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.800
 leshan diablo is a tape that allows 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.380
 the nfc-equipped android device 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.869
 behave like a nfc card and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.570
 talk directly to the voter 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.759
 This video here will do based on the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.219
 example available in the url next to you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.710
 can download and explore all the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.059
 bodies will discuss here ok good but 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.680
 before you start talking exactly 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.840
 about the English oscar shan 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.629
 I'll talk a little bit about what's up. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.700
 is the nfc or near field communication 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.489
 is a technology based on communication 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.430
 is emotion without contact where you have 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.590
 that your device is closer to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 as close to the reader environment as possible . 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 other device must be so that there is 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.579
 communication example we have by 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.920
 example google wallet where you can 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.200
 make payments through points of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.750
 sale or other mechanisms used by 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 type of technology also has android 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.740
 bin where touching devices 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.439
 android you can exchange information 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 between it and coordinated photos of maps and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.009
 everything else 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.930
 also has tags you can read record 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.580
 Tag a snow and put this on 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.220
 various activities in your daily life 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.829
 we also have devices like oo 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 hotel the phone that uses technology 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.329
 nfc to do communication and gives you a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.530
 Even greater comfort can hear your 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.000
 good songs 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.820
 for more information on how you can 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.220
 is to use the nfc android available in this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.090
 link here will also be in the description 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.119
 from the video 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.340
 good staff and android is c and we have three 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.040
 ways to make that interaction there 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.560
 first are the river the internet 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.939
 are forms of reading and writing 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.360
 using tex ok 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.219
 we also have piu-piu is p2p where you go 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.409
 use two devices to 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.930
 talk and if a great example 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.409
 android bin and we also have the cardozo 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.360
 leshan is that where I go through a 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.209
 simulation of a card can 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.920
 Android device behave like the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.230
 card the various types 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.959
 situations and talk directly to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.770
 good reader and this is our subject 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.230
 today 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.120
 to start you go there and manifest and 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.640
 You'll have to indicate how that was. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.030
 included in pm 19 you have to use the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.739
 month of the cave or as 19 tap and then 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.440
 you will trigger the permissions 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.720
 here is mainly to indicate that 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.600
 You have to be to use it. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.890
 this device this little ribbon around good and 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.110
 How does he want to do it? 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.150
 the device behaves like a card 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.120
 will use in order to check if it is 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.000
 as he 40 that is you have to have this 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.910
 Ribbon on the available phone reminding 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.310
 which is to be and comes before the athlete 19 but the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.239
 hc is another leshan path was added 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.010
 on android 4.4 good and there when you 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.269
 put the rice meat and the milk we 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.720
 we must also think about the services 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.160
 because approaching a device is close 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.350
 of a company should be for example the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.959
 corresponding service, ie your 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.090
 code will be called and execute the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.000
 transition there in the background in 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.220
 background for this is inside the cell is 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.810
 based on the right component that 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.120
 accustomed to use for several 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.220
 your application situations android 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.410
 in case a special type of service uses 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.269
 Gas service is okay 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.420
 and thus it is possible to perform in 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.140
 background without having any interface with 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.120
 the user 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.829
 but of course if you need to wait for some 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.890
 kind of notification that makes sense 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.940
 for your application is also yours 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.060
 criterion there 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.370
 Good how I'll know what the service has 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.340
 to be fired at the moment when the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.739
 Trade is what makes a link and should be 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.269
 good has an iso specification that 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.010
 defines how to select the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.329
 the case is based on the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.970
 application to id or edel and how the 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.600
 I like to speak good, it 's a string of until 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.819
 16 bytes and stimulating cards that already 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.280
 are is well known man made the 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.709
 voter already well available in the case 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.560
 example payment cards and if this 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.340
 there it is published it is publicly 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.900
 huh 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.000
 it is already known will not get much 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.099
 beware of this that is making its 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.950
 own service so you sure will 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.840
 know the idea of using good 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.330
 You make the implementation of this service 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.210
 the first creates a class that extends 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.389
 or if you lose a service implement the 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.150
 methods for you as iptu and 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.380
 veteran detective and then checked out 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.229
 that your application is 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.949
 using and clear that in the service of the 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.479
 manifest 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.180
 let's take a look first number of 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.010
 process as where we learned 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.800
 find this is called whenever the reader 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.320
 send application protocol data and nit 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.240
 or learned that nothing is more than a 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.479
 packet that is exchanged between the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.210
 fc and your gas service is good and 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.760
 method where it comes from it will always be 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.770
 called in some situations because it is the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.639
 next that happen new learned 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.889
 always arrive at your service until the 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.990
 reader or send another command to the 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.570
 lose select idea I am 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.010
 sending other services is selected and 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.560
 that's how he ends up choosing another 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.310
 your service soon stopped running 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.510
 or the connection between the nfc and the reader 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.940
 for example your device 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.280
 moves away from the player on fc 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.889
 in which case the method is done it is 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.740
 called by passing the argument indicating 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.229
 which of these two situations occurred 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.240
 just take a look at the card class 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.580
 services is taking that example in the 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.200
 link put in the beginning is that this 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.560
 some of which are mainly 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.030
 service command apeu header 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.889
 select command 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.020
 We now have the process method 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.940
 how 'from where does it check whether it was the same 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.479
 select iptu he is walking in this 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.250
 if a service account said 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.039
 fidelity so that cards of the type 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.760
 with ideas earn is or is accumulate 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.560
 points 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.620
 this example implements the type of 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.979
 service of this shock and also has to 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.710
 registering the meta tag is having meta tag 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.110
 on this date in xml indicating what the 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.800
 reservation that will have records of the output 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.110
 of s 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.660
 then you go there to register your id 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.430
 people have either create one or look for 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.450
 inform with the case you have implemented 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.080
 and add in the corresponding xml and clear 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.580
 huh 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.139
 If you did the service you have to 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.210
 declare this service 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.099
 Also on the manifest so we have a 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.530
 example of how you put or lose 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.610
 a service which is the category type of the 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.759
 intendant and 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.250
 I think it's the technical goal indicating xml 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.439
 in case there, andre list that goes 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.849
 be all your settings there 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.349
 personal touch 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.270
 following these steps by implementing 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.789
 these methods and will be able to create 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.189
 an application on your android device 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.810
 that works as caetano fc 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:03.590
 stay connected on the next videos of 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.590
 next staff
