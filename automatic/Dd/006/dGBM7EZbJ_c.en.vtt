it's really cool but there's a catch to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.749 
it's really cool but there's a catch to
this<00:01:59.300> glitch<00:02:00.760> when<00:02:01.760> you<00:02:02.090> go<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.670> when<00:02:04.670> you

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
this glitch when you go on it when you

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.350 
this glitch when you go on it when you

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
move it to the next day and then you set

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.220 
move it to the next day and then you set
it<00:02:11.480> back<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.739> then<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.700> go<00:02:14.390> back<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.870> next

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
it back and then you go back on the next

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.729 
it back and then you go back on the next
day<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.980> how<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.310> says<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:21.050> move<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.860> up

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
day you know how it says so move it up

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.449 
day you know how it says so move it up
didn't<00:02:24.739> do<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:24.950> one<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:26.600> oh<00:02:26.959> no<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.950> didn't<00:02:28.340> I

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
didn't do that one so oh no I didn't I

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:39.850 
didn't do that one so oh no I didn't I
did<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.690> comes<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:36.080> with<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:37.420> day<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.860> but

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
did so it comes up with this day one but

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.370 
did so it comes up with this day one but
when<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.130> go<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.610> when<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.450> go<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:42.140> day

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
when you go on when you go on that day

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.530 
when you go on when you go on that day
it<00:02:42.650> doesn't<00:02:42.980> come<00:02:43.130> up<00:02:43.280> with<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
it doesn't come up with that so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.370 
it doesn't come up with that so
sometimes<00:02:45.470> you've<00:02:45.620> got<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.830> be<00:02:46.010> careful

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
sometimes you've got to be careful

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.430 
sometimes you've got to be careful
because<00:02:48.380> then<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.220> won't<00:02:49.580> show<00:02:49.790> up<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.440> when

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
because then it won't show up and when

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.860 
because then it won't show up and when
you<00:02:51.590> go<00:02:51.739> on<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:52.160> day<00:02:52.400> if<00:02:52.790> everything<00:02:53.690> won't

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
you go on that day if everything won't

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.490 
you go on that day if everything won't
be<00:02:53.989> loaded<00:02:54.410> because<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:56.180> went<00:02:56.360> on<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.690> but<00:02:57.200> you

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
be loaded because you went on it but you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.710 
be loaded because you went on it but you
have<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.709> go<00:02:57.830> on<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.310> then<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.299> will<00:02:59.480> start

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
have to go on it and then it will start

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.199 
have to go on it and then it will start
loading<00:02:59.959> again<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:01.310> these<00:03:01.400> will<00:03:01.610> start

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
loading again and these will start

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.630 
loading again and these will start
popping<00:03:02.570> up<00:03:03.790> cut<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.510> go<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.049> year<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.190> go

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
popping up cut and I go on a year I go

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.020 
popping up cut and I go on a year I go
on<00:03:07.790> year<00:03:08.560> 2028<00:03:09.970> because<00:03:12.459> that's<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.670> year<00:03:13.910> that

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
on year 2028 because that's a year that

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.250 
on year 2028 because that's a year that
I<00:03:14.120> know<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.959> probably<00:03:16.570> won't<00:03:17.570> go<00:03:17.810> on<00:03:17.840> at

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
I know that I probably won't go on at

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.100 
I know that I probably won't go on at
this<00:03:18.470> anymore

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
this anymore

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.940 
this anymore
so<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:21.730> do<00:03:22.730> that

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
so I do that

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.160 
so I do that
but<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.400> appears<00:03:25.790> lots<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.299> these<00:03:26.480> parasites

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
but it appears lots of these parasites

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.569 
but it appears lots of these parasites
and<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.640> don't<00:03:28.940> have<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:31.630> have

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
and I don't have I have

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.750 
and I don't have I have
Fluttershy's<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:35.769> thought<00:03:36.769> oh<00:03:36.799> shiz<00:03:37.070> parasites

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
Fluttershy's I thought oh shiz parasites

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.270 
Fluttershy's I thought oh shiz parasites
and<00:03:38.000> rainbow<00:03:38.570> dash's<00:03:38.780> but<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.530> don't<00:03:40.130> really

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
and rainbow dash's but I don't really

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.180 
and rainbow dash's but I don't really
have<00:03:40.400> many<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.910> their<00:03:41.060> shards<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.680> can't

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
have many of their shards so I can't

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.440 
have many of their shards so I can't
really<00:03:43.370> get<00:03:44.030> rid<00:03:44.180> of

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
really get rid of

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.390 
really get rid of
I<00:03:44.650> need<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.710> collect<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.310> lot<00:03:46.880> as<00:03:47.240> you<00:03:47.300> can<00:03:47.570> see

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
I need to collect a lot as you can see

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.300 
I need to collect a lot as you can see
mostly<00:03:49.510> rainbow<00:03:50.510> dash's<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:52.990> so<00:03:53.990> they<00:03:54.920> appear

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
mostly rainbow dash's but so they appear

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.310 
mostly rainbow dash's but so they appear
if<00:03:55.520> you<00:03:55.550> go<00:03:55.760> really<00:03:55.940> far<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.510> I'd<00:03:56.690> go<00:03:56.990> really

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
if you go really far like I'd go really

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.130 
if you go really far like I'd go really
far<00:03:57.560> into<00:03:58.250> time<00:03:58.580> even<00:03:59.270> though<00:03:59.360> these<00:03:59.540> will<00:03:59.810> be

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
far into time even though these will be

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.140 
far into time even though these will be
the<00:04:00.530> parasites<00:04:01.400> will<00:04:01.580> appear

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the parasites will appear

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.480 
the parasites will appear
