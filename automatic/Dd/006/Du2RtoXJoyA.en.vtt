00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.450
 build to from me guys what in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.889
 previous video comments wrote 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.349
 what they want to see 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.740
 just some kind of simple house for 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.010
 initial survival I thought so well 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.080
 I don't know how much this house can do for you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.650
 look like an ordinary let's show 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.800
 you him and after the end of the video you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.550
 you can download it without any problems 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.090
 package which is in the description 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.760
 what a house looks well, most that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.840
 there is an ordinary house a small loft 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.789
 and 3 little rooms nothing more they are sorry 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.140
 more is a balcony a balcony such here 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.180
 serving over a rock i found this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 the terrain is purely random to me she is very 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.989
 I liked immediately saw it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 the potential to build a house on such here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.520
 small bulging rock and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.789
 spam with a bridge that leads to it that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 Well let ka and go inside the design 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.720
 houses such a specific stone entrance 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.950
 wooden all wooden shorter and near 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.080
 each to on the windowsill small with 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.939
 flowers, well, let's go inside 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.200
 bullshit you are so loud, we go fine 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.729
 inside we see a small hallway 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.119
 can be settled so to speak 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.250
 Again, who will download it myself 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.409
 the biggest room in the house is me 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.840
 the corridor counted, too, as a room 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.640
 that you are not surprised 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 the biggest room in the house is here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 plenty of space for something 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.210
 it is also possible to place from this room 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 get to the small loft 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.570
 the loft is longer here but 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.420
 nevertheless it does not interfere by instruct 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.829
 here under the pile wall chests a bunch 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.509
 chests to have access 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.750
 some kind of food supply something like that 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:07.200
 further next room a little smaller 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.649
 with access to the patio and patio 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.120
 and principle yes here also the emphasis is on 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.250
 so that I forgot to do something here 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.400
 so here we are right in the video this 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 we will decide everything perfectly the emphasis is on 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.290
 so that at least half of the room was with 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.900
 tiger full so you can 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.090
 somehow and arrange here because 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.980
 if there are windows everywhere there is very little 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.160
 places to put even 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.690
 most ordinary bookshelves 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.380
 imagine well this is for everyone 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.150
 our problems go out into the courtyard 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.849
 a small trump as well here 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 principle house as a house and a platform for 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.900
 order to observe the territory 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.420
 look what a cool look from here 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.890
 right forest on the left 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.000
 sea â€‹â€‹in the distance in general sea islands there 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.880
 chic i just can't pass you 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.829
 how pleased I am because the house 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.060
 really get so simple yes I am 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.290
 too decorated him outside but it is already 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.130
 let's say my 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.109
 I like to decorate the houses from the outside to the inside and 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.049
 the truth is, I have this much the same but 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.959
 Nevertheless, I hope that you have this 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.970
 construction liked spent on it 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.049
 pretty little time somewhere 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.739
 an hour two three from strength well and surely 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.230
