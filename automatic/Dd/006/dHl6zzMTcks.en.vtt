the<00:00:22.890> conservative<00:00:23.310> approach<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the conservative approach this is a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630 
the conservative approach this is a
ultrabook<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.769> large<00:00:26.070> bone<00:00:26.369> one

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.130 
ultrabook but it's a large bone one
that's<00:00:26.849> thicker<00:00:27.090> than<00:00:27.359> maybe<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.050> would

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
that's thicker than maybe you would

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.169 
that's thicker than maybe you would

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
expect compared to a MacBook Air but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.490 
expect compared to a MacBook Air but
it's<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> lot<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.750> security<00:00:31.170> features<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it's got a lot of security features and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
it's got a lot of security features and
ports<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.070> connections<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.090> meant<00:00:33.270> for

ports and connections and it's meant for

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030 
ports and connections and it's meant for
businesses<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.140> got<00:00:34.350> V<00:00:34.559> Pro<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.980> all

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040

that<00:00:35.219> stuff<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.700> mean<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.120> business

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that stuff I mean it's really business

that's one of the main port
differentiators<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> talk<00:00:43.320> about

business versus a consumer laptop it's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.490 
business versus a consumer laptop it's
also<00:00:45.780> expensive

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
also expensive

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
also expensive

HP folio 13 last year and this is kind
of<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.490> bigger<00:02:53.700> brother<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.390> at

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
of like the bigger brother to that at

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.450 
of like the bigger brother to that at
the<00:02:55.230> time<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.740> thought<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.070> was<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> great

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
the time I thought that was a great

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.630 
the time I thought that was a great
ultrabook<00:02:57.180> really<00:02:57.930> really<00:02:58.260> stood<00:02:58.530> out

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
ultrabook really really stood out

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.280 
ultrabook really really stood out
because<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.790> its<00:02:59.910> reliability<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.690> its<00:03:00.930> ports

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
because of its reliability and its ports

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.320 
because of its reliability and its ports
but<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> lot<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.190> times<00:03:02.400> gone<00:03:02.640> by<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.060> mean<00:03:03.180> what

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
but a lot of times gone by I mean what

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.110 
but a lot of times gone by I mean what
this<00:03:03.480> has<00:03:03.630> going<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:03.960> it<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.320> again<00:03:05.120> extra

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
this has going for it is again extra

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.850 
this has going for it is again extra
ports<00:03:06.480> Ethernet<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.410> fact<00:03:07.620> that's<00:03:07.740> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
ports Ethernet and the fact that's a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.770 
ports Ethernet and the fact that's a
seven<00:03:08.310> hour<00:03:08.430> battery<00:03:08.790> life<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.270> there<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.660> go

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
seven hour battery life so there you go

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.110 
seven hour battery life so there you go
that's<00:03:09.960> a<00:03:10.110> pretty<00:03:10.320> big<00:03:11.070> honking<00:03:11.610> battery<00:03:11.910> life

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
that's a pretty big honking battery life

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.110 
that's a pretty big honking battery life
on<00:03:12.300> an<00:03:12.390> ultrabook<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.640> maybe<00:03:15.000> you
