year i'm training moves like this like
I'm<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.420> focusing<00:01:15.930> single<00:01:16.350> move<00:01:16.530> sand

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I'm not really focusing single move sand

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.030 
I'm not really focusing single move sand
but<00:01:17.610> always<00:01:17.940> when<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.590> conditions<00:01:19.590> always

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
but always when the conditions always

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.180 
but always when the conditions always
worse<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.720> competition<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.500> also<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
worse in the competition and also you

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.570 
worse in the competition and also you
get<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.700> computation<00:01:24.450> stress<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.050> all<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
get the computation stress and all that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.359 
get the computation stress and all that
but<00:01:26.580> yeah<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.840> came<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.920> had<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> do

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
but yeah I just came in and I had to do

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.120 
but yeah I just came in and I had to do
the<00:01:29.490> first<00:01:29.729> move<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.050> felt<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.800> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the first move and I just felt like I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.639 
the first move and I just felt like I
should<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.600> move<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> wind<00:01:34.410> felt

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
should go for big move the wind felt

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.950 
should go for big move the wind felt
perfect<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> double<00:01:36.509> cool<00:01:36.720> Irwin

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
perfect for it to do a double cool Irwin

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.430 
perfect for it to do a double cool Irwin
and<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:38.009> made<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.259> good

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.650 
and I made that one and that's a good
opening<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.460> still<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.300> it's<00:01:42.600> not

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
only not about one move so you have to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.990
