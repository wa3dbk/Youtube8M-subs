the hoof um but when I bought it is just
paint<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.039> my

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

putting<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.869> CNC<00:01:28.470> cage<00:01:28.770> grid<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:31.909> I'll<00:01:32.909> show<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
putting a CNC cage grid in I'll show you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.899 
putting a CNC cage grid in I'll show you
so<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.380> section<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.670> Heidi

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
so this section this little Heidi

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.310 
so this section this little Heidi
section<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.970> normally<00:01:38.970> you'd<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
section and normally you'd like have it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.130 
section and normally you'd like have it
open<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:40.829> I've<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.369> CNC<00:01:42.270> grid<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:42.930> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
open but I've put this CNC grid here so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130 
open but I've put this CNC grid here so
I<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.350> use<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.950> storage<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.180> I've<00:01:45.600> tried

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
I can use this for storage so I've tried

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
I can use this for storage so I've tried
to<00:01:46.229> choose<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.770> section<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.520> storage

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to choose this section for storage

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.840 
to choose this section for storage
because<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.229> which<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.710> very<00:01:50.009> big<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.520> five

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
because this which is very big it's five

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.899 
because this which is very big it's five

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
first we have a new bottle this is the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.300 
first we have a new bottle this is the
living<00:02:41.700> world<00:02:41.880> large<00:02:42.540> water<00:02:43.440> bottle<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
living world large water bottle it's the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.330 
living world large water bottle it's the
glass<00:02:44.580> one<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:46.800> got<00:02:47.160> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
glass one and and I just got that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.460 
glass one and and I just got that
because<00:02:47.730> they<00:02:48.360> need<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.660> new<00:02:48.870> bottle<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.410> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
because they need a new bottle and I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.560 
because they need a new bottle and I
wanted<00:02:49.740> something<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.190> would<00:02:50.430> last<00:02:50.700> me<00:02:51.240> and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
wanted something that would last me and

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.930 
wanted something that would last me and
this<00:02:52.230> look<00:02:52.440> pretty<00:02:52.680> good<00:02:52.830> quality<00:02:53.280> although

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
this look pretty good quality although

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.340 
this look pretty good quality although
it's<00:02:54.210> glass<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.720> I'll<00:02:54.810> probably<00:02:54.960> end<00:02:55.230> up

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
it's glass so I'll probably end up

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.820 
it's glass so I'll probably end up
smashing<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.450> then<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.110> here<00:02:58.470> I'll

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
bad and then it will work out okay but

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.070 
bad and then it will work out okay but
if<00:03:28.440> not<00:03:28.920> then<00:03:29.850> I'll<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.720> find<00:03:30.900> something

but<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:05.880> suppose<00:04:06.210> it<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.390> serious<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.960> it's

but I suppose it is serious and it's

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.190 
but I suppose it is serious and it's
actually<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.459> fatty<00:04:08.820> lump<00:04:09.090> which<00:04:09.540> we<00:04:09.870> have

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
actually just a fatty lump which we have

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.940 
actually just a fatty lump which we have
chosen<00:04:10.800> not<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.400> remove<00:04:11.940> because<00:04:12.270> when<00:04:12.660> he

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
chosen not to remove because when he

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.130 
chosen not to remove because when he
went<00:04:13.950> under<00:04:14.220> anesthetic<00:04:14.850> for<00:04:15.090> his<00:04:15.540> neutering

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
went under anesthetic for his neutering

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.229 
went under anesthetic for his neutering
he<00:04:16.470> nearly<00:04:16.770> didn't<00:04:17.130> come<00:04:17.280> back<00:04:17.520> round<00:04:17.850> and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
he nearly didn't come back round and

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.500 
he nearly didn't come back round and
it's<00:04:18.780> not<00:04:18.930> really<00:04:19.170> affecting<00:04:19.440> him

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
it's not really affecting him

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.320 
it's not really affecting him
so<00:04:21.140> that's<00:04:21.320> why<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.980> he<00:04:22.580> also<00:04:22.730> has<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.030> bit<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.240> a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
so that's why and he also has a bit of a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.050 
so that's why and he also has a bit of a
lazy<00:04:23.570> eye<00:04:23.780> his<00:04:24.230> right<00:04:24.440> eyes<00:04:24.650> gone<00:04:25.220> with<00:04:25.910> it

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
corner we have I don't I think it's the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.050 
corner we have I don't I think it's the
medium<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:54.080> pets<00:05:54.890> at<00:05:55.040> home<00:05:55.070> corner<00:05:55.880> litter

his<00:06:00.110> em<00:06:01.210> verges<00:06:02.210> XL<00:06:02.600> pellets<00:06:03.020> out<00:06:03.650> of<00:06:03.920> their

his em verges XL pellets out of their
little<00:06:04.340> nibble<00:06:04.820> ball<00:06:05.000> which<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:05.360> think<00:06:05.600> was

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
little nibble ball which I think was

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.180 
little nibble ball which I think was
also<00:06:05.780> from<00:06:06.320> perhaps<00:06:06.440> at<00:06:06.680> home<00:06:06.830> but<00:06:06.980> I've<00:06:07.070> had

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
also from perhaps at home but I've had

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.030 
also from perhaps at home but I've had
it<00:06:07.220> ages<00:06:07.730> so<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:07.940> don't<00:06:08.150> really<00:06:08.330> know<00:06:08.570> and<00:06:09.040> then

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
it ages so I don't really know and then

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.550 
it ages so I don't really know and then
on<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.520> door<00:06:10.850> they<00:06:11.240> have<00:06:11.450> this<00:06:11.690> daisy<00:06:12.080> chain

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
on the door they have this daisy chain

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.880 
on the door they have this daisy chain
and<00:06:13.010> which<00:06:13.880> again<00:06:14.030> it's<00:06:14.360> not<00:06:14.540> new<00:06:14.780> and<00:06:15.080> as<00:06:15.770> you

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
and which again it's not new and as you

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.700 
and which again it's not new and as you
can<00:06:16.010> tell<00:06:16.070> by<00:06:16.640> the<00:06:16.750> state<00:06:17.750> of<00:06:17.960> it<00:06:18.140> they<00:06:18.530> have

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
can tell by the state of it they have

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.610 
can tell by the state of it they have
chewed<00:06:18.950> it<00:06:19.130> a<00:06:19.460> lot<00:06:19.880> but<00:06:20.660> um<00:06:20.870> yeah

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.010 

that<00:06:24.620> is<00:06:24.860> basically<00:06:25.610> all<00:06:26.000> they<00:06:26.330> have<00:06:26.569> in<00:06:26.780> here

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
that is basically all they have in here

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.779 
that is basically all they have in here
at<00:06:27.169> the<00:06:27.259> minute<00:06:27.470> I<00:06:27.590> don't<00:06:27.650> like<00:06:27.919> to<00:06:28.100> overcrowd

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
at the minute I don't like to overcrowd

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:35.260 
at the minute I don't like to overcrowd
and<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:33.020> hutch<00:06:33.259> and<00:06:33.740> with<00:06:34.669> it<00:06:34.759> being<00:06:34.970> you<00:06:35.120> I've

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
and the hutch and with it being you I've

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.879 
and the hutch and with it being you I've
not<00:06:35.449> put<00:06:35.599> wet<00:06:35.780> loads<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.259> things<00:06:36.500> in<00:06:36.680> but<00:06:36.860> I

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
not put wet loads of things in but I

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.920 
not put wet loads of things in but I
think<00:06:37.130> they've<00:06:37.280> got<00:06:37.460> enough<00:06:37.819> if<00:06:38.449> they<00:06:38.630> start

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
think they've got enough if they start

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.659 
think they've got enough if they start
using<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.319> upstairs<00:06:39.740> then<00:06:40.009> obviously<00:06:40.220> I'll

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
using the upstairs then obviously I'll

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.390 
using the upstairs then obviously I'll
add<00:06:40.880> things<00:06:41.270> up<00:06:41.630> there<00:06:42.080> but<00:06:42.860> to<00:06:43.099> be<00:06:43.190> honest

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
add things up there but to be honest

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.770 
add things up there but to be honest
with<00:06:43.520> fidgets<00:06:44.180> along<00:06:44.599> and<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:47.270> fact<00:06:47.479> that<00:06:47.569> pop

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
with fidgets along and the fact that pop

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.689 
with fidgets along and the fact that pop
is<00:06:47.930> quite<00:06:48.169> nervous<00:06:48.440> I<00:06:49.009> don't<00:06:49.370> really<00:06:49.550> think

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
is quite nervous I don't really think

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.790 
is quite nervous I don't really think
they'll<00:06:49.970> use<00:06:50.180> upstairs<00:06:50.750> I<00:06:51.080> don't<00:06:51.530> learn<00:06:51.680> just
