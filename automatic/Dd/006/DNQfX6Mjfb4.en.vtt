00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.650 
saturating how long we're going to use
from<00:04:26.200> two<00:04:26.950> boxes<00:04:27.370> out<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.550> color<00:04:27.790> but<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.420> went

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
from two boxes out of color but I went

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.480 
from two boxes out of color but I went
back<00:04:28.750> in<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:30.130> poured<00:04:30.550> my<00:04:31.210> third<00:04:31.480> one<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:32.490> and

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
back in and I poured my third one in and

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.160 
back in and I poured my third one in and
it<00:04:33.610> was<00:04:33.700> pretty<00:04:33.940> inexpensive<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.630> think<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:34.840> felt

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
it was pretty inexpensive I think I felt

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.920 
it was pretty inexpensive I think I felt
like<00:04:35.200> $18<00:04:36.070> at<00:04:36.760> Sally's<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.510> hair<00:04:40.720> is
