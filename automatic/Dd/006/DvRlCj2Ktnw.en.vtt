and<00:02:43.970> when<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.150> twist<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:47.150> there's<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.360> big

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and when you twist this on there's a big

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.130 
and when you twist this on there's a big
gap<00:02:49.140> that's<00:02:49.769> as<00:02:49.980> far<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.519> as<00:02:50.700> it'll<00:02:50.970> go<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.079> you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
gap that's as far on as it'll go so you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.410 
gap that's as far on as it'll go so you
need<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.709> glue<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.970> part<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:57.060> just

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
need to glue this part on so I'm just

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:09.880 
need to glue this part on so I'm just
going<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.810> get<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.170> glue<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:06.660> glue<00:03:07.470> here

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.280 

there<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.100> myth<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.670> brand<00:03:12.060> called<00:03:12.299> araldite

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
there is a myth a brand called araldite

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.420 
there is a myth a brand called araldite
which<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.220> fantastic<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.560> they<00:03:16.890> didn't<00:03:17.250> have

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
which is fantastic but they didn't have

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.880 
which is fantastic but they didn't have
any<00:03:17.670> other<00:03:17.910> dice<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.630> I'm<00:03:18.810> guessing<00:03:19.470> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
any other dice and I'm guessing that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.360 
any other dice and I'm guessing that
this<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.459> same<00:03:20.700> stuff<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:22.650> what<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.160> do

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
this is the same stuff so what you do

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.560 
this is the same stuff so what you do
with<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.209> your<00:03:24.989> squeeze<00:03:25.940> squeeze<00:03:26.940> equal

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
with this is your squeeze squeeze equal

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.160 
with this is your squeeze squeeze equal
amounts<00:03:28.130> are<00:03:29.130> onto<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> table<00:03:31.400> now<00:03:32.400> araldite

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
amounts are onto the table now araldite

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
amounts are onto the table now araldite
there's<00:03:34.170> not<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> lot<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.310> one<00:03:35.640> here

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
there's not a lot in this one here

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.370 
there's not a lot in this one here
araldite<00:03:38.510> would<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.660> caught<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.109> woulda

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
araldite would have caught it woulda

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.340 
araldite would have caught it woulda
come<00:03:40.650> straight<00:03:41.160> out<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.019> about

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
come straight out there so it's about

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.300 
come straight out there so it's about
equal<00:03:44.130> amounts<00:03:44.670> i<00:03:45.230> did<00:03:46.230> use<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.680> use<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> glue

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
equal amounts i did use to use a glue

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.699 
equal amounts i did use to use a glue
gone<00:03:47.639> for<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.479> the<00:03:48.600> clue<00:03:48.870> isn't<00:03:49.169> strong

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
gone for this but the clue isn't strong

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.090 
gone for this but the clue isn't strong
enough<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.989> what<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.470> do<00:03:52.680> with

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
enough so what you do with

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.520 
enough so what you do with
this<00:03:53.190> clue<00:03:53.550> is<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.060> mix<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.480> together<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:55.290> I

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
this clue is you mix it together and I

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.890 
this clue is you mix it together and I
honestly<00:03:55.920> don't<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.670> there<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.270> stronger

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
honestly don't think there is a stronger

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.160 
honestly don't think there is a stronger
glue<00:03:58.200> out<00:03:58.800> there<00:04:02.120> I'd<00:04:03.120> never<00:04:03.450> heard<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.990> this

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
glue out there I'd never heard of this

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.050 
glue out there I'd never heard of this
until<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.650> met<00:04:04.950> John<00:04:05.630> and<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.990> you<00:04:07.050> just<00:04:08.060> take

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
until I met John and so you just take

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.230 
until I met John and so you just take
the<00:04:09.660> end<00:04:09.990> over<00:04:10.920> whatever<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:14.700> pop

the end over whatever and you just pop

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:23.420 
the end over whatever and you just pop
it<00:04:15.480> into<00:04:15.750> here<00:04:16.170> around<00:04:17.040> there<00:04:21.680> if<00:04:22.680> you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.670 
it into here around there if you
remember<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.120> last<00:04:24.150> video<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.870> showed<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.500> of

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
sure where that is dead dead center and

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.980 
sure where that is dead dead center and
if<00:05:38.880> it's<00:05:39.480> not<00:05:39.600> centered<00:05:40.410> ends<00:05:40.860> up<00:05:41.420> been<00:05:42.420> to<00:05:42.750> one

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
if it's not centered ends up been to one

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.200 
if it's not centered ends up been to one
side<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.770> it<00:05:44.070> drives<00:05:44.340> you<00:05:44.580> mad<00:05:44.610> because<00:05:44.910> it's

side and it drives you mad because it's
not<00:05:45.420> straight<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.550> then<00:05:47.600> you<00:05:48.600> get<00:05:48.810> your

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
not straight and then you get your

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.140 
not straight and then you get your
nozzle<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:50.310> don't<00:05:50.580> need<00:05:50.790> to<00:05:50.940> do<00:05:51.120> that

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
nozzle you don't need to do that

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.170 
nozzle you don't need to do that
straight<00:05:51.780> where<00:05:52.080> by<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.410> way<00:05:52.740> you<00:05:53.730> get<00:05:53.940> the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
straight where by the way you get the

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.540 
straight where by the way you get the
nozzle<00:05:54.450> and<00:05:54.870> then<00:05:55.200> you<00:05:55.380> just<00:05:55.620> pop<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:55.920> over

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
nozzle and then you just pop that over

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.450 
nozzle and then you just pop that over
the<00:05:56.970> nozzle<00:05:57.390> and<00:05:57.540> twist<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.050> on<00:05:58.290> but<00:05:59.100> I'm<00:05:59.220> not

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
the nozzle and twist it on but I'm not

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.550 
the nozzle and twist it on but I'm not
going<00:05:59.640> to<00:05:59.730> do<00:05:59.940> that<00:05:59.970> right<00:06:00.240> now<00:06:00.540> because<00:06:01.530> I

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
going to do that right now because I

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.260 
going to do that right now because I
want<00:06:01.710> this<00:06:02.510> this<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.750> set<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.970> think<00:06:05.970> I<00:06:06.090> might

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
want this this to set I think I might

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.040 
want this this to set I think I might
just<00:06:06.540> put<00:06:06.780> a

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
just put a

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.439 
just put a
more<00:06:07.349> glue<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:09.560> bit<00:06:10.560> more<00:06:10.830> around<00:06:11.400> here<00:06:11.849> because

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
more glue a bit more around here because

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.570 
more glue a bit more around here because
I<00:06:12.599> want<00:06:12.810> to<00:06:12.870> make<00:06:12.930> sure<00:06:13.169> what<00:06:13.740> it's<00:06:13.979> well<00:06:14.400> and

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
I want to make sure what it's well and

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:25.700 
I want to make sure what it's well and
truly<00:06:14.669> sealed<00:06:22.039> I'll<00:06:23.039> just<00:06:23.370> pop<00:06:23.699> in<00:06:23.909> it<00:06:24.470> you<00:06:25.470> see

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
truly sealed I'll just pop in it you see

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.920 
truly sealed I'll just pop in it you see
it's<00:06:25.919> move<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.460> that's<00:06:26.669> just<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.360> little<00:06:27.659> bit

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
it's move and that's just a little bit

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.020 
it's move and that's just a little bit
of<00:06:27.960> a<00:06:28.139> problem<00:06:28.409> with<00:06:28.800> this<00:06:29.009> glue<00:06:29.400> it<00:06:29.639> doesn't

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
of a problem with this glue it doesn't

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.050 
of a problem with this glue it doesn't
set<00:06:30.300> straight<00:06:30.720> aware<00:06:31.169> but<00:06:32.069> it<00:06:32.340> you'll<00:06:32.729> be<00:06:32.909> able

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
set straight aware but it you'll be able

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.490 
set straight aware but it you'll be able
to<00:06:33.419> well<00:06:34.379> it's<00:06:34.680> never<00:06:35.159> ever<00:06:35.810> come<00:06:36.810> loose<00:06:37.110> for

to well it's never ever come loose for

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.899 
to well it's never ever come loose for
me<00:06:37.680> and<00:06:38.210> this<00:06:39.210> glue<00:06:39.800> where<00:06:40.800> the<00:06:40.979> glue<00:06:41.250> gwan<00:06:41.610> it

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
me and this glue where the glue gwan it

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.779 
me and this glue where the glue gwan it
does<00:06:42.780> epiny<00:06:43.409> just<00:06:43.740> about<00:06:43.979> every<00:06:44.370> time<00:06:44.610> you

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
does epiny just about every time you

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:53.899 
does epiny just about every time you
wash<00:06:45.000> it<00:06:51.169> so<00:06:52.169> what<00:06:52.860> you<00:06:53.009> need<00:06:53.159> to<00:06:53.370> do<00:06:53.580> is<00:06:53.610> just

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
wash it so what you need to do is just

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:58.010 
wash it so what you need to do is just
leave<00:06:54.509> that<00:06:54.870> to<00:06:55.409> stand<00:06:56.509> for<00:06:57.509> as<00:06:57.599> long<00:06:57.810> as<00:06:57.870> you

glue right down round that Ridge there

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.540 
glue right down round that Ridge there
and<00:07:20.900> that<00:07:21.900> I'll<00:07:22.020> make<00:07:22.349> it<00:07:22.560> really<00:07:23.520> really

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.399 
and that I'll make it really really
solid<00:07:25.009> but<00:07:26.009> it<00:07:26.370> should<00:07:26.699> be<00:07:26.880> pretty<00:07:27.150> solid<00:07:27.779> the

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:28.409 
solid but it should be pretty solid the
