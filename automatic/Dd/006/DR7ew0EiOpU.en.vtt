 you saw your friend stand over here and 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.950
 after that car goes to look at patch 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.450
 garage and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.040
 friend just have to watch that car what 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.049
 they would do so your city ​​is so in you 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.780
 elegy and a bowl of phone you go to 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.820
 mercury job and then john random and if you like 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.909
 then with such a foam from that show 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 otherwise tactics in car in elegy for that 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.939
 honey is, by the way, I had to do with 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.129
 one from the other car but then 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.990
 derivation kind of so are you him 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.500
 lost then you have 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.950
 so actually sort of red and called red 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 is going to run a quick job joy if you have one 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.110
 your ishares foam with just click one 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.390
 little time to draw dad and straight up 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.290
 cross the blaze and shabbat with a 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.400
 pr the cross and have two then you must 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.910
 so you have to do it at the same time 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.800
 click 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:42.190
 so hhh and guests hoped very happy 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.900
 do okay once we did it already 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.080
 totally likely this and then you go 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.730
 so up if you return john and if 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.930
 so you have to live like that and then you have to 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.330
 be very fast 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.290
 you have to run out of your garage and unevenly 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.830
 stepping into your friend would work differently 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.500
 it doesn't 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.020
 So you have to do it very quickly 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.480
 was a sweet kafir 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.030
 from b yes sweet and that's how you see it 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.810
 what you here so turn them so lunch 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.490
 my friend's car and you get in it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.350
 okay because that does so very quickly one 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.370
 little used and you do nothing and so 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.370
 if you are in that you have all the space 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.560
 And then you see how you get out of your car 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.740
 and then you get in alias car like that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.700
 walk your ipad this car because there is still 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.470
 a lazy see how are you unlucky 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.590
 then you would see that here one likes it 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.870
 is the gran turismo there and here container 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.670
 then one that rows a garage 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.710
 it can also be different than that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.710
 he drives the grass you are lucky 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.730
 from this this car in garage it is here 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.090
 a little buggy 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.440
 yes that is so in glass house so that 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.069
 you get the car right and was 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.040
 totally space and stuff 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.719
 then you are worked when you see 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.389
 I now here the car of harm 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.950
 I can probably sell it too 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.090
 maybe the poor jurgen is freud 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.840
 but now he has to go back yes 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.840
 only bad luck 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.130
 sometimes once so but sometimes yes and now I have 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.690
 him actually in my glass you can a 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.699
 just turning it off can also do it 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.949
 sell that I show it off and 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.030
 Narrow a point 11 patch and it can 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.150
 just do it 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.090
 Young boy good pay your euro 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.410
 ok thanks hey well then you can 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.410
 you do not hurt my husband real doer 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.889
 the desk drawer i will speed up french 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.970
 coast and struggle to watch or suddenly 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.900
 can hang on to sell 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.000
 still come in a layer as you see 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.560
 it's not just my car that is poor 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.360
 is only destroyed I can do that 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.150
 pick up and thunder 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.380
 can learn you can in the spade and then can 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:05.270
 in such a it also actually not hidden 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.370
 but I ca n't get out 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.520
 yes pick it up and then you have it back to you 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.490
 I put it in my garage and arm has one 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.110
 problem but if you do sell it 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.460
 but his soldiers are not well sprinkled 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.780
 on the works a little different but 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.320
 it eventually comes down to soft and down 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.880
 because once you just that I do lessons 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.130
 you still walk from your garage 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.090
 it is all a row just normal witch 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:35.270
 garage and then leaders and backwards 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:39.560
 and then the narafi process works 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:42.050
 therefore has to pay more than that is possible and 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.380
 then the drive to we in slides you that 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.060
 he is also in shirt but I try 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.500
 this sell I am not sure if he 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.139
 ca n't sell otherwise I just have 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:56.999
 be out of luck 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:06:00.050
 extra turismo and yes hopefully that's possible 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:00.050

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.530
