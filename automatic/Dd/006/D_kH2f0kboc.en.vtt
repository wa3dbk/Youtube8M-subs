stressful<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.009> many<00:01:32.100> things

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
stressful but there are so many things

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.770 
stressful but there are so many things
that<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.970> cover<00:01:33.180> while<00:01:33.570> we're<00:01:33.750> all

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that we want to cover while we're all

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
that we want to cover while we're all
together<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.460> expensive

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
together and this was a very expensive

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.929 
together and this was a very expensive
thing<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> put<00:01:36.869> together<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.439> us<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:38.130> think

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
thing to put together for us I think

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.870 
thing to put together for us I think
it's<00:01:39.090> worth<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.280> during<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.490> period<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's worth it so during this period of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
it's worth it so during this period of
