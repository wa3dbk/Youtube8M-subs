use various different stance all kinds
of<00:02:17.390> stance<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.650> very<00:02:19.040> smart<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.670> unlike

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
of stance this is very smart and unlike

of stance this is very smart and unlike
other<00:02:20.660> gps<00:02:21.620> car<00:02:22.129> keyed<00:02:22.280> solutions<00:02:22.730> for

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
other gps car keyed solutions for

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.660 
other gps car keyed solutions for
example<00:02:23.959> most<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.290> them<00:02:24.440> have<00:02:24.709> like<00:02:25.040> imagine

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
example most of them have like imagine

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.390 
example most of them have like imagine
if<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:26.000> was<00:02:26.209> divided<00:02:27.019> right<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:28.099> part

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
if this was divided right and this part

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.970 
if this was divided right and this part
doesn't<00:02:28.730> move<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.840> part<00:02:30.110> moves<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.860> know

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
doesn't move as this part moves you know

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.610 
doesn't move as this part moves you know
so<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.450> problem<00:02:32.780> with<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.230> over

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
so the problem with that is that over

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.039 
so the problem with that is that over
time<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:34.550> system<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.330> type<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.720> system

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
time this system this type of the system

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.619 
time this system this type of the system
where's<00:02:36.410> out<00:02:36.620> quicker<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.250> gets<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:37.940> loser<00:02:38.390> and

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
where's out quicker and gets a loser and

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.930 
where's out quicker and gets a loser and
the<00:02:39.170> rattles<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.830> all<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.129> but<00:02:40.519> with<00:02:40.760> this

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the rattles and all that but with this

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.960 
the rattles and all that but with this
type<00:02:41.299> of<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.569> system<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.049> think<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.470> will<00:02:43.069> you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
type of the system I think it will you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.620 
type of the system I think it will you
know<00:02:44.090> we're<00:02:44.390> out<00:02:45.190> less<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.849> less<00:02:47.120> likely<00:02:47.360> to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
know we're out less it's less likely to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.949 
know we're out less it's less likely to
wear<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:48.190> sooner<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.340> know<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.640> plus<00:02:50.390> you

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
wear out sooner you know and plus you

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.650 
wear out sooner you know and plus you
get<00:02:51.079> more<00:02:51.440> choices<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:52.700> easier<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.390> adjust

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
get more choices it's easier to adjust

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.830 
get more choices it's easier to adjust
you<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.099> moves<00:02:55.400> better<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.569> if<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
you know just it moves better and if you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.569 
you know just it moves better and if you
want<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.110> fix<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.470> you'll<00:02:57.739> just<00:02:57.950> tighten<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.459> up

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
want to fix it you'll just tighten it up

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.449 
want to fix it you'll just tighten it up
and<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.030> fixed<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.540> place<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:01.069> only

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
and it's fixed in place the only

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.319 
and it's fixed in place the only
negative<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:03.319> would<00:03:04.040> say<00:03:04.280> about<00:03:04.459> this<00:03:04.849> car<00:03:05.120> kit

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
negative I would say about this car kit

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.190 
negative I would say about this car kit
is<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.870> speaker<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.799> weak<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.599> know<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
is that the speaker is weak you know the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.920 
is that the speaker is weak you know the
speaker<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.650> weak<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:11.510> know<00:03:11.630> so

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
speaker is weak and you know so

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.309 
speaker is weak and you know so
something<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.829> consider<00:03:13.510> another<00:03:14.510> thing<00:03:14.959> is

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
something to consider another thing is

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.460 
something to consider another thing is
well<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.130> not<00:03:16.250> really<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.790> minus<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:18.079> wouldn't

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
well it's not really a minus I wouldn't

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.319 
well it's not really a minus I wouldn't
have<00:03:18.590> deducted<00:03:19.040> point<00:03:19.489> for<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.819> but<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:20.150> they

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
have deducted point for this but if they

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.330 
have deducted point for this but if they
had<00:03:20.480> used<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.959> microUSB<00:03:21.620> instead<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.100> mini

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
had used the microUSB instead of mini

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.650 
had used the microUSB instead of mini
that<00:03:23.150> would<00:03:23.329> have<00:03:23.450> been<00:03:23.600> very<00:03:24.410> nice<00:03:24.760> also<00:03:25.760> as<00:03:26.510> I

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
that would have been very nice also as I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.590 
that would have been very nice also as I
mentioned<00:03:26.690> earlier<00:03:27.170> this<00:03:27.650> has<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.600> GPS
