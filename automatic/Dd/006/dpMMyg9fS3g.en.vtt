the engine management unit systems in

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.390 
the engine management unit systems in
the<00:00:09.040> vehicles<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:10.660> use<00:00:10.870> this<00:00:11.080> to<00:00:11.410> determine<00:00:11.860> if

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
the vehicles we use this to determine if

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.900 
the vehicles we use this to determine if
there's<00:00:12.730> any<00:00:13.050> parameters<00:00:14.050> set<00:00:14.519> wrong<00:00:15.519> in<00:00:15.820> the

there's any parameters set wrong in the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.760 
there's any parameters set wrong in the
vehicle<00:00:16.270> and<00:00:16.450> to<00:00:16.930> help<00:00:17.080> us<00:00:17.170> determine<00:00:17.439> whether

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
vehicle and to help us determine whether

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.380 
vehicle and to help us determine whether
there's<00:00:17.980> a<00:00:18.009> speed<00:00:18.310> tampering<00:00:18.940> over<00:00:19.150> or

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
there's a speed tampering over or

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:35.860 
there's a speed tampering over or
divorce

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.170 

it's<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> tool<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.560> help<00:00:37.740> us<00:00:37.950> try<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.490> work

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it's the tool to help us try and work

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.850 
it's the tool to help us try and work
out<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.600> vehicle<00:00:40.020> does<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.500> fitted

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
out if the vehicle does have one fitted

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.570 
out if the vehicle does have one fitted
we<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:42.000> other<00:00:42.810> tools<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.380> well<00:00:43.590> including

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
we do have other tools as well including

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.130 
we do have other tools as well including
climate<00:00:44.730> over<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> truck<00:00:45.330> and<00:00:45.480> physically

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
climate over the truck and physically

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.760 
climate over the truck and physically
locating

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.070 

this<00:00:55.770> sort<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.040> shows<00:00:56.280> pretty<00:00:56.910> easy<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.990> the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
this sort of shows pretty easy what the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.110 
this sort of shows pretty easy what the
trucks<00:00:58.350> been<00:00:58.530> doing<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.950> that's<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.220> time<00:00:59.460> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
trucks been doing so that's a time and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.210 
trucks been doing so that's a time and
that's<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:00.450> amount<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.720> revs<00:01:00.990> so<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.770> spends

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
that's the amount of revs so it spends

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.890 
that's the amount of revs so it spends
most<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.490> its<00:01:02.610> time<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.970> where<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.300> stand

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
most of its time is where you stand

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:13.730 
most of its time is where you stand
sixteen<00:01:04.380> hundred<00:01:04.410> grams<00:01:04.890> which<00:01:05.520> would<00:01:05.700> be

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.220 

I've<00:01:14.740> had<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.040> for<00:01:15.460> around<00:01:15.790> 12<00:01:16.510> months<00:01:16.720> now

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
I've had that for around 12 months now

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.450 
I've had that for around 12 months now
so<00:01:17.410> it's<00:01:18.370> probably<00:01:18.610> been<00:01:18.790> successful<00:01:20.460> in

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
so it's probably been successful in

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.150 
so it's probably been successful in
probably<00:01:21.760> four<00:01:22.030> or<00:01:22.060> five<00:01:22.770> instances<00:01:23.770> and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
probably four or five instances and

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.610 
probably four or five instances and
probably<00:01:24.820> checked<00:01:25.090> probably<00:01:25.990> 40<00:01:26.260> or<00:01:26.320> 50

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
probably checked probably 40 or 50

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.800 
probably checked probably 40 or 50
vehicles<00:01:26.770> with<00:01:27.160> it<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.730> even<00:01:28.090> given<00:01:28.330> us<00:01:28.420> intel

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
vehicles with it and even given us intel

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.960 
vehicles with it and even given us intel
on<00:01:29.020> trucks<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.470> we<00:01:29.560> may<00:01:29.730> suspect<00:01:30.730> are

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
on trucks that we may suspect are

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.210 
on trucks that we may suspect are
speeding<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.650> we<00:01:32.710> can<00:01:32.860> check<00:01:33.010> them

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
speeding so that we can check them

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.110 
speeding so that we can check them
further<00:01:33.660> in<00:01:34.660> due<00:01:35.290> time<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.610> fight<00:01:36.850> against

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
further in due time in the fight against

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.790 
further in due time in the fight against
speed<00:01:37.390> yeah<00:01:37.600> it's<00:01:37.750> pretty<00:01:37.900> much<00:01:38.050> another<00:01:38.530> tool

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
speed yeah it's pretty much another tool

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.280 
speed yeah it's pretty much another tool
to<00:01:38.830> help<00:01:38.950> us<00:01:39.330> ensure<00:01:40.330> this<00:01:40.630> compliance<00:01:40.990> on<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
to help us ensure this compliance on the
