now<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:17.580> zoom<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.420> for<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.020> better<00:02:19.140> look

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.010 

we<00:02:22.710> went<00:02:22.920> with<00:02:23.070> excess<00:02:23.670> PC<00:02:24.060> coolant<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.690> then

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
we went with excess PC coolant and then

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.110 
we went with excess PC coolant and then
we've<00:02:25.260> got<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.680> i<00:02:25.830> zoom<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.910> bit

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
we've got if i zoom right in on this bit

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.840 
we've got if i zoom right in on this bit
you'll<00:02:27.300> see<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.950> went<00:02:29.130> with<00:02:29.250> bits<00:02:29.520> power

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
you'll see we went with bits power

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.980 
you'll see we went with bits power
fittings<00:02:30.300> throughout<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:36.510> see<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.810> red

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
hanging off of the IX 1200 I that we've

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.710 
hanging off of the IX 1200 I that we've

got in the bottom really from the
outside<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.320> does<00:02:52.530> look<00:02:54.170> quite<00:02:55.170> sedate<00:02:55.739> and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
outside it does look quite sedate and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.760 
outside it does look quite sedate and
kind<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.570> know<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:57.930> massive<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:58.590> it's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
kind of I know it's massive but it's

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.920 
kind of I know it's massive but it's
relatively<00:02:59.190> understated<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.300> case

relatively understated in the case

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.440 
relatively understated in the case
obviously<00:03:01.170> does<00:03:01.650> swallow<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.820> motherboard

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
obviously does swallow that motherboard

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.479 
obviously does swallow that motherboard
what<00:03:04.350> I'm<00:03:04.440> gonna<00:03:04.530> do<00:03:04.680> quickly<00:03:05.010> now<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.310> I'm

fire the old girl up and then I'll give

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.699 
fire the old girl up and then I'll give
you<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> look<00:03:10.530> at<00:03:10.650> some<00:03:11.400> temperature<00:03:11.850> results

you a look at some temperature results

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.020 
you a look at some temperature results
that<00:03:13.709> we've<00:03:13.830> got<00:03:14.040> while<00:03:14.250> do<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.610> I'll<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.850> some

overclock<00:03:41.220> first<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.000> know<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.299> at<00:03:42.450> an<00:03:42.540> angle

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
overclock first I know it's at an angle

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.400 
overclock first I know it's at an angle
but<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.170> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
but it's just so that you can see the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.850 
but it's just so that you can see the
test<00:03:47.130> results<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.810> that's<00:03:48.989> CPU<00:03:49.500> one<00:03:49.680> point

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
test results so that's CPU one point

bench rig for well since the CPUs
arrived<00:03:59.600> and<00:04:00.600> then<00:04:00.780> we've<00:04:00.900> got<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:02.360> Titan<00:04:03.360> you

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
arrived and then we've got the Titan you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.270 
arrived and then we've got the Titan you
can<00:04:03.780> see<00:04:03.959> we've<00:04:04.170> got<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.500> overclocked<00:04:05.040> as

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
can see we've got that overclocked as

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.890 
can see we've got that overclocked as
well<00:04:07.040> if<00:04:08.040> we<00:04:08.250> move<00:04:08.459> up<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.780> EVGA<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.600> see

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
well if we move up to EVGA you can see

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.949 
well if we move up to EVGA you can see
the<00:04:13.890> settings<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.400> we<00:04:14.700> used<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.299> EVGA

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
the settings that we used on EVGA

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.740 
the settings that we used on EVGA
precision<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.850> then<00:04:17.850> last<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:18.269> not<00:04:18.390> least

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
precision and then last but not least

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.900 
precision and then last but not least
and<00:04:18.959> I'm<00:04:19.019> going<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.260> move<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.709> tripod<00:04:20.430> for

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
and I'm going to move the tripod for

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.690 
and I'm going to move the tripod for
this<00:04:21.060> oh<00:04:21.239> we're<00:04:21.450> straighter<00:04:22.130> we'll<00:04:23.130> zoom<00:04:23.370> in

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
this oh we're straighter we'll zoom in

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.250 
this oh we're straighter we'll zoom in
so<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.539> temps

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
so that you can see the temps

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.150 
so that you can see the temps
now<00:04:25.980> it's<00:04:26.340> worth<00:04:26.550> remembering<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
now it's worth remembering that the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.000 
now it's worth remembering that the
left-hand<00:04:29.900> column<00:04:30.900> is<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.590> current

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
left-hand column is the current

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.040 
left-hand column is the current
temperatures<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:33.120> middle<00:04:33.480> one<00:04:33.720> is<00:04:33.960> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
temperatures the middle one is the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.290 
temperatures the middle one is the
minimum<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:35.280> right<00:04:35.490> hand<00:04:35.700> side<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
minimum the right hand side is the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.030 
minimum the right hand side is the
maximum<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.170> can<00:04:37.290> see<00:04:37.440> there<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.800> one

you<00:04:47.040> may<00:04:47.220> think<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:47.790> you'd<00:04:48.150> want<00:04:48.180> less<00:04:48.840> on

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
you may think that you'd want less on

you may think that you'd want less on
water<00:04:49.500> but<00:04:50.280> it's<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.550> pretty<00:04:50.880> quiet<00:04:51.150> running

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660

rig<00:04:51.870> we've<00:04:52.080> only<00:04:52.230> got<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.410> 360<00:04:53.160> in<00:04:53.250> there<00:04:53.490> that's

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
rig we've only got a 360 in there that's

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.820 
rig we've only got a 360 in there that's
you<00:04:54.270> know<00:04:54.390> below<00:04:54.750> 70<00:04:55.260> degrees

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
you know below 70 degrees

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.600 
you know below 70 degrees
that's<00:04:56.040> perfectly<00:04:56.670> perfectly<00:04:57.150> fine<00:04:57.390> with<00:04:57.660> me

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
that's perfectly perfectly fine with me

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.040 
that's perfectly perfectly fine with me
but<00:04:59.610> then<00:04:59.790> if<00:04:59.940> we<00:04:59.970> go<00:05:00.120> down<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.510> little<00:05:00.810> bit

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
but then if we go down a little bit

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.470 
but then if we go down a little bit
further<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.650> can<00:05:01.950> see<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.400> Titan<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:06.150> we've

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
further you can see the Titan and we've

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.710 
further you can see the Titan and we've
had<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.630> maximum<00:05:07.050> temperature<00:05:07.830> of<00:05:08.150> 36<00:05:09.150> degrees

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
had a maximum temperature of 36 degrees

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.800 
had a maximum temperature of 36 degrees
on<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.020> Titan<00:05:10.320> now<00:05:10.440> that<00:05:10.710> in<00:05:10.920> itself<00:05:10.980> is

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
on the Titan now that in itself is

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.990 
on the Titan now that in itself is
unreal<00:05:12.810> but<00:05:13.680> one<00:05:14.040> of<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.190> things<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.670> know<00:05:14.880> a

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
unreal but one of the things I know a

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.070 
unreal but one of the things I know a
lot<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.180> you'll<00:05:15.360> be<00:05:15.480> jumping<00:05:15.660> about<00:05:15.990> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
lot of you'll be jumping about the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.200 
lot of you'll be jumping about the
temperatures<00:05:16.640> GPU<00:05:18.080> GPUs<00:05:19.080> do<00:05:19.940> as<00:05:20.940> far<00:05:21.180> as

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
temperatures GPU GPUs do as far as

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.910 
temperatures GPU GPUs do as far as
temperatures<00:05:21.510> concerned<00:05:22.110> do<00:05:22.290> really<00:05:22.650> really

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
temperatures concerned do really really

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.730 
temperatures concerned do really really
like<00:05:23.250> water<00:05:23.610> cooling<00:05:24.150> so<00:05:25.140> that's<00:05:25.470> why<00:05:25.710> that

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
like water cooling so that's why that

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.530 
like water cooling so that's why that
temperature<00:05:26.280> so<00:05:26.400> low<00:05:26.550> that's<00:05:26.760> pretty<00:05:27.390> much

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
temperature so low that's pretty much

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.500 
temperature so low that's pretty much
you<00:05:27.870> know<00:05:28.020> as<00:05:28.200> we<00:05:28.500> would<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:28.860> expected<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:30.300> be

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
you know as we would have expected to be

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.830 
you know as we would have expected to be
to<00:05:31.290> be<00:05:31.410> honest<00:05:31.680> about<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:32.130> and<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.390> CPU

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
to be honest about that and so the CPU

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.120 
to be honest about that and so the CPU
temps<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.230> don't<00:05:34.380> forget<00:05:34.530> that's<00:05:34.740> all<00:05:34.950> on<00:05:35.100> a

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
temps and don't forget that's all on a

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.820 
temps and don't forget that's all on a
360<00:05:35.820> degree<00:05:36.060> radio<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.630> we've<00:05:36.750> kept<00:05:36.990> all<00:05:37.260> with

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
360 degree radio and we've kept all with

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.320 
360 degree radio and we've kept all with
the<00:05:38.010> reason<00:05:38.280> why<00:05:38.370> we<00:05:38.520> did<00:05:38.670> it<00:05:38.700> like<00:05:38.910> this<00:05:39.120> with

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
the reason why we did it like this with

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.510 
the reason why we did it like this with
this<00:05:39.510> kit<00:05:39.810> so<00:05:40.500> it's<00:05:40.680> all<00:05:40.800> really<00:05:40.950> accessible

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
this kit so it's all really accessible

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.820 
this kit so it's all really accessible
kit<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.000> not<00:05:42.150> me<00:05:42.270> no<00:05:42.420> for<00:05:42.720> radiators<00:05:43.470> or<00:05:43.620> you

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
kit and not me no for radiators or you

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.940 
kit and not me no for radiators or you
know<00:05:43.950> -<00:05:44.010> for<00:05:44.220> 80s<00:05:44.940> or<00:05:45.120> whatever<00:05:45.420> we<00:05:46.410> kept<00:05:46.650> all

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
know - for 80s or whatever we kept all

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.460 
know - for 80s or whatever we kept all
really<00:05:47.640> kind<00:05:47.850> of<00:05:47.940> minimal<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.510> just<00:05:49.230> to<00:05:49.320> kind

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
really kind of minimal and just to kind

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.670 
really kind of minimal and just to kind
of<00:05:49.620> give<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:49.890> an<00:05:50.010> idea<00:05:50.370> if<00:05:50.550> you<00:05:50.670> were<00:05:50.940> to<00:05:51.240> add<00:05:51.390> a

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
of give you an idea if you were to add a

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.140 
of give you an idea if you were to add a
second<00:05:52.680> 240<00:05:53.190> in<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.400> front<00:05:53.640> only<00:05:53.880> could<00:05:54.120> you

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
second 240 in the front only could you

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.450 
second 240 in the front only could you
easily<00:05:54.720> run<00:05:54.870> another<00:05:55.110> Titan<00:05:55.680> but<00:05:56.220> you<00:05:56.340> could

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
easily run another Titan but you could

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.510 
easily run another Titan but you could
also<00:05:56.580> run<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.270> fan<00:05:57.570> speeds<00:05:57.960> even<00:05:58.140> lower<00:05:58.740> thus

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
also run the fan speeds even lower thus

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.260 
also run the fan speeds even lower thus
making<00:05:59.820> it<00:06:00.090> even<00:06:00.300> quieter<00:06:01.320> anyway<00:06:02.040> I'm<00:06:02.270> almost

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
making it even quieter anyway I'm almost

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.060 
making it even quieter anyway I'm almost
a<00:06:03.390> minute<00:06:03.630> overdue<00:06:04.170> now<00:06:04.380> so<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:04.710> is<00:06:04.800> my<00:06:04.950> own

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
a minute overdue now so this is my own

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.280 
a minute overdue now so this is my own
