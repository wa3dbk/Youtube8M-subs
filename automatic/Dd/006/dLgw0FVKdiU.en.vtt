just a quick little tip of how you

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.180 
just a quick little tip of how you
should<00:06:11.030> maintain<00:06:11.300> curly<00:06:11.960> hair<00:06:12.200> this<00:06:12.440> is<00:06:12.620> ocean

should maintain curly hair this is ocean
wave<00:06:13.640> hair<00:06:13.880> but<00:06:14.090> if<00:06:14.180> it's<00:06:14.330> body<00:06:14.570> wave<00:06:14.840> French

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
wave hair but if it's body wave French

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.180 
wave hair but if it's body wave French
wave<00:06:16.160> deep<00:06:16.820> wave<00:06:17.180> any<00:06:17.960> of<00:06:18.200> those<00:06:18.350> loose<00:06:18.800> curl

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
wave deep wave any of those loose curl

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.310 
wave deep wave any of those loose curl
patterns<00:06:19.670> instead<00:06:20.480> of<00:06:20.600> you<00:06:20.900> know<00:06:20.930> the<00:06:21.140> usual

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
patterns instead of you know the usual

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.990 
patterns instead of you know the usual
people<00:06:21.710> telling<00:06:21.950> you<00:06:22.010> is<00:06:22.160> greater<00:06:22.520> than<00:06:22.610> three

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
people telling you is greater than three

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.880

this<00:06:23.300> is<00:06:23.450> a<00:06:23.480> much<00:06:23.720> better<00:06:23.990> method<00:06:24.260> because<00:06:24.740> it

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
this is a much better method because it

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.580 
this is a much better method because it
gives<00:06:25.100> you<00:06:25.280> a<00:06:25.310> nicer<00:06:25.790> spiral<00:06:26.330> curl<00:06:26.630> rather

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
gives you a nicer spiral curl rather

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.990 
gives you a nicer spiral curl rather
than<00:06:27.800> have<00:06:27.980> a<00:06:28.010> neck<00:06:28.220> tight<00:06:28.490> curl<00:06:28.730> you<00:06:28.850> might

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
than have a neck tight curl you might

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.880 
than have a neck tight curl you might
get<00:06:29.180> if<00:06:29.300> you<00:06:29.390> braid<00:06:29.600> it<00:06:29.690> because<00:06:29.960> once<00:06:30.620> you<00:06:30.740> get

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
get if you braid it because once you get

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.140 
get if you braid it because once you get
towards<00:06:31.190> the<00:06:31.250> bottom<00:06:31.460> and<00:06:31.790> you're<00:06:31.880> braiding

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.640 
towards the bottom and you're braiding
in<00:06:32.270> three<00:06:32.540> you're<00:06:32.690> gonna<00:06:32.780> change<00:06:33.200> the<00:06:33.410> curl

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
in three you're gonna change the curl

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.200 
in three you're gonna change the curl
pattern<00:06:33.980> into<00:06:34.250> that<00:06:34.400> tight<00:06:34.700> braid<00:06:35.000> pattern

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
pattern into that tight braid pattern

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.730 
pattern into that tight braid pattern
then<00:06:35.870> when<00:06:35.990> you<00:06:36.050> take<00:06:36.170> a<00:06:36.230> hero<00:06:36.500> you're<00:06:36.620> gonna
