00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 the consequence of the evening practically 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.650
 simultaneously started work four 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 dance workshop in the central 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.309
 the park danced a classic waltz on 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.590
 Alley on Karl Marx Hip Hop Avenue 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.969
 victory park butt and perhaps the most 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.590
 Numerous became a playground 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.080
 Komsomol pond where participants 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:22.500
 practiced rock and roll and three four five 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.180
 six seven eight and it's amazing that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.920
 all the students were able to repeat 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.630
 the movement that the coach showed well or 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.630
 almost everyone almost succeeded 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.320
 full house 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.320
 opaque 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 I wonder I'll probably be later 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 the work of the leader of the children's camp can 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.789
 put for kids it's a dance he doesn't 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.460
 can principle 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.539
 near as visible so as not to embarrass 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.050
 nonprofessional class showed pros 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.079
 these young 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.079
 and 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.960
 on Karl Marx Avenue was a little 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.710
 less crowded but not less 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.710
 incendiary

 master class in social networks and 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.970
 came to learn a new movement 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.100
 yet like many around without delving into 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.960
 the general meaning of what is happening here is some 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.200
 draw will be and in my opinion soon something 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 there 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.550

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.939
 called kaltsev effect 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.409
 in fact, dancing with meaning is 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.450
