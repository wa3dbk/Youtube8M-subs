00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hey here means that to the limit the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 sun with hydrogen in helium thanks to the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.240
 nuclear fusion and this releases energy that 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.670
 prevents the sun from collapsing on itself 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.370
 gravitationally but what will happen 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.370
 when a sun runs out of hydrogen 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.370
 we started 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.250
 the sun is a sphere of hydrogen in 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.380
 plasma state converts hydrogen into 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.540
 helium thanks to two processes on the one hand 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.150
 the proton proton chain and on the other the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.530
 cycle ceneo thanks to this accumulates helium 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.239
 its core and the energy of these 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.730
 reactions prevents gravity what 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.470
 compress and collapse it however when 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.269
 the hydrogen almost runs out within 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.460
 about five billion years the 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.140
 energy will not be enough and that is 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.269
 will compress thus increasing its temperature 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.890
 inside this will make a layer of 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.269
 hydrogen around the helium nucleus 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.550
 start again to produce energy 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.840
 but much more quickly what 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.399
 will make our sun expand 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.710
 enormously and it becomes a 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.960
 giant red 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.610
 your radio will increase so much that it will reach 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.650
 the orbit of the earth and any 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.450
 ocean will evaporate without a trace 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.470
 ending with life as the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.450
 we know 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.010
 Also, when the hydrogen layer is not 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.290
 be enough to avoid collapse 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.360
 gravitational the nucleus will turn to 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.759
 compress until the log starts to 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.440
 merge at this point the 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.450
 helium will fuse into carbon and oxygen 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.850
 thanks to the process known as triple 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.619
 alpha the production of oxygen is due to 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.330
 the fusion of the carbon nucleus with one 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.770
 of them however this process 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.420
 it will also end when there is no 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.700
 enough helium to merge 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.619
 making the core compress 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.350
 enormously and the temperatures increase 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.240
 unusually at this moment a 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.550
 outer layer of the nucleus will return to 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.619
 merge making the layers 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.270
 of the star are expelled 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.759
 and leaving the core of the star to 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.830
 discovered these layers of gas were 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.630
 they know as planetary nebulae and they are 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.370
 the basic ingredient to create new 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 stars 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.520
 the core of the sun that has remained 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.620
 discovered will be composed 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.870
 mainly by carbon and oxygen to 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.700
 this is known as white dwarf in 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.200
 this phase the sun will only emit the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 thermal energy stored in its 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.580
 inside so the sun will not explode 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.890
 in a supernova your destiny is that of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.360
 cool slowly leaving a dense 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.080
 core for thousands of millions of years 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.080
 very well
