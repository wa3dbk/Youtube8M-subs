 hello youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 opportunity I will show you a design 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.580
 Nail for brides that is very simple 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.990
 we will use as materials is the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.440
 white the white chalk and a glaze 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.060
 milky white color for the base and the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.869
 brightness 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.820
 the pike teeth and a few sparks 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.279
 in this case I will use the one that is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.790
 small little pink flowers 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.820
 smooth and one white for the center 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.470
 to begin with as I had told you 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.610
 suppose first we will be the bottom 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.610
 which is the milky white 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170
 I'm going to do on my nail 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:54.780
 this is the Havana base layer background 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.780
 This color is a very soft color 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.560
 it looks great for this day so 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.410
 special for brides who want 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.269
 look spectacular that day so 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.820
 special 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.640
 then let's wait for it to dry 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.230
 little 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.440
 and we are going to continue 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.060
 a small frames or French as you like 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.909
 call you 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.320
 it is a delicate touch that can be 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.320
 do at the tip 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.939
 you can see it's not difficult to do the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.939
 french 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.100
 waiting for another one that is 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.520
 that a little bit because we are going to adhere 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.620
 now our glitter machines that 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.050
 it's pretty easy 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.370
 with teeth or sticks pica 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.370
 orange tree we can catch 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.270
 the glitter 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.040
 I will put in this case as it is in 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.450
 a corner on the top 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.670
