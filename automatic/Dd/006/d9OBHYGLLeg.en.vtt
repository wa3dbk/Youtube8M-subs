this one today this loves lace has a
smaller<00:01:17.340> sequence<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.270> we'll<00:01:18.479> use<00:01:18.870> smaller

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
smaller sequence so we'll use smaller

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
smaller sequence so we'll use smaller
people<00:01:21.020> these<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.190> flat<00:01:23.190> sequins<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.510> I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
people these are flat sequins and I

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.000 
people these are flat sequins and I
usually<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.640> from<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.830> is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
usually take it out from this so this is

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.280 
usually take it out from this so this is
the<00:01:29.190> way<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:30.090> check<00:01:30.330> them<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.720> now<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.790> can

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
the way to check them out now you can

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.980 
the way to check them out now you can
these<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.350> flat<00:01:34.799> sequins<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.450> bought<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
these are flat sequins and I bought this

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.219 
these are flat sequins and I bought this
belt<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.830> I'm<00:01:38.210> taking<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.299> all<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.690> sequins

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
belt and I'm taking out all the sequins

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.770 
belt and I'm taking out all the sequins
because<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.190> cheaper<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.940> buy<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
because it's much cheaper if you buy a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.030 
because it's much cheaper if you buy a
belt<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:44.010> a<00:01:44.700> hairband<00:01:45.420> full<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.229> sequins<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
belt or a hairband full of sequins and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560 
belt or a hairband full of sequins and
check<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.400> out<00:01:47.520> there's<00:01:47.850> much<00:01:48.060> cheaper

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
check it out there's much cheaper

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.770 
check it out there's much cheaper
because<00:01:49.530> usually<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.400> packages<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.150> come

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
because usually the packages that come

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.399 
because usually the packages that come
in<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.189> few<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.670> them<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.869> this

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
in they have very few of them but this

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.649 
in they have very few of them but this
entire<00:01:55.890> belt<00:01:56.460> has<00:01:57.150> many<00:01:57.930> many<00:01:58.200> many<00:01:58.490> sequins

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
entire belt has many many many sequins

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.920 
entire belt has many many many sequins
so<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:01.470> more<00:02:01.799> cost<00:02:02.159> effective<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.479> let<00:02:03.659> me

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
so it's more cost effective so let me

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.979 
so it's more cost effective so let me
show<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.430> how<00:02:05.430> we're<00:02:06.420> gonna<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:08.989> putting

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
I think we have three three six seven

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.800 
I think we have three three six seven
eight<00:05:48.919> about<00:05:49.250> nine<00:05:49.840> yeah<00:05:50.870> in<00:05:51.200> each<00:05:52.000> side<00:05:53.000> on

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
eight about nine yeah in each side on
top<00:05:54.139> of<00:05:54.380> this

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.020 

we<00:06:23.830> have<00:06:24.420> about<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:26.500> you<00:06:26.770> can't<00:06:27.190> add<00:06:27.610> a<00:06:27.640> little

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
we have about and you can't add a little

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.140 
we have about and you can't add a little
bit<00:06:28.330> of<00:06:28.360> extra<00:06:28.750> glue<00:06:29.200> let<00:06:30.010> it<00:06:30.160> fill<00:06:30.460> it<00:06:30.670> doesn't

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
bit of extra glue let it fill it doesn't

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.380 
bit of extra glue let it fill it doesn't
require<00:06:32.250> because<00:06:33.250> we<00:06:33.640> already<00:06:33.790> have<00:06:34.150> some

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
require because we already have some

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:44.700 
require because we already have some
glue<00:06:36.030> for<00:06:41.850> this<00:06:42.850> one<00:06:43.150> and<00:06:43.750> we<00:06:43.990> will<00:06:44.020> be<00:06:44.410> done

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
glue for this one and we will be done

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.920 
glue for this one and we will be done
with<00:06:44.920> this<00:06:45.130> and<00:06:45.520> then<00:06:45.730> you<00:06:45.880> can<00:06:46.090> do<00:06:46.300> the<00:06:46.510> other

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
with this and then you can do the other

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.030 
with this and then you can do the other
side

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
side

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.970 
side
so<00:06:48.640> main<00:06:49.390> thing<00:06:49.660> is<00:06:50.430> you<00:06:51.430> can<00:06:51.820> use<00:06:52.060> a<00:06:52.980> large

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
so main thing is you can use a large

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.030 
so main thing is you can use a large
confetti<00:06:54.760> which<00:06:55.750> will<00:06:55.990> look<00:06:56.230> exactly<00:06:56.530> like

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040
