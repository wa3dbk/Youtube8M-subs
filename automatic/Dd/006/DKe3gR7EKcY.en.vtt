these<00:04:42.140> years<00:04:42.410> well<00:04:42.710> it<00:04:42.890> sticks<00:04:43.070> in<00:04:43.220> my<00:04:43.250> mind

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
these years well it sticks in my mind

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.340 
these years well it sticks in my mind
because<00:04:43.790> it<00:04:44.090> was<00:04:44.210> gobbledygook<00:04:44.810> at<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.110> time

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
because it was gobbledygook at the time

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.470 
because it was gobbledygook at the time
and<00:04:45.650> therefore<00:04:45.860> ember<00:04:46.700> eyes<00:04:46.820> it<00:04:46.970> like<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.150> card

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480
