00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.440
 compact the diet of the d 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.200
 that cute 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.360
 if he wins 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 to 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.670
 by the author of the song 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.960
 we have to demand 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.890
 Stable is good because throughout 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.839
 this week there was talk that the motherland 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.089
 we had to be with the 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.739
 americans that juanes and I argued that 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.750
 actually I could avoid it to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.010
 Brazil wanted to avoid it and if Argentina 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.839
 is eliminated I wanted Brazil not to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.309
 I was a world champion, I did not care 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.690
 the Latin American brotherhood I do not know what 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.510
 it happens to you 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.440
 it is clear that seeing the big 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.409
 selections 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:14.759
 the powers would be good that I know that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.200
 is a reality germany holland so yes 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.670
 did not come out in the case that Argentina 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.009
 do not leave in return to like that already 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.460
 change brazil uruguay costa rica costa 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.460
 delicious 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.000
 for tiger 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.130
 I'm not playing well 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.520
 greece love 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.530
 and there is one going has I think I feel 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.090
 certain priorities when choosing 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.080
 If it's not Argentina, I'll play by the coast 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.080
 I see it very firm 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.030
 and they never made us strong or that there was 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.030
 a pica 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.450
 holland germany we have it a bit 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.979
 we say but the other way around 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.580
 I hope we can not because we lose a final 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.490
 with Brazil it 's worse than not playing and it would be 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:22.510
 It would be hard but more for them 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.510
 being in your country would be organized 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.290
 but it would be an extraordinary spectacle 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.790
 Brazil has never crossed the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.410
 end of a world cup 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540
 imagine if it happens to happen from one side 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220
 It is also the other one that will go more than one 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 side gives life the other side nothing say 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.530
 the global superclásico two things there 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.150
 to ask that final and a party like 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.480
 that we beat him with the goal of cani but 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.930
 with a goal by messi 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.930
 missing 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.550
 the story because he has asked for jonás the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.250
 galgo gutiérrez who asked is again 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.250
 he wants to hear giordano's story 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:15.830
 and a lot of attention because for me it 's the 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:20.380
 better story so far for my eye I 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.380
 remember much the 86 we go Argentina 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.290
 I get absolutely alves 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.560
 if you have the center abc absolutely 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.670
 free to make the goal there is there 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.480
 it is omen 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.480
 well let's go 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.620
 the Argentines were a bit touched 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.680
 and paranoid with the defeat that 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.599
 tremendous against Germany the 40 against and 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.890
 that conditions a little what can 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.569
 make the team now in this world 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.780
 that everyone is afraid that happens to us 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.120
 the same the four forwards all the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.410
 matches are different take your world 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.210
 and if you can not keep thinking about what 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.940
 that already happened four years ago is a 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.050
 new opportunity and it's how they are 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.000
 giving things 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.150
 it's good for good to follow 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.669
 moving forward you have to think positive and 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.100
 not stay in things that are no longer done 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.570
 many years and now good selected 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.280
 the kun aguero that was the owner 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.600
 let's say to you who you would like 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.039
 between the guard and with grandfather you think 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.200
 that he sometimes the natural represante 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.889
 doing a bit from midfield 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.889
 recover 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.660
 no way 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.830
 the truth that there are many in terms of 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.300
 front there are many players who 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.509
 they can mark an imbalance by the 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.030
 right 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.990
 now with the 433 the other day out there was 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.900
 the party that I liked the most 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.120
 selection or when it comes forward 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.130
 obviously he's going to have out there he's going 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.780
 it's going to be discovered a little behind but it's 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.340
 the selection that we all do not like 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.470
 playing more later being between 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.389
 the ball having mobility creating 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.130
 situations I think the other day was 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.199
 saw the selection that we like everyone 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.260
 well let's listen to the national anthem 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.260
 Argentinian
