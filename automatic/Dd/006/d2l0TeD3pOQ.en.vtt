00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.150
 in yellow the truth is brutal 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.740
 is that this color is very nice and 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.480
 well here we have the lenovo k3 nude that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.519
 It has some very good characteristics 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.950
 for a pretty low price if you want 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.980
 know more about him do not miss this 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.980
 video 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.740
 ah 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.180
 the lenovo castellnou of a fable that has 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.309
 gone to market a few months ago 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.290
 back that is currently having very 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.809
 good acceptance by those who already 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.879
 they have bought and I know that you too 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.160
 will love the link so you can 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.110
 keep an eye on this device what 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.050
 you have in the description of the video like this 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.600
 let's start talking about him we're going to 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.339
 talk about their design and manufacture the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.350
 again kanouté is manufactured a 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.540
 plastic with a simple design but very 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.369
 pretty and striking the yellow color 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.110
 this the truth is that it feels very very 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.390
 well also white but 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.530
 yellow is that he sees it in a video and says 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.770
 it 's nice but he sees it in the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.039
 reality and flipas in colors its good 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.929
 weight is 150 grams and has 8 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.580
 millimeters thick the most relevant thing of 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.180
 This terminal, as I already told you, are the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.340
 colors that present 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.770
 in the front we find ourselves by 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.260
 up the front camera the sensor 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.730
 proximity and the speaker for when 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.860
 we are talking on the phone listening to 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.390
 the other person and also we 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.430
 we find in the bottom part the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.260
 navigation buttons that are outside 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.870
 the screen should be noted that these 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.119
 Menu buttons are not backlit 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.280
 at the top we find 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.050
 the mini usb input to load the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.010
 device and we are also 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.660
 with the 3.5 tag for headphones 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.390
 on the left side we can not find 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.520
 absolutely nothing in the right we 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.920
 we found the power button and the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.080
 volume button to raise and lower it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.450
 in the bottom part we are 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.619
 only with the microphone and the part and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.470
 in the back 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.209
 we have the logo of lenovo a loudspeaker 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 located at the top right and the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.150
 left the camera and the double flash 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.150
 led 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.439
 in the multimedia section or the lenovo 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:24.709
 cut 3 does not have a 5.5 screen 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:27.170
 inches with a full resolution hd a 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.220
 very good resolution for good because 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.950
 for the price that this has 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.640
 device and the panel has a 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.849
 ips technology the rear camera is of 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.340
 13 megapixels and the front camera of 5 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.680
 megapixels yes it is true that it is not the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.689
 best camera on the market or the front 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.849
 and the back but good if you're watching 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.799
 this video you know that both this one and 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.470
 All Chinese mobiles have a worse 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.069
 camera because somewhere they have to 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.299
 to make the mobile cheaper 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.909
 and we have finished with the section 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.849
 multimedia and let's see the section on 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.129
 hardware of this device good the 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.459
 lenovo 4 does not stay behind because 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.829
 It has an 8-core processor 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.670
 specifically the mediatek mtk if they say 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.370
 doubts that I do not say it mediatek mtk 67 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.739
 52 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.290
 and the gpu is a Malian 760 has a 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.790
 ram 2 gb a very good 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.459
 memory because we already know that a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.730
 gigabyte or 1.5 we are left something small 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.220
 but 2GB of RAM I like and 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.099
 I think the storage is adequate 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.530
 internal of this device is 16 GB 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.680
 although it can be expanded up to 32 GB 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.480
 using microsd cards in the section 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.299
 of the software we found that this 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.549
 terminal brings android lollipop 5.0 from 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.090
 Custom factory with a layer of 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:55.000
 personalization of lenovo 'live 2.0 that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.770
 is what this layer is called 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.570
 in terms of connectivity we 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.160
 We find practically everything 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:06.610
 we all go 2g 3g we also have 4g gps 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.020
 wifi bluetooth gsm definitely not 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.110
 we find of all the unique things that we do not 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.520
 we find is therefore the nfc chip that there is 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.280
 many people who use it a lot of people 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.320
 that the Katrin winemaker does not have 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.880
 a 3000 milliamp battery one 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.070
 very good amount for a terminal 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.470
 these dimensions that after being 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.750
 Trying it for several weeks I'm not able 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.650
 to say something bad about it the truth the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.340
 I liked the battery 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.410
 good thing is that I liked it is that it is not 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.210
 for telling you there were three empires that well 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.190
 but he has been testing was 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.370
 using and the performance that has given me 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.990
 really good battery the price 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.570
 this terminal we can find it 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.150
 on the gear best dotcom page from 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.050
 142 euros as I told you at the beginning 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.699
 the link will have it in the description 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.360
 of the video so you can access and 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.949
 have a look and good 142 euros is 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.690
 a pretty tempting price for 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.120
 characteristics that we are seeing from 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.919
 this device and now how do we 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.169
 they always want to dream like the terminal 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.240
 of fluid and how is your performance and 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.610
 for this we will use multitasking and 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.590
 we will open a few applications and 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.790
 Meanwhile, I'm going to tell you 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.340
 in my conclusion about this terminal 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.530
 the de novo to 3 not of which we are 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.440
 talking about positive points 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.630
 how are the battery like I just did 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.330
 to mention how its 2 gb of memory are 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.580
 ram and its processor that I have not been 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.430
 given no problem about everything also 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.190
 a point very very very very very in your favor 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.350
 is the price for less than 200 euros 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.450
 even for less than 150 euros all 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.760
 these features in a device 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.650
 in your hand they are not bad but 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.380
 it also has its weaknesses though 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.360
 they are very few or almost none but good 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.920
 have some for example that comes with 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.170
 two or three installed applications of 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.440
 factory that are almost never used but 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.390
 good that they are there and that they can not be 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.800
 remove no unless the routers the 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.090
 device and may need the 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.160
 applications that come from these 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.430
 Factory do not bother us if we do not use them 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.920
 but good one another point that good that 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.780
 is negative or with or that I did not like 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.360
 The whole thing is that the buttons on the 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.920
 screen the navigation buttons that 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.290
 they are under the screen there 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.070
 are retro- backlit so you do not 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.070
 they light up when 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.920
 whether or not light when 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.960
 when we touch them or make use of 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.090
 them for me this is good when 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.290
 you are at night using the device you 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.030
 tó like that lit up with 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.950
 the buttons to see where the 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.390
 but good that logically are the three 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.830
 Always buttons everyone 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.240
 we know we know how to use it we know where 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.630
 they are so it is also not a major 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.360
 problem and good up to here the review of 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.040
 this device the again with three no 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.480
 give it a like if you want what 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.110
 we draw and we come to a lot 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.960
 of likes 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.320
 I do not know what I'll think I'll talk with the 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.720
 company but we will reach 1500 likes and 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.670
 we raffled it I do not know we'll see finally 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.440
 up to here today's video of tips
