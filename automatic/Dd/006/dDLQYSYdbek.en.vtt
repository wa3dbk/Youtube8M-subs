00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.280
 this is the salt cellar that we are going to decorate 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.130
 this time what I'm going to do is remove the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.869
 bowl face 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.869
 and here on the shore I'm going to put 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.670
 two strips of this ribbon this is a 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.130
 satin ribbon with gold border as 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.969
 3 mm 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.239
 with silicon valley paste a strip by 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.239
 here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.770
 at the border 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.590
 and so 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.590
 with other 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.490
 I'm going to go holding it 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.730
 lover putting on the edges that is 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.100
 where 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.100
 more makes more tension 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.880
 now I have this lace look two 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.590
 centimeters a shore 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.229
 and I'm going to stick it here where it ends 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.750
 white from here and if 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.229
 outside a little skirt and also here at 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.229
 edge 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.200
 exactly where the stopper ends 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.200
 one full turn 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.700
 here I have this velvet leaf of 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.700
 vine is a dog 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.620
 and this is a golden rose with sparks 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.299
 I'm going to ride like this 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.299
 I'm going to cut these stems 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.690
 I'm going to cost the little bag where it has 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.690
 more aspects of being bullshit 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.980
 first here I'm going to look where I made the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.540
 lace joints because this will help 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.879
 disguise a little 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.489
 and I'm going to pay her here like this for him 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.079
 with silicone this has that to the field 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.129
 so I'm going to bend it when I have 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.129
 put in the salt shaker 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.480
 exactly here 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.670
 d 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.200
 and these little sheets are also going to be fixed 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.099
 here with 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.099
 mini droplet 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.010
 so he does not get up 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.069
 do not go to fall when you 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.069
 they are using 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.920
 there I have that this last leaf also 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.430
 the case is fit close as a 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.430
 so much 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.440
 and here in the center of the sheet I'm going to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.440
 place the rose 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.690
 a silicon worm 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.260
 the first base 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.510
 we have a very appropriate salt shaker 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.640
 for a wedding where there is the nature of 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.830
 through 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.830
 a very romantic people clear
