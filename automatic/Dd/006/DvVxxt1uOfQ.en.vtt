 what else awaits us 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.510
 we enter the car in a truly unconventional way 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.330
 because now from the passenger side there is a reverse door 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.730

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.640
 show the prizes up for grabs 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.390
