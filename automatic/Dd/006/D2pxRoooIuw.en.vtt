00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
happens to be one of my favorite and it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
happens to be one of my favorite and it
should<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.809> been<00:00:57.899> done<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:59.000> o-rings<00:01:00.000> or

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
should have been done with o-rings or

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
should have been done with o-rings or
binder<00:01:00.719> rings<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.170> whatever<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.730> did

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
binder rings or whatever but it just did

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
binder rings or whatever but it just did
not<00:01:02.940> fit<00:01:03.329> too<00:01:03.480> well<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> pages<00:01:04.379> were

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
not fit too well because the pages were

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.490 
not fit too well because the pages were
so<00:01:04.680> thick<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> ended<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.640> using<00:01:05.909> black<00:01:06.500> satin

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so thick so I ended up using black satin

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
so thick so I ended up using black satin
ribbon<00:01:07.820> ok<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.000> usually<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.510> she<00:01:09.750> does<00:01:09.900> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
ribbon ok but usually what she does is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
ribbon ok but usually what she does is
she<00:01:10.140> uses<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> binder<00:01:11.130> rings<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.060> she

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
she uses the binder rings and then she

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.640 
she uses the binder rings and then she
puts<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> whole<00:01:12.570> bunch<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.080> ribbon<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
puts a whole bunch of like ribbon and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
puts a whole bunch of like ribbon and
and<00:01:13.830> fibers<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> ring<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.270> can't

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and fibers on the ring so you can't

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.710 
and fibers on the ring so you can't
really<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.430> ended<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.420> using

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
really see it but I ended up just using

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.660 
really see it but I ended up just using
the<00:01:19.500> ribbon<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> actually<00:01:20.280> came<00:01:20.580> out

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the ribbon and it actually came out

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
the ribbon and it actually came out
pretty<00:01:20.820> good<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:21.509> turns<00:01:22.439> better

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
pretty good and it actually turns better

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
pretty good and it actually turns better
and<00:01:23.009> fits<00:01:23.250> better<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.420> course<00:01:24.450> it's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and fits better so and of course it's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.630 
and fits better so and of course it's
super<00:01:25.080> thick<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.950> pages<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
super thick because the pages are very

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.210 
super thick because the pages are very
dimensional<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.009> bit<00:01:29.100> about

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
dimensional so just a little bit about

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330
