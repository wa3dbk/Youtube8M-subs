April

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
April

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.819 
April
2013<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.899> I<00:01:33.960> maybe<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.350> wrote<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.679> year

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
2013 I think I maybe I wrote the year

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
2013 I think I maybe I wrote the year
down<00:01:35.009> along<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.640> either<00:01:36.479> way<00:01:36.689> these<00:01:36.899> an<00:01:37.049> oil

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
down along but either way these an oil

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950 
down along but either way these an oil
change<00:01:37.289> so<00:01:37.820> I'll<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
change so I'll have to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.780 
change so I'll have to
on<00:01:41.020> that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
on that

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.720 
on that
but<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.360> still<00:01:43.540> rides<00:01:43.810> okay<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:45.310> shaky

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
but it still rides okay little shaky

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.230 
but it still rides okay little shaky
upfront

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
upfront

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.630 
upfront
probably<00:01:46.720> some

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
probably some

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.150 
probably some
the<00:01:47.970> issues<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> tire<00:01:49.080> balance<00:01:49.380> pulls

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
the issues with the tire balance pulls

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.790 
the issues with the tire balance pulls
to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.400> I<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:52.230> strut<00:01:52.530> in

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
to the right I know that's the strut in

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.190 
to the right I know that's the strut in
the<00:01:52.920> alignment<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.610> that's<00:01:53.790> no<00:01:53.940> big<00:01:54.150> deal

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.010 

they<00:01:56.710> said<00:01:56.979> sometime<00:01:57.430> maybe<00:01:57.700> buy<00:01:58.540> another<00:01:58.750> car

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
they said sometime maybe buy another car

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.080 
they said sometime maybe buy another car
and<00:01:59.530> it'll<00:01:59.710> it<00:02:00.220> works<00:02:00.430> for<00:02:00.759> now

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.040
