then<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.700> two<00:01:35.820> screens<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
then you get two screens like this you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
then you get two screens like this you
go<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> settings<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.640> down<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
go to settings and you go down here to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810 
go to settings and you go down here to
your<00:01:39.570> wireless<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.560> Internet<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
your wireless and Internet and then you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.190 
your wireless and Internet and then you
go<00:01:42.030> what

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
go what

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.130 
go what
who<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> car<00:01:44.790> I've<00:01:45.210> seen<00:01:45.570> routers

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
who put that in a car I've seen routers

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.899 
who put that in a car I've seen routers
that<00:01:46.170> are<00:01:46.500> simpler<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> configure<00:01:47.490> than<00:01:47.729> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that are simpler to configure than this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.940 
that are simpler to configure than this
so<00:01:48.450> they're<00:01:48.840> still<00:01:49.110> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> drinking<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so they're still kind of drinking the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.550 
so they're still kind of drinking the
kool-aid<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:51.090> media<00:01:51.390> choices<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:51.960> many<00:01:52.320> on

these systems from USB drives you have

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810 
these systems from USB drives you have

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.449 
other hand kind of a paucity of apps
really<00:02:11.720> aren't<00:02:11.990> any<00:02:12.200> because<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.890> irony<00:02:13.340> with

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
really aren't any because the irony with

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
high-end my touch interface you don't

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.170 
high-end my touch interface you don't
get<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.500> broad<00:02:18.890> support<00:02:19.220> for<00:02:19.580> apps<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.090> you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
get the broad support for apps that you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.690 
get the broad support for apps that you
get<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:20.810> sync<00:02:21.290> at<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.560> lower<00:02:21.980> level<00:02:22.130> that's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
get with sync at a lower level that's

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.520 
get with sync at a lower level that's
been<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> weird<00:02:23.239> schism<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.840> Ford<00:02:24.140> layout

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
been a weird schism in the Ford layout

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.620 
been a weird schism in the Ford layout
and<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.770> still<00:02:25.040> continues<00:02:25.550> here<00:02:25.849> now<00:02:26.450> another

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
and it still continues here now another

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.760 
and it still continues here now another
thing<00:02:26.750> they've<00:02:26.930> improved<00:02:27.170> dramatically

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
thing they've improved dramatically

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.100 
thing they've improved dramatically
finally<00:02:28.430> are<00:02:28.580> these<00:02:28.940> two<00:02:29.209> touch<00:02:29.510> ribbons<00:02:29.930> for

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
finally are these two touch ribbons for

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.770 
finally are these two touch ribbons for
volume<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.800> for<00:02:31.250> fan<00:02:31.610> now<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.360> works<00:02:32.510> really

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
volume and for fan now it works really

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.050 
volume and for fan now it works really
well<00:02:32.900> volume<00:02:33.770> goes<00:02:33.980> up<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.400> down<00:02:34.459> smoothly

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
well volume goes up and down smoothly

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.690 
well volume goes up and down smoothly
the<00:02:35.510> fan<00:02:35.750> goes<00:02:36.020> up<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.440> down<00:02:36.500> smoothly<00:02:37.100> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
the fan goes up and down smoothly the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.820 
the fan goes up and down smoothly the
first<00:02:37.940> time<00:02:38.239> other<00:02:38.600> controls<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.680> be<00:02:39.800> a

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
first time other controls here can be a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.650 
first time other controls here can be a
little<00:02:40.130> nebulous<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.670> mean<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.849> just<00:02:41.120> touch<00:02:41.390> on

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
little nebulous I mean you just touch on

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.840 
little nebulous I mean you just touch on
the<00:02:41.720> actual<00:02:42.200> bezel<00:02:42.709> here<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:43.400> things<00:02:43.670> like

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
the actual bezel here to do things like

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.550 
the actual bezel here to do things like
temperature<00:02:44.450> raise<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.050> tuning<00:02:45.440> and

shifter<00:02:48.620> over<00:02:48.860> here<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.250> have<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.489> gripe<00:02:49.850> with

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
shifter over here I have a gripe with

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.690 
shifter over here I have a gripe with
these<00:02:50.299> they<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.140> feel<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.860> operate<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.489> same

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
these they all feel and operate the same

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.850 
these they all feel and operate the same
way<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.209> may<00:02:53.360> sound<00:02:53.630> obvious<00:02:53.870> but<00:02:54.200> that

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
way and that may sound obvious but that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.229 
way and that may sound obvious but that
means<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.280> they<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.610> have<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.850> unique

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
means that they don't have a unique

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.940 
means that they don't have a unique
personality<00:02:56.780> which<00:02:57.049> i<00:02:57.140> think<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.470> important

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
personality which i think is important

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.710 
personality which i think is important
for<00:02:58.069> drive<00:02:58.430> controls<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.209> seems<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.510> little

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
for drive controls it seems a little

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.780 
for drive controls it seems a little
little<00:03:00.410> too<00:03:00.620> easy<00:03:00.830> for<00:03:00.980> me<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.280> change<00:03:01.489> modes

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
little too easy for me to change modes

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.610 
little too easy for me to change modes
now<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.420> course<00:03:02.540> by<00:03:02.720> not<00:03:02.900> having<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.260> shifter

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
now of course by not having a shifter

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.900 
now of course by not having a shifter
here<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.010> moving<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.340> these<00:03:04.519> buttons<00:03:04.819> you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
here and moving it to these buttons you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.850 
here and moving it to these buttons you
pick<00:03:05.150> up<00:03:05.299> some<00:03:05.450> more<00:03:05.540> console<00:03:06.019> space<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.769> of

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
pick up some more console space and of

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.320 
pick up some more console space and of
course<00:03:07.040> we've<00:03:07.220> seen<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.580> mini<00:03:07.730> screens<00:03:08.090> over

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
course we've seen the mini screens over

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.479 
course we've seen the mini screens over
here<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.110> sides<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.950> speedometer<00:03:10.459> the

and<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.400> is<00:04:58.670> just<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.210> lackluster<00:05:00.110> powertrain

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
and that is just a lackluster powertrain

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.220 
and that is just a lackluster powertrain
get<00:05:01.670> on<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:01.880> pedal<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.300> things<00:05:02.540> start<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.960> rev

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
get on the pedal and things start to rev

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.410 
get on the pedal and things start to rev
but<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.770> power<00:05:03.980> doesn't<00:05:04.400> arrive<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.240> car

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
but the power doesn't arrive and the car

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.900 
but the power doesn't arrive and the car
almost<00:05:05.600> never<00:05:06.050> runs<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.680> even<00:05:07.160> mode<00:05:07.430> which<00:05:07.640> is

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
almost never runs in even mode which is

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.570 
almost never runs in even mode which is
very<00:05:08.210> nice<00:05:08.480> when<00:05:08.810> it<00:05:08.930> works<00:05:09.140> torquey<00:05:09.890> silent

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
very nice when it works torquey silent

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.250 
very nice when it works torquey silent
that's<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.880> cool<00:05:11.090> thing<00:05:11.360> about<00:05:11.480> some<00:05:11.870> hybrids

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
that's a cool thing about some hybrids

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.420 
that's a cool thing about some hybrids
this<00:05:12.350> one<00:05:12.500> doesn't<00:05:12.740> do<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.100> engines

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
this one doesn't do that the engines

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.190 
this one doesn't do that the engines
almost<00:05:13.670> always<00:05:13.850> on<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.660> sounds<00:05:14.960> like<00:05:15.080> the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
almost always on and it sounds like the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.200 
almost always on and it sounds like the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.640 
calling BS on that 129 foot pound rating
that<00:05:20.510> just<00:05:20.780> can't<00:05:21.020> be<00:05:21.080> right<00:05:21.350> because<00:05:21.380> this

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
that just can't be right because this

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.920 
that just can't be right because this
