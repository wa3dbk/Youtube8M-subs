the mind game anyway at least we know

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.870 
the mind game anyway at least we know
one<00:00:47.450> positive<00:00:47.690> thing<00:00:47.899> that<00:00:48.140> came<00:00:48.290> from<00:00:48.410> today

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
one positive thing that came from today

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.620 
one positive thing that came from today
was<00:00:49.880> that<00:00:52.000> Joe<00:00:53.000> couldn't<00:00:53.300> take<00:00:53.390> our<00:00:53.510> eyes<00:00:53.570> off

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
was that Joe couldn't take our eyes off

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.420 
was that Joe couldn't take our eyes off
you<00:00:53.840> could<00:00:54.020> she

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.560 

um<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.350> next<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:59.180> there's<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.240> lot<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
um in this next one there's a lot of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.640 
um in this next one there's a lot of
sort<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.810> emphasis<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.560> relationship

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
sort of emphasis on the relationship

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.250 
sort of emphasis on the relationship
between<00:01:02.010> Hermione<00:01:02.580> and<00:01:02.850> Ron<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.930> think

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
between Hermione and Ron and I think

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.640 
between Hermione and Ron and I think
this<00:01:04.440> next<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:06.030> comic<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
this next one will be more comic and I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.900 
this next one will be more comic and I
think<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> last<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.280> lot<00:01:08.400> darker<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
think the last one was a lot darker and

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.210 
think the last one was a lot darker and
heavier<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.690> this<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.320> funnier<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
heavier and this one will be funnier and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
heavier and this one will be funnier and
more<00:01:11.280> lighthearted<00:01:11.810> yeah<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:12.930> changes<00:01:13.230> quite

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
more lighthearted yeah he changes quite

I<00:01:29.760> guess<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> pathology<00:01:30.960> she<00:01:31.830> developed

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I guess in the pathology she developed

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.830 
I guess in the pathology she developed
quite<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.430> Ginny<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> character<00:01:33.330> though

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
quite a lot Ginny as a character though

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
quite a lot Ginny as a character though
scream<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.729> more

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
scream a bit more I see in a bit more

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.190 
scream a bit more I see in a bit more
outgoing<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.660> in<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:36.990> she

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
outgoing but I think in this one she

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.290 
outgoing but I think in this one she
kind<00:01:37.410> of<00:01:37.470> she's<00:01:38.100> done<00:01:38.340> her<00:01:38.580> kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> stepping

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
kind of she's done her kind of stepping

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.910 
kind of she's done her kind of stepping
out<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.690> bit<00:01:39.900> more<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.110> she's<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> settled

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
out a bit more and she's kind of settled

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.710 
out a bit more and she's kind of settled
them<00:01:41.040> more<00:01:41.250> settle<00:01:41.640> down<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.150> she's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
them more settle down and she's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.920 
them more settle down and she's
therefore<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.670> help<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.510> think

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
therefore you know to help and I think

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.680 
therefore you know to help and I think
she<00:01:46.200> becomes<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.650> bit<00:01:46.800> more<00:01:47.030> kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.119> connected

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
she becomes a bit more kind of connected

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.180 
she becomes a bit more kind of connected
to<00:01:48.720> Harry<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> different<00:01:49.530> things<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.420> you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
to Harry and different things so you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.490 
to Harry and different things so you
know<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:54.240> think<00:01:54.390> Luna<00:01:54.690> changes<00:01:55.259> much

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
know and I don't think Luna changes much

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.740 
know and I don't think Luna changes much
I<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.369> all<00:01:56.759> through<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> whole<00:01:57.360> book

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
I think like all through the whole book

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
I think like all through the whole book
series<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:58.470> think<00:01:58.860> she'll<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.220> forevermore

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
series and I think she'll be forevermore

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.970 
series and I think she'll be forevermore
she'll<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.450> how<00:02:00.600> she<00:02:00.660> is<00:02:00.870> as<00:02:01.320> she<00:02:01.380> first

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
she'll be just how she is as she first

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.150 
she'll be just how she is as she first
appeared<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:03.050> maybe<00:02:04.050> grow<00:02:04.350> bits<00:02:04.650> hopefully

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
appeared and maybe grow bits hopefully

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
but I can't imagine that she she plays

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.420 
but I can't imagine that she she plays
such<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.680> an<00:03:12.480> important<00:03:13.480> role<00:03:13.890> because<00:03:14.890> Harry's

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
such a an important role because Harry's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.259 
such a an important role because Harry's
over<00:03:16.060> her<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.600> he's<00:03:17.260> moved<00:03:17.470> on<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.800> Ginny<00:03:18.269> so

over her and he's moved on to Ginny so

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.750 
over her and he's moved on to Ginny so
she's<00:03:19.510> kind<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:20.260> left<00:03:20.470> behind<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:21.400> in

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
she's kind of that left behind and in

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.420 
she's kind of that left behind and in
the<00:03:21.880> sixth<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.530> think<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.980> know<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.130> get<00:03:24.400> a

the sixth I think you know you get a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.810 
the sixth I think you know you get a
glimpse<00:03:24.700> into<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:26.680> get<00:03:26.860> a<00:03:26.920> greater<00:03:27.489> insight

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820

into<00:03:27.880> Harry<00:03:28.269> sense<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.630> humor<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.110> think<00:03:29.319> if<00:03:29.680> I

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
into Harry sense of humor I think if I

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.280 
into Harry sense of humor I think if I
think<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.850> safe<00:03:31.030> generally<00:03:31.450> is<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.780> lot

think the safe generally is a lot

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.690 
think the safe generally is a lot
funnier<00:03:32.620> than<00:03:32.950> anything<00:03:33.220> else<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.640> been
