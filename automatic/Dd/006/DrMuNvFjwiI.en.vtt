00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
 (vibrant music) 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.940
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.620
 Welcome to my cooking channel! 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 Today we are going to make ttalgi jam or ttalgi. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.020
 Ttalgi means 'strawberry', strawberry jam. 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.060
 I have been doing ttalgi cardboard for my family for a long time. 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.360
 I use it to make a huge amount. 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.500
 But today I only have one pound of strawberries, 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.520
 Small part. 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.980
 All Korean housewives, they will make their own strawberry jam, 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880
 Especially during the strawberry season. 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.300
 But these days, strawberries can be used all year round. 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.540
 By the way, my 'bread' video has been uploaded, 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.860
 Just in the previous video 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 Then I promised that I will take this strawberry jam video for you. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.300
 So today, I only have a pound of strawberries for this. 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.540
 Really beautiful, is it? 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 These strawberries are beautiful. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.740
 Then remove the stem. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.720
 Add half a cup of sugar. 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 Close the lid, 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.340
 Then cook over medium heat. 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.860
 Today I bought a really high quality, is a very good size strawberry. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580
 But usually we make a really smaller one. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.200
 After about twelve minutes, then it was really boiling. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.960
 Potato masher. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520
 From this moment, you don't need to cover 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.940
 Until the strawberry jam is finished. 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.200
 Reduce heat, medium to low. 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.740
 My bread is finished, 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 My strawberry jam is still hot. 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.080
 Wowowow 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.700
 wonderful 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.660
 Oh my God. 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.080
 Then smash it, 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.540
 Crushed 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.500
 So this density, 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.000
 It is like a jelly that is still running nose 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.380
 As it cools, it will become a bit thicker. 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.820
 With a pound of strawberries, we can make a cup 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.500
 Strawberry jam 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.300
 You like to have a very special weekend day, 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.180
 Then, do it (referring to strawberry jam). 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.000
 This small jar is a half cup. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.820
 So we made a cup. 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.360
 Both jars are filled with this strawberry jam. 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.220
 Hot bread, hot strawberry jam. 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.500
 too delicious! 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.640
 Today we make strawberry jam 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.640
 Korean name: "ttalgi jam" 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.940
 When it runs out, 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.160
 When you think about eating again, 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.060
 Just do it again! 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.420
 Just pick up a packet of strawberries and you can do it. 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.060
 Simple, easy and easy. 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.840
 Like my strawberry sauce recipe everyone. 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.340
 see you later! 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.840
 Goodbye!
