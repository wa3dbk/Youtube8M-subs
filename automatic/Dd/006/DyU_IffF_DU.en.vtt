model saying that don't look at this

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.430 
model saying that don't look at this
there's<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> ceiling<00:02:29.630> on<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.290> can

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
there's like a ceiling on it you can

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.110 
there's like a ceiling on it you can
really<00:02:30.739> make<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.920> lot<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.220> money<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.760> can<00:02:31.880> take
