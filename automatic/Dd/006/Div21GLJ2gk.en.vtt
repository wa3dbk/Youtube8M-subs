and this one you'll undo this nut here

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
and this one you'll undo this nut here
we<00:00:47.129> would<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> power<00:00:47.730> gum<00:00:48.000> socket<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> or

we would use a power gum socket on it or

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
we would use a power gum socket on it or
you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.050> use<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.230> socket<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> long<00:00:50.039> bar<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you can use a socket with a long bar and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.670 
you can use a socket with a long bar and
you<00:00:51.510> might<00:00:51.719> need<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> put<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> socket<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you might need to put a socket on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
you might need to put a socket on the
other<00:00:52.800> side<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.250> hold<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> spindle<00:00:53.789> steady

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
other side to hold the spindle steady

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
other side to hold the spindle steady
why<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.780> undo<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> once<00:00:55.920> you've<00:00:56.160> loosened

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
why you undo it once you've loosened

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.130 
why you undo it once you've loosened
that<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.850> you'll<00:00:57.059> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> loosen<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.809> just

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that off you'll need to loosen it just

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
that off you'll need to loosen it just
so<00:00:58.320> you've<00:00:58.469> got<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> gap<00:00:59.039> behind<00:00:59.250> than

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so you've got a bit of a gap behind than

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.510 
so you've got a bit of a gap behind than
that<00:00:59.809> then<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.289> loosen<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.280> one

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
that then you would loosen on this one

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.479 
that then you would loosen on this one
you<00:01:03.510> loosen<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.320> lock<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.040> both

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you loosen the lock on that here both

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
you loosen the lock on that here both
sides<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.090> you've<00:01:06.780> got<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.320> bit

do the outside edge and again keep ten
in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.009> real<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.689> for

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
in the real so out for this one for

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.510 
in the real so out for this one for
example<00:02:03.840> right<00:02:04.909> on<00:02:06.979> turn<00:02:07.979> chain<00:02:10.370> yeah<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> think

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
example right on turn chain yeah I think

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.809 
example right on turn chain yeah I think
to<00:02:11.730> check<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:12.360> sure<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.200> marks<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:14.099> here<00:02:14.550> on

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
to check make sure the marks in here on

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.830 
to check make sure the marks in here on
you<00:02:15.090> alignment<00:02:15.629> see<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.110> one<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:17.840> make

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you alignment see this one to you make

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.510 
you alignment see this one to you make
sure<00:02:19.160> you've<00:02:20.160> got<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.400> same<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:21.480> both<00:02:21.510> sides

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
sure you've got the same on both sides

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.050 
sure you've got the same on both sides
otherwise<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.540> real<00:02:24.660> could<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.930> out<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.050> line

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
otherwise the real could be out of line

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.520 
otherwise the real could be out of line
now<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.390> get<00:02:27.569> our<00:02:27.660> bikes<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.349> cat

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
now you can get our bikes like the cat

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.500 
now you can get our bikes like the cat
is<00:02:28.680> here<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> different

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
is here they can have a different

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.020 
is here they can have a different
arrangement<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.080> single<00:02:31.110> sided<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.250> deville

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
arrangement a single sided I deville

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.600 
arrangement a single sided I deville
onion<00:02:33.360> mounts<00:02:33.709> through<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:34.860> side<00:02:35.160> as<00:02:35.489> you'll

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
onion mounts through one side as you'll

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.210 
onion mounts through one side as you'll
see<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.000> nice<00:02:36.360> being<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.989> other<00:02:37.080> side

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
see here nice being on the other side

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.479 
see here nice being on the other side
now<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.280> adjust<00:02:38.640> these<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.489> register

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
now to adjust these you have a register

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.850 
now to adjust these you have a register
in<00:02:42.349> here<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.810> concentric<00:02:46.260> adjuster

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
in here and it's a concentric adjuster

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.619 
in here and it's a concentric adjuster
which<00:02:47.010> basically<00:02:47.310> means<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:48.030> spindle<00:02:48.390> was

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
which basically means this spindle was

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.119 
which basically means this spindle was
upset<00:02:49.050> if<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.860> turn<00:02:50.129> it<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.580> will<00:02:50.730> turn<00:02:52.129> like

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
upset if you turn it it will turn like

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.500 
upset if you turn it it will turn like
so<00:02:53.840> tightening<00:02:54.840> or<00:02:54.900> loosening<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.349> chain<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
so tightening or loosening the chain and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.199 
so tightening or loosening the chain and
you<00:02:57.510> use<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> tool<00:02:58.050> very<00:02:58.440> much<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:59.209> and

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
you use a tool very much like this and

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.619 
you use a tool very much like this and
hook<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.709> either<00:03:01.860> tighten<00:03:02.540> turn<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
hook it on so either tighten turn the

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.620 
hook it on so either tighten turn the
other<00:03:03.690> way<00:03:04.099> using<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.280> chain

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.540 

and<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.260> have<00:03:09.410> two<00:03:09.620> little<00:03:09.770> pinch<00:03:10.040> bolts<00:03:10.370> here

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
and you have two little pinch bolts here

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.680 
and you have two little pinch bolts here
you<00:03:11.450> have<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.810> undo<00:03:12.050> first<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:14.030> they<00:03:14.150> hold<00:03:14.360> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
you have to undo first and they hold it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.580 
you have to undo first and they hold it
all<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.530> place<00:03:16.810> that's<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.930> quick<00:03:18.080> guide<00:03:18.290> to

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
all in place that's a quick guide to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.550 
all in place that's a quick guide to
just<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:19.190> your<00:03:19.340> chain
