00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and it's just a lot more easier I would

is<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.740> adds<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.129> little<00:02:08.340> bit<00:02:08.489> more<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
is that it adds a little bit more of a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.880
