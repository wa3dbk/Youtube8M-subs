00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.740
 Hello, my little guardians, how are you? 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.690
 you are welcome to a new video of 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.910
 destiny and today I want to share with 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.280
 you certain information that has 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.410
 recently filtered and is referring to the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.599
 future of destiny and the future of our 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.900
 favorite game good before entering 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.269
 good stuff I tell you that 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.840
 you're going to see a pretty lot in the background 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.910
 fast and dynamic I did the week 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.769
 not the other one in the previous ones 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.949
 osiris tests and well you'll see that 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.080
 here is tomato hehehe and good tomatito 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.970
 well of nothing apart from this that I just 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.460
 to comment we are already in matter and 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.250
 let's talk about the future of destiny and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.900
 of the future of lc that equal some of 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.449
 you have already heard and that 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.670
 called the taken king or something like the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.879
 king taken good where this has come from 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.530
 information because this information started 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.420
 good as a leak on the part of 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.820
 the red bull company you already know the one of this 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.199
 energy drink and through a 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.119
 merchandising a kind of contest 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.240
 that was done because they already gave the name of 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.509
 this one of this next of lcd marine 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.119
 this has been let's say the detonator already 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.460
 From there because the web famously 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.680
 Kotaku famous web game since 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.049
 also leaked some good information 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.200
 just as I am going to detail you right now 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.080
 not on the one hand we have the good in 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.030
 beginning release date the good 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.880
 the date seems to be confirmed 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.560
 As on September 15, I already tell you that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.659
 all this must be taken a little bit with 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.270
 tweezers because that's what happens with the 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.860
 leaks you already know that I think I am 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.450
 of the opinion that if something has leaked 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.459
 it's because there's really something behind 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.130
 all this but neither should we take 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.420
 so to the letter so good 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.340
 have it be very present then what 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.659
 I was telling you the date seems to be the 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.299
 September 15 release date 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.649
 and the price talking about the price 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.610
 It will be nothing cheap because we are talking 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.560
 of a price of 40 dollars is nothing 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.049
 bad would be more or less what they have cost 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.189
 the two expansions uy go here granada 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:09.069
 mark me there because as I said it will be the 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.209
 price seems to be like good equivalent 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.380
 to the two expansions that have come out 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.180
 so far not that more or less then 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.090
 they come to cost the same 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.069
 well, following a little bit with the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.650
 content with the content of this 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.859
 next dlc it seems that it will include a 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.010
 campaign where our antagonist is going to 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.390
 be orix you know dad decrees this 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.989
 dad decrees I do not want I do not want nor 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.700
 imagine how it will be like orix because 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.859
 seeing his son well surely 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.319
 that as the saying of such a man says 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.930
 not good but it seems that the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.180
 history because that will put there at the point 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.910
 to look at this this bad malote this 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.180
 bad bad 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.830
 orix and good it seems that it will have a 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.630
 army that will follow him until the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.820
 death and that will put us then 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.010
 surely that the situation and things 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.370
 well quite complicated 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.860
 good apart from this well 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.989
 as I said you will logically include 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.360
 a new raid I say logically because 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.220
 even bungee already confirmed that for 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.560
 next of leces because we would have 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.940
 is with this new kingdom that 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.700
 surely it will also be based 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.769
 in the in the hive apart from this new 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.390
 root will logically also include 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:24.209
 assaults good events etcetera and knew 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.069
 that for good the price that it will have and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.420
 what it will occupy seems to be 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.239
 also that it's going to be an extension 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.190
 quite large has even been rumored 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.739
 also that it is possible that it comes to the 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.620
 sale in physical format as a good 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.269
 a game with the expansion not good then 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.769
 this I already tell you that it will be indicative of 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.299
 that this expansion is not going to be small 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.180
 precisely and as I tell you then 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.280
 of all the content that will include then 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.200
 The price also gives us a little bit 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.849
 a reference just fine and going back to 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.000
 content that we will find in this 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.220
 future d lc do not forget the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.650
 subclasses that we have pending in each 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.470
 one of our guardians making a 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.440
 review you know that the sorcerer is 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.940
 lack of element or arch of 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.890
 electrical element and it seems to be 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.230
 will have a super mega storm 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.860
 electric that will make the delights of 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.380
 the most sparkling go how funny 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.690
 well then we continue with the hunters 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.989
 you know that the hunters are 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.480
 lacking emptiness and we will count with 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.090
 a kind of vacuum arch never better 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.500
 said that also because it seems that 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.410
 will make a kind of hole in the ground 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.390
 and will paralyze the 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.720
 enemies and so on, you know what 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:41.040
 well there will be something related to 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.860
 him with vacuum damage and to finish 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.710
 then we have the titans that will count 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.930
 with a new subclass a kind of 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.750
 Solar hammer referring to 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.580
 Fire damage that seems to be going to 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.310
 hit pretty hard enough and 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.530
 warm good the truth that I have 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.990
 pretty curious to know how they will be 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.760
 these subclasses finally and what is it 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.160
 that they will include and what options 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.780
 we will have there to configure us 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.550
 is this new subclass as I said 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.070
 the truth that I suppose if we have 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.569
 been waiting so long because no 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.099
 I think we are disappointed 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.009
 and well, that will expand much more 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.050
 you know then the whole theme of gameplay 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.569
 and fun in the game and that 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.249
 each one, well, always, how many more 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.869
 options we have, it will be easier 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:26.999
 find one that we like more and with the 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:28.379
 that we feel more comfortable well 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:31.080
 Now I want to ask you a question to 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.289
 all of you is next what 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.479
 you wait for the new expansion 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.009
 of destiny what little things you would like to see 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.699
 in the new expansion that right now 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:44.429
 you have or not or you do not see and well, this one 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.229
 will be our request we will do in 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:48.029
 set for destin and so that we 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.419
 listen and to consider it 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.740
 is to our requests so nothing 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.849
 I hope you have entertained this 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.809
 background gameplay I hope that the 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.449
 information you have found 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:59.759
 interesting as always I hope for you 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.709
 comments on the video - I'm gothic and 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.309
 see you in the next one, take care of yourself a lot 

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:04.309
 goodbye
