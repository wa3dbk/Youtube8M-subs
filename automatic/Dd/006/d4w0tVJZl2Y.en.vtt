00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 oil a bruno and good actor or player 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.369
 now we are a match of one against 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.230
 one against red legend I already wanted 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.230
 upload this game since time nothing more 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.119
 who wrote had died what he knows 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.739
 because well now my computer that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.989
 assigned the charger that started 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.599
 fail and therefore no sudden arrival 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:34.230
 then it occurred to me to raise the when 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.160
 just as is you against me but well 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.220
 in order that charged me works and everything 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 this dessert is I bring stew and go 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.310
 that is to say that total the game against 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.190
 legend itself the five games the 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.390
 first time I won 15 to 2 the second me 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.510
 won 15 4 and I think this is still 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 the third game you are watching here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 it went well he won me 15 to 7 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.680
 in fact the five games all me the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.120
 won but talked they'll see how good 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.050
 start to take advantage of some angles 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.600
 to start debating with him but yes 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.670
 a very good one that made me and where I was 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.470
 something and in stress and jon r2 and I do not know 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.350
 how he did it to reach me to find 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.460
 the intern was shot down but yes yes 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.940
 reached very ugly and finally and the last 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.700
 time it was in centuries 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.310
 the ox won me 15 to 1 he told me he was going to 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.710
 take all flow told me so but 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.610
 Well, already in total in 12 games 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.900
 this is between sanctuary and s'illot 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.920
 I have never played in broth but I 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.670
 he taught a scratch out there where he was most 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.510
 like 5 times I leave it in total but 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.510
 anyway this one 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.460
 I have practiced a lot on that map but 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.160
 Anyway, I can start uploading it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.690
 to see how I 'm doing this I'm sure 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.670
 that most of me will be winning 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.980
 that map because the games nothing else 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.840
 five times and then finally 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.200
 I'm going to start trimming this gameplay 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.310
 so they can see it better since I do not have 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 a lot of time right now to be 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.070
 commenting the truth that I'm going to leave 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.080
 I'm doing this example to the race 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.810
 and well, I'm going to leave you with 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.120
