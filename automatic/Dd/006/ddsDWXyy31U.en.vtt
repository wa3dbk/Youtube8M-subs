so let's talk about the hardware first I

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.270 
so let's talk about the hardware first I
really<00:00:40.690> like<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.960> way<00:00:40.989> it<00:00:41.230> looks<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.800> feels

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
really like the way it looks and feels

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.099 
really like the way it looks and feels
and<00:00:42.670> it's<00:00:42.789> built<00:00:43.059> really<00:00:43.239> well<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.750> sturdy

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
and it's built really well and sturdy

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.770 
and it's built really well and sturdy
and<00:00:44.350> it's<00:00:44.620> slim<00:00:44.979> but<00:00:45.879> I<00:00:46.030> have<00:00:46.179> to<00:00:46.329> see<00:00:46.479> it<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.750> a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
and it's slim but I have to see it is a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.430 
and it's slim but I have to see it is a
bit<00:00:47.049> slippery<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.949> I<00:00:48.780> did<00:00:49.780> drop<00:00:50.019> it<00:00:50.199> a<00:00:50.260> couple

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
bit slippery and I did drop it a couple

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.139 
bit slippery and I did drop it a couple
of<00:00:50.589> times<00:00:50.829> when<00:00:51.129> I<00:00:51.190> didn't<00:00:51.429> have<00:00:51.519> the<00:00:51.670> case<00:00:51.879> on

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
of times when I didn't have the case on

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.799 
of times when I didn't have the case on
but<00:00:53.189> it<00:00:54.189> wasn't<00:00:54.489> really<00:00:54.729> that<00:00:54.850> big<00:00:55.210> of<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.479> drop

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
but it wasn't really that big of a drop

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.969 
but it wasn't really that big of a drop
and<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:58.359> first<00:00:58.629> time<00:00:58.839> I<00:00:58.869> when<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.170> dropped<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.710> I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
and the first time I when I dropped it I

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.240 
and the first time I when I dropped it I
dropped<00:01:00.640> it<00:01:00.850> out<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.719> pocket<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.439> the

brightness all the way down the there's
like<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.170> pink<00:01:35.530> shade<00:01:35.920> on<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.280> display<00:01:37.060> and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
like a pink shade on the display and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.910 
like a pink shade on the display and
that<00:01:38.319> Uriel<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:38.979> really<00:01:39.250> appealing<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.970> me

but leaving the brightness up a bit

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.619 
but leaving the brightness up a bit
won't<00:01:45.160> really<00:01:45.340> affect<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.819> battery<00:01:46.239> since

compared to last year's Nexus this nexus

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.250 
compared to last year's Nexus this nexus
is<00:03:22.310> much<00:03:22.940> more<00:03:23.270> expensive<00:03:23.740> it's<00:03:24.740> for<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.310> 32<00:03:25.880> gig

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
is much more expensive it's for a 32 gig

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.390 
is much more expensive it's for a 32 gig
gigabytes<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.560> starts<00:03:28.220> at<00:03:28.780> 649<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.190> 464<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400

goes<00:03:31.610> up<00:03:31.760> fifty<00:03:32.060> dollars<00:03:32.300> more<00:03:32.540> for<00:03:33.100> 699<00:03:34.100> which

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
goes up fifty dollars more for 699 which

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.650 
goes up fifty dollars more for 699 which
is<00:03:35.270> in<00:03:35.540> its<00:03:35.810> plus<00:03:36.170> tax<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.760> now<00:03:38.030> let's<00:03:38.510> talk

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
is in its plus tax so now let's talk

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.160 
is in its plus tax so now let's talk
about<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.080> software<00:03:39.770> i<00:03:40.010> really<00:03:40.850> like<00:03:41.170> Android

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
about the software i really like Android

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.970 
about the software i really like Android
5.0<00:03:42.470> lollipop<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.750> material<00:03:45.230> design<00:03:45.650> I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
5.0 lollipop and the material design I

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.160 
5.0 lollipop and the material design I
think<00:03:46.490> was<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.670> good<00:03:47.000> direction<00:03:47.180> for<00:03:47.750> Google<00:03:48.050> to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
think was a good direction for Google to

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.140 
think was a good direction for Google to
go<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.940> bring<00:03:50.210> more<00:03:50.620> Android<00:03:51.620> users

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
go in to bring more Android users

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.840 
go in to bring more Android users
because<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.330> much<00:03:53.630> more<00:03:54.310> simple<00:03:55.310> like<00:03:55.610> that

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
because it's much more simple like that

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.450 
because it's much more simple like that
like<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.450> iPhone<00:03:56.960> it's<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.100> can<00:03:58.280> still

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
like the iPhone it's you can still

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.820 
like the iPhone it's you can still
provision<00:03:58.820> send<00:03:59.210> all<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.480> stuff<00:03:59.720> but<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.620> is

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
provision send all the stuff but it is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.100 
provision send all the stuff but it is
much<00:04:01.100> more<00:04:01.130> simpler<00:04:01.910> than<00:04:02.120> before<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:02.900> it

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
much more simpler than before and it

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.040 
much more simpler than before and it
looks<00:04:03.140> much<00:04:03.590> cleaner<00:04:04.390> but<00:04:05.390> some<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.960> the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
looks much cleaner but some of the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.980 
looks much cleaner but some of the
things<00:04:06.320> that<00:04:06.410> don't<00:04:06.890> like<00:04:07.190> about<00:04:07.990> the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
things that don't like about the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.090 
things that don't like about the
software<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:11.180> it<00:04:12.020> load<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.380> takes<00:04:12.950> a

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
software is that it it load it takes a

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.100 
software is that it it load it takes a
little<00:04:13.250> bit<00:04:13.430> too<00:04:13.700> long<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.210> initialize<00:04:14.870> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
little bit too long to initialize the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.539 
little bit too long to initialize the
camera<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:17.420> image<00:04:17.900> processing<00:04:18.590> on<00:04:18.950> the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
camera and the image processing on the

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.410 
camera and the image processing on the
on<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.200> camp<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.530> camera<00:04:21.890> is<00:04:22.250> not<00:04:22.790> the

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
on the camp of the camera is not the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.200 
on the camp of the camera is not the
greatest<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.290> much<00:04:24.560> better<00:04:24.830> than<00:04:25.010> before

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
greatest it is much better than before

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.030 
greatest it is much better than before
but<00:04:26.210> if<00:04:26.510> they<00:04:26.840> sit<00:04:27.170> still<00:04:27.350> needs<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.740> little<00:04:27.890> bit

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
but if they sit still needs a little bit

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.380 
but if they sit still needs a little bit
of<00:04:28.100> work<00:04:28.370> but<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:30.710> this<00:04:31.310> is<00:04:31.370> not<00:04:31.760> that's<00:04:32.090> not

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
of work but this this is not that's not

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.000 
of work but this this is not that's not
a<00:04:32.600> big<00:04:32.840> issue<00:04:32.870> because<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.560> still<00:04:33.800> takes

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
a big issue because it still takes

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.120 
a big issue because it still takes
