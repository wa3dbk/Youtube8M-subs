00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:08.099
 The fact that most of the spicy ribs we eat at a senior house are not really so called 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:11.400
 In fact, you know DID 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.230
 You are selling a mixture of ribs riches and neck and legs and you 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.949
 It 's a fake rib-shaped fried meat with a bunch of other cheap meats. 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.949
 I was caught 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.619
 This is what life and legs are made of 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.449
 It's a lump. 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.449
 The part that looks white like this is an adhesive. 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.520
 February is so short 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:41.980
 You see, this is a pig- tailed missile. 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.980
 This is exactly the same size frills 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.870
 Cut thinly, stick to the school with edible glue 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.960
 What should I do? 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:00.309
 I 'll make a fake rib pork rib. 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.309
 Now I'm applying a negative neuropathy. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.530
 And sideways 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.530
 Show circuit address 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.310
 Do not let one 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.560
 Let's compare it to those sold on the market. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.930
 There is not quite a big difference I made. 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.790
 It's not much harder than I thought. Then how are real pork ribs 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.430
 I'll take another map. 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.400
 This is a real pig 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.230
 It's a little weird to see the fat part hanging. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.230
 But this is a real present 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.310
 You can see the bones. 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.820
 Let's make it artificially. 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.410
 It can be clearly divided into nine forms 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.440
 Fake is much smoother and handsome. 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.440
