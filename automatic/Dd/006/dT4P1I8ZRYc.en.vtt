00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
to his friends to some degree

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.420 
to his friends to some degree
I<00:00:40.300> think<00:00:40.990> the<00:00:41.050> reason<00:00:41.260> why<00:00:41.320> Cedric<00:00:41.800> goes<00:00:42.130> crazy

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
I think the reason why Cedric goes crazy

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.970 
I think the reason why Cedric goes crazy
is<00:00:42.640> because<00:00:42.910> uh<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:44.050> people<00:00:44.200> like<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.650> do<00:00:44.830> it

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
is because uh some people like to do it

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.240 
is because uh some people like to do it
big<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.780> themselves<00:00:47.230> but<00:00:47.530> claim<00:00:47.890> that<00:00:48.070> it's

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
big for themselves but claim that it's

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.020 
big for themselves but claim that it's
for<00:00:48.400> someone<00:00:48.700> else

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
for someone else

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.840 
for someone else

women in this movie and I think it shows
you<00:02:05.810> know<00:02:05.929> they<00:02:06.200> hold<00:02:06.679> their<00:02:07.369> own<00:02:07.399> in<00:02:07.969> their

you know they hold their own in their

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.059 
you know they hold their own in their
scenes<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.319> forget<00:02:09.590> about<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.920> guys

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
scenes and you forget about the guys

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.280 
scenes and you forget about the guys
when<00:02:10.880> they're<00:02:11.000> on<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.750> guys<00:02:11.930> come

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
when they're on and then the guys come

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.539 
when they're on and then the guys come
up<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.829> completely<00:02:13.190> different<00:02:13.280> thing

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
up and it's a completely different thing

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.250 
up and it's a completely different thing
when<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:13.880> all<00:02:14.030> come<00:02:14.239> together<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.900> some

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
when we all come together and some

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.770 
when we all come together and some
another<00:02:15.440> movie<00:02:15.769> within<00:02:15.950> itself<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:17.030> think

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
another movie within itself so I think

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.410 
another movie within itself so I think
it<00:02:17.989> gave<00:02:18.140> our<00:02:18.290> movie<00:02:18.530> levels<00:02:18.920> by<00:02:19.340> about<00:02:20.060> adding

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
it gave our movie levels by about adding

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.940 
it gave our movie levels by about adding
so<00:02:20.569> much<00:02:20.690> more<00:02:20.930> for<00:02:21.079> them

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.619 

I<00:02:24.160> would<00:02:24.760> tell<00:02:24.879> people<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.180> go<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:25.300> things

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
I would tell people to go see things

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.690 
I would tell people to go see things
like<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.810> man<00:02:26.080> -<00:02:26.349> because<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.920> universal

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
like a man - because it is a universal

movie<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.269> said<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.230> because<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.500> appeals<00:02:29.739> to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
movie I said it because it appeals to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.240 
movie I said it because it appeals to
everybody<00:02:31.170> regardless<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.379> race<00:02:32.590> shape<00:02:32.980> or

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
everybody regardless of race shape or

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.210 
everybody regardless of race shape or
size<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.019> movie<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.129> I
