00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
yep we seem to pull the vacuum pretty

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.860 
yep we seem to pull the vacuum pretty
much<00:02:23.790> seems<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:24.970> we<00:02:25.060> got<00:02:25.210> everything<00:02:25.450> out<00:02:25.690> of

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
much seems like we got everything out of

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:46.060 
much seems like we got everything out of
there<00:02:26.970> return<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.980> up

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070

shut this off here turn off the gauge
set<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:55.070> little<00:02:56.070> bit<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.250> pressure<00:02:58.160> seem<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
set a little bit of pressure seem to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.830 
set a little bit of pressure seem to
pull<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> backing<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.120> impulse<00:03:00.480> for<00:03:00.690> about

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
pull the backing this impulse for about

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.610 
pull the backing this impulse for about
30<00:03:01.170> minutes<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.930> go<00:03:04.080> ahead<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.320> fill<00:03:04.470> this

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
and i also got to put oil in the system

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:54.250 
and i also got to put oil in the system
too<00:03:39.080> but<00:03:42.910> this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.060> pressurizing<00:03:53.260> I'm

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
too but this is just pressurizing I'm

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.420 
too but this is just pressurizing I'm
just<00:03:54.440> getting<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.680> rest<00:03:54.830> out<00:03:54.950> of<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:55.190> can

just getting the rest out of this can

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.870 
just getting the rest out of this can
because<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:55.970> pulled<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.270> vacuum<00:03:57.520> all<00:03:58.520> right<00:03:58.730> we

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
because I pulled a vacuum all right we

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
because I pulled a vacuum all right we
got<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.240> out<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.450> this<00:03:59.630> can<00:04:01.450> let<00:04:02.450> me<00:04:02.570> go<00:04:02.690> grab

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
got that out of this can let me go grab

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:13.830 
got that out of this can let me go grab
the<00:04:03.110> oil<00:04:09.760> where<00:04:10.760> did<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.000> put<00:04:11.240> that<00:04:11.300> oil<00:04:12.310> there

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
the oil where did I put that oil there

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.150 
the oil where did I put that oil there
ended<00:04:14.840> up<00:04:14.960> in<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.170> back<00:04:15.320> of<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.560> truck<00:04:18.160> there

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
ended up in the back of the truck there

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:29.140 
ended up in the back of the truck there
we<00:04:19.220> go<00:04:19.340> Esther<00:04:19.700> oil<00:04:23.950> so<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:27.760> loosen<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:28.880> up

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
we go Esther oil so just loosen this up

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.280 
we go Esther oil so just loosen this up
here<00:04:31.120> well<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.480> get<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.630> idea<00:04:32.750> basically

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
here well you get the idea basically

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.050 
here well you get the idea basically
i'll<00:04:33.680> make<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> part<00:04:34.160> two<00:04:34.190> once<00:04:34.580> i<00:04:34.730> get<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.940> air

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
i'll make a part two once i get the air

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.550 
i'll make a part two once i get the air
conditioning<00:04:35.510> all<00:04:35.600> working<00:04:35.930> i'm<00:04:36.380> going<00:04:36.500> to

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
conditioning all working i'm going to

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.350 
conditioning all working i'm going to
put<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.710> little<00:04:36.740> bit<00:04:36.980> asteroid<00:04:37.430> exit<00:04:38.000> needs<00:04:38.180> it

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
put a little bit asteroid exit needs it

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.280 
put a little bit asteroid exit needs it
oh<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.950> then<00:04:40.040> I'll<00:04:40.130> inject<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.610> way<00:04:41.290> yep

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
oh and then I'll inject it that way yep

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.870 
oh and then I'll inject it that way yep
but<00:04:42.470> basically<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:42.980> loosen<00:04:43.280> this<00:04:43.520> up<00:04:43.669> so

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
but basically you just loosen this up so

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.820 
but basically you just loosen this up so
you<00:04:44.060> can<00:04:44.180> let<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.419> air<00:04:44.570> out<00:04:44.600> because<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.650> fill

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
you can let the air out because you fill

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.790 
you can let the air out because you fill
in<00:04:45.950> this<00:04:46.040> hose<00:04:46.310> with<00:04:46.580> oil<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.290> yep<00:04:48.290> there<00:04:48.770> you

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
in this hose with oil so yep there you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.220 
in this hose with oil so yep there you
go<00:04:49.090> alright<00:04:50.090> catch<00:04:50.660> y'all<00:04:50.840> later<00:04:51.220> bye
