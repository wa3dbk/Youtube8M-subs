00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 The minions get their own movie 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 and this may be second seventh in the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.210
 german cinemas i already have 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.519
 seen and therefore there's mine here 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 Short review on the movie The Minions 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.299
 have already had two film appearances 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.780
 I'm just incorrigible 1 and 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.460
 Part 2 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 because the filmmakers have noticed quickly 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.869
 that the minions are very popular and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 the reason is why the people 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.890
 went to the cinema have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.539
 Determined to make a film about the media too 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 the filmmakers have money here 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 thought or have you tried one 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.160
 to make a film that is good and unfortunately 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.649
 the first has been the case so it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.870
 was really just a movie about the hype 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.520
 to take from the minions and money 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 to make a lot of effort out of it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 To make a good movie here was unfortunately 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.600
 not given in the first two 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.520
 were filming the one now, although the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 Nebencharaktere but they have one 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.850
 a little bit the people so the show 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.649
 stolen and were actually the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.449
 real superstar of the movies in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.570
 The minions are also the superstar 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 from the minions movie but a movie full 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.480
 packed with only minions and with one 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.430
 year I say something of 08 15 story 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.140
 which really is not interesting fits 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.760
 that does not like everything and is not 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.290
 interesting from the trailers we know 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.299
 yes that this is the prehistory of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 The minions means they are always 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.960
 looking for a new villain 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.549
 and always lose it I found that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.840
 actually totally interesting and would have 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.970
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 had concentrated because in the film 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.710
 you quickly find the villain because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.390
 choose the one you want and the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.040
 other that except transit so accurate 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.829
 that's what happened in the movie as well 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.450
 shows the initial bad guys 2 seconds 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.009
 and this way and actually I would have 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.659
 I'm happy if the movie actually 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.579
 would have been consistently that the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.409
 then where a villain would have been 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.210
 and doris died or they have him 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.560
 from the cliff fall down 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.640
 and at the next or at least one 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.009
 a bit longer because this is one 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 bit fitter and yet would be 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.250
 very funny because something is yellow 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.170
 actually not yet what 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.180
 initially so original looks outdated 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.100
 Be careful then after really zero 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.920
 fifteen movie with a story like that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.390
 is lifeless and really uninteresting 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.700
 and you know why that is so uninteresting 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.130
 is because we have a bad guy here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.049
 who is not really angry 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.270
 but just annoying so she will 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.030
 there presented as the crass and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.980
 worst of all times but you like them 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.390
 not at all 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.040
 but you do not like them either 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.900
 villain understands yeah just looks 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.430
 somehow totally annoying has continued 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.560
 actually not that many emotions 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.060
 you laugh just only from time to time because of - 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.709
 because they are just funny but more 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.060
 Emotions do not exist here and at 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.709
 animated films respectively 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.580
 i wish for children then 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.470
 somehow that then any 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.780
 relationships are and and if you are 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.069
 somehow something touching sees that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.299
 it hardly and here actually 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.920
 Animation films are actually for 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.510
 Children are important because they should help them 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.890
 but teach something and and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.239
 show that you are nice and happy 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.180
 but this film has somehow 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.590
 nothing you can give the children 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.180
 I have a day ahead for comparison 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.959
 I have seen the minions the pixar 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.030
 movie seen 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.160
 Everything is upside down and this is easy 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.079
 a thousand times better than the minions because 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.549
 he is also more profound 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.069
 can positively count on is that 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.530
 movie has been animated simply awesome 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.720
 So the pictures are awesome and horny 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.609
 look really good right out so that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.079
 the best animated film of one 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.329
 optical he I've seen so far 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.890
 and the second plus point are natural 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.170
 the minions because they are cool as always 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.030
 and ever and there is a reason 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.560
 why all seven a disaster is 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.510
 the movie is not the first two 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.030
 I'm simply incorrigible 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.919
 definitely better if you but 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.299
 the minions loves and if you just 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.340
 wanna go to the cinema and have a go 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.260
 little laugh then the movie is on 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.090
 every case right for you because he too 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.919
 simply just terrific at the cinema 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.419
 Looks like you have to make the movie easy 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.280
 let's have a really good job 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.410
 done because animations 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.660
 otherwise the film is not a masterpiece 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.150
 but he is no scrap 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.220
 film and I like it actually 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.109
 I do not like animation so much 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.950
 Stop that then a little bit 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.389
 is more profound and not just 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.220
 a bit of a laugh I do not have now 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.720
 laughed so much because humor then 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.609
 rather something for children and I believe 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.940
 For children, the film is just perfect 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.799
 for adults rather less and 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.120
 actually for the adult ones yet 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.590
 a child are for the name of the movie 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.410
 probably something else from me 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.609
 That's why I'm here 55 points 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.290
 know if you look at the movie 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.819
 if you have already seen him then 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.220
 Write in the comments as you do 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.810
 found and in the infobox you can find 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.010
 another link to all trainers and 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.319
 clips to the movies if you are 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.669
 wanted to prepare and how they 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.669
 once again until next time
