00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.680
 Y 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.740
 hello to all subscribers and people from 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.480
 beyond greets you, say goodbye and fun 1990 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 I want to apologize for my 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.860
 long absence time is that I was 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.869
 presenting bi-monthly exams 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.029
 but good luckily I came out with 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.520
 good grades and what better way 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.230
 with a new video in which I will criticize 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.220
 one of the most animated movies 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.710
 expected of the year 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.010
 I speak of dragon ball z the battle of the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.829
 gods before I start the video I want to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.350
 clarify some things 1 this video will be 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.809
 done by me 2 do not search and insult 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.329
 others and 3 this video will only search 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.250
 entertain the viewer good without more 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.250
 filling let's start with criticism 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:13.399
 With all my sincerity these were my 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.640
 expectations towards the film and what is 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.590
 what I get to see a disappointment but 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.409
 good to start with the left foot 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.929
 let's mention the positive things of 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.179
 the movie let's start with the dubbing the 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.310
 which is pretty good since they gave us 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.229
 the same voices of the old dragon ball z 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.969
 that we all live as children mario 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.039
 castañeda has made a very good 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.609
 acting as his goku character at 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.380
 same as René García and Carlos second 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.090
 Another point in favor of the film is the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.369
 excellent animation that we have been offered 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.549
 with very good fluency and excellent 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.500
 details and finally the soundtrack the 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.659
 which are topics previously seen in the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.840
 series and you also have to tell the remix 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.509
 of the talk which was quite 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.969
 well and until then I can mention what 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.060
 positive since the rest of the movie was 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.159
 quite disappointing first thing and what 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.159
 that was the straw that spilled the glass or 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.329
 be the story I 'll tell you about the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.329
 fastest way possible 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.090
 A) Yes 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.580
 and apart from that the movie had been 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.530
 announced as a film of the genre of 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.680
 action and adventure when the product 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.710
 final was a 30 of action and adventure and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.810
 the remainder or 70% focused on 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.120
 the comedy do not take it badly 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.340
 the comedy was pretty good but not 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.350
 they must have exceeded this because dragon 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.870
 Ball has more potential for action 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.080
 and for an acceptable plot now 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.270
 let's talk about the various good characters 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.520
 characters retained their personality 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.290
 seen in the series as goku with his 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.570
 barbarian personality and ready to 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430
 fight but this time I did not feel 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.709
 a little different since in several 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.930
 Sometimes he acts like a clown in the middle 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.080
 of a fight would costco ultimate 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.720
 spiderman codc of vegeta with its character 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 serious but the bad thing is that his character of 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.500
 pride they send it completely to the 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.690
 trash as they grabbed the best that 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.150
 I had vegeta in the series and they put it in 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.130
 the movie like a complete asshole without 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.780
 act in a mature way solving the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.370
 problem and what was the drop that 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.370
 spilled the glass was this 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.489
 while others were just there 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.650
 so that the scenery is not so 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.780
 empty and poor being able to take advantage 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.790
 for a good part of the story but 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.340
 when they start acting alone 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.800
 they begin to do pure stupidities that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.440
 I personally did not laugh so much 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.349
 let's say and finally we have the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.950
 ie bits villain as you can 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.200
 say this villain is not the big deal 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.360
 ok so we do not go straight to the point we're going 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.209
 to mention the good and bad things of 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.310
 this subject the good thing is that sometimes 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.349
 presents that if he has evil and is a 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.480
 tough guy to kill clear but up there 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.360
 I can say the good thing about him since what 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.250
 follow will be the negative is a villain who 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.260
 behaves in a childlike manner and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.609
 immature and destroys the earth for a 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.590
 simple whim 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.800
 I just wanted pudding and it burns so much that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.830
 wants to destroy the earth seriously fuck 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.810
 that invited me something else that I did not like 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.510
 of the movie was the subplot of the super 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.669
 Indian saiyan or they do not explain it to you 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.320
 the way you create it for yourself 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.479
 It is a simple subplot that is 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.230
 fanned in five minutes and chan chan 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.110
 chan 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.090
 they have sir is the last thing I liked 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.980
 A bit was the end because there 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.200
 shows that goku is not a super being 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.570
 powerful showing that he can surrender 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.220
 there you have dragonball fanboys that 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.860
 his landmark god is not the most 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.050
 strong of all before moving on to 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.690
 conclusion of the video some friends of mine 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.170
 will give their respective opinions hello 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.320
 friends of youtube I am a cr 2051 and you 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.400
 I thank the festival 1990 for inviting me 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.100
 to this criticism 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.990
 Well, I'm going to start the plot 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.360
 simple which is not a novelty in 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.880
 dragon ball z but considering the great 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.860
 budget that I had and exploit a little 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.420
 more to the characters because many are 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.310
 filling 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.690
 the problem for me is not a good 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.610
 shining and not even a good 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.010
 antagonist for their motivations and 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.620
 extremely childish attitudes because the 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.750
 conflict is given by a tantrum the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.820
 animation is very good on all 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.010
 battles although in the last battle the 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.900
 3ds of a little out of place in a 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.510
 part use three of the bottom and two in the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.610
 characters and it looks mediocre and about the 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.439
 designs of the new characters 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.159
 but it has an unattractive design 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:51.560
 simple and his assistant equal the music is 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.939
 he did something to me that is more or less now 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.189
 I think about it, although some 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.530
 soundtracks are fine but they are not something 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.120
 to remember and the voices are the same 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.219
 than those in the series except for some 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.229
 exceptions I have a problem with the voice 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.729
 of goku and bulma since they sound very 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.460
 young for the age who have their 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.469
 characters in the fight seems like a 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.060
 mediocre movie although I do not know how it can 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.710
 make for the grade fans in ball z 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.039
 since I 'm never a big fan of the 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.620
 franchise up here finishes my criticism 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.639
 thank you very much for inviting me to the people 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.830

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.680
 Zulma Díaz Land is another guest 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.800
 of the criticism and I also thank 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.860
 pep and dave to 1990 for inviting me to this 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.949
 video 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.889
 well before I start I clarify that no 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:38.460
 I'm a fan of dragon ball z that's all 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:41.490
 Well let's start what can I say about the 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.860
 movie for me was pretty good to me 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.169
 he liked the movie his animation well 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.780
 drawn its effects in general is 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.080
 spectacular is the well composed music 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.060
 and above all the best his black humor 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.310
 thank you very much friends I thank you for 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.669
 have participated in this criticism in 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.500
 how old are you 1999 ex sorry 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.080
 a lot for not having participated and 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.629
 I understand your school matters well 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.849
 going straight to the point in conclusion the 

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:11.009
 movie was a plot detection nothing 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.620
 interesting flat characters and without 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:15.810
 joke villain little used but with 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.180
 an excellent animation very good dubbing 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:22.159
 and soundtrack to this thing I give a 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.319
 score of 55 out of 10 or mediocre 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:27.090
 good until here the video ends 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:29.819

 this year until next time
