also<00:00:42.699> be<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.710> just<00:00:44.890> way<00:00:45.220> easier<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.610> eat<00:00:45.850> if

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
also be it's just way easier to eat if

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.250 
also be it's just way easier to eat if
there's<00:00:46.120> not<00:00:46.239> bones<00:00:46.510> if<00:00:46.839> you're<00:00:46.960> putting<00:00:47.140> it

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
on top of a waffle in my humble opinion

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.329 
on top of a waffle in my humble opinion
but<00:00:49.420> maybe<00:00:49.570> that's<00:00:49.750> just<00:00:49.960> because<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.559> did<00:00:51.220> not

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
but maybe that's just because I did not

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.130 
but maybe that's just because I did not
grow<00:00:51.519> up<00:00:51.580> eating<00:00:51.940> chicken<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.510> waffles<00:00:52.930> and

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
maybe I'm kind of an idiot and I don't

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.160 
maybe I'm kind of an idiot and I don't

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
couple of years I'm not totally sure

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.010 
couple of years I'm not totally sure
when<00:01:34.030> they<00:01:34.119> originally<00:01:34.240> knit<00:01:34.659> I<00:01:34.689> always

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
when they originally knit I always

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.660 
when they originally knit I always
assumed<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.469> was<00:01:35.649> like<00:01:35.859> a<00:01:35.890> southern<00:01:36.219> thing<00:01:36.429> but

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
assumed it was like a southern thing but

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.739 
assumed it was like a southern thing but
then<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:36.820> was<00:01:36.939> reading<00:01:37.090> something<00:01:37.359> that<00:01:37.600> said

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
then I was reading something that said

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.599 
then I was reading something that said
that<00:01:38.140> actually<00:01:38.560> may<00:01:39.070> have<00:01:39.159> come<00:01:39.399> out<00:01:39.429> of

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
that actually may have come out of

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.580 
that actually may have come out of
