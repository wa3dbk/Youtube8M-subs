we<00:00:12.210> noticed<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.719> some<00:00:12.960> things<00:00:13.290> cause<00:00:13.679> other

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
we noticed that some things cause other

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.820 
we noticed that some things cause other
things<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.450> begin<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.350> continue

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
things to be to begin to be to continue

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.970 
things to be to begin to be to continue
to<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.279> both<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:18.359> example<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.050> man<00:00:19.680> playing

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
to be or both for example a man playing

to be or both for example a man playing
the<00:00:20.160> piano<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.699> causing<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> music<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.840> we

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the piano is causing the music that we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.849 
the piano is causing the music that we
hear<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.529> he<00:00:22.980> stops<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.210> does<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> music<00:00:24.859> now

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
hear if he stops so does the music now

hear if he stops so does the music now
ask<00:00:26.130> yourself<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:27.449> things<00:00:27.779> caused<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
ask yourself are all things caused to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.130 
ask yourself are all things caused to
