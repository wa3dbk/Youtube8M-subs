00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.460 
the piece that I have on Stephanie right
now<00:06:50.430> is<00:06:50.640> a<00:06:50.670> raw<00:06:50.940> piece<00:06:51.240> so<00:06:51.630> it<00:06:51.720> hasn't<00:06:51.900> been<00:06:52.140> cut

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
now is a raw piece so it hasn't been cut

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.320 
now is a raw piece so it hasn't been cut
I<00:06:52.800> just<00:06:53.430> want<00:06:53.580> to<00:06:53.670> show<00:06:53.880> you<00:06:53.940> what<00:06:54.180> it<00:06:54.270> would

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
I just want to show you what it would

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.570 
I just want to show you what it would
look<00:06:54.540> like<00:06:54.600> if<00:06:54.990> you<00:06:55.020> took<00:06:55.290> a<00:06:55.590> longer<00:06:56.100> look<00:06:56.430> so

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
look like if you took a longer look so

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.650 
look like if you took a longer look so
anyone<00:06:56.970> could<00:06:57.210> choose<00:06:58.670> to<00:06:59.670> have<00:06:59.940> a<00:07:00.300> longer

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
anyone could choose to have a longer

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.230 
anyone could choose to have a longer
piece

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.510 

so<00:07:05.780> this<00:07:05.960> is<00:07:06.050> a<00:07:06.080> longer<00:07:06.500> piece<00:07:06.740> let's<00:07:07.250> go<00:07:07.460> to

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
so this is a longer piece let's go to

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.460 
so this is a longer piece let's go to
the<00:07:07.759> front<00:07:08.020> there<00:07:09.020> we<00:07:09.110> go

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
the front there we go

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.809 
the front there we go
so<00:07:09.620> now<00:07:09.770> it<00:07:09.889> looks<00:07:10.069> like<00:07:10.130> it's<00:07:10.340> growing<00:07:10.490> out<00:07:10.669> of

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:10.819 
so now it looks like it's growing out of

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.170 
so now it looks like it's growing out of
the<00:07:11.060> front<00:07:11.389> and<00:07:11.630> then<00:07:12.229> I<00:07:12.500> do<00:07:12.590> highly<00:07:13.490> highly

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
the front and then I do highly highly

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.480 
the front and then I do highly highly
recommend<00:07:14.750> you<00:07:14.960> having<00:07:15.289> these<00:07:15.440> cut<00:07:15.740> so<00:07:16.400> you

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
recommend you having these cut so you

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.980 
recommend you having these cut so you
don't<00:07:16.639> necessarily<00:07:16.729> need<00:07:17.270> to<00:07:17.300> have<00:07:17.389> bangs<00:07:17.750> but

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
don't necessarily need to have bangs but

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.499 
don't necessarily need to have bangs but
having<00:07:18.500> these<00:07:18.680> cut<00:07:19.009> will<00:07:19.250> be<00:07:19.280> a<00:07:19.400> nice<00:07:19.639> touch<00:07:20.479> to

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:20.509 
having these cut will be a nice touch to

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:56.090 
having these cut will be a nice touch to
the<00:07:21.319> look

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.100 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.160 

you
