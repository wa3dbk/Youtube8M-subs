difficult<00:00:56.260> route<00:00:56.620> probably<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.489> most

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670

I learned and I had like a small kick

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.870 
I learned and I had like a small kick
with<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.710> rear<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.070> car<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.700> don't

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
really absorb the landing and then I

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.820 
really absorb the landing and then I
lost<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.090> car<00:03:53.240> immediately<00:03:53.440> couldn't<00:03:54.440> do

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
pongsapat estate has been a great

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.610 
pongsapat estate has been a great
challenge<00:04:24.520> first<00:04:25.419> time<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:26.050> quite<00:04:26.320> dry

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
challenge first time in quite dry

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.409 
challenge first time in quite dry
conditions<00:04:27.160> on<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.460> second<00:04:27.790> time<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.270> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
mixed conditions with wet and dry really

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.990 
mixed conditions with wet and dry really
really<00:04:31.300> tricky<00:04:31.570> for<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.440> driver<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.000> also

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
really tricky for the driver and also

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.279 
really tricky for the driver and also
the<00:04:34.120> car<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.540> tackle<00:04:34.960> these<00:04:35.020> conditions

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.649 

it's<00:04:43.949> been<00:04:44.159> not<00:04:44.339> be<00:04:44.460> easy<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.789> drive<00:04:44.999> and<00:04:45.300> I

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
it's been not be easy to drive and I

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.809 
it's been not be easy to drive and I
think<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.229> win<00:04:46.439> we<00:04:46.619> managed<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.039> well<00:04:47.189> so<00:04:47.550> i<00:04:47.580> will

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
think I win we managed it well so i will

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.279 
think I win we managed it well so i will
be<00:04:47.849> very<00:04:48.119> poorest<00:04:48.689> and<00:04:48.899> i<00:04:49.020> will<00:04:49.169> be

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
be very poorest and i will be

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.589 
be very poorest and i will be
concentrated<00:04:50.009> that<00:04:50.189> that<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.569> sure

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
concentrated that that that is for sure

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.909 
concentrated that that that is for sure
but<00:04:52.759> i'm<00:04:53.759> not<00:04:53.969> thinking<00:04:54.149> about<00:04:54.389> them<00:04:54.749> under<00:04:55.740> we

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
but i'm not thinking about them under we

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:33.600 
but i'm not thinking about them under we
are<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.279> end<00:04:56.399> of<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.580> running

to this long left hand corner and
suddenly<00:05:48.460> an<00:05:48.550> exit<00:05:49.090> of<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.240> corner<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:49.750> lose

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
suddenly an exit of the corner I lose

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.020 
suddenly an exit of the corner I lose
the<00:05:50.319> rear<00:05:50.469> so<00:05:51.129> I<00:05:51.159> tried<00:05:51.460> to<00:05:51.580> drive<00:05:51.759> line

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
the rear so I tried to drive line

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.659 
the rear so I tried to drive line
somewhere<00:05:52.539> to<00:05:52.719> get<00:05:53.169> back<00:05:53.409> to<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.620> road<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:54.520> we

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
somewhere to get back to the road but we

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.119 
somewhere to get back to the road but we
hit<00:05:54.819> the<00:05:54.939> fence<00:05:55.180> we<00:05:55.750> will<00:05:55.900> get<00:05:56.050> stuck<00:05:56.319> and<00:05:56.620> only

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:57.129 
hit the fence we will get stuck and only

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.070 
hit the fence we will get stuck and only
five<00:05:57.310> meters<00:05:57.699> would<00:05:58.240> be<00:05:58.419> more<00:05:58.629> to<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.930> right

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
five meters would be more to the right

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.290 
five meters would be more to the right
we<00:05:59.289> would<00:05:59.439> get<00:05:59.590> back<00:05:59.830> to<00:06:00.009> the<00:06:00.129> road<00:06:00.250> so<00:06:01.060> this

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
we would get back to the road so this

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.589 
we would get back to the road so this
incident<00:06:01.780> was<00:06:02.229> due<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:02.860> fact<00:06:03.039> that<00:06:03.250> I<00:06:03.669> had<00:06:04.569> a

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
incident was due the fact that I had a

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.080 
incident was due the fact that I had a
little<00:06:04.930> mistake<00:06:05.229> in<00:06:05.439> the<00:06:05.620> rinky<00:06:05.919> last<00:06:06.729> second

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
little mistake in the rinky last second

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.790 
little mistake in the rinky last second
thing<00:06:07.240> a<00:06:07.419> little<00:06:07.960> bit<00:06:08.139> too<00:06:08.229> optimistic<00:06:08.379> with

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
thing a little bit too optimistic with

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.820 
thing a little bit too optimistic with
the<00:06:09.129> with<00:06:09.699> the<00:06:09.729> conditions<00:06:10.389> that<00:06:10.449> it<00:06:10.719> was<00:06:11.650> not

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
the with the conditions that it was not

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:26.879 
the with the conditions that it was not
getting<00:06:12.129> as<00:06:12.340> dry<00:06:12.610> as<00:06:12.639> as<00:06:13.240> I<00:06:13.509> thought

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.739 

well<00:06:27.340> for<00:06:27.580> sure<00:06:27.610> I'm<00:06:27.849> really<00:06:28.240> happy<00:06:28.360> with<00:06:28.659> the

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:28.749 
well for sure I'm really happy with the

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:30.899 
well for sure I'm really happy with the
third<00:06:28.900> place<00:06:29.110> here<00:06:29.349> in<00:06:29.379> Germany<00:06:29.909> it's

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
third place here in Germany it's

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:32.189 
third place here in Germany it's
actually<00:06:31.060> a<00:06:31.300> little<00:06:31.389> bit<00:06:31.569> more<00:06:31.749> than<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:31.990> came

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
actually a little bit more than I came

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.110 
actually a little bit more than I came
for<00:06:32.439> future<00:06:32.860> conditions<00:06:33.340> very<00:06:33.610> difficult

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
for future conditions very difficult

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.760 
for future conditions very difficult
event<00:06:34.389> a<00:06:34.539> lot<00:06:34.659> of<00:06:34.810> things<00:06:34.930> happened<00:06:35.379> and<00:06:35.560> the

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
event a lot of things happened and the

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.709 
event a lot of things happened and the
way<00:06:35.979> end<00:06:36.189> of<00:06:36.340> the<00:06:36.460> third<00:06:36.669> place<00:06:36.879> also<00:06:37.449> in

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:37.719 
way end of the third place also in

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.659 
way end of the third place also in
drivers<00:06:38.020> are<00:06:38.139> one<00:06:38.289> two<00:06:38.439> three<00:06:38.680> so<00:06:38.949> it<00:06:39.460> looks

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
drivers are one two three so it looks

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.540 
drivers are one two three so it looks
like<00:06:39.729> now<00:06:40.539> we<00:06:41.379> share<00:06:41.620> one<00:06:41.860> box<00:06:42.099> on<00:06:42.249> your<00:06:42.340> driver

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
like now we share one box on your driver
