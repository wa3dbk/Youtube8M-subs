according<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:09.000> Russian<00:00:09.480> scientists<00:00:10.280> it

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
according to Russian scientists it

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.450 
according to Russian scientists it
wasn't<00:00:11.639> actually<00:00:12.139> detected<00:00:13.139> until<00:00:13.460> Friday

again ties into this narrow mess over
the<00:01:20.280> weekend<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.900> asteroid<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the weekend because the asteroid that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
by just nine hours after it was

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
by just nine hours after it was
initially<00:01:34.799> discovered<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.119> basically<00:01:36.689> they

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
initially discovered so basically they

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.660 
initially discovered so basically they
had<00:01:36.990> no<00:01:37.200> warning<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.040> asteroid

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
had no warning of this asteroid

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.550 
had no warning of this asteroid
whatsoever<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.900> came<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> complete

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
whatsoever it came as a complete

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.910 
whatsoever it came as a complete
surprise<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.430> everybody<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.799> only

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
surprise to everybody so this will only

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.760 
surprise to everybody so this will only
reignite<00:01:44.549> debate<00:01:44.939> about<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.899> threat<00:01:46.380> posed

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
reignite debate about the threat posed

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100

depicted in this simulation I just find
it<00:03:54.479> interesting<00:03:54.569> that<00:03:55.169> we<00:03:55.440> had<00:03:55.620> an<00:03:56.609> asteroid

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
it interesting that we had an asteroid

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.289 
it interesting that we had an asteroid
pass<00:03:57.930> within<00:03:58.919> eleven<00:03:59.519> thousand<00:04:00.030> three

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
discovered it nine hours before it

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.890 
discovered it nine hours before it
passed<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:08.010> earth<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:09.060> basically<00:04:09.569> nobody

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
passed the earth and basically nobody

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.430 
passed the earth and basically nobody

knew about it in the public arena until
