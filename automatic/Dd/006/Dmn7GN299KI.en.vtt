replace Angel Pagan if I don't get the
speed<00:03:14.500> attributes<00:03:15.010> up<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.940> problem<00:03:16.209> with

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
speed attributes up but the problem with

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.750 
speed attributes up but the problem with
that<00:03:16.359> is<00:03:16.750> okay<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.230> then<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.650> put<00:03:17.680> my<00:03:17.920> attributes

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
that is okay so then I put my attributes

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.120 
that is okay so then I put my attributes
in<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.269> speed<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.140> put<00:03:20.320> them<00:03:20.440> into<00:03:20.560> fielding

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
in to speed and I put them into fielding

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.400 
in to speed and I put them into fielding
and<00:03:21.370> reaction<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.930> takes<00:03:23.140> away<00:03:23.290> from

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
and reaction and that takes away from

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.930 
and reaction and that takes away from
hitting<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:26.530> who<00:03:26.799> wants<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.220> hit<00:03:27.310> those<00:03:27.519> candy

think it's time to make the decision to

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.169 
think it's time to make the decision to
move<00:07:56.250> to<00:07:56.520> left<00:07:57.389> field
