00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.889
 most interesting news of windows 10 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.570
 mobil and that we see on the vid 10,051 by 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.090
 First time talks about the new browser 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.680
 web project spartan with microsoft that 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.000
 it will be his definitive name although to day 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.220
 today still appears as a project 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.100
 spartan as we have seen in the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.420
 last vile 10,136 by the way I'm going to 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.250
 seize to make a moment to 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.930
 recommend that you watch the video that 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.939
 I make my incredible mates jose 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.309
 llanes showing all the news that 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.199
 bring this last build said this we go 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.910
 what we are interested in we already know how 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.769
 is the new browser for computers 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.479
 so in this video we're going to meet him 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.159
 also as it is for smartphone today by 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.809
 today since until the 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.879
 final version of windows 10 mobil could 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.989
 suffer even more changes if we go into the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.610
 application we see that one of your 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.860
 main changes regarding the view 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.330
 previous is that the interface will be clear 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.530
 dark depending on the way we have 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.659
 configured the settings of 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.949
 customization as you can see the design is 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.839
 very clean placing the bar 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.400
 directions on top 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.589
 unlike internet explorer where 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.820
 everything was located at the bottom 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.470
 here we also find the button to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.670
 update the page and on the side 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.140
 right to the option called mode 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.789
 reading that is definitely recommended 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.290
 to read any news or article 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.670
 in a very comfortable way 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.770
 certainly the change to this mode does 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.060
 quite quickly in the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.980
 bottom however microsoft 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.930
 keeps the menu with the different 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.340
 options offered by the browser to 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.500
 unfold as you can see the bottom of the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.240
 page goes dark and we see how first 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.250
 option to add to favorites in which 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.930
 we can put a name to the page 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.760
 choose the folder in which to save the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.710
 same and even create some new 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.290
 folders for for example having by 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.210
 separate the different pages add to 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.940
 the reading list allows you to save the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.620
 page to read later if we press 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.180
 in search on the page will appear in the 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.369
 top a bar in which 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.229
 we will write the word or text that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.580
 we want to look in the same 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.110
 words will appear with a background of 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.600
 yellow color and on the bottom 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.490
 next to the menu will appear two signs for 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.540
 jump to the next word found 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.540
 or return to the previous 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.000
 in the configuration section we can 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.680
 erase the scan data or choose 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.229
 what we want to delete by selecting 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.509
 aspects such as cookie history and so on 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.360
 we can also from here choose the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.099
 reading view style 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.130
 default light medium dark e 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.140
 even choose the font size if 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.670
 We click on advanced configuration is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.769
 possible to activate the option that allows 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.989
 save passwords block or not 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.910
 cookies and allow or not the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.830
 websites store licenses 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.880
 protected multimedia on my device 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.880
 among other options 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.170
 also has among the options the 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.720
 possibility to send comments in 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.549
 report and anchor the page to the screen 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.439
 of start this last option does not work 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.670
 today correctly so 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.579
 let's hope that they solve them in the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.629
 next skin in this same menu you see that 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.640
 in addition to the previous options 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.260
 appear at the bottom in a tone 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.599
 darker other three important 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.220
 options how are you going to see the first the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.620
 tab here we will find the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.689
 Open pages that we can close 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.489
 easily clicking on the X's too 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.049
 we can open it in a new one by pressing 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 in the symbol of more than the part 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.920
 lower as well as unfold the options 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.450
 that allows you to open a tab in a mode 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.659
 private and close all tabs 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.040
 including the ones in this way incognito 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.780
 concentrator is the place where 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.299
 find the favorite pages the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.129
 pages added to the reading list 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.470
 browsing history and 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.670
 current downloads as you see is very 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.060
 comfortable to move between the different 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.739
 sections 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.480
 The third and final option is 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.700
 share a page with who we want 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.200
 either via twitter or facebook or 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.720
 well via an email like 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.120
 message like this is aesthetically today 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.410
 talking project spartan in guate more 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.910
 presence with the browser I have to 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.170
 recognize that it is positive even though cast in 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.849
 missing some of the options that they have 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.620
 internet explorer as for example 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.510
 return to the previous page by sliding 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.920
 the finger from right to left as well as 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.150
 the application of the address bar 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.769
 in the lower part that I 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.360
 personally I find more comfortable about 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.310
 all in terminals of 5 more inches 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.319
 as in my case 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.030
 in this last time 10,136 already 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.769
 disappeared internet explorer without 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.209
 However in the previous build although I 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.920
 come a browser and I can assure 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.170
 that the result when loading 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.090
 pages was very similar without appreciating 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.100
 special waiting times in both 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.569
 cases in this sense the experience is 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.340
 practically the same in this last 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.500
 bill being also positive at the time 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.420
 to scroll or zoom on the page 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.280
 So far this first review of 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.560
 definitive new windows 10 browser 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.910
 mobile microsoft although we will be very 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.740
 pending of the new functions that 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.750
 they are implementing it in future bits 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.979
 before saying goodbye I want to encourage you 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.249
 tell me in the comments that you 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.109
 it seems if you like no project spartan 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.239
 I hope you liked it and you know no 

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:34.559
 of pizza because in a few days you will have a 

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:36.949
 new video on our channel 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.949
 until next time
