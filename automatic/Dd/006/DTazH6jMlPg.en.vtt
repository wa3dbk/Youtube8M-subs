 minecraft change their core 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.050
 destination to bind 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.910
 tool to the tool holding the right 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.640

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.869
 claire what does this tool do he 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:16.580
 changes block data i.e. changes 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:19.570

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.570
 the position of the loaf 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.720
 to change color or type you need to click 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.290
 right mouse button 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.190
 to change lesson type more precisely 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.970
 position needs to be poured into the rescue once 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:44.710
 pressed such more than 2 pressing such third 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.710
 without a blog at all 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.590
 if the desire to departure lip ax is not 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.100
 there will be ordinary values â€‹â€‹i.e. it will 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.550
 hack cut it such but again with me 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.979
 I will take 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.650
 and you do not touch also remain 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:05.470
 tool even if u throw out and pick up 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.709
 will be the same as you tool 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.300

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.080
 tamado nom 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 everything 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.780
 now it is an ordinary ax 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.780
 the next tool is 3 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.370
 need to write 3 and the type of tree in this 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.970
 I will leave without a case 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:40.030
 defaults to normal tree and using 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:44.310
 right click we grow believe i 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.310
 on the mouse button no top gives 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.410
 So for example, you mean the type of random 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.700
 grows a random tree without 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.700
 available game 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.310
 the next available tool and 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.500
 the ripple allows you to replace one unit 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.159
 another 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.670
 let's try oh well fish and let our 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.659

 McCready click finally god he will 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.709
 change but 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.610
 for quick change and block type replacing 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.349
 you just need to connect to it 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.000
 java mouse button so i click on it 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:50.560
 written too will now be replaced by 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.550
 tree try we see here and 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.519
 replaced by a weight 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.239
 come alive on the dashing grass they were at 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.239
 me center 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.880
 tool and write build allows 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.000
 build us to put blocks at a distance 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.650
 for this you need to write 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.109
 write build specify 1 de god and he for 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.940
 left mouse button and 2 1 block to edit 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.870
 pebbles 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:30.930
 let's try limb is blocks 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.930

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.530
 which will replace cabitt also 41 and 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.710
 radius in which will replace let's 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:00.220
 launcher 4 in my opinion if I remember the radius 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.450
 maximum 6 and minimum 1 let's 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.450
 try to click in the request 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.159
 as you can see the grooves this tool replaces 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:13.889
 one-type contiguous slides around 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:17.840
 the god of the trams is almost like ours 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.840
 the creature fell only on a large scale 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.980
 how can we decorate what 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.020
 the goal is to color on the figure probably many 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.449
 annoying punish players on server 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.970
 the tree trunk is cut down and the stove remains 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.620
 and flying foliage 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.930
 how the developers came up and for that 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:45.450
 tool called daughtry 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:48.390

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.190
 ordinary activists do not disappear 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.060
 top through like asphalt but so we 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.540
 we can click once and all empty foliage 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.090

 it is even convenient to eat here 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.300
 very comfortable 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:22.219
