00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.330
 Our goal is to create a bo 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.730
 but very inferior 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 that's why the stable of zeal has led us 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.639
 it was another very curious layout 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.219
 when we had just 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.589
 nine years old 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.069
 here in rich pool 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.859
 I played see many mothers out there 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.730
 what they call UFOs sometimes happens nothing 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.390
 these generals of interior 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.720
 a strong desire to know something beyond the material 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.710
 so 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.810
 we started very recently I can tell you kahlo 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.149
 seven years 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.500
 I was giving some topic near him 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 then life the school of life 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.050
 sewed by placing different teachers 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.140
 with which we are very grateful 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.530
 and give us this time polishing until all this time 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.040
 We are right here in Poza Rica, it is clear that they can locate us 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.690
 in 82 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.580
 really for what 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.940
 to escape the accompanying sale 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.890
 is to be closer to these two trips the preparation the key 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.730
 issue that tried to appeal the penalty until that time that a clear rich pool 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 our country 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.310
 It has many more places 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.750
 wonderful 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.780
 so part of the activities that involve traveling to those sites 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.150
 to activate power centers 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 energy centers and go developing 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 each place has a very special family 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.050
 many people now all their life 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.890
 for example to travel to Tibet 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.290
 or india 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.010
 and here in the tajín 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.869
 we have many know 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.789
 more than we so shortly condemn with a North Korean attack other than returning 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.410
 two 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.200
 And why are we going back to Spain? I'm here to work and grow 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.960
 company 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 we stayed in practice and turkey 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.300
 clarified 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 travel is an opportunity for all of us 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.190
 those areas of our country are very important 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.670
 For example, we have the people of Tepoztlán 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.040
 crisp dessert is a wonderful place 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.460
 is nestled between them 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.960
 which have great wisdom 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.040
 it's amazing to be able to observe scenes of the passion of Christ 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.809
 in the cordilleras of tepozteco 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.349
 time that those images 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.559
 They have been here 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.859
 long before we arrived Spanish 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.559
 then one what happens not 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.629
 what kind of wisdom did I see here that was so despised during the conquest 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.080
 forgotten and was served 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.949
 how many of us talk nothing 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.479
 we go practically nobody in those who speak it 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.969
 everything was fine with the shame of mentioning it 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.159
 makes us try to return our identity 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.909
 based on mystical travel 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.179
 spiritual 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:47.909
 those of us who work with meditation angels work with energies 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.789
 we do rituals in these energy centers 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.090
 we talk about 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.169
 of the mysteries that said places explaining 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.629
 for example now in this image we are in a park that is very 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.879
 near this city 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.139
 in which we were working with meditation extensively 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.659
 talking about the importance of taking care of our nature 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.819
 and they are trips from which we learn a lot 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.819
 because suddenly we travel with Mexican philosophy 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.469
 another trip and we practice lots the buddhism zen ajá percent 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.469
 different branches of knowledge 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.509
 the tajine for example is a wonderful center 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.289
 incredibly 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.559
 full of energy 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.609
 and of spirituality within the same pajín 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.219
 we can find the wisdom that is taught in tibet in the game 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.209
 Ball 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.019
 Regrettably 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.119
 the official propolis 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.529
 do not consider worthy aspects of our culture 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.739
 the sacred aspect 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.109
 the awkwardness months 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.739
 there you have to be annoying carts yes I will do what we are doing 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.090
 it was ricky group 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.779
 - the king 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:56.020
 psp operating theater 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.530
 there and the people who travel with us lie down we give them king 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.799
 to all together 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:02.889
 to achieve 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.869
 in each of them a state of deep relaxation 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.609
 we work in front of the sea 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.089
 emotion homes as fast as Bernal's rock 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.759
 Teotihuacan like these musavi photos 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:16.139
 It was a great experience for all of us who participated in this trip 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 teotihuacán the city where men become god 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:21.799
 all this is for something 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.180
 so how can you see it is very broad what we handle is too much 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.610
 wide practically people who are almost almost dreaming of us and 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.849
 Then he knows us 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.889
 talking have to fall until that time to agree to adopt a dinner 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:35.820
 to appear 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.820
 from here a few years earlier than in spite of the fact that Spain in this survey are 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.690
 the works do not want them to discover why you can dream about certain 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.440
 things 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.699
 exactly 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:48.770
 I will look at you 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.249
 happens that 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.070
 the villages have different 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.240
 types 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.310
 of manifestation will reflect different things about you 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.039
 which mentioned that man is known for his dreams 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.990
 we have dreams of mental type 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.870
 that is to say projects what you lived news such a movie corbis p 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.039
 percent 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.399
 He asserted that the night turn they put you to the whole movie but 

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.379
 as well 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:15.719
 there are dreams 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:17.990
 with a deep spiritual character 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.300
 archetypes 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.990
 chopped not to be what types or symbols to be interpreted leave you a 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.069
 teaching because the top 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.809
 spreading a message 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:29.870
 there is precognition 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.650
 when was the tsunami
