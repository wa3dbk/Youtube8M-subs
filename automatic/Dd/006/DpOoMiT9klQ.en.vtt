factors<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> very<00:00:53.280> hard<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> pick<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
factors it is very hard to pick up the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
factors it is very hard to pick up the
controls<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:54.719> you're<00:00:54.840> using<00:00:55.050> purely<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
controls if you're using purely the

controls if you're using purely the
touch<00:00:56.039> mechanics<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.210> feel<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.719> one

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
touch mechanics I feel like this is one

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.150 
touch mechanics I feel like this is one
of<00:00:57.930> those<00:00:58.020> games<00:00:58.379> where<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.949> need<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
of those games where you really need to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.729 
of those games where you really need to
tell<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> controller<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:01.109> controls<00:01:01.500> are

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tell the controller the controls are

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.930 
tell the controller the controls are
quite<00:01:01.920> easy<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.250> pick<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> touch

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
quite easy to pick up on the touch

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
quite easy to pick up on the touch
screen<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> gameplay<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.769> said

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
screen but the gameplay is like I said

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
screen but the gameplay is like I said
very<00:01:05.369> frantic<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.689> need<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.020> ready<00:01:07.229> for

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
very frantic so you need to be ready for

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020 
very frantic so you need to be ready for
those<00:01:07.590> quick<00:01:08.040> action<00:01:08.430> scenes<00:01:08.700> where<00:01:08.909> enemies

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
those quick action scenes where enemies

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
those quick action scenes where enemies
pop<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.869> vehicles<00:01:10.260> pop<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.979> thing<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
pop up or vehicles pop up one thing that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.890 
pop up or vehicles pop up one thing that
I<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.520> enjoyed<00:01:11.790> about<00:01:11.880> modern<00:01:12.299> combat<00:01:12.510> 5

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
actually running through the game so it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
actually running through the game so it
feels<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.430> actually<00:01:35.850> proud

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
of the gameplay of course it's a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.350 
of the gameplay of course it's a
scripted<00:01:38.430> event<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.180> looks

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
scripted event but it just looks

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149

ahead and I will reply anyway but it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.830 
ahead and I will reply anyway but it
definitely<00:02:36.730> did<00:02:37.060> take<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.240> bit<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.480> time<00:02:37.720> to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
definitely did take a bit of time to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.560 
definitely did take a bit of time to
pick<00:02:37.990> up<00:02:38.140> those<00:02:38.380> touch<00:02:38.830> screen<00:02:39.490> controls<00:02:40.120> and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
pick up those touch screen controls and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.210 
pick up those touch screen controls and
I<00:02:41.140> guess<00:02:41.320> that's<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.710> to<00:02:41.800> give<00:02:41.950> them<00:02:42.070> with

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
I guess that's just to give them with

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.560 
I guess that's just to give them with
first-person<00:02:42.760> shooters<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> mobile<00:02:43.390> device
