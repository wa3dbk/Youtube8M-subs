like a pre-production model but that's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
like a pre-production model but that's
what<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.789> is

electric<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.590> battery<00:00:49.980> powered<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
electric it's battery powered so you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.880 
electric it's battery powered so you
don't<00:00:50.610> need<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> carry<00:00:50.940> around<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> cord

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
don't need to carry around the cord

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
don't need to carry around the cord
battery<00:00:52.890> charges<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.730> about<00:00:53.940> 9<00:00:54.149> hours<00:00:54.329> which

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
battery charges in about 9 hours which

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.119 
battery charges in about 9 hours which
is<00:00:54.930> funny<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.530> only<00:00:55.620> am<00:00:55.800> using<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
is funny because you're only am using it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
is funny because you're only am using it
like<00:00:56.190> once<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.489> week<00:00:57.050> but<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> need<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> more

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
like once a week but if you need it more

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.029 
like once a week but if you need it more
often<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.430> sell<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.620> 15

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
often that they sell a so it's like 15

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.780 
often that they sell a so it's like 15
or<00:01:02.190> 45-minute<00:01:02.789> charger<00:01:03.979> separately<00:01:07.670> it's<00:01:08.670> got

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
or 45-minute charger separately it's got

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420 
or 45-minute charger separately it's got
a<00:01:08.820> single<00:01:09.119> screen<00:01:09.270> head<00:01:09.920> auto<00:01:10.920> feed<00:01:11.220> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
a single screen head auto feed it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240 
a single screen head auto feed it
actually<00:01:11.820> works<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.010> see

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
actually works pretty well you can see

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.499 
actually works pretty well you can see
it's<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:14.760> graphs<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.299> I've<00:01:15.390> been

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's got some graphs in there I've been

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.789 
it's got some graphs in there I've been
using<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.900> under<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> features<00:01:19.590> now

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
using it so it's under the features now

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.010 
using it so it's under the features now
it<00:01:20.400> has<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:21.299> interesting<00:01:21.570> feature<00:01:21.810> called<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
it has an interesting feature called the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.460 
it has an interesting feature called the
boost<00:01:25.020> mode<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:26.909> normal<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.509> boost

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
boost mode it's got normal and boost

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.670 
boost mode it's got normal and boost
mode<00:01:28.740> basically<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> normal<00:01:30.600> mode<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.500> not

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
mode basically a normal mode it's not

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
mode basically a normal mode it's not
quite<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.189> doesn't<00:01:32.430> use<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.970> voltage

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
quite as it doesn't use all the voltage

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.090 
quite as it doesn't use all the voltage
from<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> battery<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.979> better

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
from the battery so you have better

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.859 
from the battery so you have better
battery<00:01:35.460> life<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> switch<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> boost

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
battery life then you switch to boost

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.230 
battery life then you switch to boost
and<00:01:37.020> switch<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.470> adopts<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> voltage<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and switch this adopts the voltage to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.160 
and switch this adopts the voltage to
give<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.509> power<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:39.900> it'll<00:01:40.049> obviously

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
give you more power but it'll obviously

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.630 
give you more power but it'll obviously
kill<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.770> battery<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.369> quicker

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
kill your battery a little bit quicker

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.660 
kill your battery a little bit quicker
so<00:01:42.350> right<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.470> we're<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.740> normal<00:01:44.250> mode<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so right now we're on normal mode and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.520 
so right now we're on normal mode and
you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.060> hear<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.270> happens

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
you can hear what happens

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.740 
you can hear what happens
Boosh

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.800 

you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.900> hear<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> spin<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.620> lot<00:01:55.710> quicker

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
you can hear it spin it up a lot quicker

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
you can hear it spin it up a lot quicker
thing<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.900> don't<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.170> about<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.590> trimmer

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
thing I don't like about this trimmer

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
thing I don't like about this trimmer
it's<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.610> stupid<00:01:59.820> safety<00:02:00.240> thing<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.720> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it's a stupid safety thing you have to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.910 
it's a stupid safety thing you have to
push<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.140> before<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.650> pull<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
push this before you can pull the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.780 
push this before you can pull the
trigger<00:02:03.650> I<00:02:04.650> will<00:02:04.920> not<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.430> pull<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.670> trigger

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
trigger I will not just pull the trigger

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.830 
trigger I will not just pull the trigger
and<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.850> was<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.119> keep<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.600> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and so if I was going to keep this I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.500 
and so if I was going to keep this I
probably<00:02:10.619> disconnect<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.390> know

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
probably disconnect that or you know

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.480 
probably disconnect that or you know
remove<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.110> safety<00:02:13.470> things<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.860> think<00:02:13.920> stupid

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
remove the safety things I think stupid

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.090 
remove the safety things I think stupid
it<00:02:15.240> also<00:02:15.420> comes<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:15.750> now<00:02:15.990> in<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.500> four

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
it also comes with now in here four

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.760 
it also comes with now in here four

actually<00:02:25.830> down<00:02:25.980> there<00:02:26.220> which<00:02:26.640> means<00:02:26.820> that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
actually down there which means that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.790 
actually down there which means that
while<00:02:27.240> you're<00:02:27.390> cutting<00:02:27.570> you're<00:02:28.500> holding<00:02:28.740> it

while you're cutting you're holding it
up<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.000> got<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> weight<00:02:30.570> down

up here and then you got the weight down

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.600 
up here and then you got the weight down
there<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.410> gives<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:32.160> about<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> same

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610

used<00:04:05.050> for<00:04:05.290> about<00:04:05.410> half<00:04:05.620> an<00:04:05.709> hour<00:04:05.800> and<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
used for about half an hour and the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.500 
used for about half an hour and the
battery<00:04:06.400> still<00:04:06.580> seemed<00:04:06.820> fine<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.240> don't<00:04:07.420> know

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
battery still seemed fine I don't know

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.750 
battery still seemed fine I don't know
what<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.720> actual<00:04:08.050> total<00:04:08.230> life<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.800> it<00:04:08.920> but

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
what the actual total life is of it but

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.850 
what the actual total life is of it but
I<00:04:10.180> think<00:04:10.750> it's<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:11.020> good<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.380> think<00:04:11.530> it's<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.740> good

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
I think it's a good I think it's a good

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.550 
I think it's a good I think it's a good
product<00:04:12.720> like<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.750> said<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.110> only<00:04:14.290> things<00:04:14.500> that

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
product like I said the only things that

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.550 
product like I said the only things that
I<00:04:14.650> would<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:15.040> would<00:04:15.610> change<00:04:15.850> is<00:04:16.180> um<00:04:16.419> this<00:04:17.140> safety

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
I would I would change is um this safety

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.190 
I would I would change is um this safety
thing<00:04:17.709> is<00:04:17.829> annoying<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.810> all<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> weight<00:04:20.079> is

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
thing is annoying and all the weight is

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.900 
thing is annoying and all the weight is
house<00:04:20.380> down<00:04:20.650> there

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
house down there

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.610 
house down there
so<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:22.600> makes<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.900> feel<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.080> little<00:04:23.169> bit<00:04:23.350> heavier

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
so it makes it feel a little bit heavier

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.750 
so it makes it feel a little bit heavier
but<00:04:23.830> you're<00:04:23.950> only<00:04:24.070> gonna<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.250> using<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.610> for<00:04:24.640> a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
but you're only gonna be using it for a

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.430 
but you're only gonna be using it for a
little<00:04:24.880> bit<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.150> time<00:04:25.360> it's<00:04:25.930> not<00:04:25.990> like<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.290> is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
little bit of time it's not like this is

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.320 
little bit of time it's not like this is
an<00:04:26.530> industrial<00:04:26.770> thing<00:04:27.190> going<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.180> walking

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
an industrial thing going to be walking

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.780 
an industrial thing going to be walking
around<00:04:28.600> for<00:04:28.720> hours<00:04:29.050> on<00:04:29.169> end<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.580> edge<00:04:30.669> of

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
around for hours on end on the edge of

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.659 
around for hours on end on the edge of
side<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.419> side<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.020> highway<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:33.580> a

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
side on the side of the highway it's a

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.360 
side on the side of the highway it's a
13<00:04:34.120> inch<00:04:34.270> cutting<00:04:34.510> swath<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.950> in<00:04:36.640> a<00:04:38.160> good<00:04:39.160> turn

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
13 inch cutting swath and in a good turn

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.490 
13 inch cutting swath and in a good turn
over<00:04:40.300> here<00:04:40.450> I've<00:04:40.540> got<00:04:40.600> some<00:04:40.870> real<00:04:41.050> heavy<00:04:41.229> stuff

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
over here I've got some real heavy stuff

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.410 
over here I've got some real heavy stuff
I<00:04:42.620> usually<00:04:43.100> don't<00:04:43.400> get<00:04:43.550> too<00:04:43.730> close<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.240> I

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
I usually don't get too close to it I

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.570 
I usually don't get too close to it I
just<00:04:45.020> know<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.770> mower<00:04:45.950> next<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.460> that's

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
just know the mower next to it that's

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.010 
just know the mower next to it that's
about<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:46.970> don't<00:04:47.240> lose<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.480> edge<00:04:47.630> here<00:04:47.900> so

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
about it I don't lose the edge here so

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.320 
about it I don't lose the edge here so
this<00:04:48.740> hasn't<00:04:48.950> been<00:04:49.070> edge<00:04:49.310> yet<00:04:49.880> this<00:04:50.060> year

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
this hasn't been edge yet this year

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.410 
this hasn't been edge yet this year
actually<00:04:50.450> should<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:52.160> guess<00:04:52.880> let's<00:04:53.060> see<00:04:53.240> how<00:04:53.330> it

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
actually should I guess let's see how it

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:16.530 
actually should I guess let's see how it
goes

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.490 

Claude<00:05:17.540> seemed<00:05:17.780> pretty<00:05:17.900> good<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.260> was<00:05:18.380> on

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
Claude seemed pretty good that was on

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.340 
Claude seemed pretty good that was on
normal<00:05:18.830> no<00:05:18.950> non<00:05:19.190> boost<00:05:19.970> mode<00:05:20.240> it<00:05:21.200> seemed

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
normal no non boost mode it seemed

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.510 
normal no non boost mode it seemed
pretty<00:05:21.470> powerful<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:21.980> guess<00:05:22.160> we'll<00:05:22.340> switch<00:05:22.490> it

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
pretty powerful I guess we'll switch it

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.560 
pretty powerful I guess we'll switch it
over<00:05:22.640> in<00:05:22.790> boost<00:05:22.970> mode<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.270> see<00:05:23.360> what<00:05:23.480> that

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
over in boost mode and see what that

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.100 
over in boost mode and see what that
does

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:37.290
