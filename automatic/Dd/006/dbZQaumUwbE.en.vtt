00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
first one so here is the code card I

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.200 
first one so here is the code card I
will<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:01.010> keeping<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:01.430> probably<00:03:01.700> for<00:03:01.880> myself

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
and I don't want to reveal the code you

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.460 
and I don't want to reveal the code you
anyway<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.940> won't<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:06.050> won't<00:03:06.410> be

anyway because it won't be you won't be
able<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> put<00:03:06.800> them<00:03:06.920> online<00:03:07.070> until<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.640> set<00:03:07.790> is

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
able to put them online until the set is

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.880 
able to put them online until the set is
released<00:03:08.240> i'm<00:03:08.420> going<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.630> set<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.810> aside<00:03:09.050> so

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
released i'm going to set that aside so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.320 
released i'm going to set that aside so
i'm<00:03:09.950> pretty<00:03:10.100> sure<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> card<00:03:10.610> trick<00:03:10.850> works<00:03:11.060> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
i'm pretty sure the card trick works the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.320 
i'm pretty sure the card trick works the
same<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.400> has<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.820> last<00:03:14.030> couple
