going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> restrict<00:01:51.659> access<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
going to kind of restrict access to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.740 
going to kind of restrict access to
certain<00:01:52.640> points<00:01:53.640> i'm<00:01:53.790> sure<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.479> played

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
certain points i'm sure you have played

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.630 
certain points i'm sure you have played
a<00:01:54.780> game<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.680> something<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.310> before

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
a game with something like this before

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
a game with something like this before
you<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.780> careful<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.649> slider

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you want to be careful that that slider

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.240 
you want to be careful that that slider
doesn't<00:01:59.460> slide<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.969> into<00:02:00.180> danger<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:02.100> we

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
doesn't slide you into danger so here we

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.069 
doesn't slide you into danger so here we
are<00:02:02.430> moving<00:02:02.790> around<00:02:03.090> we've<00:02:03.600> got<00:02:03.780> some<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
are moving around we've got some of

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
are moving around we've got some of
these<00:02:04.170> sliders<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.130> we're<00:02:05.250> bouncing

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
these sliders here that we're bouncing

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.680 
these sliders here that we're bouncing
off<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:06.719> move<00:02:07.350> me<00:02:07.530> out<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> way

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
off of as they move me out of the way

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.570 
off of as they move me out of the way
here<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.959> see<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> any<00:02:11.280> walls

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
here you can see we don't have any walls

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.670 
here you can see we don't have any walls
so<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.360> want<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.930> careful

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so we want to be careful

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.539 
so we want to be careful
move<00:02:13.920> slowly<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.390> don't<00:02:15.599> die<00:02:19.549> you

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
move slowly so that we don't die you

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.789 
move slowly so that we don't die you
also<00:02:20.670> want<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.150> take<00:02:21.599> notice<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.230> some<00:02:22.709> of

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
also want to take notice to some of

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.920 
also want to take notice to some of
these<00:02:22.890> orbs<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.430> may<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.819> hiding<00:02:24.299> kind<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
these orbs that may be hiding kind of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.640 
these orbs that may be hiding kind of
over<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> side<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.609> and<00:02:27.420> then<00:02:28.260> there

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
over on the side and then and then there

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.069 
over on the side and then and then there
is<00:02:28.920> our<00:02:29.189> activator<00:02:29.879> over<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.930> need

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
is our activator over here that we need

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.690 
is our activator over here that we need
to<00:02:31.109> get<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:31.739> can<00:02:31.920> make<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.219> through<00:02:32.489> all

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
to get so we can make it through all

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.369 
to get so we can make it through all
right<00:02:34.430> now<00:02:35.430> only<00:02:35.849> enough<00:02:36.180> room<00:02:36.299> for<00:02:36.810> us<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.230> get

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
right now only enough room for us to get

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.199 
right now only enough room for us to get
through<00:02:37.650> with<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.980> slider<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.730> we<00:02:38.939> have<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.180> be

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
through with the slider so we have to be

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.059 
through with the slider so we have to be
careful<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.709> never<00:02:40.889> know

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
careful there because you never know

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.369 
careful there because you never know
what<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.519> lurking<00:02:41.879> outside<00:02:42.389> of<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.989> screen

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
what is lurking outside of the screen

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.339 
what is lurking outside of the screen
area<00:02:43.680> now<00:02:44.519> right<00:02:44.760> here<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:45.510> we<00:02:46.019> don't<00:02:46.139> move

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
area now right here if we don't move

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.929 
area now right here if we don't move
through<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:46.859> really<00:02:47.159> fast<00:02:47.189> we<00:02:47.669> would<00:02:47.849> have

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
through there really fast we would have

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.009 
through there really fast we would have
really<00:02:48.209> got<00:02:48.419> dead<00:02:49.139> pretty<00:02:49.500> quick<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.959> you

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
really got dead pretty quick so so you

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.729 
really got dead pretty quick so so you
want<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.319> move<00:02:52.439> fast<00:02:54.139> so<00:02:55.139> far<00:02:55.379> I'm<00:02:55.500> doing

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
want to move fast so far I'm doing

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.009 
want to move fast so far I'm doing
pretty<00:02:55.919> good<00:02:56.389> according<00:02:57.389> to<00:02:57.540> what<00:02:57.689> the<00:02:57.810> game

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
pretty good according to what the game

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.129 
pretty good according to what the game
is<00:02:58.049> telling<00:02:58.560> me<00:02:59.480> all<00:03:00.480> right<00:03:00.629> time<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.989> move

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
is telling me all right time to move

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.640 
is telling me all right time to move
slow<00:03:01.439> again<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:02.129> we<00:03:02.939> are<00:03:03.060> out<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.299> walls<00:03:04.200> no

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
slow again as we are out of walls no

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.679 
slow again as we are out of walls no
walls<00:03:04.919> there<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.579> protect<00:03:05.819> us<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:09.209> also<00:03:09.329> want

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
walls there to protect us you also want

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.420 
walls there to protect us you also want
to<00:03:09.750> be<00:03:09.840> careful<00:03:09.959> because<00:03:10.469> the<00:03:10.739> slider<00:03:11.099> will

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to be careful because the slider will

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.940 
to be careful because the slider will
just<00:03:11.760> throw<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.269> right<00:03:12.569> off<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.019> edge<00:03:13.169> it

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
just throw you right off the edge it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.039 
just throw you right off the edge it
doesn't<00:03:14.310> care<00:03:14.519> how<00:03:14.730> nice<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.359> guy<00:03:15.540> or<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> gal

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
doesn't care how nice of a guy or a gal

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:29.179 
doesn't care how nice of a guy or a gal
you<00:03:16.290> are<00:03:16.469> it<00:03:17.040> wants<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.430> gone<00:03:27.620> all<00:03:28.620> right<00:03:28.829> so

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
you are it wants you gone all right so

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.170 
you are it wants you gone all right so
we're<00:03:29.430> doing<00:03:29.549> pretty<00:03:29.909> well<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.720> far<00:03:31.729> 64<00:03:32.729> that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
we're doing pretty well so far 64 that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.000 
we're doing pretty well so far 64 that
is<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.659> entire<00:03:34.079> amount<00:03:34.319> that<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.799> first

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
is the entire amount that the first

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.539 
is the entire amount that the first
level<00:03:35.250> has<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.030> looks<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:37.040> we<00:03:38.040> pass<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
level has so looks like we pass the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.429 
level has so looks like we pass the
level<00:03:38.699> pretty<00:03:39.030> good<00:03:39.239> level<00:03:39.599> is<00:03:39.689> complete<00:03:40.169> I

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 
level pretty good level is complete I

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:49.249 
level pretty good level is complete I
didn't<00:03:41.159> die<00:03:42.470> we<00:03:43.470> got<00:03:43.650> all<00:03:43.799> 64<00:03:44.459> orbs<00:03:47.989> my<00:03:48.989> best

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
didn't die we got all 64 orbs my best

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.939 
didn't die we got all 64 orbs my best
time<00:03:49.560> yet<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.639> no<00:03:51.479> shields<00:03:51.959> lost<00:03:52.229> so<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.680> got<00:03:52.919> a

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
time yet and no shields lost so I got a

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.219 
time yet and no shields lost so I got a
bronze<00:03:53.220> star<00:03:53.639> overall<00:03:54.180> from<00:03:54.720> here<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:54.959> could

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
bronze star overall from here I could

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.710 
bronze star overall from here I could
decide<00:03:55.650> either<00:03:55.979> to<00:03:56.129> go<00:03:56.729> on<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> next<00:03:57.329> level

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
decide either to go on to the next level

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.439 
decide either to go on to the next level
or<00:03:58.099> restart<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.280> level<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.759> hopes<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.180> get

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
or restart the level in hopes to get

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.229 
or restart the level in hopes to get
gold<00:04:01.439> stars<00:04:01.590> on<00:04:02.189> all<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.609> these<00:04:02.699> as<00:04:02.939> you<00:04:03.060> can

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
gold stars on all of these as you can

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.420 
gold stars on all of these as you can
see<00:04:03.449> I<00:04:03.479> took<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.870> little<00:04:04.019> bit<00:04:04.199> of<00:04:04.259> time<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.919> wasn't
