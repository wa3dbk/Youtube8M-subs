00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.470
 halo in a thousandth competition 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.940
 competition in the premier league was a long one 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.889
 time in the air 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.630
 and yet it went wrong they just delivered 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.630
 one point on what went wrong 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 yes i chose you where it went 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.140
 wrong and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.930
 yes the first goal was also unfortunate and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.430
 BirutÃ© started and we must do things 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 just don't have to and meant to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.449
 about two and or nothing about the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.890
 hand but boxing had many chances and om 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.290
 have even more to score that too 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.390
 failed the positions yes at the end 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.920
 stijn with only one point so at the moment 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.790
 that we ourselves lost those two in one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 lead 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.579
 unnecessary loss of ball starts there 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 Believe me it was evil and she was out 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.340
 the second half are not dangerous 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 been first and then a few 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.789
 had a chance and with two one then 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 that belief suddenly came back to the boys 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.579
 then they have 10 more minutes to get there 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 what to do about it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.930
 and unfortunately they have done that on 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.910
 the moment the two fall one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.949
 comes a certain fear in the team 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.539
 because it was the team of combative we 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.080
 gave away for nothing and then on the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.580
 moment was some testing organization 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 Yes No that you're right and I found 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.490
 also that he was frightened into the team 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.710
 and then people will say how is that possible 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.710
 but well we are 12 doing what we think 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.180
 they all too low until this was it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.470
 four matches not won 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.720
 so you feel the pressure of having to 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 yes if nothing is wrong then and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.009
 suddenly out of the blue actually 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.270
 scoring are to gold from us yes then 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.009
 that faith went back among the boys and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 conclude that fear in our team and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.729
 are now a total of 5 games in a row 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.540
 that vitesse does not wind you blow that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.700
 worry worry naturally you always want 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.079
 and find all the competition 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.479
 we just started to make up for it 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.520
 market good goals and these were common 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.320
 important points and the know we hope 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 but we must continue to this 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640
 learn and just move on 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.670
 yes , I can say very often 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.049
 from 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.250
 unbelievable that we are that way 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.790
 have won all those opportunities that we 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.799
 have had 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.390
 Well I will say today it i 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.710
 did not find us in that are not so whole 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.060
 play well but good against such 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.659
 conservative team you come with 2 0 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.710
 in front of 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.049
 then you must also once business 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.100
 and then the athletes would too 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.479
 have been satisfied 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.479
 again unfortunately not happened
