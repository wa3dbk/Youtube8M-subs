00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
for everybody to digest and I'm going to

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.610 
for everybody to digest and I'm going to
split<00:00:02.010> them<00:00:02.159> into<00:00:02.280> into<00:00:02.970> four<00:00:03.210> groups<00:00:03.620> the

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
split them into into four groups the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.000 
split them into into four groups the
first<00:00:04.650> one<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.040> going<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.339> be<00:00:05.460> dairy<00:00:07.010> the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
first one is going to be dairy the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.089 
first one is going to be dairy the
second<00:00:08.340> one<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.490> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> be<00:00:08.849> wheat<00:00:10.099> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
second one is going to be wheat the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.549 
second one is going to be wheat the
third<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:11.820> sugar<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.559> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
third is going to be sugar and the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.570 
third is going to be sugar and the
fourth<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.250> be<00:00:14.340> fat<00:00:15.410> now<00:00:16.410> as<00:00:17.279> much<00:00:17.520> as

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
fourth is going to be fat now as much as

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.050 
fourth is going to be fat now as much as
as<00:00:17.940> many<00:00:18.029> people<00:00:18.570> don't<00:00:18.660> want<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> hear<00:00:19.050> this

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
as many people don't want to hear this

as many people don't want to hear this
dairy<00:00:21.060> products<00:00:21.510> are<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.710> hard<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
dairy products are just really hard to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.870 
dairy products are just really hard to
digest<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.890> some<00:00:25.890> some<00:00:26.189> people<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.519> okay<00:00:26.760> with

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
digest and some some people do okay with

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.210 
digest and some some people do okay with
dairy<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.420> not<00:00:27.660> many<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.619> lot<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
dairy but not many because a lot of a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.130 
dairy but not many because a lot of a
lot<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.609> foods<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.150> plain<00:00:30.390> suck<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> life

out of you because it's so hard for your
body<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.180> digest<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:34.100> now<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.399> something

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
body to digest them now or something

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.220 
body to digest them now or something
like<00:00:35.790> dairy<00:00:36.590> it's<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:39.660> comes<00:00:40.079> from

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
like dairy it's it's like it comes from

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
like dairy it's it's like it comes from
an<00:00:40.410> animal<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> totally<00:00:41.489> different

an animal that has a totally different
digestive<00:00:42.270> system<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.719> humans<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.320> cows

digestive system that humans do cows

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.190 
digestive system that humans do cows
have<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> fourth<00:00:45.210> stomach<00:00:45.420> system<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
have for a fourth stomach system and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.340 
have for a fourth stomach system and
it's<00:00:46.890> meant<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.129> calves<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.870> nature

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it's meant for calves and in nature

it's meant for calves and in nature
every<00:00:50.039> man<00:00:50.280> will<00:00:50.460> gets<00:00:50.640> weaned<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.600> not

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
every man will gets weaned you know not

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.250 
every man will gets weaned you know not
that<00:00:52.320> long<00:00:52.379> after<00:00:52.860> they're<00:00:53.010> born<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.300> why

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that long after they're born and so why

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.540 
that long after they're born and so why
is<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> human<00:00:55.860> thing<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> drink

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is it a human thing we have to drink

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.799 
is it a human thing we have to drink
milk<00:00:56.699> our<00:00:56.910> whole<00:00:57.090> lives<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
milk our whole lives like it just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.010 
milk our whole lives like it just
doesn't<00:00:58.079> make<00:00:58.140> sense<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.969> dairy<00:01:00.020> products

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
doesn't make sense and dairy products

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
doesn't make sense and dairy products
are<00:01:01.109> very<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:01.710> hard<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.010> digest<00:01:02.270> they

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
are very very hard to digest they

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
are very very hard to digest they
ferment<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.260> sit<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.650> produce<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
ferment they just sit they produce a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.330 
ferment they just sit they produce a
tremendous<00:01:05.339> amount<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.909> mucus<00:01:06.330> there's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
tremendous amount of mucus there's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.260 
tremendous amount of mucus there's
antibiotics<00:01:08.340> there's<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> lot<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> things

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
antibiotics there's just a lot of things

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.940 
antibiotics there's just a lot of things
in<00:01:09.510> dairy<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.350> people<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
in dairy that don't do people a lot of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.270 
in dairy that don't do people a lot of
good<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.869> yes<00:01:12.869> yes<00:01:13.170> yes<00:01:13.409> there's<00:01:13.650> calcium<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
good and yes yes yes there's calcium and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010 
good and yes yes yes there's calcium and
dairy<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.180> another<00:01:15.390> issue<00:01:15.479> about

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
dairy but that's another issue about

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
dairy but that's another issue about
dairy<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.920> can't<00:01:17.189> assimilate<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
dairy is that we can't assimilate the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
dairy is that we can't assimilate the
calcium<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:18.960> dairy<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
calcium from dairy it's in it but it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.399 
calcium from dairy it's in it but it
doesn't<00:01:20.640> mean<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.970> absorb<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
doesn't mean we can absorb it it's the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
doesn't mean we can absorb it it's the
same<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.619> there's<00:01:22.950> calcium<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.670> egg<00:01:23.909> shells

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
same as there's calcium in egg shells

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
same as there's calcium in egg shells
why<00:01:24.360> don't<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.540> eat<00:01:24.600> egg<00:01:24.900> shells<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.560> can't

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
why don't we eat egg shells you can't

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.020 
why don't we eat egg shells you can't
digest<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.850> can't<00:01:27.119> absorb<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:28.939> want<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
digest it you can't absorb it I want to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
digest it you can't absorb it I want to
turn<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.450> an<00:01:30.659> hour<00:01:30.990> seminar<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.560> this

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
turn this into an hour seminar on this

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.200 
turn this into an hour seminar on this
issue<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.820> research<00:01:32.850> on

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
issue but if you do your research on

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.749 
issue but if you do your research on
you'll<00:01:33.450> find<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.520> very

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you'll find that that we we have a very

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.819 
you'll find that that we we have a very
difficult<00:01:35.939> time<00:01:36.240> absorbing<00:01:36.990> calcium<00:01:37.380> from

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
difficult time absorbing calcium from

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.710 
difficult time absorbing calcium from
dairy<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> heavy<00:01:38.670> protein<00:01:39.240> any

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
dairy because it's a heavy protein any

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
dairy because it's a heavy protein any
heavy<00:01:39.960> approaching<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.890> can't<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
heavy approaching you really can't I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.210 
heavy approaching you really can't I
just<00:01:41.280> assimilate<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.390> calcium<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
just assimilate the calcium from that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.179 
just assimilate the calcium from that
the<00:01:44.220> second<00:01:44.549> thing<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.759> wheat<00:01:45.619> when<00:01:46.619> i<00:01:46.649> farmed

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the second thing is wheat when i farmed

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
the second thing is wheat when i farmed
we<00:01:47.430> grew<00:01:47.790> wheat<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.810> were<00:01:48.960> weak<00:01:49.140> because

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we grew wheat and we were weak because

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.179 
we grew wheat and we were weak because
it<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.680> cheap<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.310> easy<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> grow<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.720> can

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
it was cheap it was easy to grow you can

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.310 
it was cheap it was easy to grow you can
it's<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.399> Hardy<00:01:53.850> against<00:01:54.149> tough<00:01:54.509> frost<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it's very Hardy against tough frost and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's very Hardy against tough frost and
many<00:01:55.710> chemicals<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.890> an

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
many chemicals it's just that it's an

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.819 
many chemicals it's just that it's an
easy<00:01:59.280> thing<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.030> grow<00:02:00.240> which<00:02:01.079> makes<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> cheap

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
easy thing to grow which makes it cheap

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.249 
easy thing to grow which makes it cheap
because<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.399> abundance<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.990> as

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
because it's an abundance and so as
