those four things will spread out as far
as<00:00:20.850> possible<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.600> that's<00:00:21.779> what's<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.289> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
as possible and that's what's going to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560 
as possible and that's what's going to
give<00:00:22.500> us<00:00:22.619> our<00:00:22.740> molecular<00:00:23.310> geometry<00:00:23.939> or<00:00:24.269> our

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
give us our molecular geometry or our

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.589 
give us our molecular geometry or our

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
shape for h2o in order to visualize that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.679 
shape for h2o in order to visualize that
let's<00:00:27.930> look<00:00:28.170> at<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.560> three<00:00:28.890> dimensions<00:00:29.039> so

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
let's look at it in three dimensions so

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.089 
let's look at it in three dimensions so
here's<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> water<00:00:31.050> molecule<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
here's the water molecule we have the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.889 
here's the water molecule we have the
red<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.850> oxygen<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.630> hydrogen's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
red that's the oxygen and the hydrogen's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
red that's the oxygen and the hydrogen's
are<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> whites<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> lone<00:00:35.969> pair

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
are the whites and then the lone pair

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.260 
are the whites and then the lone pair
electrons<00:00:36.750> there<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.230> top<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.149> at

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
electrons there on top so as we look at

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
electrons there on top so as we look at
this<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> straight

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this we can see it's not a straight

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.459 
this we can see it's not a straight
molecule<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.690> bent<00:00:43.020> shape

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
molecule it actually has a bent shape

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
molecule it actually has a bent shape
and<00:00:43.739> that's<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> molecular

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and that's going to be the molecular

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
and that's going to be the molecular
geometry<00:00:45.149> bent<00:00:46.140> let's<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.250> back<00:00:47.550> though<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
geometry bent let's go back though and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
geometry bent let's go back though and
look<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.480> another<00:00:48.750> method<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.440> determine<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
look at another method to determine the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.049 
look at another method to determine the
molecular<00:00:50.039> geometry

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
molecular geometry

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.260 
molecular geometry
we'll<00:00:51.629> use<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.989> ax<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> notation<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.000> figure

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
we'll use the ax and notation to figure

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.290 
we'll use the ax and notation to figure
out<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> geometry<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.789> that's<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.030> central

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
out the geometry a that's the central

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.849 
out the geometry a that's the central
atom<00:00:57.510> we're<00:00:57.780> dealing<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.469> case<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
atom we're dealing with in this case the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.970 
atom we're dealing with in this case the
oxygen<00:00:59.430> X<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> number

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
oxygen X that's going to be the number

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
oxygen X that's going to be the number
of<00:01:02.010> atoms<00:01:02.460> attached<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> oxygen<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.870> have

of atoms attached to the oxygen we have

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.509 
of atoms attached to the oxygen we have
the<00:01:04.110> two<00:01:04.260> hydrogen's<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:04.949> we're<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> put

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the two hydrogen's so we're going to put

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.690 
the two hydrogen's so we're going to put
it<00:01:05.610> two<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.420> n<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.130> nonbonding

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it two here and n that's the nonbonding

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.719 
it two here and n that's the nonbonding
electron<00:01:09.570> pairs<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:10.979> pairs<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.610> have

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
electron pairs we have two pairs we have
