 welcome to our block is also 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.459
 sure to have a license to carry 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.469
 weapons does not mean any guarantee of 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.940
 that they are used correctly 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.340
 there are a number of guidelines there 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.930
 to respect to safeguard life 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.279
 of the people around us 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.630
 purpose of this topic we are going to 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.190
 link with our eric companion 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.510
 blacksmith who is in the polygon 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.660
 of the 'black eagles' who go to 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.789
 give a chair on this matter were 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.250
 very good morning like these claudia very 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.910
 good morning indeed this I have 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.710
 in my hands is not a toy sir is 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.600
 about all civilians the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.640
 responsibility to carry a weapon of 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.770
 fire is very big because not only 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.110
 can harm a person yourself 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.110
 it can also be damaged is what 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.050
 recommends the master instructor of the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.969
 lucky randy and roses' captain we have 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.329
 here different types of weapons the 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 staff is practicing to be able 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.940
 effectively carry out the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.280
 dexterity but a civilian yesterday we have seen 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720
 a person who apparently has not 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.000
 had control of the situation 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.670
 He has unsheathed his weapon and started 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.470
 shoot indiscriminately which 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.289
 is the recommendation for civilians 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.110
 capital thank you good morning 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:22.590
 effectively firearms are very 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.689
 dangerous and its use is recommended that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.060
 the personnel who use it are trained 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.659
 you have to refer a training a 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.250
 training not the firearm well 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.560
 How can you give security too? 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.229
 can cause injury and its use has to 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.690
 be keeping mediation is the case 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.220
 in case for example of criminals not 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.319
 who have long used indiscriminate 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.049
 of that in exchange for police cash 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.289
 has to identify the threat to 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.850
 do you receive use of your firearm not 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.190
 we must use the captain weapon to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.610
 teach us how we should use the weapon 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.500
 I want to go out and get my license 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.950
 weapons what is the correct position as 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.689
 I have to see if the weapon 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.070
 to charge to explain all that but 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.409
 good the recommendation that I can give you 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.509
 civilians is that when you keep a gun 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.670
 of fire is not to show it is not for 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.269
 exhibit it has to be on 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.890
 correct form in a sleeve can not one 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.590
 make a career and you can drop the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.420
 weapon has to have a sleeve that is 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.790
 to the belt safely 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.140
 also when we push the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.239
 weapon has to be towards a safe place 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.040
 always down 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.840
 we should not point up because 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 there can be a western shot and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.190
 cause a person who is in a to 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.769
 balcony a building or suddenly too 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.930
 with the makes an accidental shot with the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.489
 same force that comes out in the warhead goes to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.849
 fall and an injury will happen against 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.549
 second in the anus never ever always 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.400
 alarmed the 45 degrees 5 degrees towards 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.140
 down a safe way if this happens a 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.800
 shooting incident will fall to the ground and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.110
 will cause us injury 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.050
 well that captain then jaime 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.280
 claudio I do not know if you have any 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.220
 consult from studies the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.700
 recommendations then as I said the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.240
 captain this is not this is not a toy 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.120
 it's not to show off it's not so they have 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.530
 and showing it to people at 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.150
 friends especially the people who are going to 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.870
 meetings and suddenly they like to take 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.670
 always keep the firearm 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.810
 saved I do not know jaime clear if they have 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 some query that I wanted to be 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.980
 ask the man who accompanies you is if 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.410
 is that at some point it has 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.300
 considered to be a bit more rigorous in 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.710
 grant this type of license because 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.330
 the permissions let's say the part 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.520
 psychological is 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.840
 I do not want to, I do not want to use 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.670
 is less relaxed if it is not enough 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.820
 flexible so to speak then it 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.140
 can easily access then in 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.810
 some time it has been considered to be 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.810
 much more rigorous in this permit 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.370
 I have heard the answer, ask 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.760
 captain roses but the permissions we 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.220
 discretion granted that the DISCAMEC 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.770
 entity responsible for issuing the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.740
 firearm certificates but the 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.020
 evaluation to all civilians should be 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.550
 rigorous and I think because the handle 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.680
 a gun needs a 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.980
 emotional stability because in a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.540
 critical situation extreme situation 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.370
 the senses are sharpened and if the person 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.100
 does not have the training preparation 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.140
 is going to block and can cause 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.350
 collateral damage to people who are 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.910
 find in the vicinity not clear 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.330
 a scourge opinion was very important 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.780
 about this matter not exactly 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.360
 we were not necessarily 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.820
 es disc swat friend what interests us 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.860
 know is your opinion from the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.560
 experience and expertise you have in 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.200
 armament because it seems that the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.020
 conditions the requirements to have 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.090
 a license are not entirely rigorous 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.850
 hence what has happened in san juan de 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.100
 lurigancho what explanations can we 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.100
 give what happened for example there that 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.720
 the authorities have passed there 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.090
 commissioned reserve the investigation 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.040
 but in my opinion how do I turn it 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.990
 repeat to handle a firearm 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.730
 you have to have enough training 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.760
 and enough preparation that's not going to 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.650
 allow in a situation of risk 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.620
 Act appropriately in a workout 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.060
 of preparation we can detail that 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.010
 precisely in that with alcohol 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.930
 that is also indispensable is 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.160
 fundamental you have to follow the measure of 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.169
 security always at all times 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.340
 how much training time does it take 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.870
 a person to be able to handle 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.820
 skillfully human 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.380
 for example a police that does the 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.600
 course the soft of obligations 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.940
 static is police personnel already with 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.550
 experience does a three-month course 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.470
 preparation after that they receive it 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.330
 graduate and can work in the unit 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.580
 swat and a civilian pretty much how much 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.620
 time to have that good specifically 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.870
 I do not know the time but I imagine that 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.190
 must be rigorous also not because 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.810
 We are talking about a firearm that 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.970
 can cause a lot of injury has to 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.920
 have concentration of your body 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.660
 concentration of your weapon and concentration 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.540
 in the situation where you are 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.220
 be a clear captain effectively have 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.770
 than having a physical pressure a 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.420
 mental preparation to be able to use the 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.040
 firearm not because we can cause 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.040
 a lot of injury like I'm going to repeat with 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.430
 is speaking specifically in the case 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.830
 of the police regarding preparation 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.560
 you need cash to handle 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.930
 certain determined type of weapon 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.210
 because they do not all have the same 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.770
 manipulation as I say in the unit 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.440
 tactical actions of police personnel 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.690
 receives a preparation a course of three 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.520
 expensive months but nothing to get out of 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.380
 this course they receive an advanced course already 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.199
 to work in unity to intervene 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.740
 in situations of risk it can very well 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:49.070
 I think it's been clear about everything 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.200
 expertise that has 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.810
 to this national police unit 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.280
 to own weaponry and a weapon like 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.310
 well he said dedicate the beginning of this 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.340
 report is not a game our game 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:04.130
 thanks series thank you also to the captain 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.410
 very good roses for these 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.390
 recommendations you have to have a lot 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.430
 watch out 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.620
 probably the permits 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.470
 that are granted in discamec could be 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:18.770
 as well you said even more rigorous 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.230
 because it seems that at least in what 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:25.610
 the psychological profile is concerned there is no 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:27.230
 Exactly enough evaluation 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.610
 jaime but we have to go to a 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.210
 pause and let's go back with a block 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.210
 very important
