yes so the building of this is about a
six-month<00:01:11.470> project<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:13.180> started<00:01:13.210> out<00:01:13.750> shaping

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
six-month project we started out shaping

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.039 
six-month project we started out shaping
it<00:01:14.740> based<00:01:14.979> off<00:01:15.189> of<00:01:15.220> some<00:01:15.549> of<00:01:15.580> our<00:01:16.049> previous

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049

it based off of some of our previous
designs<00:01:17.619> that<00:01:17.799> I've<00:01:17.950> done<00:01:18.360> I've<00:01:19.360> tried<00:01:19.630> to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
designs that I've done I've tried to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.420 
designs that I've done I've tried to
incorporate<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.320> into<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.560> Polaris<00:01:21.039> had<00:01:21.250> about

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
incorporate it into a Polaris had about

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.740 
incorporate it into a Polaris had about
three<00:01:21.670> different<00:01:21.970> attempts<00:01:22.299> at<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.689> this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
three different attempts at it and this

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.469 
three different attempts at it and this
is<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.049> final<00:01:23.409> one<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:24.250> first<00:01:25.119> one<00:01:25.240> was

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
is the final one the first one was

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.570 
is the final one the first one was
called<00:01:25.509> had<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.020> roof<00:01:26.259> visibility<00:01:27.159> was<00:01:27.280> kind<00:01:27.490> of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
called had a roof visibility was kind of

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.300 
called had a roof visibility was kind of
limited<00:01:28.080> kind<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.140> looked<00:01:29.289> like<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.470> want<00:01:30.280> to

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
limited kind of looked like a want to

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.529 
limited kind of looked like a want to
call<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:30.580> maybe<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.850> smart<00:01:31.179> car<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.509> a

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
call it maybe a smart car and a

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.080 
call it maybe a smart car and a
Volkswagen<00:01:32.049> combined<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:33.310> I've<00:01:33.640> tried<00:01:33.789> to<00:01:33.970> get

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
Volkswagen combined so I've tried to get

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.669 
Volkswagen combined so I've tried to get
rid<00:01:34.179> of<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.360> look<00:01:34.600> by<00:01:34.840> improving<00:01:35.470> some<00:01:35.590> of

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
rid of that look by improving some of

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.490 
rid of that look by improving some of
the<00:01:35.740> body<00:01:35.920> lines<00:01:36.190> blowing<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.030> sides

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the body lines blowing the sides

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.809 
the body lines blowing the sides
eliminating<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.590> roof<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:39.009> now<00:01:39.130> eventually

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
eliminating the roof for now eventually

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.550 
eliminating the roof for now eventually
we<00:01:40.000> might<00:01:40.149> go<00:01:40.299> back<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.690> roof<00:01:40.899> design<00:01:41.140> with<00:01:41.530> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
we might go back to a roof design with a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.669 
we might go back to a roof design with a
windshield<00:01:41.860> some<00:01:42.819> other<00:01:42.970> options<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.530> for

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
windshield some other options but for

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.289 
windshield some other options but for
now<00:01:44.740> this<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.039> finished<00:01:45.369> product<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.909> I

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
now this is a finished product and I

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:59.310 
now this is a finished product and I
think<00:01:47.289> we're<00:01:47.380> pretty<00:01:47.500> happy<00:01:47.679> with<00:01:47.860> it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.920 

okay<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.680> now<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.340> door<00:02:01.750> for<00:02:02.750> the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
okay so now we have the door for the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.500 
okay so now we have the door for the
glass<00:02:03.110> double<00:02:03.620> wall<00:02:03.770> construction<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.360> a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
glass double wall construction so it's a
