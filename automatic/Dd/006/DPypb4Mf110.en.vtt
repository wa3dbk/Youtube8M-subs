00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
they are used only in race driving

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.740 
they are used only in race driving
things<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.790> know<00:02:26.940> Formula<00:02:27.599> one

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
things like that you know Formula one

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.670 
things like that you know Formula one
cars<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:28.290> race<00:02:28.319> cars<00:02:28.769> however<00:02:29.549> we<00:02:29.940> still<00:02:30.269> have

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
cars or race cars however we still have

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.430 
cars or race cars however we still have
during<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.769> crash<00:02:32.010> some<00:02:32.610> way<00:02:33.049> that's<00:02:34.049> not<00:02:34.290> very

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
during a crash some way that's not very

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.979 
during a crash some way that's not very
good<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.489> when<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:36.390> was<00:02:36.860> found<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:39.150> seatbelt

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
good so when this was found the seatbelt

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.350 
good so when this was found the seatbelt
pretensioners<00:02:40.110> were<00:02:41.099> developed<00:02:41.610> seatbelt

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
pretensioners were developed seatbelt

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.839 
pretensioners were developed seatbelt
pretensioners<00:02:42.480> mean<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.950> pull<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.610> belt

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
pretensioners mean you pull the belt

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.199 
pretensioners mean you pull the belt
very<00:02:45.599> tight<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.220> can't<00:02:47.489> fall<00:02:47.790> into<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
very tight so you can't fall into the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.229 
very tight so you can't fall into the
bed<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.870> already<00:02:49.170> there<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.670> low

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
bed it's already there so you have low

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.600 
bed it's already there so you have low
loads<00:02:51.599> on<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.019> chest<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.950> pelvis<00:02:53.340> or

let's say minimize load on the chest or

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.750 
let's say minimize load on the chest or
pelvis<00:02:56.849> not<00:02:57.540> more<00:02:57.780> than<00:02:57.959> necessary<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:59.430> next

thing was in very severe accidents you

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.840 
thing was in very severe accidents you
might<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:03.180> heavy<00:03:03.450> loads<00:03:04.700> coming<00:03:05.700> from

might have to heavy loads coming from

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.599 
might have to heavy loads coming from
this<00:03:06.000> small<00:03:06.750> bed<00:03:06.989> here<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.739> ribs<00:03:07.980> they

this small bed here on the ribs they

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.530 
this small bed here on the ribs they
might<00:03:08.940> break<00:03:09.239> we<00:03:10.170> learned<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:11.299> from<00:03:12.299> real

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
might break we learned this from real

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.900 
might break we learned this from real
accidents<00:03:13.139> of<00:03:13.230> course<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.799> from<00:03:13.920> research<00:03:14.730> as

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
accidents of course and from research as

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.319 
accidents of course and from research as
well<00:03:15.090> therefore<00:03:15.930> we<00:03:16.470> now<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:17.099> systems<00:03:17.639> that

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
well therefore we now have systems that

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.470 
well therefore we now have systems that
lower<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.989> tension<00:03:19.440> during<00:03:20.160> an<00:03:20.459> accident<00:03:20.639> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
lower the tension during an accident the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.780 
lower the tension during an accident the
special<00:03:21.930> range<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.500> tension<00:03:22.889> is<00:03:23.040> reached

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
special range of tension is reached

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.930 
special range of tension is reached
so<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.780> give<00:03:25.079> way<00:03:25.709> or<00:03:25.739> they<00:03:26.130> give<00:03:26.340> way<00:03:26.579> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
so you give way or they give way the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.199 
so you give way or they give way the
belt<00:03:27.090> gives<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.450> way<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:28.200> decelerate<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
belt gives you way to decelerate and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.870 
belt gives you way to decelerate and
this<00:03:30.620> meinem<00:03:31.620> eise's<00:03:31.980> loads<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.579> chest

this meinem eise's loads on the chest

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:49.460 
this meinem eise's loads on the chest
it's<00:03:33.269> good<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.750> ribs

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.729 

where<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.740> safety<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.900> safety<00:03:52.900> belts<00:03:53.319> today

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
where the safety of safety belts today

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.940 
where the safety of safety belts today
is<00:03:54.270> their<00:03:55.270> high-tech<00:03:55.780> instruments<00:03:56.560> they<00:03:56.709> are

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
is their high-tech instruments they are

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.370 
is their high-tech instruments they are
not<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.489> belt<00:03:57.730> they<00:03:58.330> have<00:03:58.569> improved<00:03:59.020> in

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
not just a belt they have improved in

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.290 
not just a belt they have improved in
many<00:03:59.410> aspects<00:04:00.130> for<00:04:00.340> example<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.849> have<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.000> seat

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
many aspects for example you have a seat

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.290 
many aspects for example you have a seat
belt<00:04:01.599> tensioner<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:03.069> in<00:04:03.400> case<00:04:03.819> an<00:04:04.120> accident

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
belt tensioner so in case an accident

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.040 
belt tensioner so in case an accident
occurs<00:04:05.050> first<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.800> belt<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.790> moving<00:04:07.300> very

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
occurs first the belt is moving very

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.260 
occurs first the belt is moving very
close<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.650> your<00:04:08.800> body<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.370> keeps<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:09.910> upright

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
close to your body it keeps you upright

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.720 
close to your body it keeps you upright
in<00:04:10.630> your<00:04:10.810> seat<00:04:11.110> which<00:04:11.380> helps<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:11.920> reduce<00:04:12.459> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
in your seat which helps to reduce the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.520 
in your seat which helps to reduce the
travel<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.300> you're<00:04:13.480> making<00:04:13.660> forward<00:04:14.319> with

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
travel that you're making forward with

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.690 
travel that you're making forward with
the<00:04:14.620> belt<00:04:14.890> on<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.819> other<00:04:16.060> hand<00:04:16.450> there's<00:04:17.019> a

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
the belt on the other hand there's a

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.090 
the belt on the other hand there's a
force<00:04:18.700> limiter<00:04:19.269> which<00:04:19.780> limits<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.500> force<00:04:20.799> in

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
force limiter which limits the force in

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.010 
force limiter which limits the force in
case<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.609> have<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> very<00:04:21.880> severe<00:04:22.479> accident

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
case you have a very severe accident

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.990 
case you have a very severe accident
because<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.470> can<00:04:23.680> be<00:04:23.889> hurt<00:04:24.310> by<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.639> belt

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
because you can be hurt by the belt

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.150 
because you can be hurt by the belt
itself<00:04:25.479> so<00:04:26.169> there<00:04:26.440> has<00:04:26.560> been<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.800> lot<00:04:27.040> of

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
itself so there has been a lot of

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.760 
itself so there has been a lot of
construction<00:04:27.610> details<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.720> improve<00:04:29.169> the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
construction details to improve the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.980 
construction details to improve the
