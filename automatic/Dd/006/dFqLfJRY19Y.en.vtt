just so it looks a little bit more
realistic<00:02:25.209> but<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.569> cue<00:02:26.930> Avery<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.590> cute

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
realistic but this is cue Avery is cute

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.740 
realistic but this is cue Avery is cute
she's<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.819> asymmetrical<00:02:31.819> type<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.390> bob

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
she's like a asymmetrical type of bob

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.110 
she's like a asymmetrical type of bob
it's<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.500> little<00:02:33.769> longer<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.819> side<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.970> has

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
it's a little longer on this side it has

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.380 
it's a little longer on this side it has
this<00:02:38.330> really<00:02:38.540> dramatic<00:02:38.840> bang<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.120> think

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
this really dramatic bang and I think

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.360 
this really dramatic bang and I think
you<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.690> do<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.170> whatever<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.650> want<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.129> it

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
you can do like whatever you want to it

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.339 
you can do like whatever you want to it
like<00:02:43.819> I<00:02:44.650> mean<00:02:45.760> there's<00:02:46.760> different<00:02:47.140> things<00:02:48.140> you
