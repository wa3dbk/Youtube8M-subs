it sounds like I'm just talking about

some combination of the matrix and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.200 
some combination of the matrix and
terminator<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:32.880> into

terminator and you know that I'm into

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
terminator and you know that I'm into
cyborgs<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.260> things<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.829> that's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
cyborgs and things like that but that's

and the UK already have military robots

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.310 
and the UK already have military robots
with<00:00:46.980> some<00:00:47.280> level<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.879> autonomy<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.660> in

with some level of autonomy and in

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.130 
with some level of autonomy and in
particular<00:00:49.469> both<00:00:50.010> China<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.760> Russia<00:00:51.180> pretty

important<00:00:52.500> states<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:52.949> working<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.850> weapons

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
important states are working on weapons

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
important states are working on weapons
systems<00:00:55.050> robotic<00:00:55.620> weapon<00:00:55.890> systems<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.309> will

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
systems robotic weapon systems that will

systems robotic weapon systems that will
be<00:00:56.640> fully<00:00:57.120> autonomous<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.199> Lethal<00:00:58.620> lethal

be fully autonomous with Lethal lethal
capabilities<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> lot<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> people<00:01:00.930> are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
capabilities and so a lot of people are

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.209 
capabilities and so a lot of people are
very<00:01:01.230> worried<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.129> they

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
very worried about this because they

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
very worried about this because they
don't<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> idea<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.570> human<00:01:03.930> being

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
don't like the idea of a human being

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
don't like the idea of a human being
taken<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.010> equation<00:01:05.580> when<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.880> comes

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
taken out of the equation when it comes

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.940 
taken out of the equation when it comes
to<00:01:06.299> actual<00:01:06.689> life<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> death<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.530> other<00:01:07.619> human

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to actual life and death for other human

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
to actual life and death for other human
beings<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> couple<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> people

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
beings and so a couple of the people

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
beings and so a couple of the people
involved<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.619> these<00:01:10.770> talks<00:01:11.070> we've<00:01:11.310> got<00:01:11.430> Mary

on<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.400> autonomous<00:03:11.790> planes<00:03:12.330> when<00:03:12.540> they<00:03:12.570> are

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
on these autonomous planes when they are

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.780 
on these autonomous planes when they are
developed<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.770> terms<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.100> cost<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.640> in

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
developed so in terms of cost and in

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.400 
developed so in terms of cost and in
terms<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.300> actual<00:03:15.600> what<00:03:15.780> they're<00:03:15.930> capable<00:03:16.080> of

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
terms of actual what they're capable of

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.290 
terms of actual what they're capable of
doing<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.370> very<00:03:17.580> appealing<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.180> so

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
doing it can be very appealing and so

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.270 
doing it can be very appealing and so
for<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.540> reason<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.990> imagine<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.010> US

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
for that reason I imagine that the US

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.950 
for that reason I imagine that the US
military<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.940> militaries<00:03:21.420> around<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.750> world

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
military and militaries around the world

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.870 
military and militaries around the world
this<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.800> going<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.430> something<00:03:23.700> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
this is going to be something that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.550 
this is going to be something that
happens<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:24.690> perhaps<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> good<00:03:25.410> thing

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
happens and so perhaps is a good thing

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.530 
happens and so perhaps is a good thing
that<00:03:25.740> this<00:03:25.830> campaign<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.460> stop<00:03:26.700> killer<00:03:27.120> robots

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
that this campaign to stop killer robots

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.360 
that this campaign to stop killer robots
is<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:27.930> there<00:03:28.140> because<00:03:28.860> they<00:03:28.980> don't<00:03:29.160> want

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
is out there because they don't want

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.430 
is out there because they don't want
each<00:03:29.580> military<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.810> take<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.200> make<00:03:31.320> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
each military to take to make the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.290 
each military to take to make the
decision<00:03:31.830> on<00:03:31.980> their<00:03:32.520> own<00:03:32.580> are<00:03:33.000> we<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:33.240> use

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
decision on their own are we gonna use

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.880 
decision on their own are we gonna use
these<00:03:33.660> weapons<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.140> not<00:03:34.230> they<00:03:34.470> want<00:03:34.800> an

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
these weapons or not they want an

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.520 
these weapons or not they want an
international<00:03:35.490> treaty<00:03:36.150> through<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.660> UN<00:03:36.990> that

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
international treaty through the UN that

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.800 
international treaty through the UN that
would<00:03:37.710> bar<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:37.980> use<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.490> these<00:03:38.580> weapons<00:03:38.810> but

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
would bar the use of these weapons but

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.810 
would bar the use of these weapons but
let's<00:03:39.960> talk<00:03:40.110> about<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.440> ethics<00:03:40.740> of<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.460> it

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
let's talk about the ethics of it is it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.810 
let's talk about the ethics of it is it
inherently<00:03:42.450> unethical<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.590> allow<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> robot<00:03:44.580> or

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
inherently unethical to allow a robot or

inherently unethical to allow a robot or

certainly<00:03:51.270> makes<00:03:51.630> me<00:03:51.900> uncomfortable<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:53.520> we

certainly makes me uncomfortable but we

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.250 
certainly makes me uncomfortable but we

armed with weapons it's a human using a
camera<00:04:29.400> that's<00:04:29.670> deciding<00:04:30.120> when<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.270> fire

camera that's deciding when to fire
drones<00:04:31.920> don't<00:04:32.220> choose<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.760> fire<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.240> their<00:04:33.390> own

drones don't choose to fire on their own

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.210 
drones don't choose to fire on their own
but<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.350> could<00:04:34.470> very<00:04:34.500> well<00:04:34.710> happen<00:04:34.950> in<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
but it could very well happen in the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.080 
but it could very well happen in the
future<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:36.480> think<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:37.170> one<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.580> fear<00:04:38.820> is

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
future and I think that one the fear is

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.820 
future and I think that one the fear is
that<00:04:39.300> robots<00:04:39.690> would<00:04:39.840> either<00:04:39.930> make<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.320> mistake

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
that robots would either make a mistake

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.280 
that robots would either make a mistake
or<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:41.160> they<00:04:41.970> would<00:04:42.240> turn<00:04:42.540> on<00:04:42.720> us<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:43.050> some

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
or that they would turn on us in some

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.200 
or that they would turn on us in some
way<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.740> kill<00:04:43.950> civilians<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.730> that's

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
way and kill civilians and that's

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.540 
way and kill civilians and that's
certainly<00:04:45.600> not<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.290> be<00:04:46.320> discounted<00:04:46.710> but

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
certainly not to be discounted but

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.100 
certainly not to be discounted but
humans<00:04:47.850> make<00:04:48.030> mistakes<00:04:48.060> all<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.600> time<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.050> it

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
humans make mistakes all the time so it

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.190 
humans make mistakes all the time so it
reminds<00:04:49.410> me<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.160> debate<00:04:51.060> over

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
reminds me of the the debate over

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.480 
reminds me of the the debate over
autonomous<00:04:52.200> cars<00:04:52.500> what<00:04:53.130> if<00:04:53.220> they<00:04:53.310> get<00:04:53.400> an

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
autonomous cars what if they get an

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.730 
autonomous cars what if they get an
accident<00:04:53.970> yeah<00:04:54.570> they<00:04:54.750> might<00:04:54.990> but<00:04:55.260> humans<00:04:55.590> get

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
accident yeah they might but humans get

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.650 
accident yeah they might but humans get
an<00:04:55.800> accidents<00:04:56.160> all<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.310> times<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.970> in<00:04:57.300> it's

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
an accidents all the times and in it's

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.780 
an accidents all the times and in it's
not<00:04:57.900> impossible<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.590> imagine<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.430> humans

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
not impossible to imagine that humans

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.430 
not impossible to imagine that humans
could<00:04:59.940> actually<00:05:00.060> be<00:05:00.240> less<00:05:00.480> capable<00:05:00.930> both<00:05:01.200> of

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
could actually be less capable both of

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.560 
could actually be less capable both of
driving<00:05:01.830> cars<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.100> also<00:05:02.520> deciding<00:05:03.000> who<00:05:03.390> is<00:05:03.540> a

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
driving cars and also deciding who is a

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.170 
driving cars and also deciding who is a
combatant<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.140> who's<00:05:04.290> not<00:05:04.560> now<00:05:05.490> if<00:05:05.700> we<00:05:05.910> found

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
combatant and who's not now if we found

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.820 
combatant and who's not now if we found
that<00:05:06.330> these<00:05:06.480> robots<00:05:06.870> were<00:05:07.110> making<00:05:07.530> lots<00:05:07.710> of

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
that these robots were making lots of

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.830 
that these robots were making lots of
mistakes<00:05:07.950> then<00:05:08.490> sure<00:05:08.700> shudder<00:05:09.060> them<00:05:09.270> or<00:05:09.450> box

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
mistakes then sure shudder them or box

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.420 
mistakes then sure shudder them or box
them<00:05:10.110> or<00:05:10.260> whatever<00:05:10.650> depending<00:05:10.950> on<00:05:11.160> who<00:05:11.310> have

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
them or whatever depending on who have

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.120 
them or whatever depending on who have
been<00:05:11.520> watching<00:05:11.640> BSG<00:05:12.210> but<00:05:12.900> until<00:05:13.170> that<00:05:13.710> happens

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
been watching BSG but until that happens

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.290 
been watching BSG but until that happens
it's<00:05:14.280> not<00:05:14.340> impossible<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.940> believe<00:05:15.060> they

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
it's not impossible to believe they

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.460 
it's not impossible to believe they
could<00:05:15.360> actually<00:05:15.540> be<00:05:15.750> better<00:05:15.960> at<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.170> and

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
could actually be better at it and

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.220 
could actually be better at it and
really<00:05:17.340> like<00:05:17.580> right<00:05:17.880> now<00:05:18.180> civilians<00:05:19.020> are

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
really like right now civilians are

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.620 
really like right now civilians are
dying<00:05:19.470> our<00:05:19.830> drone<00:05:20.130> strikes<00:05:20.460> very<00:05:20.850> often<00:05:21.360> kill

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
dying our drone strikes very often kill

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.050 
dying our drone strikes very often kill
civilians<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.560> there's<00:05:23.190> no<00:05:23.370> robot<00:05:23.820> making

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
civilians and there's no robot making

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.850 
civilians and there's no robot making
the<00:05:24.300> decision<00:05:24.630> there<00:05:24.870> it's<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.260> human<00:05:25.620> being

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
the decision there it's a human being

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.740 
the decision there it's a human being
who's<00:05:26.130> making<00:05:26.460> that<00:05:26.490> unethical<00:05:27.120> decision<00:05:27.540> and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
who's making that unethical decision and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.840 
who's making that unethical decision and
so<00:05:28.320> while<00:05:28.500> I<00:05:28.530> sympathize<00:05:29.040> with<00:05:29.310> these<00:05:29.580> people

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
so while I sympathize with these people

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.280 
so while I sympathize with these people
who<00:05:29.940> want<00:05:30.060> to<00:05:30.180> stop<00:05:30.390> robots<00:05:30.840> from<00:05:30.990> making

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
who want to stop robots from making

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.690 
who want to stop robots from making
decisions<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:31.740> could<00:05:31.950> cost<00:05:32.130> human<00:05:32.460> lives

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
decisions that could cost human lives

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.520 
decisions that could cost human lives
right<00:05:33.450> now<00:05:33.570> we<00:05:33.630> already<00:05:33.870> have<00:05:34.050> a<00:05:34.140> huge<00:05:34.320> problem

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
right now we already have a huge problem

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.380 
right now we already have a huge problem
with<00:05:34.650> humans<00:05:35.100> doing<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.670> so<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.120> think<00:05:36.210> that

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
with humans doing it and so I think that

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.090 
with humans doing it and so I think that
in<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.750> end<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.050> robots<00:05:37.410> would<00:05:37.560> be<00:05:37.650> following

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
in the end the robots would be following

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.240 
in the end the robots would be following
at<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.940> orders<00:05:39.300> of<00:05:39.770> politicians<00:05:40.770> members

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
at the the orders of politicians members

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.770 
at the the orders of politicians members
of<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.520> military<00:05:41.940> who<00:05:42.390> are<00:05:42.450> just<00:05:42.660> as

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
of the military who are just as

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.240 
of the military who are just as
infallible<00:05:43.110> as<00:05:43.440> they<00:05:43.590> are<00:05:43.680> now<00:05:43.890> when<00:05:44.130> they

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
infallible as they are now when they

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.120 
infallible as they are now when they
order<00:05:44.550> human<00:05:45.240> members<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.050> military<00:05:46.440> into

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
order human members of the military into

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.040 
order human members of the military into
conflict<00:05:47.580> now<00:05:48.180> I<00:05:48.210> know<00:05:48.480> this<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:48.870> somewhat

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
conflict now I know this is somewhat

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.330 
conflict now I know this is somewhat
controversial<00:05:49.500> it's<00:05:49.830> something<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:50.220> I'm

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
controversial it's something that I'm

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.600 
controversial it's something that I'm
