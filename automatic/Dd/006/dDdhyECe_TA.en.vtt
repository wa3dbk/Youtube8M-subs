00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.440
 we have one here and cylinder 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 and percent of these 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.229
 us countries here have two close with it in particular 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.299
 End to used 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.519
 this position is he states together we have to last longer 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.689
 to open 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.880
 an ordinary people before 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.400
 December has two cores once that here 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.899
 the one that is a little clarify and there is 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:28.999
 that again 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.300
 that big Kansas mostly their sides 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.380
 He is not supposed to be "Her death is one 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.450
 if you just change the point Red 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.260
 Langens on the right side a small hole and such a needle 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 adjusted 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.630
 the world once 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.630
 pressed 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 to press Marc Rath's table and 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.640
 in the late year 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.680
 open to it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.840
 this should be 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 the two are pro and Rudas a Hastedt 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 To put this Zehnder back together you just put it 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 the castle rolls the other side 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.910
 and 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.080
 third, he dead together Choules IFRS 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.960
 and to open it all up again 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 Cindy key roles 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.390
 as the NADA reintroduced 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.940
 you could as well 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.660
 take a paper clip for 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.020
 in this case it is diagonally from the side so the needle enters 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.970
 sometimes way too high 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.180
 since then ranks but for this the course change 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.410
 Peters 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.860
 this position 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.260
 no soldier on it 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.119
 and then I can 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.549
 compelling 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 what you build for others 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.429
 partly out again 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.309
 so felt 99 countries 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.180
 to exchange these and cylinder it from the company Winkhaus 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.229
 There is a needle for that 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.559
 to say dts 9 earlier 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.799
 because the first draw the expenses that van Baker is seventh since both make 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.799
 the different manufacturer 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.749
 that's a little bit 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:43.709
 to open that
