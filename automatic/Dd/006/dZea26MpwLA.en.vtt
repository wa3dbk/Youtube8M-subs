00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.720 
Tuesday of tutorial
i<00:00:12.030> am<00:00:12.630> leonardo<00:00:12.840> pereznieto<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.679> today<00:00:14.219> we

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
i am leonardo pereznieto and today we

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.029 
i am leonardo pereznieto and today we
will<00:00:15.059> draw<00:00:15.470> glamorous<00:00:16.470> lips<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.609> feather

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
will draw glamorous lips and a feather

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.529 
will draw glamorous lips and a feather
let's<00:00:20.039> start<00:00:20.430> by<00:00:20.640> sketching<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.359> general

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
let's start by sketching the general

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.000 
let's start by sketching the general
shape<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.500> mouth<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.930> top<00:00:25.199> lip<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
shape of the mouth the top lip and the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.720 
shape of the mouth the top lip and the
bottom<00:00:26.369> lip<00:00:26.550> roughly

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.020 

then<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:32.029> properties

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 

I'll<00:00:36.690> erase<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.109> lines<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:37.920> don't<00:00:38.100> need

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I'll erase the lines and we don't need

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.549 
I'll erase the lines and we don't need
anymore<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.570> draw<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
anymore and then draw them out in a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.790 
anymore and then draw them out in a
little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:40.980> more<00:00:41.219> detail

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.770 

good<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.340> texture<00:00:49.820> line<00:00:50.060> will<00:00:50.330> be<00:00:50.450> on<00:00:50.540> this

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
good the texture line will be on this

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.840 
good the texture line will be on this
direction<00:00:51.500> following<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.220> shape<00:00:52.520> of<00:00:52.550> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
direction following the shape of the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.510 
direction following the shape of the
loops<00:00:55.930> now<00:00:56.930> let's<00:00:57.290> do<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.740> overall<00:00:58.100> shape<00:00:58.460> of

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
loops now let's do the overall shape of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.540 
loops now let's do the overall shape of
the<00:00:58.700> fella

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.420 

I<00:01:02.640> wanted<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.860> may<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.280> little

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
I wanted to go here it may be a little

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.770 
I wanted to go here it may be a little
bit<00:01:05.640> tickling<00:01:07.760> again<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:09.119> start<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
bit tickling again we start with the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.700 
bit tickling again we start with the
general<00:01:09.990> shape<00:01:12.020> now<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> red<00:01:13.680> marker

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
general shape now with a red marker

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:25.910 
general shape now with a red marker
let's<00:01:14.550> align<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.180> lips

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.400 

good<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.670> will<00:01:27.850> leave<00:01:28.060> some<00:01:28.330> reflections<00:01:29.050> here

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
good we will leave some reflections here

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:37.050 
good we will leave some reflections here
and<00:01:30.510> let's<00:01:31.510> fill<00:01:31.870> it<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:35.430> more<00:01:36.430> or<00:01:36.550> less<00:01:36.580> try<00:01:37.000> to

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
and let's fill it in more or less try to

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
and let's fill it in more or less try to
follow<00:01:37.360> their<00:01:37.690> shape

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.790 

now<00:01:42.250> with<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.610> white<00:01:42.700> pastel<00:01:43.360> we<00:01:44.170> will<00:01:44.380> do<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
now with a white pastel we will do the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.250 
now with a white pastel we will do the
feather<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.490> am<00:01:46.390> throwing<00:01:46.660> on<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.020> gray

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
feather I am throwing on a gray

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.220 
feather I am throwing on a gray
cardboard<00:01:47.740> paper<00:01:48.070> on<00:01:48.670> white<00:01:49.240> paper<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.960> white

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
cardboard paper on white paper the white

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.660 
cardboard paper on white paper the white
pastel<00:01:50.800> pudding<00:01:51.280> BC<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.740> should<00:01:53.980> get<00:01:54.130> some<00:01:54.400> red

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
pastel pudding BC we should get some red

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.180 
pastel pudding BC we should get some red
in<00:01:54.880> between<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.390> feather<00:01:57.450> good

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.580 

use<00:02:02.190> linear<00:02:02.670> strokes<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.930> would<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.260> thicker

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
use linear strokes they would be thicker

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.130 
use linear strokes they would be thicker
toward<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.340> center<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:09.360> reason<00:02:09.810> I'm<00:02:09.930> doing

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
toward the center the reason I'm doing

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
toward the center the reason I'm doing
this<00:02:10.260> drawing<00:02:10.760> aside<00:02:11.760> from<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> fact<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.360> I

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
this drawing aside from the fact that I

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.180 
this drawing aside from the fact that I
wanted<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.140> draw<00:02:13.410> ellipse<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.980> feather

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
wanted to draw ellipse and a feather

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.150 
wanted to draw ellipse and a feather
it's<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.810> want<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.140> show<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.620> how<00:02:17.100> to

it's because I want to show you how to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.220 
it's because I want to show you how to
draw<00:02:17.580> two<00:02:17.880> very<00:02:18.210> different<00:02:18.510> kinds<00:02:18.990> of

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
draw two very different kinds of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.370 
draw two very different kinds of
textures<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:21.330> feather<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.720> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.230> be

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380

let's<00:03:14.090> do<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.300> shade<00:03:14.750> with<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.080> light<00:03:15.440> gray

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
let's do a shade with the light gray

let's do a shade with the light gray
toward<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.520> center<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.980> lips<00:03:19.220> need<00:03:19.460> more

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
toward the center the lips need more

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.270 
toward the center the lips need more
volume<00:03:20.300> we<00:03:20.540> can<00:03:20.780> achieve<00:03:21.320> this<00:03:21.500> by<00:03:21.560> darkening

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
volume we can achieve this by darkening

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.350 
volume we can achieve this by darkening
some<00:03:22.520> areas<00:03:22.970> with<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.450> blue<00:03:23.630> pencil<00:03:25.360> notice

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
some areas with the blue pencil notice

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.510 
some areas with the blue pencil notice
that<00:03:26.540> there<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.930> reflected<00:03:27.650> light<00:03:27.920> toward

that there is a reflected light toward
the<00:03:28.700> bottom<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.240> them

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690

reflections on the lower lip too much so
I'll<00:03:47.670> cover<00:03:47.970> them<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.540> redo<00:03:49.170> them<00:03:50.180> for<00:03:51.180> the
