little jet well generating it start yeah
it<00:03:03.660> starts<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.050> vital<00:03:04.349> mode<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:05.209> place<00:03:06.209> was

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it starts a vital mode if you place was

it starts a vital mode if you place was
pretty<00:03:06.569> quickly<00:03:06.870> don't<00:03:07.410> take<00:03:07.530> long<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.709> load

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
pretty quickly don't take long to load

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.059 
pretty quickly don't take long to load

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.870 

because

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.890 

hey<00:03:22.420> Steve<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.820> can<00:03:24.910> go<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.120> view<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.720> can

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
hey Steve you can go to view you can

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.350 
hey Steve you can go to view you can
change<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.290> view<00:03:28.140> no<00:03:29.140> no<00:03:29.760> Barnard<00:03:30.760> atop<00:03:31.150> a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
change the view no no Barnard atop a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:44.760 
change the view no no Barnard atop a
little<00:03:31.690> dots<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.110> got<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.290> few<00:03:44.560> there

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
little dots on and you got a few there

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.180 
little dots on and you got a few there
volume<00:03:46.710> change<00:03:47.710> a<00:03:47.800> view<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:49.020> today<00:03:50.020> this<00:03:51.010> is

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
volume change a view but today this is

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.150 
volume change a view but today this is
survival<00:03:51.670> mode<00:03:51.820> so<00:03:52.000> it's<00:03:52.120> not<00:03:52.210> a<00:03:52.270> quite

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
survival mode so it's not a quite

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.770 
survival mode so it's not a quite
