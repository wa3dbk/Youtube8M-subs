00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.360 
rather than dig them from just outside
I'll<00:01:21.480> use<00:01:21.960> these<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.440> these<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.860> due<00:01:23.010> to<00:01:23.250> be

and<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.780> whole<00:01:27.900> process<00:01:28.350> starts<00:01:28.740> again<00:01:31.400> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and the whole process starts again it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.190 
and the whole process starts again it
really<00:01:32.730> is<00:01:32.850> easy<00:01:38.300> to<00:01:39.300> have<00:01:39.480> your<00:01:39.630> knife<00:01:39.810> sharp
