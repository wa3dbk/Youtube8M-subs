 employment and other types of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.930
 assessments including formal language 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 writing is essential for communication 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 for clear communication every day 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.300
 both write right but I go 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 stumbling on social networks I do not use 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.579
 the language of the internet have a fear of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.600
 The little that I know why I 'm 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.350
 talking about it is to listen on the radio the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.980
 the globe made a story about the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.600
 essays of the students who obtained the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.880
 basic spelling agreement 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.680
 finally points out faults in the evaluation of enem 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.240
 enrolling in Brazil is a problem of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.750
 for many years is to encourage reading and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.170
 writing everything gets very theoretical 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.080
 another fact also throughout life 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.640
 Who has never doubted a word 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.310
 write with ox or ch or had a 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.689
 you offer proof of an employee 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.290

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.950
 a friend but a pressure test 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.680
 psychological factors can influence 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.860
 some gafes when it comes to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.880
 writing with journalist 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.149
 the teacher who has not 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.670
 quiz 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.119
 they see us looking for words not 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.650
 everyday 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.590
 I think ' I will reaffirm that I am in favor 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.549

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.810
 I learn with the calves in no more 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.720
 committed 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.900

 I'm aware that I'm still far from 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.010
 due to lack of command of the language 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.459
 Portuguese I will not faint 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.230

 of a poor mortal 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.540

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.230

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.670
 learn with them our language is difficult 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:56.700
