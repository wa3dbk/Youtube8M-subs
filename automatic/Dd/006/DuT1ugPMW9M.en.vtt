00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.860
 I do not remember that from friends or in Russian 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.530
 reviews some had heard about the brand 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.200
 Oscar but abroad I will not praise them 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.370
 just take a lazy look at the headset 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.370
 astra a50 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.160
 Astra 50 there are 3 variations of the usual 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.539
 those will come out without 104 Yiddish 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.619
 we got auto 51 cherries and she can 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.619
 be celebrated 2 2 2 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.770
 the cover and the box is decorated in the style of the game 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.950
 throughout the logo on the butt mentioned 343 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.950
 studios mike 1 and the prison itself 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.670
 headset and receiver meet us right away 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.680
 among other things there is documentation 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.570
 many many wires and team 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.260
 not folding stand therefore 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.780
 choose a brand it is very nice design and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.700
 In principle, such a headset should be 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 every self-respecting spartan 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.300
 control sits on gives rise gorgeous 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.530
 partly yourself 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.520
 ear cushions and pillows on the headband parts of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.590
 the fact that you can freely adjust the length 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 headsets ear pads here tissue 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 so everything that happens around you you 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.729
 you'll be fine to do this what 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 plays around you also hear 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.540
 connects all this good to any 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 platform except to possess such 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.790
 desire is enough to connect yusb 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.280
 console already need optics and there is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.500
 no optical output keep off on 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 minijack 35 super nintendo though 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 connects the main possesses like this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:57.149
 here is perry brandy such is why you 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.750
 the situation is similar either through the same wire 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:06.540
 and connecting through 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:09.470
 component or company or connect 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.600
 here is such a cab usually cable to 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.420
 Jack is a gamepad 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.880
 the truth looks like it's pretty weird and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.610
 it turns out yes chained gamepad 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.160
 the receiver is not very convenient but such 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.370
 option is the microphone one is not directed 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.970
 unlike island 40 the microphone is not 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880
 taking off 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.800
 on the other side, why should you take it off 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.780
 earphone such is not particularly walking down the street and 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.090
 if you are comfortable with the receiver bag or in 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.040
 Pocket then he reached the microphone 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.950
 carefully 2 with it turns out some 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.770
 such external noise flows away in order not to 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.440
 disturb the interlocutor with the principle of quality 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.140
 it is quite controversial but to support 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.760
 connection with teammates enough by the way that you 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.820
 among summer residents it is quite simple 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.290
 raise now it is worth remembering that 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.120
 headset after all designed 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.330
 brought up boxing one has the ability 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.980
 connect to it 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.500
 microusb and plug into receiver 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.950
 and there was already beat free tailors 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.950
 slipped 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.230
 further connects the optical cable 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.240
 the receiver is connected to the input on ice box 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.940
 turns off in the port which is located 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.530
 slightly more to the right than expected output 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.530
 picture on the TV 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.430
 let 's do half the work now 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.040
 the headset will settle exclusively 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.769
 sound but don't take it that way 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.750
 microphone you can not use if 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.090
 do you need a microphone you'll need 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.870
 to steal the kit from the author 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.019
 2 and 5 4 left ear and the adapter itself 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.629
 inserted into the gamepad ready it is 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.299
 time to remember and about the sound and what I 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.250
 I wanted to emphasize that inside the headphones 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.579
 cost 40 millimeter speakers 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:07.109
 headphones have three sound profiles first 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:11.040
 this media is enhanced by bosses 2 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.319
 this core is aligned with frequency 3 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.739
 it's about him begins to dominate 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.549
 mid and high frequencies in games this 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.739
 really helps 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.620
 on the right bowl is and such 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.770
 volume priority rocker now 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:30.960
 will explain if you click on the back 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.949
 socket then you set priority for 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.840
 vote 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.750
 if you click on the front 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.669
 set the priority for the game so 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.770
 way you can make it louder 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.199
 or game depending on what you 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 not enough thing megapolezno and but not 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.199
 will work with bye if you have 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.340
 use the way I became 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.260
 before using yuzbi 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.349
 through will work exclusively 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.320
 channel weiss course day will be too 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.789
 work but apart from the sounds of serenity in 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.460
 this is unlikely to hear anything therefore 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.560
 exclude to maximum voice if you 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.229
 also need this feature and for now 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.479
 as well as all previously described functions 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.389
 since they do not work 4 stars 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.650
 you will have to connect all this through 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.690
 optical cable 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.909
 by the way there is also a slider 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.860
 volume recent listings on non 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.340
 the last value of the receiver is on it 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.070
 there is a button on the receiver and 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.849
 power button with round sound 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:30.720
 in addition, there is a usb port 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:33.030
 Optical ports are two pieces of their own therefore 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.710
 You can connect one more such 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.310
 headset for the reason that on 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.250
 I donâ€™t know these ports at the entrance and at the exit 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.190
 for some reason you need but fun 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.510
 there is also a port for micro usb and 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.100
 aux 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.630
 I mean Jack, arson exit 3-5 which I 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.270
 I'll tell you how to connect 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.400
 the console with a ruler headset turned out 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.870
 really worthy and shit can 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.090
 be connected to almost any 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.940
 the unit just do not forget it 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.560
 recharge every 6 to 8 hours in principle 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.510
 it can work in wired mode 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.580
 just remember to buy it like this 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.850
 cable length and since the set 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.730
 go cable per meter and half a meter 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.790
 I don't think that's enough for us 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.150
 at least sit next to north on this 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.350
 everything 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
 thank you for the annoying 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.430
 graffiti company samples 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.920
 they are exclusive distributor 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.760
 put the author's brand in Russia 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:33.200
 top subscribe and continue playing 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.200
 good bye
