00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
look a lot nicer gives us a much clearer

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.230 
look a lot nicer gives us a much clearer
sky<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.740> quick<00:01:31.979> word<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> note<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.970> added

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sky one quick word to note I have added

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
sky one quick word to note I have added
about<00:01:33.479> 10<00:01:33.750> percent<00:01:34.079> brightness<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> these

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
about 10 percent brightness to these

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
about 10 percent brightness to these
because<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.400> YouTube<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> tendency<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
because I know YouTube has a tendency to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.510 
because I know YouTube has a tendency to
darken<00:01:36.990> them<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.439> try<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> mod<00:01:38.369> for

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
darken them so try out the mod for

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
darken them so try out the mod for
yourself<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.060> exact<00:01:39.509> color<00:01:39.869> matching

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
yourself for exact color matching

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.710 
yourself for exact color matching
because<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.770> am<00:01:40.920> NOT<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.189> good<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
because I am NOT very good at that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.870 
because I am NOT very good at that
so<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.130> sky<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.579> lot

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so as we can see the sky is a lot

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600 
so as we can see the sky is a lot
brighter<00:01:45.240> things<00:01:45.899> are<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.380> looking<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.310> much

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
brighter things are just looking so much

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.330 
brighter things are just looking so much
better<00:01:47.670> than<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.270> were<00:01:48.299> before<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:49.340> really

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
better than they were before I really

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490 
better than they were before I really
enjoy<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.090> sky<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.509> nice<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.259> blue

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
enjoy the way the sky is nice and blue

certain mods here's an area here in

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.109 
certain mods here's an area here in
Springvale<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> shows<00:01:59.759> us<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Springvale which kind of shows us the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.319 
Springvale which kind of shows us the
same<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.600> back

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.080 
same up back
the<00:02:01.930> area<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.649> kind<00:02:02.979> of<00:02:03.009> looks<00:02:03.219> okay<00:02:03.729> but

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the area here kind of looks okay but

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.880 
the area here kind of looks okay but
then<00:02:04.570> when<00:02:04.689> you<00:02:04.780> compare<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.289> to<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.530> blue

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
then when you compare it to the blue

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.639 
then when you compare it to the blue
skies<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.850> DC<00:02:07.390> moods<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.929> sort<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.259> realize

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
skies of DC moods you sort of realize

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.919 
skies of DC moods you sort of realize
that<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.580> know<00:02:09.670> maybe<00:02:09.879> maybe<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.509> wasteland

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
that you know maybe maybe the wasteland

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.619 
that you know maybe maybe the wasteland
doesn't<00:02:11.290> look<00:02:11.440> quite<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:11.860> good<00:02:12.010> as<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.280> could

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
doesn't look quite as good as it could

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.180 
doesn't look quite as good as it could
the<00:02:13.629> sky<00:02:13.989> in<00:02:14.230> particular<00:02:14.709> looks<00:02:14.860> better<00:02:15.010> but

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
the sky in particular looks better but

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.979 
the sky in particular looks better but
also<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.610> ground<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.269> sort<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.510> brings<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.840> bit

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
also the ground it sort of brings a bit

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.440 
also the ground it sort of brings a bit
more<00:02:17.170> life<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> dead<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.640> mean<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.299> been

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
more life to the dead I mean it's been

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.869 
more life to the dead I mean it's been
200<00:02:19.660> years<00:02:20.200> since<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.530> bombs<00:02:20.739> dropped<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.549> it

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
200 years since the bombs dropped so it

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.940 
200 years since the bombs dropped so it
would<00:02:22.030> kind<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.540> make<00:02:22.690> sense<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.680> lot<00:02:23.920> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
would kind of make sense that a lot of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.080 
would kind of make sense that a lot of
that<00:02:24.129> green<00:02:24.599> radioactivity<00:02:25.599> would<00:02:26.140> disappear

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
that green radioactivity would disappear

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.670 
that green radioactivity would disappear
so<00:02:28.090> that's<00:02:28.720> what<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:28.900> mod<00:02:29.080> does<00:02:29.319> if<00:02:29.530> you're<00:02:29.620> a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
so that's what this mod does if you're a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.410 
so that's what this mod does if you're a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
shots but with DC moods installed we'll

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.089 
shots but with DC moods installed we'll
see<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.370> there's<00:02:45.549> sort<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:46.260> fog<00:02:47.260> existing

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099

here it makes the place look a bit more
mysterious<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.500> overcast<00:02:51.190> these<00:02:51.610> were<00:02:51.760> taken

at<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.239> exact<00:02:52.540> same<00:02:52.780> time<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.380> only

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
at the exact same time the only

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.350 
at the exact same time the only
difference<00:02:53.920> here<00:02:54.099> is<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.519> mod<00:02:54.700> installation

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
difference here is the mod installation

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.050 
difference here is the mod installation
and<00:02:55.840> once<00:02:56.650> we<00:02:56.799> get<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> full-screen

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
and once we get to a full-screen

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.509 
and once we get to a full-screen
screenshot<00:02:58.720> here<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.049> will<00:02:59.260> notice<00:02:59.680> just<00:03:00.310> how

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
screenshot here we will notice just how

screenshot here we will notice just how
cool<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.510> makes<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.900> look<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.590> makes<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.950> DC

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
cool this makes it look it makes the DC

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.460 
cool this makes it look it makes the DC
wasteland<00:03:03.910> look<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.180> bit<00:03:04.299> more<00:03:04.450> mysterious<00:03:04.690> and

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
wasteland look a bit more mysterious and

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.940 
wasteland look a bit more mysterious and
foreboding<00:03:06.220> kind<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.670> scary<00:03:07.209> really<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.530> am

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
foreboding kind of scary really and I am

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.039 
foreboding kind of scary really and I am
a<00:03:09.190> huge<00:03:09.790> fan<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.359> look<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.780> think<00:03:10.870> that

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
a huge fan of this look I think that

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.860 
a huge fan of this look I think that
this<00:03:11.290> really<00:03:12.010> shows<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.910> ruins<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
this really shows the ruins of the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.610 
this really shows the ruins of the
wasteland<00:03:14.940> finally<00:03:15.940> our<00:03:16.600> typical<00:03:16.840> night<00:03:17.260> shot

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
wasteland finally our typical night shot

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.379 
wasteland finally our typical night shot
in<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:18.069> location<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.579> I<00:03:18.730> generally<00:03:19.209> like<00:03:19.359> to

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
in a location that I generally like to

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.390 
in a location that I generally like to
choose<00:03:19.690> for<00:03:19.720> night<00:03:20.109> shots<00:03:20.440> just<00:03:20.799> because<00:03:21.100> of

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
choose for night shots just because of

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.509 
choose for night shots just because of
the<00:03:21.609> darkness<00:03:22.329> in<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.540> area<00:03:22.870> if<00:03:23.799> we<00:03:23.920> look<00:03:24.310> to

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
the darkness in the area if we look to

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.000 
the darkness in the area if we look to
the<00:03:24.670> right<00:03:24.790> we'll<00:03:25.269> see<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.870> not<00:03:26.170> only<00:03:26.200> does

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
the right we'll see that not only does

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.220 
the right we'll see that not only does
it<00:03:27.209> darken<00:03:28.209> things<00:03:28.420> but<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.780> also<00:03:28.900> makes

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
it darken things but it also makes

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.729 
it darken things but it also makes
things<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.560> bit<00:03:29.590> more<00:03:29.739> vibrant<00:03:31.260> lights<00:03:32.260> and

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
things a bit more vibrant lights and

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.890 
things a bit more vibrant lights and
fires<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.670> stuff<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.359> flashing<00:03:34.810> of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
fires and stuff like the flashing of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.509 
fires and stuff like the flashing of
that<00:03:35.019> vending<00:03:35.349> machine<00:03:35.680> look<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.190> bit<00:03:36.340> better

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
that vending machine look a bit better

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.050 
that vending machine look a bit better
and<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.780> sky<00:03:38.049> itself<00:03:38.440> has<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.769> deeper<00:03:39.370> darker

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
and the sky itself has a deeper darker

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.020 
and the sky itself has a deeper darker
blackness<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.950> makes<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.639> ton<00:03:43.000> of

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
blackness to it this makes a ton of

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.569 
blackness to it this makes a ton of
sense<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:43.720> night<00:03:44.380> doesn't<00:03:44.980> tend<00:03:45.370> to

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
sense because night doesn't tend to

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.400 
sense because night doesn't tend to
desaturate<00:03:46.060> things<00:03:46.569> as<00:03:46.780> much<00:03:46.959> as<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.230> game

these lights are in normal places it

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.979 
these lights are in normal places it
basically<00:04:07.269> just<00:04:07.450> makes<00:04:07.630> most<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.900> the

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
basically just makes most of the

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.960 
basically just makes most of the
streetlights<00:04:08.380> works<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:09.069> not<00:04:09.280> only<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.579> it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
streetlights works but not only that it

also<00:04:10.000> adds<00:04:10.449> FX<00:04:11.079> beams<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.859> lights<00:04:12.040> will

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
also adds FX beams so the lights will

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.809 
also adds FX beams so the lights will
flicker

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
flicker

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
the streetlights mod and it looks pretty

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.029

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
dark with DC moots installed and if we

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.379 
dark with DC moots installed and if we
get<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.190> little<00:04:51.310> closer<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:52.030> look<00:04:52.180> at<00:04:52.300> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
really improves the atmospherics of it I

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.469 
really improves the atmospherics of it I
