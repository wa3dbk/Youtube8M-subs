 You can see what we are talking about 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:37.230
 we see in the protected that includes us a 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 meshed cable 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.280

 configuration 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.150
 and well let's connect it so that 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.150

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.750
 the top and sides 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.370
 we see that it is an ambidextrous mouse that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.570
 we can use both the right hand 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.490
 as with the left as it has 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.229
 symmetrical format 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.610
 we see that it has a selector button 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.640
 country that we will see 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.280

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.040
 select the four country levels 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.640
 500 to 5000 finishes are in rubber 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.640
 ruber will improve our grip a lot 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.230
 and we see that his slip is very 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 soft thanks to the huge surfers that 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.750
