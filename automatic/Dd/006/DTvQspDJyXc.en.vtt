chemicals i'm going to be showing you

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150 
chemicals i'm going to be showing you
now<00:00:12.330> how<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.599> apply<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.170> nano<00:00:13.679> ceiling

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
now how to apply the nano ceiling

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.779 
now how to apply the nano ceiling
correctly<00:00:14.700> i<00:00:15.599> can't<00:00:16.139> stress<00:00:16.350> enough<00:00:16.560> how

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
correctly i can't stress enough how

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.730 
correctly i can't stress enough how
important<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.990> very<00:00:19.289> over

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
important it is to have a very very over

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.609 
important it is to have a very very over
clean<00:00:20.010> surface<00:00:21.380> because<00:00:22.380> basically

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
clean surface because basically

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.960 
clean surface because basically
everything<00:00:23.130> that's<00:00:23.310> inside<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> paint

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
everything that's inside of the paint

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.820 
everything that's inside of the paint
needs<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.300> come<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.539> before<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.260> nano<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.710> go

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
needs to come out before the nano can go

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
needs to come out before the nano can go
in<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.150> oils<00:00:27.570> waxes<00:00:28.260> things<00:00:28.500> like

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
in so if you have oils waxes things like

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.990 
in so if you have oils waxes things like
that<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.010> your<00:00:29.130> car<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> make<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that on your car it's going to make the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
that on your car it's going to make the
job<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> nano<00:00:30.689> sealant<00:00:31.080> much<00:00:31.230> harder<00:00:31.679> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
job of the nano sealant much harder to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.900 
job of the nano sealant much harder to
get<00:00:33.030> into<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> paint<00:00:33.890> also<00:00:34.890> another<00:00:35.760> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
get into the paint also another very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
get into the paint also another very

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
is not hazing from the Nano sealant this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.440 
is not hazing from the Nano sealant this
is<00:01:07.920> hazing<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> wax<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.030> oils<00:01:09.360> that

have been removed in the car so if you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520 
have been removed in the car so if you
see<00:01:11.729> hazing<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> surface<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
see hazing you know that the surface is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.640 
see hazing you know that the surface is
not<00:01:13.740> clean<00:01:14.509> because<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.840> basically<00:01:16.259> should

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
not clean because this basically should

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
not clean because this basically should
dry<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> an<00:01:17.310> almost<00:01:17.460> clear<00:01:17.970> film<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.900> really

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
dry to an almost clear film you really

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800 
dry to an almost clear film you really
shouldn't<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.799> able<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.220> anything<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.909> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
shouldn't be able to see anything I just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
shouldn't be able to see anything I just
put<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> few<00:01:22.049> drops<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
rubbing it in until it basically

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.190 
rubbing it in until it basically
disappears<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> have

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to force these other metal particles

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
to force these other metal particles
inside<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:37.409> paint<00:01:39.170> kind<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.229> well<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.590> really

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
inside the paint kind of well not really

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
inside the paint kind of well not really
force<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> help<00:01:41.850> them<00:01:42.060> get

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
force them just going to help them get

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:55.070 
force them just going to help them get
into<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> paint

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.050 

and<00:01:56.080> also<00:01:56.260> to<00:01:56.470> by<00:01:56.830> doing<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.220> like<00:01:57.400> this<00:01:57.430> you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
and also to by doing it like this you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.180 
and also to by doing it like this you
may<00:01:58.900> even<00:01:59.080> be<00:01:59.320> able<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.590> get<00:01:59.710> away<00:01:59.800> with<00:02:00.040> not

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
may even be able to get away with not

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.310 
may even be able to get away with not
doing<00:02:00.460> two<00:02:00.880> coats<00:02:01.180> but<00:02:01.450> i<00:02:01.540> always<00:02:01.690> suggest<00:02:01.990> a

doing two coats but i always suggest a
second<00:02:02.710> coat<00:02:02.830> just<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.190> make<00:02:03.369> sure<00:02:03.400> that<00:02:03.729> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
second coat just to make sure that that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.430 
second coat just to make sure that that
got<00:02:05.619> full<00:02:05.860> coverage<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:07.170> now<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.229> should

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
got full coverage on it now you should

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.010 
got full coverage on it now you should
let<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.709> dry<00:02:08.950> for<00:02:08.979> about<00:02:09.360> 10<00:02:10.360> minutes<00:02:10.539> 15

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
let that dry for about 10 minutes 15

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.020 
let that dry for about 10 minutes 15
minutes<00:02:11.160> you'll<00:02:12.160> see<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.550> when<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.730> draw<00:02:12.970> you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
minutes you'll see it when a draw you

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.340 
minutes you'll see it when a draw you
won't<00:02:13.270> be<00:02:13.390> able<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:13.959> this<00:02:14.080> color

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
won't be able to see it on this color

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.900 
won't be able to see it on this color
but<00:02:14.590> you'll<00:02:15.070> see<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.370> when<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.610> dries<00:02:15.880> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
but you'll see it when it dries it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.229 
but you'll see it when it dries it
really<00:02:16.870> dries<00:02:17.170> almost<00:02:17.350> completely<00:02:18.220> clear<00:02:18.550> you

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
really dries almost completely clear you

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.640 
really dries almost completely clear you
won't<00:02:19.420> be<00:02:19.540> able<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> see<00:02:19.930> much<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.500> but

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
won't be able to see much of it but

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.530 
won't be able to see much of it but
again<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.430> see<00:02:21.640> hazing<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.090> know<00:02:22.300> that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
again if you see hazing you know that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.020 
again if you see hazing you know that
the<00:02:22.870> surface<00:02:23.290> wasn't<00:02:23.620> clean<00:02:23.830> now<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.880> for

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the surface wasn't clean now just for

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.640 
the surface wasn't clean now just for
demonstration<00:02:25.209> purposes<00:02:26.140> I'm<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:26.500> going<00:02:26.620> to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
demonstration purposes I'm just going to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.430 
demonstration purposes I'm just going to
go<00:02:26.709> ahead<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.209> clean<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.239> off<00:02:31.290> comes<00:02:32.290> off

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
go ahead and clean this off comes off

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:41.270 
go ahead and clean this off comes off
very<00:02:32.650> easily

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.370 

now<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.270> you've<00:02:42.480> applied<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.990> sealant

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
now if you've applied the sealant

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.410 
now if you've applied the sealant
correctly<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:45.660> should<00:02:45.690> be<00:02:45.990> getting<00:02:46.110> beating

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
correctly you should be getting beating

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.330 
correctly you should be getting beating
like<00:02:48.420> this

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.770 

very<00:02:56.060> tall

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:16.940 

strong<00:02:59.500> beating

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.770 

and<00:03:17.580> basically<00:03:17.819> if<00:03:18.209> you're<00:03:18.330> not<00:03:18.450> getting

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
and basically if you're not getting

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
and basically if you're not getting
beating<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.290> well<00:03:19.739> then<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.250> know

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
beating like that well then you know

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
beating like that well then you know
that<00:03:20.400> one<00:03:21.269> or<00:03:21.360> two<00:03:21.510> things<00:03:21.720> either<00:03:22.050> the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
that one or two things either the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.880 
that one or two things either the
surface<00:03:22.830> wasn't<00:03:23.160> queen<00:03:24.019> or<00:03:25.019> your<00:03:25.440> applicator

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
surface wasn't queen or your applicator

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.949 
surface wasn't queen or your applicator
wasn't<00:03:26.310> clean<00:03:26.519> again<00:03:27.000> I'm<00:03:27.510> going<00:03:27.629> to<00:03:27.720> stress

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
wasn't clean again I'm going to stress

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.140 
wasn't clean again I'm going to stress
again<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.760> importance<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.849> a<00:03:29.940> clean

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
again the importance of a clean

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.080 
again the importance of a clean
applicator<00:03:30.629> clean<00:03:31.140> surface<00:03:31.910> most<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
applicator clean surface most of the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.160 
applicator clean surface most of the
time<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.450> do<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:34.680> wash<00:03:35.519> with<00:03:36.390> an<00:03:36.540> APC<00:03:37.019> or

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
time you can do a wash with an APC or

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.540 
time you can do a wash with an APC or
something<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.890> sprayed<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
something like that just sprayed on the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.240 
something like that just sprayed on the
car<00:03:38.760> before<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.209> wash<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.599> car<00:03:39.980> let<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.069> sit

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
car before you wash the car let it sit

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.009 
car before you wash the car let it sit
there<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.640> minute<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.910> then<00:03:42.000> wash<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.330> APC

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
there for a minute and then wash the APC

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.930 
there for a minute and then wash the APC
and<00:03:43.049> if<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.680> spray<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.010> APC<00:03:44.489> on<00:03:44.640> there

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and if you just spray the APC on there

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.670 
and if you just spray the APC on there
and<00:03:45.150> then<00:03:45.209> spray<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.870> off<00:03:46.049> with<00:03:46.260> water<00:03:46.440> it's

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
and then spray it off with water it's

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.869 
and then spray it off with water it's
really<00:03:46.920> not<00:03:47.040> doing<00:03:47.220> anything<00:03:47.580> because

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
really not doing anything because

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.380 
really not doing anything because
basically<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.780> cut<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:50.120> then<00:03:51.120> later

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
basically you have to cut it then later

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.300 
basically you have to cut it then later
before<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.110> apply<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> sealant<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:53.040> always

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
before you apply the sealant it's always

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.839 
before you apply the sealant it's always
best<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.640> do<00:03:53.790> an<00:03:53.910> IPA<00:03:54.269> wipe<00:03:54.980> but<00:03:55.980> actually<00:03:56.459> the

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
best to do an IPA wipe but actually the

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.330 
best to do an IPA wipe but actually the
very<00:03:57.390> most<00:03:57.750> effective<00:03:58.230> thing<00:03:58.440> would<00:03:58.860> be<00:03:59.040> to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
very most effective thing would be to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.280 
very most effective thing would be to
use<00:03:59.489> our<00:03:59.730> shine<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.299> seal<00:04:00.480> its<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.840> pre<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.079> so

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
use our shine and seal its the pre it so

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.220 
use our shine and seal its the pre it so
it's<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> pre<00:04:01.920> nano<00:04:02.130> polish<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:03.060> has<00:04:03.690> micro

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
it's like a pre nano polish it has micro

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.289 
it's like a pre nano polish it has micro
braces<00:04:04.680> inside<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.489> clean<00:04:06.180> this

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
braces inside of it that clean this

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.530 
braces inside of it that clean this
clean<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.989> pores<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.440> paint<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:09.030> anyways

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
clean the pores of the paint so anyways

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.500 
clean the pores of the paint so anyways
that's<00:04:10.260> it
