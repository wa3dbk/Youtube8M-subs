00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and then while I sort of designing and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.580 
and then while I sort of designing and
writing<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> story<00:03:06.359> they<00:03:07.049> thought<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.560> know

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
writing the story they thought you know

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.520 
writing the story they thought you know
the<00:03:07.769> story<00:03:08.040> was<00:03:08.160> too<00:03:08.370> big<00:03:08.780> for<00:03:09.780> three<00:03:10.290> years

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the story was too big for three years

game<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.890> order<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.190> make<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.340> full<00:03:11.579> game<00:03:11.849> place

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
game in order to make a full game place

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.759 
game in order to make a full game place
to<00:03:12.599> be<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.989> more<00:03:13.049> money<00:03:13.260> from<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.590> and

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
to be one of the more money from it and

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.089 
to be one of the more money from it and
then<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.840> that's<00:03:15.959> why<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.260> become<00:03:16.680> full<00:03:16.890> game

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
then so that's why it's become full game

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.680 
then so that's why it's become full game
and<00:03:17.340> I'm<00:03:17.459> quite<00:03:17.639> disappointed<00:03:17.849> because<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.510> I

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
Assassin's Creed encyclopedia so I think

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.789 
Assassin's Creed encyclopedia so I think
it'd<00:04:02.549> be<00:04:02.700> very<00:04:02.910> useful<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.569> add<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:04.169> free<00:04:04.590> world

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
see because this is nevertheless is then

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.649 
see because this is nevertheless is then
it's<00:04:46.139> natural<00:04:47.000> if<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.240> find<00:04:48.449> out<00:04:48.569> this

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
it's natural if you find out this

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.360 
it's natural if you find out this
multi-platform<00:04:50.990> they're<00:04:51.990> all<00:04:52.349> float<00:04:53.099> you

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
multi-platform they're all float you

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.519 
multi-platform they're all float you
know<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.759> is<00:04:53.789> certainly<00:04:54.270> none<00:04:54.569> so<00:04:55.409> you're

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:55.529 
know this is certainly none so you're

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.709 
know this is certainly none so you're
not<00:04:55.590> really<00:04:55.650> excited<00:04:56.189> about<00:04:56.279> I<00:04:56.669> mean<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:59.719> but

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
not really excited about I mean and but

you know I think it's quite good if what
I<00:05:02.340> debated<00:05:02.669> this<00:05:02.879> time<00:05:03.090> because<00:05:03.300> this<00:05:03.689> is<00:05:03.840> much

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
I debated this time because this is much

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.830 
I debated this time because this is much
idea<00:05:04.379> tough<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.830> chance<00:05:05.219> beta<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:06.419> game<00:05:06.629> is

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
idea tough and chance beta the game is
