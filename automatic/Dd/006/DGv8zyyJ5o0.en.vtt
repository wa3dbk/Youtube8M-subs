00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
pushing six thousand pounds so not only

pushing six thousand pounds so not only
does<00:02:34.849> that<00:02:35.030> add<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.420> agility<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> car

does that add to the agility of the car

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.380 
does that add to the agility of the car
but<00:02:36.769> it's<00:02:36.920> actually<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> fuel<00:02:37.670> savings<00:02:38.150> measure

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
but it's actually a fuel savings measure

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.910 
but it's actually a fuel savings measure
because<00:02:38.629> obviously<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.379> less<00:02:39.560> weight<00:02:39.769> you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
because obviously the less weight you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.710

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
come in right under 30,000 that's our

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.000 
come in right under 30,000 that's our
best<00:03:49.879> guess<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:50.690> that's<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.019> both<00:03:51.200> both<00:03:51.830> are

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
best guess so that's it both both are

to<00:04:04.010> look<00:04:04.099> even<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.430> little<00:04:04.579> bit<00:04:04.760> more<00:04:04.940> simpler

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
to look even a little bit more simpler

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.000 
to look even a little bit more simpler
