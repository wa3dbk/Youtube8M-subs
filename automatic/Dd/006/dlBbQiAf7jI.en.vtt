is<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.539> bit<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.899> roadblock

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
is there a little bit of a roadblock

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
is there a little bit of a roadblock
there<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.250> from<00:00:56.579> college

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
there because going from college

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.779 
there because going from college
football<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.780> pro<00:00:58.050> football<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.920> almost<00:00:59.370> if

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
football to pro football is almost if

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
football to pro football is almost if
you<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> talent<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> natural<00:01:01.020> flow

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
you have the talent it's a natural flow

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.380 
you have the talent it's a natural flow
it's<00:01:02.039> what's<00:01:02.280> expected<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it's what's expected it's what the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
it's what's expected it's what the
individual<00:01:03.899> most<00:01:04.290> likely<00:01:04.619> has<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.189> goal

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
individual most likely has is this goal

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
individual most likely has is this goal
from<00:01:05.700> day<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.960> wrestling<00:01:07.170> there's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
from day one in wrestling there's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.660 
from day one in wrestling there's
there's<00:01:08.369> quite<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> difference

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
there's quite a difference

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.030 
there's quite a difference
and<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:11.479> it's<00:01:11.659> not<00:01:11.810> as<00:01:12.080> standard<00:01:12.590> for<00:01:12.770> somebody

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
and so it's not as standard for somebody

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.530 
and so it's not as standard for somebody
to<00:01:13.100> move<00:01:13.340> out<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.670> college<00:01:14.000> ranks<00:01:14.030> and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
to move out of the college ranks and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.149 
to move out of the college ranks and
want<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:14.960> get<00:01:15.140> into<00:01:15.290> pro<00:01:15.500> wrestling<00:01:15.530> it's<00:01:16.009> been

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
want to get into pro wrestling it's been

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.749 
want to get into pro wrestling it's been
done<00:01:16.450> but<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.840> would<00:01:18.799> think<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.130> situation<00:01:19.729> is

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
done but I would think the situation is

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.190 
done but I would think the situation is
a<00:01:19.880> little<00:01:20.149> bit<00:01:20.420> different<00:01:20.750> because<00:01:20.810> they<00:01:21.080> have

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
a little bit different because they have

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.010 
a little bit different because they have
to<00:01:21.320> bargain<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:21.740> more<00:01:22.130> than<00:01:22.780> matter<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.840> fact

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
to bargain for more than matter of fact

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.410 
to bargain for more than matter of fact
all<00:01:24.170> those<00:01:24.320> holds<00:01:25.040> that<00:01:25.220> may<00:01:26.119> have<00:01:26.210> gotten

all those holds that may have gotten

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.810 
all those holds that may have gotten
them<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.659> collegiate<00:01:27.170> championship<00:01:27.670> you<00:01:28.670> do
