all<00:00:00.539> right<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:00.719> got<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.190> 2002<00:00:02.190> Dodge<00:00:02.959> Caravan<00:00:05.000> the

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
all right I got a 2002 Dodge Caravan the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.999 
all right I got a 2002 Dodge Caravan the
battery<00:00:07.980> died<00:00:08.250> on<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:12.139> they<00:00:13.139> load<00:00:13.469> tested

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
battery died on it and they load tested

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.620 
battery died on it and they load tested
the<00:00:14.099> battery<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.639> check<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.059> see<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.509> was

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the battery to check and see if it was

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.779 
the battery to check and see if it was
bad<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> process<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> doing<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.250> we

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
bad and in the process of doing so we

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.450 
bad and in the process of doing so we
think<00:00:18.090> that's<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:18.510> caused<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
think that's what caused it to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.960 
think that's what caused it to
completely<00:00:20.460> fried<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> computer<00:00:22.730> watch<00:00:23.730> what

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
completely fried a computer watch what

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.260 
completely fried a computer watch what
happens<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.600> try<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.810> start<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:32.120> see<00:00:33.120> all

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
happens when we try to start it see all

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.500 
happens when we try to start it see all
the<00:00:33.469> dash<00:00:34.469> lights<00:00:34.739> come<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.130> nothing<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.820> bunch

the dash lights come on nothing a bunch

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.119 
the dash lights come on nothing a bunch
of<00:00:36.660> beeping<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> hollering<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.739> carrying<00:00:38.070> on

noises things running and aren't close
to<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> we're<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.129> disconnect<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
to be so we're going to disconnect the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.709 
to be so we're going to disconnect the
battery<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.120> reset<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.239> I'm

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
battery so we can reset this and I'm

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.910 
battery so we can reset this and I'm
going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.870> show<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> little<00:00:58.410> trick<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.680> I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
going to show you a little trick that I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.490 
going to show you a little trick that I
discovered<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.079> process<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
discovered in the process of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.649 
discovered in the process of
troubleshooting<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:03.530> I've<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.479> just<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
troubleshooting this I've got a just a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.580 
troubleshooting this I've got a just a
generic<00:01:06.900> run-of-the-mill<00:01:09.020> code<00:01:10.020> reader<00:01:12.590> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
generic run-of-the-mill code reader that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.120 
generic run-of-the-mill code reader that
I<00:01:13.770> use<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.430> scanning<00:01:15.180> codes<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.890> plug

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
I use for scanning codes and when I plug

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.109 
I use for scanning codes and when I plug
this<00:01:17.369> thing<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:19.700> on<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.340> turn<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> key

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
this thing in on to it and turn the key

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.160 
this thing in on to it and turn the key
on<00:01:24.920> scan<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> codes<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:28.860> course<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:30.720> doesn't

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
on scan the codes of course it doesn't

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.700 
on scan the codes of course it doesn't
do<00:01:31.320> anything<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:32.869> says<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.079> reading<00:01:34.409> codes

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
do anything it says it's reading codes

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.489 
do anything it says it's reading codes
and<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.070> says<00:01:35.340> no<00:01:35.520> codes<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
and it says no codes because the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.099 
and it says no codes because the
Computers<00:01:40.499> been<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.979> unplug<00:01:41.929> but<00:01:42.929> what<00:01:43.079> I

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
Computers been just unplug but what I

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.160 
Computers been just unplug but what I
did<00:01:43.409> discover<00:01:43.859> was<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> turn<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
did discover was I was going to turn the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.819 
did discover was I was going to turn the
key<00:01:46.319> on<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.069> I<00:01:47.219> could<00:01:47.460> make<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
key on and see if I could make it

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.389 
key on and see if I could make it
throw<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> code<00:01:51.500> wrong<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.679> process<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> doing

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
throw a code wrong the process of doing

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.609 
throw a code wrong the process of doing
that<00:01:54.109> the<00:01:55.109> engine<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.560> turn<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:58.459> so<00:02:00.619> -

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that the engine would turn over so -

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.289 
that the engine would turn over so -
rather<00:02:01.829> slick<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.579> deal<00:02:05.090> because<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
rather slick little deal because the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.600 
rather slick little deal because the
engine<00:02:06.599> will<00:02:06.810> start<00:02:07.109> and<00:02:07.289> run<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:11.250> one's<00:02:11.459> got

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
engine will start and run this one's got

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.100 
engine will start and run this one's got
a<00:02:11.640> little<00:02:11.790> noise<00:02:12.090> when<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.420> first<00:02:12.629> starts<00:02:12.959> up

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
a little noise when it first starts up

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.050 
a little noise when it first starts up
because<00:02:13.379> it's<00:02:13.700> little<00:02:14.700> cold<00:02:14.910> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
because it's little cold and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.259 
because it's little cold and
cantankerous<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.959> as<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.349> see<00:02:17.269> it's

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
cantankerous but as you can see it's

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.400 
cantankerous but as you can see it's
running<00:02:19.879> going<00:02:21.709> my<00:02:22.709> theory<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.900> sets

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
running going my theory is that it sets

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.619 
running going my theory is that it sets
the<00:02:25.620> program<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.459> computer<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.150> default

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
the program in the computer to default

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.869 
the program in the computer to default
mode<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.579> so<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:30.269> will<00:02:30.569> run<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.049> default

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
mode and so it will run on that default

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.080 
mode and so it will run on that default
if<00:02:32.879> we<00:02:33.120> unplug<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:35.519> shuts<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.940> down

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.509 

see<00:02:39.109> turns<00:02:40.109> it<00:02:40.260> completely<00:02:40.680> off<00:02:40.829> and<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.370> goes

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
see turns it completely off and it goes

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.879 
see turns it completely off and it goes
back<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.970> its<00:02:42.109> oath<00:02:43.109> habits<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.940> other<00:02:45.090> thing

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
back to its oath habits the other thing

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.650 
back to its oath habits the other thing
see<00:02:46.889> I've<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.010> no<00:02:47.280> doors<00:02:47.549> no<00:02:47.849> door<00:02:48.389> locks

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
see I've got no doors no door locks

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.000 
see I've got no doors no door locks
nothing<00:02:49.590> works

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
nothing works

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.470 
nothing works
watch<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:51.389> plug<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.780> back<00:02:52.019> in<00:02:56.329> we<00:02:57.329> also

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
watch this we plug this back in we also

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.390 
watch this we plug this back in we also
have<00:02:57.840> doors<00:02:58.079> at<00:02:58.349> windows<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:58.950> work<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:01.400> just

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
have doors at windows that work so just

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.520 
have doors at windows that work so just
for<00:03:02.579> future<00:03:02.819> information<00:03:03.630> for<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:03.959> guys<00:03:04.200> that
