okay if you remember for I was talking
about<00:00:10.580> this<00:00:11.580> pattern<00:00:12.030> possibly<00:00:12.510> having<00:00:12.690> too

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
about this pattern possibly having too

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.140 
about this pattern possibly having too
much<00:00:13.260> ground<00:00:14.129> color<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> any

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
much ground color and that any

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.630 
much ground color and that any
background<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.690> put<00:00:15.870> behind<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.439> is<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:17.460> going

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
background I put behind it is just going

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.260 
background I put behind it is just going
to<00:00:17.960> pop<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.290> it's<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.099> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.270> too

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
to pop or it's just going to be too

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.279 
to pop or it's just going to be too
let's<00:00:22.200> show<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.949> quickly<00:00:23.810> it<00:00:24.810> just

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
let's show you very quickly it just

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.810 
let's show you very quickly it just
stands<00:00:25.529> out<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:26.010> too<00:00:26.039> much<00:00:26.400> matter<00:00:26.670> what

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
stands out way too much matter what

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.609 
stands out way too much matter what
color<00:00:27.029> effort<00:00:27.300> behind<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.900> always<00:00:28.380> going

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
color effort behind it is always going

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.119 
color effort behind it is always going
to<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:29.779> almost<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.260> floating<00:00:31.500> too<00:00:31.920> much

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
to be almost like it's floating too much

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.970 
to be almost like it's floating too much
so<00:00:32.519> what<00:00:32.759> I'm<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.600> i<00:00:34.170> printed

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
so what I'm going to do is I i printed

so what I'm going to do is I i printed
this<00:00:35.160> page<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.879> on<00:00:36.269> my<00:00:36.480> printer<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.110> an<00:00:37.230> a4

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
this page out on my printer on an a4

this page out on my printer on an a4
page<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.370> something<00:00:38.640> small<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:40.140> got<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
pen and paper and literally started to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.290 
pen and paper and literally started to
work<00:00:43.350> back<00:00:43.620> into<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.670> example<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.120> we

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
work back into it so for example here we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
work back into it so for example here we
go<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.690> print<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.530> crap<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.950> moment<00:00:47.280> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
go I print a bit crap at the moment so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.510 
go I print a bit crap at the moment so
forgive<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.750> I<00:00:48.770> see<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.340> good

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
forgive me I see here it's not very good

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.069 
forgive me I see here it's not very good

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
print and I've done this basic got a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.430 
print and I've done this basic got a
pencil<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> draw<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:54.230> parts<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
pencil and just like to draw in parts I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200 
pencil and just like to draw in parts I
like<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> cover<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> background

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
like to kind of cover up the background

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
like to kind of cover up the background
so<00:00:57.329> we've<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.780> more<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:59.510> less<00:01:00.510> space

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so we've got a bit more of a less space

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.450 
so we've got a bit more of a less space
in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> background<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.340> for

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
in the background I'm just on this for

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.729 
in the background I'm just on this for
the<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.329> pencil<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.289> i'm<00:01:04.410> going<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the just a pencil and now i'm going to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.999 
the just a pencil and now i'm going to
use<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> template<00:01:06.440> by<00:01:07.440> going<00:01:07.710> back

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
use this as a template by going back

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.190 
use this as a template by going back
into<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> printed<00:01:09.420> off<00:01:09.539> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.840> here

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
into the one I printed off which is here

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.010 
into the one I printed off which is here
and<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.849> this<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.119> has<00:01:12.149> all<00:01:12.539> of<00:01:12.840> my

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and because this one has all of my

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.930 
and because this one has all of my
layers<00:01:13.709> now<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.429> doesn't<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:16.160> dear<00:01:17.160> okay<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> have

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
layers now it doesn't I dear okay I have

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.160 
layers now it doesn't I dear okay I have
to<00:01:17.970> find<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.509> has<00:01:18.660> layers<00:01:18.869> because

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to find one which has layers because

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
to find one which has layers because
what<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.649> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.160> is<00:01:20.399> basically<00:01:21.300> take

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
what I'm going to do is basically take

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.839 
what I'm going to do is basically take
these<00:01:21.990> leaves<00:01:22.349> and<00:01:22.770> position<00:01:23.340> them<00:01:23.490> where

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:23.849 
these leaves and position them where

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.460 
these leaves and position them where
these<00:01:24.000> ones<00:01:24.240> should<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.599> and<00:01:24.780> rotate<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
these ones should be and rotate and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.109 
these ones should be and rotate and
transform<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.160> to<00:01:26.340> make<00:01:26.520> sure<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.970> my

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
transform them to make sure that my

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.380 
transform them to make sure that my
print<00:01:27.420> will<00:01:27.569> end<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.929> looking<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
print will end up looking like this in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.960 
print will end up looking like this in
other<00:01:30.690> words<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.200> layout<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.220> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
other words this layout just here so

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.430 

okay<00:01:39.680> here<00:01:39.830> we<00:01:39.890> go<00:01:39.920> as<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.460> can<00:01:40.550> see<00:01:41.410> we<00:01:42.410> have

okay here we go as you can see we have

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.140 
okay here we go as you can see we have
this<00:01:42.950> print<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.490> let's<00:01:43.730> get<00:01:43.910> into<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
this print here let's get into the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.300 
this print here let's get into the
layers<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:45.440> move<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.680> over<00:01:45.770> here<00:01:46.010> for<00:01:46.190> you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
layers to move this over here for you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.150 
layers to move this over here for you
okay<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:47.720> have<00:01:47.930> our<00:01:48.140> original<00:01:48.710> print<00:01:48.950> which

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
okay so we have our original print which

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.750 
okay so we have our original print which
is<00:01:49.400> all<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:50.000> layer<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.510> we<00:01:51.080> have<00:01:51.290> our<00:01:51.830> scanned

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
is all one layer and we have our scanned

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.790 
is all one layer and we have our scanned
in<00:01:52.940> image<00:01:53.240> with<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.630> new<00:01:54.080> aspects<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.650> want

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
in image with the new aspects you want

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.690 
in image with the new aspects you want
to<00:01:54.890> add<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.930> then<00:01:56.930> over<00:01:57.170> here<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.700> have

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
to add to it and then over here we have

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.900 
to add to it and then over here we have
our<00:01:59.830> document<00:02:00.830> where<00:02:00.980> all<00:02:01.190> of<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.430> layers<00:02:01.610> are

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
our document where all of the layers are

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.240 
our document where all of the layers are
visible<00:02:02.270> or<00:02:02.450> they're<00:02:02.750> all<00:02:02.870> unlocked<00:02:03.410> so<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:04.040> can

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
visible or they're all unlocked so I can

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.890 
visible or they're all unlocked so I can
just<00:02:04.430> go<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.790> layer<00:02:05.000> move<00:02:05.510> this<00:02:05.660> leaf

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
just go to this layer move this leaf

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.889 
just go to this layer move this leaf
around<00:02:06.290> or<00:02:07.010> take<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.060> move<00:02:08.750> this

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
around or take this one and move this

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.190 
around or take this one and move this
one<00:02:09.110> around<00:02:09.759> okay<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.910> one's<00:02:11.090> linked<00:02:11.450> but

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
one around okay this one's linked but

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.600 
one around okay this one's linked but
that's<00:02:12.350> fine<00:02:12.530> because<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.860> can<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.190> unlink

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
that's fine because I can just unlink

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.260 
that's fine because I can just unlink
them<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.970> then<00:02:14.959> now<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:16.490> can<00:02:16.640> see<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:16.850> can<00:02:16.940> move

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
them and then now you can see I can move

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.580 
them and then now you can see I can move
the<00:02:17.420> leaves<00:02:17.630> around<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.200> i'm<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.470> start

dragging and dropping these into here
and<00:02:20.480> start<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.870> move<00:02:21.110> these<00:02:21.290> around

i can download probably from the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.719 
i can download probably from the
internet<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.830> i<00:04:26.919> can<00:04:27.070> use<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.430> put<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.699> here

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
internet that i can use to put in here

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.670 
internet that i can use to put in here
and<00:04:28.150> also<00:04:28.720> i<00:04:28.870> need<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.199> get<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:29.440> into

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
and also i need to get this into

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.740 
and also i need to get this into
illustrator<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.340> i<00:04:30.400> can<00:04:30.550> try<00:04:30.760> start<00:04:31.449> doing

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
illustrator so i can try start doing

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.010 
illustrator so i can try start doing
some<00:04:32.010> some<00:04:33.010> very<00:04:33.400> smooth<00:04:33.820> vector<00:04:34.389> lines<00:04:34.660> here

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
some some very smooth vector lines here

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.730 
some some very smooth vector lines here
and<00:04:35.229> then<00:04:35.830> hopefully<00:04:36.190> turn<00:04:36.940> them<00:04:37.150> into<00:04:37.740> this

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
and then hopefully turn them into this

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.939 
and then hopefully turn them into this
kind<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.100> worn<00:04:39.430> jaggedy<00:04:40.090> kind<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.360> edge<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.860> i'm

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
kind of worn jaggedy kind of edge so i'm

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.050 
kind of worn jaggedy kind of edge so i'm
going<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.100> do<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.280> now<00:04:42.460> so<00:04:42.760> I'm<00:04:42.820> just<00:04:42.940> going

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
going to do that now so I'm just going

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.939 
going to do that now so I'm just going
to<00:04:43.120> save<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:47.729> obviously<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.789> big<00:04:48.880> file<00:04:49.949> that's

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
to save this obviously a big file that's

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.110 
to save this obviously a big file that's
a<00:04:51.039> problem<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.370> this<00:04:51.430> kind<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.669> stuff<00:04:51.880> if

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
a problem of this kind of stuff if

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.510 
a problem of this kind of stuff if
you're<00:04:52.680> good<00:04:53.680> ink<00:04:53.830> prints<00:04:54.160> you've<00:04:54.310> got<00:04:54.430> to

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
you're good ink prints you've got to

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.650 
you're good ink prints you've got to
have<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.639> reasonable<00:04:55.090> amount<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.330> power<00:04:55.510> behind

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
have a reasonable amount of power behind

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.300 
have a reasonable amount of power behind
you<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.169> confuse<00:04:56.530> not<00:04:56.680> amazing<00:04:57.100> but<00:04:57.130> it

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
you this confuse not amazing but it

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.010 
you this confuse not amazing but it
can't<00:04:57.699> cope<00:04:57.880> a<00:04:58.000> little<00:04:58.210> bit<00:04:58.330> because<00:04:58.810> this

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
can't cope a little bit because this

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.760 
can't cope a little bit because this
print<00:04:59.229> is<00:04:59.320> 196<00:05:00.160> megabytes<00:05:00.639> but<00:05:01.360> potential<00:05:02.139> 503

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
print is 196 megabytes but potential 503

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.070 
print is 196 megabytes but potential 503
so<00:05:03.130> it's<00:05:03.849> not<00:05:03.970> massive<00:05:04.120> but<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:04.720> know<00:05:04.870> it's

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
so it's not massive but you know it's

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.350 
so it's not massive but you know it's
pretty<00:05:05.229> big<00:05:05.470> so<00:05:06.310> I'm<00:05:06.789> then<00:05:07.090> going<00:05:07.270> to

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
pretty big so I'm then going to

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.770 
pretty big so I'm then going to
basically<00:05:07.720> is<00:05:08.590> this<00:05:08.830> this<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.599> adding<00:05:10.599> leaves

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
basically is this this is adding leaves

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.529 
basically is this this is adding leaves
one<00:05:11.050> ok<00:05:11.470> I'm<00:05:11.560> going<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.740> close<00:05:11.860> this<00:05:11.919> down

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
bring into illustrator first of all to

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:26.800 
bring into illustrator first of all to
add<00:05:19.690> these<00:05:19.930> vector<00:05:20.530> lines

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.850 

okay<00:05:27.650> here<00:05:27.889> we<00:05:27.919> go<00:05:29.200> so<00:05:30.200> just<00:05:30.470> close<00:05:30.620> us<00:05:30.830> down

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
okay here we go so just close us down

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:42.080 
okay here we go so just close us down
let's<00:05:31.400> open<00:05:31.910> up

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.200 

okay<00:05:42.960> so<00:05:43.020> here's<00:05:43.380> any<00:05:43.530> leaves<00:05:43.800> one<00:05:47.000> will<00:05:48.000> just

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
okay so here's any leaves one will just

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.420 
okay so here's any leaves one will just
flatten<00:05:48.780> all<00:05:48.840> this

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.740 

because<00:05:53.030> we're<00:05:53.120> going<00:05:53.210> to<00:05:53.330> use<00:05:53.480> it<00:05:53.600> as<00:05:53.720> a

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
because we're going to use it as a

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.340 
because we're going to use it as a
template<00:05:54.290> to<00:05:54.650> create<00:05:55.160> these<00:05:55.580> vector<00:05:56.120> lines<00:05:56.360> so

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
template to create these vector lines so

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.840 
template to create these vector lines so
here<00:05:57.530> we<00:05:57.590> go<00:05:57.650> we're<00:05:57.950> going<00:05:58.100> to<00:05:58.190> take<00:05:58.310> off<00:05:58.520> the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
here we go we're going to take off the
