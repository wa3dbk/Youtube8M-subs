00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.150 

common<00:00:02.550> problem<00:00:02.970> on<00:00:03.060> these<00:00:03.300> engines<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:04.350> they

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
common problem on these engines is they

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.310 
common problem on these engines is they
have<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.750> steel<00:00:06.750> intake<00:00:07.200> pan<00:00:07.529> with<00:00:07.980> aluminum

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
have this steel intake pan with aluminum

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.339 
have this steel intake pan with aluminum
intake<00:00:10.670> and<00:00:11.670> I've<00:00:11.820> heard<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.599> cited<00:00:13.080> does<00:00:13.230> it

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
intake and I've heard that cited does it

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.169 
intake and I've heard that cited does it
cause<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.769> also<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.309> these<00:00:14.460> bolts<00:00:14.910> are<00:00:15.000> too

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
cause and also that these bolts are too

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.760 
cause and also that these bolts are too
long<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.690> they<00:00:15.750> bottom<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.199> before<00:00:16.560> they<00:00:16.650> get

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
long and they bottom out before they get

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.130 
long and they bottom out before they get
a<00:00:16.830> chance<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.100> properly<00:00:17.660> tighten<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.810> gasket

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
a chance to properly tighten this gasket

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.950 
a chance to properly tighten this gasket
here<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.310> there's<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.730> result<00:00:21.300> either<00:00:21.600> way

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
here and there's a result either way

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.689 
here and there's a result either way
from<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> two<00:00:22.740> metals<00:00:23.100> expanding<00:00:23.609> at

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
from the two metals expanding at

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.370 
from the two metals expanding at
different<00:00:23.970> rates<00:00:24.150> or<00:00:24.390> from<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> bolts<00:00:25.260> are

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
different rates or from the bolts are

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620 
different rates or from the bolts are
too<00:00:25.529> long<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.760> don't<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> good<00:00:27.359> seal<00:00:27.599> on

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
too long you don't get a good seal on

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.750 
too long you don't get a good seal on
this<00:00:27.810> gasket<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.699> is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
this gasket as you can see here it is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.720 
this gasket as you can see here it is
blown<00:00:30.119> out<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.619> this<00:00:31.619> common<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:32.460> I've

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
blown out is this common with these I've

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.549 
blown out is this common with these I've
heard<00:00:32.880> they<00:00:33.000> also<00:00:33.149> suck<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.809> I'm<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.380> sure

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
heard they also suck in I'm not sure

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.229 
heard they also suck in I'm not sure
which<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.370> common<00:00:35.700> problem<00:00:35.730> either

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
which is a more common problem either

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.080 
which is a more common problem either
way<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.559> air<00:00:37.800> leakage<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.550> causes

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
way you get air leakage which causes

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.709 
way you get air leakage which causes
pinging

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
pinging

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.830 
pinging
or<00:00:39.899> spark<00:00:40.320> knock<00:00:40.700> which<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
or spark knock which is not good if you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
or spark knock which is not good if you
look<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.260> other<00:00:43.410> videos<00:00:43.800> you'll<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.340> that

middle you work your way out I actually

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.890 
middle you work your way out I actually
messed<00:05:52.760> up<00:05:52.970> a<00:05:53.060> little<00:05:53.150> bit<00:05:53.390> started<00:05:53.750> on<00:05:53.810> the

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
messed up a little bit started on the

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.540 
messed up a little bit started on the
outside<00:05:53.960> they<00:05:54.470> don't<00:05:54.650> have<00:05:54.860> those<00:05:55.040> very<00:05:55.220> tight

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:04.420 
outside they don't have those very tight
yet<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:57.010> you<00:05:58.010> know<00:05:58.040> I<00:05:58.130> crisscross

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:11.830 

you

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:29.620 

you

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.090 

for

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
for

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.020 
for
apparently<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:32.130> don't<00:06:32.250> have<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.610> right<00:06:32.759> size

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
apparently I don't have the right size

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.700 
apparently I don't have the right size
socket<00:06:33.360> for<00:06:33.660> my<00:06:33.750> torque<00:06:34.050> wrench<00:06:34.169> to<00:06:34.440> torque

socket for my torque wrench to torque

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.520 
socket for my torque wrench to torque
these<00:06:34.830> down<00:06:34.889> to<00:06:35.220> the<00:06:35.340> proper<00:06:35.699> specs<00:06:36.440> so<00:06:37.440> I'm

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
these down to the proper specs so I'm

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.840 
these down to the proper specs so I'm
basically<00:06:37.710> just<00:06:37.949> going<00:06:38.160> to<00:06:38.250> keep<00:06:38.430> working<00:06:38.639> my

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
basically just going to keep working my

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.409 
basically just going to keep working my
around<00:06:40.310> criss-crossing<00:06:41.310> like<00:06:41.610> I<00:06:41.789> was<00:06:42.000> and<00:06:42.300> get

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
around criss-crossing like I was and get

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.200 
around criss-crossing like I was and get
these<00:06:42.599> down<00:06:42.840> so<00:06:42.870> they're<00:06:43.520> fairly<00:06:44.520> snug<00:06:44.699> but

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
these down so they're fairly snug but

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.909 
these down so they're fairly snug but
you<00:06:45.270> don't<00:06:45.449> want<00:06:45.569> to<00:06:45.630> over<00:06:45.780> tighten<00:06:45.810> them<00:06:46.229> keep

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
you don't want to over tighten them keep

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.070 
you don't want to over tighten them keep
in<00:06:47.039> mind<00:06:47.220> it<00:06:47.400> is<00:06:48.470> an<00:06:49.470> aluminum<00:06:49.680> intake<00:06:50.960> we<00:06:51.960> were

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
in mind it is an aluminum intake we were

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.140 
in mind it is an aluminum intake we were
tighten<00:06:52.440> them<00:06:52.530> you<00:06:52.830> could<00:06:53.099> end<00:06:53.460> up<00:06:53.580> stripping

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
tighten them you could end up stripping

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.960 
tighten them you could end up stripping
out<00:06:54.389> a<00:06:54.419> screw

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970
