00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.559
 Hello 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.799
 today there is bee sting and for it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.609
 we need 100 grams of flour 150 grams 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.960
 sugar 4 1 packet vanilla sugar 1 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.960
 teaspoon of baking soda 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.700
 for the topping we need a tablespoon 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.320
 sugar and a pack of mandl leaves 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.240
 then for the cream we still need 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.300
 two cups of cream and a packet 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.220
 paradise cream vanilla yes first 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.150
 the eggs want to beat the sugar and 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.150
 Vanille sugar frothy 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.710
 Now we have the mail below 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.039
 and then you can do the dough in one with 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.039
 Baking paper designed Springform give 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.659
 then put aside first and now 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.250
 Let's take care of the almond leaves 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.280
 We put that in a pan with the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.570
 Sugar and equip the very short and 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.570
 then give the dough 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.550
 then it goes in the oven for about 30 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.550
 minutes at 175 degrees 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.890
 and in the meantime we can do the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.310
 prepare cream then we take ours 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.770
 paradise cream and add the cream 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.870
 beat the whole thing stiff and that comes 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.760
 then immediately in the fridge until the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.760
 cake is completely chilled 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.590
 The whole thing will happen now 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.950
 cut through that cream 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.930
 can intervene and is best 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.640
 if you already have the cake down by 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.540
 This solves the plate I unfortunately 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.290
 forgotten and later made 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.360
 Now you can do a springform again 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.310
 put in or frame a bug as well 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.310
 I did are the creme pure 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.810
 now only the top piece comes 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.280
 on it and then the cake is actually 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.050
 so far finished I have one more here 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.310
 a little bit of water dripped on it 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.230
 so a bit of moisture in there 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.610
 Come on and then it was with you 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.360
 my video and I say goodbye 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.360
 next time
