00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
properties and this is what makes it

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.900 
properties and this is what makes it
really<00:04:15.500> look<00:04:15.800> like<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.160> tax<00:04:16.400> you're<00:04:16.730> going<00:04:16.850> to

really look like the tax you're going to

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.069 
really look like the tax you're going to
go<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.799> mode<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.370> go<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.329> color<00:04:20.750> dodge

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079

go to the mode and go to color dodge
that<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:22.490> really<00:04:22.790> like<00:04:23.090> gives<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.419> their

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
that that really like gives it their

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.530 
that that really like gives it their
whole<00:04:24.220> model<00:04:25.220> for<00:04:25.460> two<00:04:25.640> thing<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.270> think

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
whole model for two thing and I think

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.930 
whole model for two thing and I think
that<00:04:26.720> looks<00:04:27.260> really<00:04:27.530> cool<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.100> can<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.820> can

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
that looks really cool you can you can

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.060 
that looks really cool you can you can
try<00:04:29.150> different<00:04:29.210> ones<00:04:29.540> but<00:04:29.720> i<00:04:30.110> recommend<00:04:30.500> color

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
try different ones but i recommend color

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.350 
try different ones but i recommend color
dodge<00:04:31.280> because<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.700> just<00:04:31.729> looks<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.210> best

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
dodge because that just looks the best

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.219 
dodge because that just looks the best
so<00:04:33.169> gonna<00:04:34.100> do<00:04:34.250> that<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:37.120> instead<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.270> just

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
so gonna do that and instead of just

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.050 
so gonna do that and instead of just
merging<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.800> layers<00:04:40.010> here<00:04:40.400> because<00:04:40.700> when<00:04:40.970> you

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
merging the layers here because when you

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.820 
merging the layers here because when you
do<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.360> it'll<00:04:41.630> just<00:04:41.960> spring<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.410> bars<00:04:42.590> back

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
do that it'll just spring the bars back

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.090 
do that it'll just spring the bars back
and<00:04:43.100> we<00:04:43.490> don't<00:04:43.580> really<00:04:43.820> want<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.560> go<00:04:45.560> just

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
and we don't really want that go just

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.180 
and we don't really want that go just
save<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.729> this<00:04:47.560> save<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.590> whatever<00:04:49.100> you

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
save it like this save it whatever you

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.640 
save it like this save it whatever you
