even have a ghost in the mix am peeing

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.780 
even have a ghost in the mix am peeing
some<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.049> these<00:03:00.170> stalkers<00:03:00.590> right<00:03:00.980> there<00:03:01.160> just

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
some of these stalkers right there just

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.809 
some of these stalkers right there just
an<00:03:01.940> insane<00:03:02.450> battle<00:03:02.989> from<00:03:03.140> both<00:03:03.319> teams<00:03:03.670> such<00:03:04.670> a

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
an insane battle from both teams such a

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.119 
an insane battle from both teams such a
high<00:03:05.090> APM<00:03:05.720> battle<00:03:06.140> here<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.319> do<00:03:06.410> think<00:03:06.829> that's

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
high APM battle here I do think that's

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.890 
high APM battle here I do think that's
they<00:03:07.579> may<00:03:07.700> have<00:03:07.760> over<00:03:08.000> 10<00:03:08.209> themselves<00:03:08.629> artosis

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
they may have over 10 themselves artosis

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.780 
they may have over 10 themselves artosis
and<00:03:09.230> qxe<00:03:09.620> they<00:03:09.769> kind<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.040> ran<00:03:10.250> out<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.400> units

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
and qxe they kind of ran out of units

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.520 
and qxe they kind of ran out of units
there<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.569> they're<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.139> were<00:03:12.260> saying

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
there but they're like you were saying

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.559 
there but they're like you were saying
man<00:03:12.859> there<00:03:13.040> were<00:03:13.099> so<00:03:13.430> many<00:03:13.579> spells<00:03:14.000> back<00:03:14.329> and

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
man there were so many spells back and

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.030 
man there were so many spells back and
forth<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.959> don't<00:03:15.109> know<00:03:15.170> how<00:03:15.319> these<00:03:15.470> players<00:03:15.769> do

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
forth I don't know how these players do

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.819 
forth I don't know how these players do
it<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:17.090> micromanage<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.930> much<00:03:18.109> stuff<00:03:18.319> show<00:03:18.799> a

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
it to micromanage that much stuff show a

it to micromanage that much stuff show a
very<00:03:19.220> epic<00:03:19.609> battle<00:03:19.910> here<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.209> almost

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
very epic battle here and it almost

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.390 
very epic battle here and it almost
seems<00:03:20.630> like<00:03:20.780> we're<00:03:20.930> back<00:03:21.139> to<00:03:21.319> square<00:03:21.349> one<00:03:21.889> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
seems like we're back to square one the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.800 
seems like we're back to square one the
only<00:03:22.579> thing<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.880> can<00:03:23.000> tell<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.389> story<00:03:23.660> of

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
only thing that can tell the story of

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.809 
only thing that can tell the story of
how<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:23.989> battle<00:03:24.440> went<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.069> units<00:03:25.459> lost

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
how that battle went is the units lost

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.870 
how that battle went is the units lost

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
that artosis and qxe actually really

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.839 
that artosis and qxe actually really
down<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.099> UNIX<00:03:34.099> lost<00:03:34.310> stop<00:03:34.519> losing

down in the UNIX lost stop losing

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.420 
down in the UNIX lost stop losing
several<00:03:35.299> more<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:36.049> terms<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.680> resources<00:03:37.280> and

several more in terms of resources and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.879 
several more in terms of resources and
that<00:03:37.819> is<00:03:37.970> not<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.329> good<00:03:38.599> story<00:03:38.959> actually<00:03:39.739> if<00:03:39.799> you

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
that is not a good story actually if you

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.890 
that is not a good story actually if you
take<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.130> look<00:03:40.340> at<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.519> army<00:03:40.940> tab<00:03:41.150> as<00:03:41.359> well<00:03:41.389> it

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
take a look at the army tab as well it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.349 
take a look at the army tab as well it
looks<00:03:42.560> like<00:03:42.680> Team<00:03:43.220> Liquid<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.849> currently

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
looks like Team Liquid is currently

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.319 
looks like Team Liquid is currently
massing<00:03:45.079> a<00:03:45.200> much<00:03:45.620> much<00:03:45.950> larger<00:03:46.220> army<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.209> in

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
massing a much much larger army so in

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.909 
massing a much much larger army so in
all<00:03:47.540> in<00:03:47.690> all<00:03:47.780> they<00:03:47.989> didn't<00:03:48.290> really<00:03:48.440> lose<00:03:48.680> that

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
all in all they didn't really lose that

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.909 
all in all they didn't really lose that
many<00:03:49.099> forces<00:03:49.579> and<00:03:49.940> qxc<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:51.109> actually<00:03:51.500> really

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
many forces and qxc is actually really

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.909 
many forces and qxc is actually really
really<00:03:52.310> low<00:03:52.639> in<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.849> army<00:03:53.090> count<00:03:53.299> at<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> measly

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
really low in the army count at a measly

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.580 
really low in the army count at a measly
63<00:03:54.919> supply<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.700> this<00:03:56.150> is<00:03:56.359> bad<00:03:56.630> if<00:03:56.810> qxe<00:03:57.260> loses

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
63 supply and this is bad if qxe loses

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.650 
63 supply and this is bad if qxe loses
this<00:03:57.739> gold<00:03:58.069> expansion<00:03:58.669> you<00:03:58.849> might<00:03:59.150> be<00:03:59.419> able<00:03:59.510> to

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
this gold expansion you might be able to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.390 
this gold expansion you might be able to

count them out of the game and with that

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.670 
count them out of the game and with that

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
it might be a really really tough part

boards<00:04:12.740> so<00:04:12.830> we<00:04:12.920> are<00:04:13.070> going<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.310> see<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.460> big

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
boards so we are going to see a big

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.100 
boards so we are going to see a big
battle<00:04:13.820> right<00:04:14.030> now<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.420> i<00:04:14.600> think<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.020> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
battle right now and i think that the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.479 
battle right now and i think that the
two<00:04:15.290> chairs<00:04:15.560> players<00:04:15.830> are<00:04:16.010> probably<00:04:16.190> gonna

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
two chairs players are probably gonna

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.800 
two chairs players are probably gonna
have<00:04:16.610> enough<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.970> just<00:04:17.150> plow<00:04:17.390> their<00:04:17.600> way<00:04:17.690> in

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
have enough to just plow their way in

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.900 
have enough to just plow their way in
here<00:04:17.840> but<00:04:18.110> the<00:04:18.230> storm<00:04:18.590> got<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.220> be<00:04:19.370> eating<00:04:19.670> up<00:04:19.790> a

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
here but the storm got to be eating up a

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.520 
here but the storm got to be eating up a
lot<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.300> units<00:04:20.540> here<00:04:20.630> how<00:04:20.900> long<00:04:21.170> can<00:04:21.380> they<00:04:21.500> hold

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
lot of units here how long can they hold

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.950 
lot of units here how long can they hold
on<00:04:21.890> which<00:04:22.100> is<00:04:22.250> storm<00:04:22.550> though<00:04:22.760> i<00:04:23.030> don't<00:04:23.600> think

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
on which is storm though i don't think

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
was a little Hellion raid in the top

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.880 
was a little Hellion raid in the top
center<00:05:05.540> able<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.960> kill<00:05:06.110> about<00:05:06.200> eight<00:05:06.530> roads

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890

there<00:05:07.160> just<00:05:07.460> now<00:05:07.640> so<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.000> mean<00:05:08.270> he<00:05:08.630> lost<00:05:08.780> all<00:05:09.020> the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
there just now so I mean he lost all the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.720 
there just now so I mean he lost all the
Hellions<00:05:09.440> but<00:05:09.620> it<00:05:09.710> did<00:05:09.860> end<00:05:10.040> up<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.340> think<00:05:10.400> being

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
Hellions but it did end up I think being

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.460 
Hellions but it did end up I think being
worth<00:05:10.910> it<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.270> since<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.900> Nexus<00:05:12.200> did<00:05:12.350> go<00:05:12.440> down

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
worth it and since the Nexus did go down

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.110 
worth it and since the Nexus did go down
there<00:05:12.770> guys<00:05:12.890> trying<00:05:13.250> off<00:05:13.430> his<00:05:13.580> jokes<00:05:13.880> and

literally a

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.310 
literally a
battle<00:07:31.670> here<00:07:31.820> for<00:07:31.850> artosis<00:07:32.300> he's<00:07:32.600> trying<00:07:33.080> to

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320 
battle here for artosis he's trying to

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
basically take this by himself but his

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.960 
basically take this by himself but his
partner<00:07:35.510> qia<00:07:36.170> ran<00:07:36.500> out<00:07:36.710> of<00:07:36.740> steam<00:07:37.010> and<00:07:37.340> so<00:07:37.820> it

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:37.970 
partner qia ran out of steam and so it

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.640 
partner qia ran out of steam and so it
was<00:07:38.000> a<00:07:38.090> good<00:07:38.300> choice<00:07:38.360> fire<00:07:38.780> chose<00:07:39.020> us<00:07:39.200> to<00:07:39.350> get

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650 
was a good choice fire chose us to get

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.590 
was a good choice fire chose us to get
massive<00:07:40.160> amounts<00:07:40.430> of<00:07:40.430> corruptors<00:07:40.940> hamburgers

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.600 
massive amounts of corruptors hamburgers

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.060 
massive amounts of corruptors hamburgers
I<00:07:41.750> think<00:07:41.930> that<00:07:42.050> was<00:07:42.140> his<00:07:42.260> only<00:07:42.440> viable<00:07:42.770> option

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.070 
I think that was his only viable option

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.860 
I think that was his only viable option
but<00:07:43.790> this<00:07:43.940> is<00:07:44.120> not<00:07:44.270> looking<00:07:44.420> good<00:07:44.600> the

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:44.870 
but this is not looking good the

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.300 
but this is not looking good the
battlecruisers<00:07:45.470> able<00:07:45.710> to<00:07:45.770> clean<00:07:45.980> up<00:07:46.130> house

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.310 
battlecruisers able to clean up house

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.550 
battlecruisers able to clean up house
and<00:07:46.580> it<00:07:46.670> does<00:07:46.820> look<00:07:46.970> like<00:07:47.060> qxe<00:07:47.570> got<00:07:48.020> to<00:07:48.170> tap<00:07:48.350> out

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 
and it does look like qxe got to tap out

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.080 
and it does look like qxe got to tap out
and<00:07:48.800> I<00:07:48.950> can<00:07:48.980> only<00:07:49.190> imagine<00:07:49.340> artosis<00:07:49.820> he's

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.090 
and I can only imagine artosis he's

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.750 
and I can only imagine artosis he's
gotta<00:07:50.240> follow<00:07:50.450> suit<00:07:50.830> both<00:07:51.830> players<00:07:52.160> gging
