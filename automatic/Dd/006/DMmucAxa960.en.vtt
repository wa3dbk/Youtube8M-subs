00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello everyone that's another video to the channel 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:09.480
 that this time will explain how 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.519
 assemble this cube this cube can be 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.360
 recognized in several ways can 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.340
 called artium the cube with gears or 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.010
 some know it also as the cube 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.160
 screw 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.250
 well this besides this I would like 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 invite them to subscribe and not 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.410
 I like several videos 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.380
 good 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 once we have it unarmed we have 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 what to do this we have to inform 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.829
 that these couples 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.930
 of corners this how it should be in each 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.470
 face for example if we want the blue 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.780
 we have to make that the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.850
 all corners are blue in some 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.600
 face then we look for the blue corner 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 it's here then we do it like that but 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.510
 as well you could not take it so that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.200
 ok we would have to do this is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.509
 from here up to shoot it a turn here and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.440
 download two here and as we see already 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.509
 we formed the cross now this this step 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.910
 It's very simple because when you make a 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 you are almost automatically formed 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.410
 all now what we have to do is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 put them in their respective centers by 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.759
 example this is the blue face there is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.759
 put it in the blue center 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.790
 already here is in south center let's see 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.220
 the works the works are put good 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.720
 what is the next step the next 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:46.460
 step is to put the edges where they should go 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:51.050
 for example we want to put the is these 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.210
 these four edges but this as 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.330
 we can see situations are formed 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.280
 so you have to exchange two edges 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.440
 what we should do is this 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.430
 catch it in such a way that it remains so 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.840
 these are the two that we have to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.429
 exchange and do this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.430
 2 up one for the right 2 for 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.250
 up and one for the right and as 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.069
 we see they are already in the place we want 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.340
 that they were now let's go for the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.500
 next good we have already been trained 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.599
 we have to repeat this so many times 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.580
 it is necessary to place all where 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.510
 should go now is the step more 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.120
 simple to place them well where in your 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.130
 original form we have to do this 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.630
 catch some face and do so 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:45.560
 turn and turn until it forms where 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.950
 we have to put them and now we're going with 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 the other 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.020
 we look and we turn 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.250
 until now we are already formed and with 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.540
 very simple steps we could put together 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.130
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.960
 leave me in the comments 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.870
 what do you want me to do in the next 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.080
 videos that have to be related 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.040
 with some these cubes the 3 x 3 2 x 2 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.070
 the mirror or the 6 x 6 the 6 for 6 still 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.020
 I do not handle it, I do not handle it well 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.140
 I could only put it together once 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:33.630
 but it comes to me in case of parity 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.400
 that I can not solve it yet I would have to 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.920
 see tutorials on youtube but good 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.280
 well here the video ends and I hope 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.280
 what you liked
