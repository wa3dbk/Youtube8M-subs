00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.589
 Today we will try to deal with 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.500
 simulation physics library 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.050
 objects will be a physicist family of nations 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 This feature allows you to create very 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.700
 realistic physical animation 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.080
 interactions of different models of them 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.380
 falling collision rebound slip and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.420
 much more to get started let's get acquainted with 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 governing bodies and their 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.310
 direct appointment pegs lot 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
 simulations 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.510
 calculation modeling creo family lost 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.059
 cleaning reset modeling when in family 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.809
 and tire real time simulation 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.710
 from barking hairy star apply values 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.910
 at start of the frame and from and the mouse is not muddled 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.230
 use animated mesh 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.360
 to lie mordzhim limit collision field 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.809
 friction 3 not 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.699
 bounce bounce liner damping lines 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.329
 rotation 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.500
 rotational damping rotational damping 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.790
 maz maz 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.189
 interns you prefer internal pressure 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.189
 liner steve carried linear stiffness 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.470
 create a simple cube scene and nobody 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.470
 to tourist car 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.060
 tighten ruim objects small 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.590
 distance apart considering 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.590
 collision paths 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.810
 we set the required number of films 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.580
 activate the new simulation scene 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 go to the object menu and set 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.450
 properties of all existing elements 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.790
 we have them as you see three ap cube itself 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.280
 car cola cube we will have 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.770
 static and machine accordingly 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.590
 dynamic object set 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.090
 the trajectory of the car using 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.920
 scale animation up to the moment 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.920
 touching it with a cube 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.090
 apply the values ​​when starting the mystery and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.530
 activate the calculation simulation as 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.860
 we see it turned out quite 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.350
 realistic collision scenes 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.880
 We fix our wayward rules Well with 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.880
 this operation we finished 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.860
 When activated, the view of the family Leshin 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.630
 real time simulation we 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.370
 we can first see how 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.300
 this or that object behaves when 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.260
 different situations and if necessary 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.280
 adjust its physical characteristics 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.519
 mentioned in the beginning on this 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.519
 everything 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.090
 other features of the physics library 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.090
 modeling will look at other lessons
