00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hi, it's just the way to the house and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.779
 Today I'm going to teach you how to 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 makes a spinach cream with what can 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.349
 be given to infants from 6 months onwards 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.450
 that is, those babies who are 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.009
 starting the feed introduction to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.880
 people make our way to spinach 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.890
 I'm going to need a password today. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 spinach spinach through the packet is 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.439
 for the first time you give the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.029
 your baby 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.220
 Are you going to take a test because 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.320
 probably it will reject the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.119
 first time and he will go to eat 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.779
 then the second or third time that he 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.890
 to know 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.700
 I'll probably make the spinach 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.469
 soften the steam 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.620
 so here I already left a pan with 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.260
 Water and a basket where I go. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.070
 put the spinach in the steam 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 it will stay on steam from 5 to 7 million 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.579
 we had to give him a hatchet and okay 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.879
 I'll take that spinach later. 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.820
 here and I'll take him in the mixer I'll mix it up 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.149
 it with onion and garlic and practically 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 our way is ready and get spinach 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.860
 and then if you can not prepare 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 the way in the day you can only wash the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.210
 spinach and sanitize the spinach 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.119
 was what I had put him in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.280
 57 minutes and then freeze the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.909
 him in a bag identified with the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.549
 name 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.159
 the spinach and the date you did ok 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.840
 then come in five minutinhos 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.650
 I'm going back to get the spinach. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.290
 from here and prepare our way 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 Hi, I 'm back and I'm going to repeat the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 spinach with water vapor and will 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.619
 place it directly in a basin 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.220
 I prepared while I was waiting for him 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.860
 stay on the bench because of ice and water're 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.560
 this bowl with ice and water I go 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.689
 Take the spinach straight from here to here. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 this process we call 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.280
 bleaching and serves to preserve 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.729
 better the nutrients and vitamins that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.340
 has a spin-off is nothing more is actually 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.310
 than a thermal shock process is 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.420
 where I take him out of extreme heat and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.290
 play it straight in the water with ice 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.019
 He will stay here in this ice water. 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.870
 for a couple of three minutinhos until 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.709
 very cold and from here I'm going to take it 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.640
 straight for me to my little jar where 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.650
 I'm going to do the crime already. 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.879
 after two three minutes then I 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:37.849
 I'll take the spinach out of the water. 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:40.819
 he in my jar so that the spinach 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.129
 get a much better taste 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.459
 we will add to our cream 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:55.669
 spinach a half number of an onion 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:58.400
 and a garlic clove is just a minute 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:02.019
 I'm going to close the window to 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.019
 curtain does not get so much loop 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.290
 come on 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.810
 after I put the spinach to 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.810
 onion and garlic is just stick 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.970
 if you make a good cream or service 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.910
 well without a piece of that baby that 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.709
 still not used to you 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.319
 can do the process in one 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.569
 blender on the mixer 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.470
 we get a few bits 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:54.620
 some fibers of the spinach and of course 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:01.970

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:04.370
