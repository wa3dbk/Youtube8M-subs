we<00:02:18.660> phone<00:02:18.840> first<00:02:19.080> rabies<00:02:19.500> vaccines<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
we phone first rabies vaccines and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.699 
we phone first rabies vaccines and
testing<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.300> still<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.260> many<00:02:22.470> are<00:02:22.709> used<00:02:24.530> 630<00:02:25.530> 1

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709

million<00:02:26.129> animals<00:02:26.340> are<00:02:26.700> used<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.120> year<00:02:27.480> food<00:02:28.200> and

million animals are used a year food and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.619 
million animals are used a year food and
they<00:02:28.830> could<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.099> much<00:02:29.489> more<00:02:29.730> worthwhile<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
they could be much more worthwhile to

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.780 
they could be much more worthwhile to
human<00:02:30.959> life<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.860> either<00:02:32.010> way<00:02:32.310> they<00:02:32.550> daddy

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
human life so either way they daddy

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.770 
human life so either way they daddy
comes<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.390> again<00:02:34.760> what<00:02:35.760> about<00:02:35.849> primates<00:02:36.330> how

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
comes up again what about primates how

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.229 
comes up again what about primates how
do<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.050> possibly<00:02:37.290> use<00:02:37.980> them<00:02:38.250> when<00:02:38.909> they<00:02:39.120> are

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
do you possibly use them when they are

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.809 
do you possibly use them when they are
