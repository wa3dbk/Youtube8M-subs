00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.459
 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.219
 video today it's about the 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.919
 designs of the week welcome to like 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.460
 already last week have indicated turns 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:22.169
 Among other things, it is about today 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 You can do that here 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:28.230
 see is also an ingredient of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 Today's designs do not follow again 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.030
 long around the whole but me 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 start and show yourself first 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.040
 airplane when you see here two models 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.140
 because this is really a very complete one 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.670
 small so if you both the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.309
 comparing both planes now 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 then that is only now as the airbus 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.879
 a380 and that he is such a small one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.229
 propeller engine 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:58.530
 the whole thing was hit saves user 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:59.720
 gps you have the name now 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.100
 seen 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.970
 the first one looks that way is completely 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.290
 cool if I sat down in there then 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.909
 Do you have a very cool Fehlinger 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.299
 It would be great to set up associations 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.310
 really cool for for example machine 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.259
 measure is suited very well because 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.659
 otherwise it has no sense yes me 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.549
 can live now it can not be a bed 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.060
 is set up and what therefore otherwise 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.009
 that now only visually quite 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 interesting or just as mentioned 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.030
 has a lot of minecraft for example movies 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.549
 So for film projects and so on and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.799
 so on , that's cool to have here 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.240
 now has a bigger model now 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:43.350
 also here in front of the big propeller 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.729
 And that looks like it is 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.579
 your biplane from the second 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.969
 world war I would say now 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:54.359
 yes and we have two places 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.039
 one up here and that one has 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.979
 really not such a good view of us 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.800
 can see here now and a place 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.210
 further back and that 's the one here 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.040
 and this was the place of the of 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.160
 that of the protectors of the gunner 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.760
 who shot with a mg in there 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.650
 second world war has should now 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.160
 Never be so said in this post 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.110
 I 'll just go here now 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.660
 that it will not work out now 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.830
 What that is supposed to be and that is this 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.050
 the wall that was the back wall while the end 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.850
 so a bit so this here is the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.740
 Back wall had nothing to do in the design 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.930
 otherwise it's all about this here and there 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.740
 while this is one 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.050
 moose head is known as the hunter 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.370
 scene that likes to be with the hunters of the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.720
 behind forest hut dranhÃ¤ngt or anywhere 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.420
 yes, and that is the pitiful thing now 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.840
 try the new crafter must be submitted 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.510
 quite acceptable because now after 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.830
 content says yes that's just right 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.870
 could have been come still on it but 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.280
 now you will see that right away 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.780
 I do not think that anyone 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.550
 of you now would come on that 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.650
 But it's still the same in Niger's head 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.010
 from the implementation quite well there for 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.690
 minecraft relationships yes we go 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.709
 continue to be there to the 12 to the third 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:27.000
 and that is a table and it works 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.459
 viewed from above and how it works 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.989
 that with the carpets yes I have yes 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.120
 you have already shown and you have to 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:40.140
 just this this thread for this 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.530
 the alarm system so you need her 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.750
 you have to go on these these rides 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.489
 lay the ground and then you can with 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.350
 this carpet you can just on it 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.290
 put then you have that I have now 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.150
 alarm system because I said that now 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.760
 a connection with imitating situation 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.310
 always bring because I am so dreamed 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.850
 So we build yes, and so on 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.070
 and so on 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.600
 and there is always an alarm system 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.070
 commitment 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:11.360
 and we usually do that with us 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.580
 this damage as you said you can do that 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.890
 In this way you can this carpet 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.260
 put on there you have this iconic 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.120
 and could not, however 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
 yes it is the case here now 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.540
 this works better 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.580
 could also blog here sometime 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.600
 Reinsetzen and otherwise it was that it 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.770
 let you 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.080
 4 the design is a racing car that looks 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.240
 Unfortunately we have no such 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.460
 License plate and also no lamp behind 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.490
 then we do not trust anyone anyway 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.930
 Brakes loses 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.350
 I sit down that's right 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.730
 does not work because it is bright 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.830
 but you can still do it in the evening 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.890
 is judge insert 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.370
 then you have a very cool many there 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.440
 in it 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.500
 There are also beds for little ones 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.790
 children who look something like that 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.700
 If you really such an action 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.000
 racer fan page then that is 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.250
 really an ideal bed for you like 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.580
 like you're fine with that 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:15.080
 operated 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:18.010
 4 that's a right one it is 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.970
 a torch, so to speak, a one 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.910
 you probably know the lighting unit 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.710
 out of the hood 1 he has something like that 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.540
 we can use similar things 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:34.240
 ignite and yes then burns the whole 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:37.340
 happy and you do not have 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.110
 otherwise it was already that were 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.840
 the fifth science of the week 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.940
 I hope I could make her heart happy 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.680
 that and maybe we'll watch each other 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.680
 the one or the other video again ciao
