00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
season I can't remember for sure at the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.570 
season I can't remember for sure at the
beginning<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.890> video<00:03:23.980> but<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.370> don't

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
beginning in the video but I don't

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.260 
beginning in the video but I don't
recall<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:27.310> defense<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.820> actually<00:03:28.120> pretty

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
recall so the defense is actually pretty

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.540 
recall so the defense is actually pretty
tough<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.050> we<00:03:29.230> went<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.040> tough<00:03:30.400> but<00:03:30.430> oh
