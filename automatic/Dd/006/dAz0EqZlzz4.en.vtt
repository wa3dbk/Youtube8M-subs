very short episode looking at the new
rotor<00:00:09.090> blades<00:00:09.590> you<00:00:10.590> can<00:00:10.740> see<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.920> connects<00:00:11.309> on

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
rotor blades you can see it connects on

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.129 
rotor blades you can see it connects on
all<00:00:11.670> four<00:00:11.910> sides<00:00:11.940> around<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> block<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
all four sides around the block at the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.299 
all four sides around the block at the
bottom<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> rotor<00:00:13.799> blade<00:00:14.040> plus

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
bottom of the rotor blade plus

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
bottom of the rotor blade plus
underneath<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.389> 5<00:00:15.630> connection<00:00:16.139> points<00:00:16.440> i<00:00:16.470> just

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
underneath so 5 connection points i just

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.859 
underneath so 5 connection points i just
want<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.800> show<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.430> briefly<00:00:17.869> once

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
want to show you that very briefly once

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.150 
want to show you that very briefly once
you<00:00:19.020> get<00:00:19.170> your<00:00:19.289> own<00:00:19.320> rotor<00:00:19.590> blades<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.070> they

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
you get your own rotor blades and they

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.070 
you get your own rotor blades and they
started<00:00:20.430> i<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.730> tier<00:00:20.910> 5<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.449> go<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
started i think at tier 5 and go all the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080 
started i think at tier 5 and go all the
way<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.350> you'll<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.220> an<00:00:23.340> opportunity<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.880> see

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
way up you'll have an opportunity to see

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.210 
way up you'll have an opportunity to see
for<00:00:24.300> yourself<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.720> little<00:00:24.840> bit<00:00:25.050> closer<00:00:25.260> mess

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
for yourself a little bit closer mess

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.390 
for yourself a little bit closer mess
around<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.640> little<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:27.769> very<00:00:28.769> interesting<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
around a little bit very interesting to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.910 
around a little bit very interesting to
work<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.760> they're<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:31.050> kind<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.380> remind<00:00:31.859> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
work with they're the kind of remind you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.560 
work with they're the kind of remind you
of<00:00:32.009> rotor<00:00:32.250> blades<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.790> don't<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> lot<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
of rotor blades they don't have a lot of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
of rotor blades they don't have a lot of
balance<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.170> their<00:00:34.290> own<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.340> kind

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
balance on their own but if you do kind

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.979 
balance on their own but if you do kind
of<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> decent<00:00:36.120> job<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> building<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.719> but

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of a decent job of building your but

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.479 
of a decent job of building your but
they're<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.350> too<00:00:37.530> bad<00:00:37.710> i<00:00:37.739> originally<00:00:38.219> built

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
they're not too bad i originally built

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.920 
they're not too bad i originally built
this<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.879> check<00:00:39.059> built<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> cage

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
this you can check built kind of a cage

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.830 
this you can check built kind of a cage
around<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.410> lower<00:00:40.620> large<00:00:40.950> rotor<00:00:41.250> blade<00:00:41.840> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
around that lower large rotor blade that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
around that lower large rotor blade that
wasn't<00:00:43.170> enough<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.530> lift<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> bot<00:00:44.100> ironically

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
wasn't enough to lift the bot ironically

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
wasn't enough to lift the bot ironically
i<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.320> took<00:00:46.500> me<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> little<00:00:46.800> while<00:00:46.920> before

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
i just it took me a little while before

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
i just it took me a little while before
I<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.430> accept<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.149> wasn't<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.870> know

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I can accept that that wasn't you know

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.779 
I can accept that that wasn't you know
that<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> case<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.489> having

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that was the case and it was not having

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.670 
that was the case and it was not having
enough<00:00:51.090> lift<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.899> anything<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> bot

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
enough lift to do anything with the bot

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.380 
enough lift to do anything with the bot
out<00:00:52.829> brought<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> practice<00:00:53.879> map<00:00:54.090> just

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
out brought it into a practice map just

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
out brought it into a practice map just
like<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.309> kind<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
like that and it was just kind of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.510 
like that and it was just kind of
rotating<00:00:57.449> around<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> ground<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> put

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
rotating around on the ground so I put

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.459 
rotating around on the ground so I put
the<00:00:59.760> rear<00:01:00.210> rotor<00:01:00.480> blade<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.930> thinking<00:01:01.320> maybe

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the rear rotor blade on thinking maybe

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
the rear rotor blade on thinking maybe
if<00:01:01.620> i<00:01:01.710> stabilized<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> would<00:01:02.730> help<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
if i stabilized it that would help it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.750 
if i stabilized it that would help it
didn't<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.589> i<00:01:04.619> put<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> second<00:01:05.309> large<00:01:05.489> rotor

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
didn't so i put the second large rotor

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
didn't so i put the second large rotor
blade<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.210> top<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.350> finally<00:01:07.770> enough

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
blade on top and that was finally enough

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
blade on top and that was finally enough
lift<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> ground<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
lift to get it up off the ground the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
lift to get it up off the ground the
rear<00:01:09.840> rotor<00:01:10.080> blade<00:01:10.320> does<00:01:10.590> help<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.159> terms<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
rear rotor blade does help in terms of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.910 
rear rotor blade does help in terms of
turning<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> momentum

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
turning but it's kind of like a momentum

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
turning but it's kind of like a momentum
thing<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.430> press<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.030> key<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> move

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
thing when you press the key to move

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.050 
thing when you press the key to move
there's<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.619> brief<00:01:16.890> pause<00:01:17.130> where<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> seems

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
there's a brief pause where it seems

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
there's a brief pause where it seems
like<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.570> doing<00:01:18.869> anything<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
like it's not doing anything and then it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.649 
like it's not doing anything and then it
kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> slowly<00:01:20.400> starts<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> turn<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
kind of slowly starts to turn around and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.090 
kind of slowly starts to turn around and
the<00:01:21.750> longer<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.170> hold<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> faster<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the longer you hold it the faster it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.210 
the longer you hold it the faster it
goes<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.850> there's<00:01:24.720> probably<00:01:25.500> still<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
goes so there's probably still going to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
goes so there's probably still going to
be<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.580> room<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.939> maneuvering<00:01:27.299> thrusters

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
be some room for maneuvering thrusters

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
be some room for maneuvering thrusters
on<00:01:28.049> these<00:01:28.619> things<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.100> kind<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.490> them

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
on these things to kind of get them

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
on these things to kind of get them
turning<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.150> bit<00:01:30.360> faster<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:31.130> tried

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
turning a little bit faster I tried

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.679 
turning a little bit faster I tried
putting<00:01:32.280> some<00:01:32.520> thrusters<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> underside

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
putting some thrusters on the underside

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.679 
putting some thrusters on the underside
of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> cage<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.670> were<00:01:35.729> too<00:01:36.030> much<00:01:36.240> they

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
of the cage and they were too much they

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.590 
of the cage and they were too much they
were<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.259> doing<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> loop-de-loops

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
were I was just doing the loop-de-loops

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.700 
were I was just doing the loop-de-loops
partly<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> positioning<00:01:40.590> but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
partly because of the positioning but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
partly because of the positioning but
also<00:01:40.829> possibly<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.329> tier<00:01:42.540> 10

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
also possibly because it was for tier 10

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
also possibly because it was for tier 10
thrusters<00:01:43.259> might<00:01:43.770> might<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.460> been<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
thrusters might might have just been a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.069 
thrusters might might have just been a
little<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.149> overkill<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.840> there's<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
little bit of overkill so there's a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.569 
little bit of overkill so there's a
little<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.680> playing<00:01:46.920> around<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
little bit of playing around to do to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
little bit of playing around to do to
find<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.060> thrusters<00:01:48.570> will<00:01:48.810> fit<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
find out how thrusters will fit with the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
find out how thrusters will fit with the
rotor<00:01:50.130> blades<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> most<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.960> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
rotor blades to get the most out of it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.440 
rotor blades to get the most out of it
it<00:01:52.350> seems<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.850> them<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> in

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it seems like if you can get them on in

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.300 
it seems like if you can get them on in
a<00:01:54.540> balanced<00:01:54.990> way<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.470> thrusters<00:01:55.979> will<00:01:56.159> make

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
a balanced way that thrusters will make

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.420 
a balanced way that thrusters will make
these<00:01:56.549> things<00:01:56.880> quite<00:01:57.630> fast<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.890> that's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
these things quite fast so that's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920 
these things quite fast so that's
definitely<00:01:59.670> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.180> an<00:02:00.270> interesting<00:02:00.479> thing

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
definitely kind of an interesting thing

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.460 
definitely kind of an interesting thing
about<00:02:00.960> them

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
about them

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.650 
about them
it's<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.550> finding<00:02:03.760> out<00:02:03.940> exactly<00:02:04.120> where<00:02:04.570> you

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
it's just finding out exactly where you

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.880 
it's just finding out exactly where you
want<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.900> put<00:02:05.020> them<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.260> order<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.470> get<00:02:05.680> that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
want to put them in order to get that

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.140 
want to put them in order to get that
benefit<00:02:06.250> beyond<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.880> could<00:02:07.030> mount

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
benefit beyond that you could mount

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.880 
benefit beyond that you could mount
pretty<00:02:07.420> much<00:02:07.630> anything<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.320> want<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:08.680> I<00:02:08.770> was

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
pretty much anything you want if I was

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.020 
pretty much anything you want if I was
going<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.040> do<00:02:09.190> rails<00:02:09.430> which<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.820> what<00:02:09.940> we're

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
going to do rails which is what we're

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.220 
going to do rails which is what we're
going<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.210> be<00:02:10.240> doing<00:02:10.390> with<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.780> build<00:02:11.050> we're

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
going to be doing with this build we're

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.840 
going to be doing with this build we're
going<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> want<00:02:11.590> some<00:02:11.650> sort<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.040> stability<00:02:12.250> so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
going to want some sort of stability so

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.750 
going to want some sort of stability so
Walker<00:02:13.120> legs<00:02:13.890> I'm<00:02:14.890> hoping<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.370> they're<00:02:15.610> not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
Walker legs I'm hoping that they're not

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.110 
Walker legs I'm hoping that they're not
too<00:02:15.940> heavy<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.420> did<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:18.490> have<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.820> put<00:02:19.090> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
too heavy I did if we have to put a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120 
too heavy I did if we have to put a
third<00:02:19.450> large<00:02:19.780> rotor<00:02:20.110> blade<00:02:20.380> on<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:20.770> might<00:02:20.950> be

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
third large rotor blade on we might be

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.620 
third large rotor blade on we might be
in<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.460> little<00:02:21.490> bit<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.880> trouble<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.510> terms

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
in a little bit of trouble just in terms

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.100 
in a little bit of trouble just in terms
of<00:02:22.810> making<00:02:22.960> ourselves<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.650> larger<00:02:23.980> but<00:02:24.130> target

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
of making ourselves to larger but target

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.150 
of making ourselves to larger but target
but<00:02:26.110> we<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.320> always<00:02:26.470> mess<00:02:26.770> around<00:02:26.920> with

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
but we can always mess around with

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.740 
but we can always mess around with
positioning<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.820> things<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:28.600> that

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
positioning and things like that so that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.660 
positioning and things like that so that
we<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.990> try<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.040> not<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.550> them

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
we can try and you know not have them

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.370 
we can try and you know not have them
all<00:02:30.820> stacked<00:02:31.210> one<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.510> top<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.020> other<00:02:32.170> not

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
all stacked one on top of the other not

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.840 
all stacked one on top of the other not
that<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.530> mind<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.340> don't<00:02:33.400> mind<00:02:33.670> that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
that I mind like this I don't mind that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.040 
that I mind like this I don't mind that
I<00:02:33.880> would<00:02:34.090> build<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.330> cage<00:02:34.570> around<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.990> a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
I would build the cage around it a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I would build the cage around it a
little<00:02:35.140> bit<00:02:35.320> more<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.620> thought<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.860> can

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
little bit more if I thought I can

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.199 
little bit more if I thought I can
handle<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.370> weight<00:02:36.520> but<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.790> don't<00:02:36.970> think<00:02:37.150> I

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
handle the weight but I don't think I

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.470 
handle the weight but I don't think I
can<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.770> you'd<00:02:39.430> say<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.640> brought<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.270> for<00:02:40.420> a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
can so you'd say I brought it in for a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.230 
can so you'd say I brought it in for a
hard<00:02:40.630> landing<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:41.140> holding<00:02:41.500> down<00:02:41.620> shift<00:02:41.680> and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
hard landing just holding down shift and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.670 
hard landing just holding down shift and
it<00:02:43.240> bounced<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.020> kind<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> rolled<00:02:44.500> right

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
it bounced and it kind of rolled right

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.830 
it bounced and it kind of rolled right
over<00:02:44.740> back<00:02:45.310> right<00:02:45.820> side<00:02:46.000> up<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.240> that<00:02:46.570> was<00:02:46.660> kind

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
over back right side up so that was kind

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.800 
over back right side up so that was kind
of<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.990> good<00:02:47.110> thing<00:02:47.290> too<00:02:48.030> lots<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.120> smgs<00:02:49.690> you

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
of a good thing too lots of smgs you

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.690 
of a good thing too lots of smgs you
have<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.260> know<00:02:50.410> helicopter<00:02:51.130> gunships<00:02:51.520> that

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
have you know helicopter gunships that

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.640 
have you know helicopter gunships that
would<00:02:51.940> probably<00:02:52.120> work<00:02:52.390> people<00:02:53.320> are<00:02:53.380> gonna<00:02:53.440> be

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
would probably work people are gonna be

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.930 
would probably work people are gonna be
putting<00:02:53.830> plasma<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.310> these<00:02:54.459> things<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.790> got

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
putting plasma on these things you got
