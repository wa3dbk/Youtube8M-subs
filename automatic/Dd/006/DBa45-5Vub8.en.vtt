00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.170 
lights or anything straight into it just
dab<00:05:10.099> whatever<00:05:10.460> it<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.789> you're<00:05:10.880> trying<00:05:11.120> to

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
dab whatever it is that you're trying to

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.969 
dab whatever it is that you're trying to
attach<00:05:11.509> it<00:05:11.720> back<00:05:11.870> into<00:05:12.139> that<00:05:12.229> Grand<00:05:12.530> Canyon

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
attach it back into that Grand Canyon

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.469 
attach it back into that Grand Canyon
melt<00:05:13.159> and<00:05:13.310> just<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.729> guess<00:05:14.000> it'll<00:05:14.180> just<00:05:14.240> act

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
melt and just I guess it'll just act

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.659 
melt and just I guess it'll just act
like<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.659> little<00:05:14.960> bit<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.169> glue<00:05:15.409> so<00:05:15.680> we're<00:05:16.520> going
