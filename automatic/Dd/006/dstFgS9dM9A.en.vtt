video<00:00:15.010> we'll<00:00:15.160> be<00:00:15.190> covering<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.700> basics<00:00:16.059> of<00:00:16.240> it

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.359 
video we'll be covering the basics of it

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.700 
video we'll be covering the basics of it
and<00:00:16.539> what<00:00:16.689> I<00:00:16.720> think<00:00:17.019> most<00:00:17.230> people<00:00:17.589> would<00:00:17.619> be

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
and what I think most people would be

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.409 
and what I think most people would be
interested<00:00:17.830> in<00:00:18.460> when<00:00:18.699> first<00:00:19.000> using<00:00:19.240> the

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
interested in when first using the

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.800 
interested in when first using the
add-on<00:00:19.839> so<00:00:20.529> let's<00:00:20.710> get<00:00:20.859> started<00:00:21.509> if<00:00:22.509> you<00:00:22.660> don't

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
add-on so let's get started if you don't

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.329 
add-on so let's get started if you don't
know<00:00:22.929> what<00:00:23.079> power<00:00:23.320> or<00:00:23.589> is<00:00:23.740> is<00:00:23.919> it's<00:00:24.189> basically

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
know what power or is is it's basically

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.310 
know what power or is is it's basically
an<00:00:24.789> add-on<00:00:24.970> that<00:00:25.240> alerts<00:00:25.480> you<00:00:25.599> when<00:00:25.689> specific

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
an add-on that alerts you when specific

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.290 
an add-on that alerts you when specific
things<00:00:26.560> happen<00:00:26.949> through<00:00:27.550> visual<00:00:27.849> effects<00:00:28.119> and

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
things happen through visual effects and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.899 
things happen through visual effects and
audio<00:00:28.599> I<00:00:28.900> think<00:00:29.769> the<00:00:29.859> most<00:00:30.009> popular<00:00:30.579> way<00:00:30.730> that

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
audio I think the most popular way that

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.280 
audio I think the most popular way that
people<00:00:31.029> use<00:00:31.329> it<00:00:31.359> is<00:00:31.599> to<00:00:31.749> track<00:00:31.989> when<00:00:32.169> an

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
people use it is to track when an

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.470 
people use it is to track when an
ability<00:00:32.500> is<00:00:32.800> off<00:00:32.950> cooldown<00:00:33.220> so<00:00:34.090> let's<00:00:34.270> take<00:00:34.420> a

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
ability is off cooldown so let's take a

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.050 
ability is off cooldown so let's take a
look<00:00:34.660> at<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.870> first<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:36.250> open<00:00:36.370> up<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.730> config

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
look at that first to open up the config

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.960 
look at that first to open up the config
just<00:00:37.390> type<00:00:37.600> in<00:00:37.810> /<00:00:38.260> power<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.700> are<00:00:39.820> some

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
just type in / power here are some

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.670 
just type in / power here are some
examples<00:00:40.450> of<00:00:40.570> what<00:00:40.720> I<00:00:40.780> have<00:00:40.930> set<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.290> show<00:00:41.500> up

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
examples of what I have set to show up

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.700 
examples of what I have set to show up
when<00:00:42.310> an<00:00:42.400> ability<00:00:42.640> is<00:00:42.970> off<00:00:43.120> cooldown<00:00:43.710> these

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
when an ability is off cooldown these

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.890 
when an ability is off cooldown these
are<00:00:44.920> both<00:00:45.100> normal<00:00:45.700> rotational<00:00:46.330> spells<00:00:46.600> and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
are both normal rotational spells and

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.860 
are both normal rotational spells and
rating<00:00:47.680> cooldowns<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:49.360> have<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.540> little

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
rating cooldowns they have a little

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.090 
rating cooldowns they have a little
green<00:00:50.080> tint<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.440> them<00:00:50.560> representing

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
green tint to them representing

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.340 
green tint to them representing
transparency<00:00:51.850> but<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.570> goes<00:00:52.720> away<00:00:52.870> once<00:00:53.140> you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
transparency but that goes away once you

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.040 
transparency but that goes away once you
close<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.590> config<00:00:54.720> you'll<00:00:55.720> notice<00:00:56.020> that

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
close the config you'll notice that

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.410 
close the config you'll notice that
instead<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.590> using<00:00:56.770> custom<00:00:57.280> textures<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.970> have

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
instead of using custom textures I have

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.360 
instead of using custom textures I have
them<00:00:58.570> set<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.900> use<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.170> actual<00:00:59.320> spell<00:00:59.890> texture

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
them set to use the actual spell texture

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.730 
them set to use the actual spell texture
you<00:01:01.000> do<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.270> by<00:01:01.480> checking<00:01:01.690> off<00:01:02.050> use<00:01:02.500> own

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
you do this by checking off use own

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.999 
you do this by checking off use own
texture<00:01:03.689> now<00:01:04.689> sometimes<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.409> texture<00:01:05.799> won't

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
texture now sometimes the texture won't

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.800

show<00:01:06.159> up<00:01:06.310> right<00:01:06.490> away<00:01:06.609> if<00:01:06.909> that<00:01:07.149> happens<00:01:07.539> try

hit the plus and minus signs if you just

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.330 
hit the plus and minus signs if you just
want<00:01:28.179> to<00:01:28.240> give<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.569> small<00:01:28.840> nudge<00:01:29.139> or<00:01:29.380> type<00:01:30.130> in

exact<00:01:30.729> coordinates<00:01:31.770> below<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:32.950> you'll<00:01:33.189> see

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
exact coordinates below this you'll see

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.730 
exact coordinates below this you'll see
four<00:01:33.639> tabs<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.689> activation<00:01:35.229> tab<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.560> what

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
four tabs the activation tab is what

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.980 
four tabs the activation tab is what
triggers<00:01:36.069> your<00:01:36.249> parents<00:01:36.639> of<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.880> texture<00:01:37.359> to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
triggers your parents of the texture to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.690 
triggers your parents of the texture to
get<00:01:38.109> a<00:01:38.139> texture<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.710> show<00:01:38.859> up<00:01:39.039> when<00:01:39.249> an<00:01:39.399> ability

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
get a texture to show up when an ability

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.910 
get a texture to show up when an ability
is<00:01:39.999> off<00:01:40.179> cooldown<00:01:40.479> you'll<00:01:41.409> need<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.649> select

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
is off cooldown you'll need to select

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.139 
is off cooldown you'll need to select
spell<00:01:42.579> cool<00:01:42.880> down<00:01:43.060> under<00:01:43.719> activation<00:01:44.560> by<00:01:45.149> then

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
spell cool down under activation by then

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.849 
spell cool down under activation by then
just<00:01:46.479> type<00:01:46.689> in<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.049> ability<00:01:47.499> that<00:01:47.679> you're

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
just type in the ability that you're

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.459 
just type in the ability that you're
tracking<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:49.299> can<00:01:49.539> also<00:01:49.659> work<00:01:49.959> for<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.229> part
