rotator<00:00:18.230> cuff<00:00:18.500> tears<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:19.250> really<00:00:19.849> for<00:00:20.210> tendon

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
rotator cuff tears and really for tendon

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.159 
rotator cuff tears and really for tendon
applications<00:00:21.920> or<00:00:22.330> muscle<00:00:23.330> tears<00:00:25.869> so<00:00:26.869> what<00:00:27.050> is

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
applications or muscle tears so what is

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.820 
applications or muscle tears so what is
a<00:00:27.199> rotator<00:00:27.679> cuff<00:00:28.359> basically<00:00:29.359> it's<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.830> series

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
a rotator cuff basically it's a series

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.670 
a rotator cuff basically it's a series
of<00:00:30.859> muscles<00:00:31.429> around<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:32.509> shoulder<00:00:33.379> that<00:00:33.500> help

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
of muscles around the shoulder that help

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.459 
of muscles around the shoulder that help
to<00:00:33.829> stabilize<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:34.730> shoulder<00:00:35.180> if<00:00:35.719> you<00:00:36.110> think

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
to stabilize the shoulder if you think

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.220 
to stabilize the shoulder if you think
of<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.620> rotator<00:00:36.950> cuff<00:00:37.280> as<00:00:37.660> muscles<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:38.870> help

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
of a rotator cuff as muscles that help

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.889 
of a rotator cuff as muscles that help
to<00:00:39.440> keep<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.770> ball<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.640> socket<00:00:41.210> as<00:00:41.360> you

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
to keep the ball in the socket as you

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.930 
to keep the ball in the socket as you
lift<00:00:42.140> your<00:00:42.320> arm<00:00:42.530> or<00:00:42.890> do<00:00:43.039> things<00:00:43.309> with<00:00:43.520> your<00:00:43.670> arm

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
lift your arm or do things with your arm

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.760 
lift your arm or do things with your arm
it's<00:00:44.539> very<00:00:44.690> important<00:00:45.079> that<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.350> ball<00:00:45.500> on<00:00:45.649> the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
it's very important that the ball on the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.849 
it's very important that the ball on the
socket<00:00:46.660> remain<00:00:47.660> aligned<00:00:48.379> because<00:00:48.739> the

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
socket remain aligned because the

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.000 
socket remain aligned because the
shoulder<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.250> relatively<00:00:49.670> shallow<00:00:50.090> joint

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
shoulder is relatively shallow joint

rotator cuff muscles are the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.939 
rotator cuff muscles are the
supraspinatus<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.690> infraspinatus<00:00:53.949> the

teres<00:00:55.340> minor<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.239> subscapularis<00:01:00.250> what<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.370> a

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
teres minor and subscapularis what is a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.869 
teres minor and subscapularis what is a
partial<00:01:02.059> rotator<00:01:02.480> cuff<00:01:02.840> tear<00:01:03.230> well<00:01:04.100> the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
partial rotator cuff tear well the

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.850 
partial rotator cuff tear well the
rotator<00:01:05.239> cuff<00:01:05.479> muscle<00:01:05.869> that's<00:01:06.020> most<00:01:06.290> commonly

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
rotator cuff muscle that's most commonly

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.030 
rotator cuff muscle that's most commonly
talked<00:01:07.220> about<00:01:07.580> here<00:01:08.000> is<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.270> supraspinatus

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
talked about here is the supraspinatus

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.950 
talked about here is the supraspinatus
which<00:01:10.040> I've<00:01:10.220> drawn<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.820> here<00:01:11.180> is<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.509> rotator

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
which I've drawn in here is that rotator

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.190 
which I've drawn in here is that rotator
cuff<00:01:12.259> muscle<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:13.549> can<00:01:13.580> see<00:01:14.000> there<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.750> ball

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
cuff muscle you can see there the ball

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.170 
cuff muscle you can see there the ball
of<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.619> ball<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:16.009> socket<00:01:16.100> bone<00:01:16.759> that<00:01:17.060> I've

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
of the ball and socket bone that I've

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.359 
of the ball and socket bone that I've
drawn<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.259> rotator<00:01:18.680> cuff<00:01:18.710> muscle

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
drawn in and the rotator cuff muscle

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.330 
drawn in and the rotator cuff muscle
that<00:01:19.520> inserts<00:01:20.000> on<00:01:20.210> it<00:01:20.360> or<00:01:20.479> attaches<00:01:21.079> to<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.470> so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
that inserts on it or attaches to it so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.340 
that inserts on it or attaches to it so
a<00:01:22.369> partial<00:01:22.729> rotator<00:01:23.240> cuff<00:01:23.509> tear<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:23.930> nothing

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
a partial rotator cuff tear is nothing

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.789 
a partial rotator cuff tear is nothing
more<00:01:24.560> than<00:01:25.100> an<00:01:25.430> injury<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:26.560> causes<00:01:27.560> not<00:01:27.740> a

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
more than an injury that causes not a

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.530 
more than an injury that causes not a
through-and-through<00:01:28.220> tear<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.270> muscle

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
through-and-through tear of that muscle

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.039 
through-and-through tear of that muscle
but<00:01:30.380> just<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.799> gouge<00:01:31.280> out<00:01:31.700> of<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.000> or<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.149> tear<00:01:32.570> in

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
but just a gouge out of it or a tear in

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.889 
but just a gouge out of it or a tear in
it<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.829> usually<00:01:34.009> occurs<00:01:34.360> where<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.390> muscle

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
it it usually occurs where the muscle

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.429 
it it usually occurs where the muscle
meets<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.350> tendon<00:01:37.030> if<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.390> were<00:01:38.630> completely

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
meets the tendon if it were completely

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.120 
meets the tendon if it were completely
through<00:01:39.829> then<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.549> would<00:01:40.729> be<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.680> full<00:01:42.680> rotator

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
through then it would be a full rotator

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.920 
through then it would be a full rotator
cuff<00:01:43.399> tear<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:43.820> I've<00:01:43.939> just<00:01:44.119> drawn<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:44.630> here<00:01:44.869> a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
cuff tear but I've just drawn in here a

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.100 
cuff tear but I've just drawn in here a
partial<00:01:45.710> tear<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.939> rotator<00:01:47.090> cuff<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:47.990> it's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
partial tear of the rotator cuff so it's

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.870 
partial tear of the rotator cuff so it's
not<00:01:48.259> through<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.680> through<00:01:48.920> but<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.700> through

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
not through and through but just through

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.210 
not through and through but just through
part<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:51.229> muscle<00:01:52.159> /<00:01:52.430> tendon

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.480 

rotator<00:01:57.220> cuff<00:01:57.520> tear<00:01:57.790> in<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.270> shoulder<00:01:58.980> as<00:01:59.980> an

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
rotator cuff tear in the shoulder as an

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.360 
rotator cuff tear in the shoulder as an
example<00:02:00.850> here<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:01.960> have<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.140> 30<00:02:02.620> year<00:02:02.950> old<00:02:03.100> white

particular<00:02:08.560> patient<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> chiropractor<00:02:10.179> so

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
particular patient is a chiropractor so

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.670 
particular patient is a chiropractor so
he's<00:02:10.540> very<00:02:10.690> active<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:11.320> his<00:02:11.410> upper

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
he's very active with his upper

this<00:02:14.920> was<00:02:15.100> really<00:02:15.340> giving<00:02:15.880> him<00:02:16.060> some<00:02:16.810> fits<00:02:17.050> and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
this was really giving him some fits and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.270 
this was really giving him some fits and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
only other option for this gentleman was

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.000 
only other option for this gentleman was
the<00:02:37.150> second<00:02:37.690> surgery<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.590> major

the second surgery with major
immobilization<00:02:39.940> required<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.600> know<00:02:40.720> if<00:02:40.840> you've

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
immobilization required I know if you've

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.530 
immobilization required I know if you've
ever<00:02:41.170> seen<00:02:41.640> patients<00:02:42.640> walking<00:02:42.820> around<00:02:43.270> with

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
ever seen patients walking around with

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.470 
ever seen patients walking around with
almost<00:02:43.750> like<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> pillow<00:02:44.380> underneath<00:02:44.800> their

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
almost like a pillow underneath their

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.090 
almost like a pillow underneath their
armpit<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.739> type<00:02:48.070> of

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
armpit but it's that type of

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.420 
armpit but it's that type of
immobilization<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.800> surgeons<00:02:50.800> do<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.160> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
immobilization and surgeons do that to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.479 
immobilization and surgeons do that to
shorten<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.959> rotator<00:02:53.410> cuff<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.890> take<00:02:54.160> some

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
shorten the rotator cuff and take some

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.360 
shorten the rotator cuff and take some
of<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.880> pressure<00:02:55.420> off<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.959> area<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:57.010> reason

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
of the pressure off the area the reason

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.530 
of the pressure off the area the reason
is<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.700> if<00:02:58.209> you're<00:02:58.360> going<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.630> put<00:03:00.540> sutures

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
is that if you're going to put sutures

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.210 
is that if you're going to put sutures
in<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> rotator<00:03:02.080> cuff<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.590> not<00:03:02.739> real<00:03:02.950> strong

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
in the rotator cuff it's not real strong

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.430 
in the rotator cuff it's not real strong
so<00:03:04.060> you've<00:03:04.209> got<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.480> completely<00:03:04.870> immobilize

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
so you've got to completely immobilize

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.880 
so you've got to completely immobilize
it<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.830> let<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.070> heal<00:03:07.019> obviously<00:03:08.019> for<00:03:08.260> this

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
it and let it heal obviously for this

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.740 
it and let it heal obviously for this
patient<00:03:09.310> as<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> chiropractor<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:10.209> was<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> big

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
patient as a chiropractor this was a big

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.100 
patient as a chiropractor this was a big
problem<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.910> what<00:03:13.030> we<00:03:13.120> did<00:03:13.239> instead<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.690> we

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
problem so what we did instead is we

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.110 
problem so what we did instead is we
isolated<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.890> stem<00:03:15.130> cells<00:03:15.430> we<00:03:15.730> culture

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
isolated the stem cells we culture

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.800 
isolated the stem cells we culture
expanded<00:03:16.720> those<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.290> injected<00:03:17.799> those<00:03:17.980> using

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
expanded those and injected those using

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.170 
expanded those and injected those using
what's<00:03:19.810> called<00:03:19.900> MRI<00:03:20.440> plant<00:03:20.860> fluoroscopy<00:03:21.310> into

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
what's called MRI plant fluoroscopy into

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.630 
what's called MRI plant fluoroscopy into
the<00:03:22.269> rotator<00:03:22.660> cuff<00:03:22.930> tear<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:24.070> what<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.340> means

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
the rotator cuff tear so what that means

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.820 
the rotator cuff tear so what that means
is<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:25.180> looked<00:03:25.450> at<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.220> high<00:03:27.220> quality<00:03:28.830> MRI

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
is we looked at the high quality MRI

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.250 
is we looked at the high quality MRI
image<00:03:30.310> we<00:03:30.730> saw<00:03:30.940> exactly<00:03:31.330> where<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.780> tear<00:03:32.019> was

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
image we saw exactly where the tear was

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.110 
image we saw exactly where the tear was
and<00:03:32.709> then<00:03:32.830> we<00:03:32.920> used<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.250> image<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.700> plan

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
and then we used that image to plan

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.229 
and then we used that image to plan
exactly<00:03:34.360> where<00:03:34.989> we<00:03:35.140> would<00:03:35.290> place<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.890> cells

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
exactly where we would place the cells

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.840 
exactly where we would place the cells
via<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.390> needle<00:03:37.989> under<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.650> live<00:03:38.890> x-ray<00:03:41.850> no

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
via a needle under a live x-ray no

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.699 
via a needle under a live x-ray no
bracing<00:03:43.299> your<00:03:43.360> activity<00:03:43.810> restriction<00:03:44.350> was

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
bracing your activity restriction was

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.170 
bracing your activity restriction was
used<00:03:44.980> which<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.340> pretty<00:03:45.549> huge<00:03:45.850> for<00:03:45.910> this

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
used which is pretty huge for this

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.520 
used which is pretty huge for this
gentleman<00:03:46.510> because<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:47.110> meant<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.440> he

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
gentleman because that meant that he

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.570 
gentleman because that meant that he
didn't<00:03:47.920> have<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.190> stop<00:03:48.430> being<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.730> chiropractor

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.150 

so<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:55.670> see<00:03:55.910> here<00:03:56.420> these<00:03:57.320> images<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.070> they're

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
so you see here these images and they're

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.740 
so you see here these images and they're
not<00:03:58.280> real<00:03:58.730> easy<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.060> look<00:03:59.210> at<00:03:59.390> if<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.600> don't

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
not real easy to look at if you don't

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.930 
not real easy to look at if you don't
look<00:03:59.900> at<00:04:00.050> these<00:04:00.140> images<00:04:00.590> all<00:04:00.740> day<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.640> can<00:04:01.790> see

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
look at these images all day you can see

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.210 
look at these images all day you can see
the<00:04:02.030> one<00:04:02.180> on<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.360> Left<00:04:02.630> showing<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.860> humeral

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
the one on the Left showing the humeral

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.920 
the one on the Left showing the humeral
head<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.820> that's<00:04:04.970> nothing<00:04:05.270> more<00:04:05.570> than<00:04:05.630> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
head and that's nothing more than the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.590 
head and that's nothing more than the
ball<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.410> ball<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.740> socket<00:04:07.010> on<00:04:07.520> top<00:04:08.330> of

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
ball of the ball and socket on top of

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.390 
ball of the ball and socket on top of
that<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:09.110> where<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.410> rotator<00:04:09.770> cuff<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.280> and

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
that is where the rotator cuff is and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.220 
that is where the rotator cuff is and
you<00:04:10.460> can<00:04:10.610> see<00:04:10.790> there's<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.060> small<00:04:11.240> notch<00:04:11.720> there

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
you can see there's a small notch there

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.430 
you can see there's a small notch there
that's<00:04:13.070> taken<00:04:13.490> out<00:04:13.640> of<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:14.170> rotator<00:04:15.170> cuff

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
that's taken out of that rotator cuff

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.020 
that's taken out of that rotator cuff
muscle<00:04:15.830> as<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.040> comes<00:04:16.250> across<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.910> I've

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.990 
muscle as it comes across and I've
encircled<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.080> in<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.859> black<00:04:19.100> dashed<00:04:19.549> circle

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
encircled that in a black dashed circle

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.630 
encircled that in a black dashed circle
if<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.049> look<00:04:21.230> at<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> right<00:04:21.799> or<00:04:22.100> four<00:04:22.370> months
