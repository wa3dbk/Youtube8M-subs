00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
few years ago I was impressed with that

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.069 
few years ago I was impressed with that
and<00:00:36.309> this<00:00:36.730> sets<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.120> bar<00:00:37.329> at<00:00:37.510> a<00:00:37.600> whole<00:00:37.809> nother

and this sets the bar at a whole nother
level<00:00:38.350> I've<00:00:39.160> never<00:00:39.430> found<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.760> hearing<00:00:40.000> aid

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
level I've never found a hearing aid

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.180 
level I've never found a hearing aid
that<00:00:40.149> really<00:00:40.870> does<00:00:41.079> what<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.440> says<00:00:41.710> it<00:00:41.890> does<00:00:41.920> as

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
that really does what it says it does as

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.279 
that really does what it says it does as
far<00:00:42.219> as<00:00:42.489> noise<00:00:42.730> reduction<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.899> getting<00:00:44.140> rid

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
far as noise reduction and getting rid

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.500 
far as noise reduction and getting rid
of<00:00:44.320> background<00:00:44.920> sounds<00:00:45.370> this<00:00:45.850> actually<00:00:46.329> did<00:00:46.449> a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
of background sounds this actually did a

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.580 
of background sounds this actually did a
pretty<00:00:46.690> good<00:00:46.870> job<00:00:46.930> with<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.290> I<00:00:47.410> was

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
pretty good job with that I was

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.540 
pretty good job with that I was
impressed

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.210 

so<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.730> foundation<00:00:52.300> of<00:00:52.420> by<00:00:52.630> necks<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:53.200> our<00:00:53.560> ete

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
so the foundation of by necks is our ete

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.140 
so the foundation of by necks is our ete
wireless<00:00:54.940> 3.0<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:56.050> with<00:00:56.830> this<00:00:57.040> technology<00:00:57.460> we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
wireless 3.0 and with this technology we

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.080 
wireless 3.0 and with this technology we
are<00:00:58.510> able<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.200> not<00:00:59.470> only<00:00:59.530> transmit<00:01:00.400> data<00:01:00.640> but

are able to not only transmit data but
also<00:01:01.480> audio<00:01:01.840> signals<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.070> with<00:01:03.670> that<00:01:03.970> we<00:01:04.330> have

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
also audio signals and with that we have

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.840 
also audio signals and with that we have

microphone network so with by next we
have<00:01:12.340> three<00:01:12.610> pillars<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.210> we're

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
have three pillars that we're

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.620 
have three pillars that we're
introducing<00:01:13.960> by<00:01:14.619> next<00:01:14.979> sound<00:01:15.160> by<00:01:16.090> next<00:01:16.420> focus

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
introducing by next sound by next focus

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.590 
introducing by next sound by next focus
and<00:01:17.050> by<00:01:17.560> next<00:01:17.920> guide<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.520> within<00:01:19.150> each<00:01:19.570> of

and by next guide and within each of

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.540 
and by next guide and within each of
these<00:01:19.840> pillars<00:01:20.140> there<00:01:20.770> are<00:01:20.979> features<00:01:21.310> that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
these pillars there are features that

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.520 
these pillars there are features that
benefit<00:01:22.300> those<00:01:22.509> patients<00:01:23.140> in<00:01:23.259> those

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
benefit those patients in those

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.370 
benefit those patients in those
demanding<00:01:24.130> environments<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.060> allow<00:01:25.509> for<00:01:26.320> a

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
demanding environments and allow for a

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
demanding environments and allow for a
customized<00:01:27.250> fit<00:01:27.729> for<00:01:28.690> each<00:01:28.869> patient

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
customized fit for each patient

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.540 
customized fit for each patient
so<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:31.540> all<00:01:31.690> know<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.020> wind<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:33.190> very

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
so we all know that wind is very

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.510 
so we all know that wind is very
challenging<00:01:33.880> for<00:01:34.660> hearing<00:01:35.619> aid<00:01:35.770> wearers<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
challenging for hearing aid wearers and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.060 
challenging for hearing aid wearers and
what<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.360> wind<00:01:37.600> screen<00:01:37.720> binaural<00:01:38.320> allows<00:01:38.680> us<00:01:38.890> to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
what a wind screen binaural allows us to

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.749 
what a wind screen binaural allows us to
do<00:01:39.250> is<00:01:39.610> if<00:01:40.180> there<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.780> wind<00:01:41.440> coming<00:01:42.160> from<00:01:42.369> one

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
do is if there is wind coming from one

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.480 
do is if there is wind coming from one
side<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.479> head<00:01:43.720> more<00:01:44.140> than<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.440> other<00:01:44.649> we

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
side of a head more than the other we

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.639 
side of a head more than the other we
are<00:01:45.640> going<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.030> take<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.390> clean<00:01:46.780> signal<00:01:47.110> from

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
are going to take the clean signal from

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.920 
are going to take the clean signal from
the<00:01:47.830> opposite<00:01:48.280> ear<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.820> send<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.690> clean

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
the opposite ear and send the clean

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
the opposite ear and send the clean
signal<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.680> side<00:01:50.890> that's<00:01:51.039> being<00:01:51.280> affected

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
signal to the side that's being affected

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.060 
signal to the side that's being affected
by<00:01:52.060> wind<00:01:52.360> that's<00:01:53.289> going<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.560> be<00:01:53.680> a<00:01:53.710> very<00:01:53.920> nice

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
by wind that's going to be a very nice

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.440 
by wind that's going to be a very nice
feature<00:01:54.310> because<00:01:54.549> I<00:01:54.760> know<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.939> lot<00:01:55.119> of<00:01:55.150> people

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
feature because I know a lot of people

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.820 
feature because I know a lot of people
do<00:01:55.600> take<00:01:55.780> their<00:01:55.960> hearing<00:01:56.170> aids<00:01:56.320> out<00:01:56.439> just<00:01:56.740> to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
do take their hearing aids out just to

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.520 
do take their hearing aids out just to
go<00:01:56.950> for<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.189> walk<00:01:57.369> because<00:01:57.790> of<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:57.970> wind<00:01:58.530> with

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
go for a walk because of the wind with

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.250 
go for a walk because of the wind with
by<00:01:59.740> next<00:02:00.100> focus<00:02:00.369> we<00:02:01.090> have<00:02:01.119> two<00:02:01.600> new<00:02:02.020> features

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
by next focus we have two new features

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.440 
by next focus we have two new features
that<00:02:02.470> were<00:02:02.740> introducing<00:02:03.460> with<00:02:04.090> narrow

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
that were introducing with narrow

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.630 
that were introducing with narrow
directionality<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.799> is<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.159> feature<00:02:06.430> that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
directionality this is the feature that

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.850 
directionality this is the feature that
allows<00:02:07.360> us<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.689> have<00:02:07.810> better<00:02:08.259> than<00:02:08.530> normal

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
allows us to have better than normal

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
allows us to have better than normal

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
this feature is engaged and the way this

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.740 
this feature is engaged and the way this
feature<00:02:23.709> works<00:02:24.130> because<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.269> looking<00:02:25.570> for

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
feature works because it's looking for

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.140 
feature works because it's looking for

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the loudest speech source in that

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.479 
the loudest speech source in that
environment<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:30.010> patient<00:02:30.340> doesn't

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
environment so that the patient doesn't

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.160 
environment so that the patient doesn't
have<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.850> turn<00:02:31.030> their<00:02:31.269> head<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.720> try<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.959> look

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
have to turn their head and try to look

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.050 
have to turn their head and try to look
at<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> passenger<00:02:32.890> or<00:02:33.070> look<00:02:33.519> at<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.730> person

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
at the passenger or look at the person

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.050 
at the passenger or look at the person
behind<00:02:34.209> them<00:02:34.769> but<00:02:35.769> we<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.280> know<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.910> there

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
behind them but we do know that there

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.390 
behind them but we do know that there
are<00:02:37.180> situations<00:02:37.810> where<00:02:37.989> some<00:02:38.380> wearers<00:02:38.920> want<00:02:39.220> a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
are situations where some wearers want a

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.509 
are situations where some wearers want a
little<00:02:39.730> bit<00:02:39.880> more<00:02:40.180> control<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:41.950> example

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
little bit more control so for example

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.940 
little bit more control so for example
let's<00:02:42.880> say<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.360> patient<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.930> not<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.709> car

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
let's say the patient is not in the car

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.979 
let's say the patient is not in the car
but<00:02:45.430> they<00:02:45.459> would<00:02:45.940> want<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.360> focus<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
but they would want to focus on the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.479 
but they would want to focus on the
person<00:02:47.170> either<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.829> right<00:02:47.860> or<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.459> the

patient can control who they want to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.900 
patient can control who they want to

listen to in any environment so they can

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.820 
listen to in any environment so they can
