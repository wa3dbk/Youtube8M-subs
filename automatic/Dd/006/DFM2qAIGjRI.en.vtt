00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.999 
they've been actually used on so let's
put<00:04:33.759> it<00:04:33.819> to<00:04:33.940> cotton<00:04:34.379> it's<00:04:35.379> all<00:04:35.530> ready<00:04:35.710> to<00:04:35.770> go

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
put it to cotton it's all ready to go

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.059 
put it to cotton it's all ready to go
I'm<00:04:36.759> just<00:04:36.819> about<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.840> switch<00:04:38.020> on<00:04:38.349> on<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.949> old

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
I'm just about to switch on on the old

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.610 
I'm just about to switch on on the old
button<00:04:39.310> here<00:04:39.729> at<00:04:40.539> first<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.139> will<00:04:41.349> sound

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
button here at first it will sound

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.499 
button here at first it will sound
pretty<00:04:41.770> loud<00:04:42.250> because<00:04:42.550> obviously<00:04:42.819> that's<00:04:43.419> the

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
pretty loud because obviously that's the

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.659 
pretty loud because obviously that's the
water<00:04:43.780> pump<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.259> in<00:04:44.349> but<00:04:44.919> once<00:04:45.129> the<00:04:45.250> water<00:04:45.460> is

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
water pump it in but once the water is

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.420 
water pump it in but once the water is
pumped<00:04:45.909> in<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.569> just<00:04:46.930> goes<00:04:47.139> silent<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.250> let's

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
pumped in it just goes silent so let's

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:58.230 
pumped in it just goes silent so let's
switch<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.639> what<00:04:48.849> you<00:04:48.970> know

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.390 

so<00:04:58.780> yeah<00:04:59.229> putt<00:04:59.560> for<00:04:59.770> water<00:04:59.949> going<00:05:00.280> through

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
so yeah putt for water going through

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.760 
so yeah putt for water going through
once<00:05:00.850> that's<00:05:01.120> actually<00:05:01.360> pumped<00:05:01.900> through<00:05:02.199> it

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
once that's actually pumped through it

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:11.300 
once that's actually pumped through it
will<00:05:02.979> start<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.430> get<00:05:03.550> quiet<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:08.740> actually<00:05:09.280> get

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
will start to get quiet you actually get

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.850 
will start to get quiet you actually get
the<00:05:12.310> motor<00:05:12.520> itself<00:05:13.169> it's<00:05:14.169> actually<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.620> digital

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
the motor itself it's actually a digital

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.580 
the motor itself it's actually a digital
inverter<00:05:15.370> motor<00:05:15.880> which<00:05:16.690> uses<00:05:17.199> less<00:05:17.229> energy

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
inverter motor which uses less energy

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.309 
inverter motor which uses less energy
than<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.250> normal<00:05:18.699> motor<00:05:18.910> as<00:05:19.180> well<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.660> it

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
than a normal motor as well and it

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.129 
than a normal motor as well and it
doesn't<00:05:20.500> use<00:05:20.800> brushes<00:05:21.330> which<00:05:22.330> are<00:05:22.479> very<00:05:22.660> noisy

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
doesn't use brushes which are very noisy

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.790 
doesn't use brushes which are very noisy
and<00:05:23.380> expensive<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.520> place<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:26.080> replace<00:05:26.440> but

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
and expensive to place to replace but

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.339 
and expensive to place to replace but
this<00:05:27.610> one<00:05:27.849> here<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.419> runs<00:05:28.599> fine

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
this one here it runs fine

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.520 
this one here it runs fine
well<00:05:29.560> it<00:05:29.650> is<00:05:29.800> by<00:05:30.009> magnets<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:31.289> it's<00:05:32.289> it's

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
well it is by magnets and it's it's

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.150 
well it is by magnets and it's it's
extremely<00:05:32.800> silent<00:05:33.370> extremely<00:05:34.180> quiet<00:05:35.160> there

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
extremely silent extremely quiet there

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.189 
extremely silent extremely quiet there
you<00:05:36.250> go<00:05:36.370> it's<00:05:36.699> washing<00:05:37.210> now<00:05:37.389> when<00:05:37.840> you<00:05:37.960> can't
