wanting<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.890> leave<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.099> out<00:02:59.190> for<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.370> while

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
wanting to leave it out for a while

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.979 
wanting to leave it out for a while

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
don't just give it a chance to sink in

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.309 
don't just give it a chance to sink in
but<00:03:01.170> because<00:03:01.530> my<00:03:01.829> arm<00:03:02.659> stretches<00:03:03.659> are<00:03:03.840> fairly

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
but because my arm stretches are fairly

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
because stretching 20 edge was help it

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.140 
because stretching 20 edge was help it
really<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:31.799> i<00:03:32.069> had<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.340> use<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.730> had<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.030> like

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
use a taping method around a paper and

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.030 
use a taping method around a paper and
because<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.180> was<00:03:36.329> like<00:03:36.510> around<00:03:37.440> something

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
because it was like around something
