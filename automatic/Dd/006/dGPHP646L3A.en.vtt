00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
doesn't help before the part three was

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
very complicated a whole lotta enemies

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.750 
very complicated a whole lotta enemies
around<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.530> place<00:00:44.739> so<00:00:44.980> if<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.160> interactive

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
around the place so if you interactive

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.850 
around the place so if you interactive
alone<00:00:45.940> yet<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.239> battle<00:00:46.540> them<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.870> there<00:00:47.739> was

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
alone yet to battle them and there was

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.220 
alone yet to battle them and there was
more<00:00:48.250> seals<00:00:48.580> there<00:00:49.420> was<00:00:49.540> like<00:00:49.690> four<00:00:50.080> or<00:00:50.199> five

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
more seals there was like four or five

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.439 
more seals there was like four or five
seals<00:00:50.739> that<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.100> had<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.309> deal<00:00:51.460> with<00:00:51.699> but<00:00:52.210> now

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
seals that you had to deal with but now

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.389 
seals that you had to deal with but now
here<00:00:52.870> you<00:00:52.989> only<00:00:53.080> have<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.379> mess<00:00:53.530> with<00:00:53.650> four<00:00:54.040> and

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
here you only have to mess with four and

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.310 
here you only have to mess with four and
I<00:00:55.149> had<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.360> figure<00:00:55.510> out<00:00:55.630> how<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.899> thing<00:00:56.170> works

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
I had to figure out how the thing works

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.620 
I had to figure out how the thing works
so<00:00:56.590> you<00:00:56.649> start<00:00:56.980> from<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.250> top<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.390> figure

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
so you start from the top and you figure

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.840 
so you start from the top and you figure
this<00:00:58.750> out<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.110> trick<00:00:59.380> to<00:00:59.649> this<00:00:59.829> is<00:01:00.070> by<00:01:00.489> putting

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
this out the trick to this is by putting

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.720 
this out the trick to this is by putting
one<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.020> seals<00:01:02.260> on<00:01:02.469> one<00:01:02.739> part<00:01:03.040> of<00:01:03.219> the

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
one of the seals on one part of the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.880 
one of the seals on one part of the
circle<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.089> like<00:01:04.780> if<00:01:04.899> you<00:01:04.960> put<00:01:05.110> one<00:01:05.380> on<00:01:05.710> one

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
circle so like if you put one on one

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.230 
circle so like if you put one on one
side<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.610> other<00:01:06.670> one<00:01:06.790> on<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.030> other<00:01:07.119> side

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
side and the other one on the other side

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.960 
side and the other one on the other side
you<00:01:07.509> can<00:01:07.660> determine<00:01:07.930> if<00:01:08.229> there's<00:01:08.619> going<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.830> be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you can determine if there's going to be

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.510 
you can determine if there's going to be
a<00:01:10.050> correct<00:01:11.050> answer<00:01:11.259> anywhere<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.280> green

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
a correct answer anywhere the green

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.160 
a correct answer anywhere the green
determines<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.330> correct<00:01:13.600> answer<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.020> yellow

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
determines the correct answer the yellow

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.620 
determines the correct answer the yellow
says<00:01:14.410> correct<00:01:14.800> one<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.820> kind<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.000> mixes<00:01:16.360> it<00:01:16.509> up

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
says correct one it kind of mixes it up

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.999 
says correct one it kind of mixes it up
and<00:01:16.869> shows<00:01:17.470> how<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:20.140> which<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.619> right

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
and shows how like which one is right

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.740 
and shows how like which one is right
all<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.430> do<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.670> just<00:01:21.880> mix<00:01:22.149> up<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
all you do is just mix up the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.560 
all you do is just mix up the
combination<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:23.789> see<00:01:24.789> what<00:01:24.910> happens<00:01:25.210> since<00:01:25.420> D

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
combination and see what happens since D

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.389 
combination and see what happens since D
and<00:01:26.819> exam<00:01:27.819> itself<00:01:28.240> has<00:01:28.479> been<00:01:28.690> nerfed<00:01:29.399> hardly

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
and exam itself has been nerfed hardly

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.029 
and exam itself has been nerfed hardly
it's<00:01:30.610> kind<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.910> hard<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.720> not<00:01:32.259> get<00:01:32.679> this<00:01:32.800> right

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
it's kind of hard to not get this right

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.210 
it's kind of hard to not get this right
I<00:01:33.280> mean<00:01:33.959> it's<00:01:34.959> just<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.229> matter<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.530> how<00:01:35.830> you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
I mean it's just a matter of how you

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.830 
I mean it's just a matter of how you
combine<00:01:36.550> certain<00:01:37.209> elements<00:01:37.660> you're<00:01:37.750> not

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
combine certain elements you're not

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.389 
combine certain elements you're not
using<00:01:38.020> all<00:01:38.200> six<00:01:38.649> instead<00:01:39.009> you're<00:01:39.190> only<00:01:39.280> using

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
using all six instead you're only using

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.389 
using all six instead you're only using
four<00:01:39.729> or<00:01:39.880> five<00:01:40.060> three<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:41.110> don't<00:01:41.349> know<00:01:41.440> but<00:01:42.250> um

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
four or five three I don't know but um

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.790 
four or five three I don't know but um
so<00:01:43.209> yeah<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.599> like<00:01:43.690> right<00:01:43.869> now<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.349> two<00:01:44.649> is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
so yeah so like right now you see two is

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.830 
so yeah so like right now you see two is
correct<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.399> now<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:46.209> have<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.420> find<00:01:46.599> a<00:01:46.660> third

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
correct and now you have to find a third

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.930 
correct and now you have to find a third
one<00:01:47.110> mix<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.590> up<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:47.950> then<00:01:48.130> but<00:01:48.310> we<00:01:48.490> have<00:01:48.610> ten

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
one mix it up and then but we have ten

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.870 
one mix it up and then but we have ten
tries<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.690> it's<00:01:49.899> not<00:01:50.679> a<00:01:50.709> be<00:01:50.979> all<00:01:51.130> hard<00:01:51.520> like<00:01:51.759> it

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
