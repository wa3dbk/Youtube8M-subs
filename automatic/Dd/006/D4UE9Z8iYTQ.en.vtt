I try to tighten up on it but so for the
clean<00:01:05.990> tones<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.380> don't<00:01:06.500> know<00:01:06.590> what<00:01:06.740> I'm<00:01:06.830> doing

the<00:02:23.610> way<00:02:23.819> up<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.450> 12<00:02:24.930> dB<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.530> don't<00:02:25.770> know<00:02:25.830> if

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
the way up to what 12 dB I don't know if

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.940 
the way up to what 12 dB I don't know if
that's<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.340> bad<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:26.640> whatever<00:02:27.950> effects

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
that's good or bad or whatever effects

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.520 
that's good or bad or whatever effects
now<00:02:29.459> I'm<00:02:30.330> gonna<00:02:30.420> turn<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.660> up<00:02:30.900> I'm<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
now I'm gonna turn this up I'm on the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.970 
now I'm gonna turn this up I'm on the
front<00:02:31.800> pick<00:02:31.950> up<00:02:32.069> which<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.340> told<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
front pick up which I told you is the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.729 
front pick up which I told you is the
seymour<00:02:34.980> duncan<00:02:35.120> classic<00:02:36.120> stack<00:02:36.720> four<00:02:37.380> strap

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.650 
seymour duncan classic stack four strap
plus<00:02:38.099> whatever<00:02:38.519> don't<00:02:39.060> know<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.269> name<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.450> it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
plus whatever don't know the name of it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.650 
plus whatever don't know the name of it
exactly<00:02:39.989> but<00:02:40.830> if<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.010> listen<00:02:41.390> there's<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> bit

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
exactly but if you listen there's a bit

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.550 
exactly but if you listen there's a bit
of<00:02:42.780> noise<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.450> if<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.540> click<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> noise<00:02:46.230> I

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
of noise so if you click on the noise I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.440 
of noise so if you click on the noise I
do<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> noise<00:02:47.069> gate<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.489> absolutely

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
do have a noise gate on this absolutely

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.930 
do have a noise gate on this absolutely
so<00:02:49.410> clean<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.739> up<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.950> bit

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
so clean it up a bit

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.729 
so clean it up a bit

electronic<00:03:29.420> laws<00:03:31.060> start<00:03:32.060> bad

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.080

but you know my buddy used to call it

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.960 
but you know my buddy used to call it
glitz<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.810> glitz<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.350> effects<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.760> just

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
glitz and glitz is effects and it just

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.240 
glitz and glitz is effects and it just
sounds<00:03:42.300> cooler<00:03:42.540> with<00:03:42.840> effects<00:03:43.290> no<00:03:43.800> way<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.010> put

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
sounds cooler with effects no way to put

sounds cooler with effects no way to put
it<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.550> know<00:03:47.480> especially<00:03:48.480> for<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.350> a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
it you know especially for like a

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.700 
it you know especially for like a
ethereal<00:03:50.390> ethereal<00:03:51.390> keethy<00:03:52.020> roll<00:03:52.170> type<00:03:52.440> sound

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
ethereal ethereal keethy roll type sound

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.110 
ethereal ethereal keethy roll type sound
so<00:03:53.610> okay<00:03:54.030> we'll<00:03:54.360> start<00:03:54.570> with<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:55.790> Tri<00:03:56.790> chorus

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
so okay we'll start with the Tri chorus

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.940 
so okay we'll start with the Tri chorus
I'll<00:03:57.270> turn<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:57.660> I'll<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.170> first<00:03:58.890> now

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.559 

you

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.849 

hmm<00:04:08.109> so<00:04:08.829> tempo<00:04:09.340> sync<00:04:09.549> off<00:04:09.700> speed<00:04:10.629> of<00:04:10.989> the

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
hmm so tempo sync off speed of the

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.170 
hmm so tempo sync off speed of the
things<00:04:12.069> arrow<00:04:12.249> point<00:04:12.489> 3<00:04:12.700> HD<00:04:13.139> mix<00:04:14.139> 53%<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.310> look

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
things arrow point 3 HD mix 53% and look

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.090 
things arrow point 3 HD mix 53% and look
these<00:04:16.449> guys<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:16.780> have<00:04:17.350> at<00:04:17.500> about<00:04:17.680> 10<00:04:18.070> o'clock

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
these guys I have at about 10 o'clock

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.920 
these guys I have at about 10 o'clock
you<00:04:18.910> can<00:04:19.000> put<00:04:19.150> them<00:04:19.269> all<00:04:19.329> at<00:04:19.449> 10<00:04:19.570> o'clock<00:04:19.660> if

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
you can put them all at 10 o'clock if

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.260 
you can put them all at 10 o'clock if
you<00:04:20.019> like<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.470> that's<00:04:21.039> basically<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.699> so<00:04:21.880> off

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
you like and that's basically it so off

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:32.010 
you like and that's basically it so off
I<00:04:29.099> don't<00:04:30.099> like<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.400> way<00:04:30.970> shimmery<00:04:31.539> and<00:04:31.630> way<00:04:31.990> I

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
I don't like it way shimmery and way I

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.170 
I don't like it way shimmery and way I
like<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.860> be<00:04:32.889> subtle<00:04:33.280> I'd<00:04:33.610> like<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:34.030> think

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
like it to be subtle I'd like to think

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.070 
like it to be subtle I'd like to think
of<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:34.419> as<00:04:34.539> spice<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.229> top<00:04:35.259> of<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.820> or<00:04:36.900> icing<00:04:37.900> or

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
of it as spice on top of a or icing or

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.700 
of it as spice on top of a or icing or
whatever<00:04:38.560> like<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.490> light<00:04:40.380> sweetener<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.590> know

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
whatever like a light sweetener you know

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:51.350 
whatever like a light sweetener you know
what<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.830> mean

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.619 

and<00:04:51.689> we<00:04:51.870> had<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> reverb

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.240 

so<00:04:58.629> the<00:04:58.780> reverb<00:04:59.110> it's<00:04:59.319> cave<00:04:59.560> I'm<00:04:59.830> always<00:05:00.039> going

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
so the reverb it's cave I'm always going

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.570 
so the reverb it's cave I'm always going
to<00:05:00.340> use<00:05:00.490> cave<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.990> decays<00:05:02.349> at<00:05:02.560> 28%<00:05:02.919> like<00:05:03.430> to

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
to use cave the decays at 28% like to

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.999 
to use cave the decays at 28% like to
keep<00:05:03.699> them<00:05:03.879> low<00:05:04.319> pre-delay<00:05:05.319> don't<00:05:05.710> know<00:05:05.860> what

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
keep them low pre-delay don't know what

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.520 
keep them low pre-delay don't know what
that<00:05:06.159> means<00:05:06.370> so<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.639> just<00:05:06.849> turn<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.120> off<00:05:07.259> tone<00:05:08.259> I

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
that means so I just turn it off tone I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.510 
that means so I just turn it off tone I
leave<00:05:08.889> it<00:05:09.009> alone

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
leave it alone

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.869 
leave it alone
80%<00:05:09.849> sure<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.479> sounds<00:05:11.020> good<00:05:11.139> to<00:05:11.259> me<00:05:11.409> mix<00:05:11.949> 16%

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
80% sure it sounds good to me mix 16%

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.210 
80% sure it sounds good to me mix 16%
like<00:05:13.120> like<00:05:13.659> I<00:05:13.780> said<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.139> know<00:05:14.259> it's<00:05:14.440> its<00:05:14.770> icing

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
like like I said you know it's its icing

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.180 
like like I said you know it's its icing
it's<00:05:15.370> not<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:16.449> know<00:05:16.539> if<00:05:16.659> it's<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:17.190> full-on

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
it's not you know if it's to full-on

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.969 
it's not you know if it's to full-on
you're<00:05:19.030> going<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.210> drowned<00:05:19.860> you're<00:05:20.860> gonna

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
you're going to drowned you're gonna

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.890 
you're going to drowned you're gonna
you're<00:05:21.580> gonna<00:05:21.639> drown<00:05:21.940> your<00:05:22.150> sound<00:05:22.360> that's

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
you're gonna drown your sound that's

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.460 
you're gonna drown your sound that's
basically<00:05:23.289> it<00:05:23.530> so<00:05:24.300> without<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.569> reverb<00:05:25.960> which

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
basically it so without the reverb which

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:38.330 
basically it so without the reverb which
I<00:05:26.770> would<00:05:27.129> hate<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.460> play<00:05:27.639> through<00:05:30.840> with<00:05:31.840> reverb

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.100 

so<00:05:39.090> you<00:05:39.150> can<00:05:39.360> kind<00:05:39.540> of<00:05:39.570> tell<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:39.810> it's<00:05:40.050> there

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
so you can kind of tell that it's there

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.360 
so you can kind of tell that it's there
but<00:05:40.470> it's<00:05:40.530> not<00:05:40.710> I<00:05:40.950> don't<00:05:41.070> think<00:05:41.190> it's<00:05:41.280> over

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
but it's not I don't think it's over

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.570 
but it's not I don't think it's over
Barrett<00:05:45.410> okay<00:05:46.410> that<00:05:46.980> fades<00:05:47.190> out<00:05:47.310> kind<00:05:47.520> of

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
Barrett okay that fades out kind of

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.700 
Barrett okay that fades out kind of
nicely<00:05:47.760> I<00:05:48.090> could<00:05:48.990> probably<00:05:49.140> put<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.440> de<00:05:49.530> gate

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
nicely I could probably put the de gate

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.650 
nicely I could probably put the de gate
de<00:05:50.070> que<00:05:50.250> les<00:05:50.490> but<00:05:51.030> I'm<00:05:51.150> just<00:05:51.210> gonna<00:05:51.330> be<00:05:51.510> where

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
de que les but I'm just gonna be where

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.020 
de que les but I'm just gonna be where
it's<00:05:51.780> at<00:05:51.930> last<00:05:52.830> but<00:05:53.040> not<00:05:53.100> least<00:05:53.340> of<00:05:53.550> course<00:05:53.580> is

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
it's at last but not least of course is

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.860 
it's at last but not least of course is
my<00:05:54.420> rusty<00:05:54.870> trusty<00:05:55.200> friend<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.650> digital<00:05:55.950> leg

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
my rusty trusty friend the digital leg

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.600 
my rusty trusty friend the digital leg
and<00:05:57.870> that's<00:05:58.080> what<00:05:58.230> I<00:05:58.260> got<00:05:58.500> from<00:05:58.650> that<00:05:58.890> Halen

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
and that's what I got from that Halen

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.790 
and that's what I got from that Halen
and<00:05:59.760> Lynch<00:05:59.910> basically<00:06:00.420> and<00:06:00.630> it's<00:06:00.750> once<00:06:01.710> again

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
and Lynch basically and it's once again

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:14.120 
and Lynch basically and it's once again
a<00:06:02.180> subtle<00:06:03.180> ish<00:06:08.840> so<00:06:09.840> delay<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.980> time<00:06:11.220> for<00:06:13.130> 481

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
a subtle ish so delay the time for 481

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.240 
a subtle ish so delay the time for 481
milliseconds<00:06:14.790> 481<00:06:15.750> milliseconds<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.590> usually

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
milliseconds 481 milliseconds I usually

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.630 
milliseconds 481 milliseconds I usually
have<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:17.460> to<00:06:18.020> 504<00:06:19.020> digital<00:06:19.530> delays<00:06:19.830> but<00:06:20.370> this

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
have it to 504 digital delays but this

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.350 
have it to 504 digital delays but this
one<00:06:20.790> sounds<00:06:20.910> alright

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
one sounds alright

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:33.080 
one sounds alright
at<00:06:21.420> this<00:06:21.690> speed<00:06:30.890> feedback<00:06:31.890> 13%<00:06:32.880> it's

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
at this speed feedback 13% it's

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.690 
at this speed feedback 13% it's
basically<00:06:33.420> you<00:06:33.570> want<00:06:33.780> like<00:06:33.930> the<00:06:34.020> initial<00:06:34.440> note

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
basically you want like the initial note

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.810 
basically you want like the initial note
and<00:06:35.750> then<00:06:36.750> no<00:06:37.080> more<00:06:37.290> than<00:06:37.470> that<00:06:37.650> like<00:06:37.860> the

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.610 

after<00:06:41.820> three<00:06:42.030> it<00:06:42.150> kind<00:06:42.330> of<00:06:42.360> goes<00:06:43.070> three<00:06:44.070> or<00:06:44.480> two

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
after three it kind of goes three or two

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.080 
after three it kind of goes three or two
one<00:06:46.620> two<00:06:47.100> yeah

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
one two yeah

basic treble middles fine look the mix

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.750 
basic treble middles fine look the mix
is<00:06:51.060> always<00:06:51.270> going<00:06:51.390> to<00:06:51.420> be<00:06:51.510> cheese<00:06:52.230> I<00:06:52.760> don't

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
is always going to be cheese I don't

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.980 
is always going to be cheese I don't
want<00:06:53.880> to<00:06:53.940> touch<00:06:54.120> the<00:06:54.300> mix<00:06:54.480> we're<00:06:54.660> gonna<00:06:54.750> find

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
want to touch the mix we're gonna find

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.720 
want to touch the mix we're gonna find
out<00:06:55.050> what<00:06:55.140> it's<00:06:55.260> have<00:06:55.440> 24<00:06:55.830> percent<00:06:56.220> is<00:06:56.490> what<00:06:56.640> it

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
out what it's have 24 percent is what it

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.320 
out what it's have 24 percent is what it
says<00:06:56.910> here

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
says here

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.860 
says here
when<00:06:57.900> did<00:06:58.020> you<00:06:58.110> save<00:06:58.440> that<00:06:58.740> all<00:06:58.890> again<00:06:59.870> 24

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
when did you save that all again 24

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.680 
when did you save that all again 24
percent<00:07:01.410> and<00:07:02.160> that's<00:07:02.340> basically<00:07:02.820> it<00:07:03.060> so<00:07:03.240> I'll

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
percent and that's basically it so I'll

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.680 
percent and that's basically it so I'll
turn<00:07:03.840> everything<00:07:04.260> off<00:07:05.270> here<00:07:06.270> that<00:07:06.480> that's

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
turn everything off here that that's

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.830 
turn everything off here that that's
kind<00:07:07.380> of<00:07:07.440> hideous<00:07:07.560> okay<00:07:08.550> I'll<00:07:08.820> play<00:07:09.510> the<00:07:09.630> same

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:38.940 

let's<00:07:19.900> turn<00:07:20.020> everything<00:07:20.260> on

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.570 

and<00:07:39.850> that<00:07:40.210> is<00:07:40.360> my<00:07:40.600> you<00:07:41.230> know<00:07:41.350> clean<00:07:42.280> sound

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
and that is my you know clean sound

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:52.520 
and that is my you know clean sound
