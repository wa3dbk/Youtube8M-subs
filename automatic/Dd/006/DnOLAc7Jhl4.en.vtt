00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the grout line and you can see in a few

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.000 
the grout line and you can see in a few
seconds<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:09.360> we're<00:03:10.170> not<00:03:10.260> seeing<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.709> as<00:03:10.830> easy

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
seconds here we're not seeing it as easy

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.199 
seconds here we're not seeing it as easy
as<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.310> normally<00:03:11.430> would<00:03:11.670> because<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
as you normally would because this is a

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.360 
as you normally would because this is a
black<00:03:12.420> route<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.440> let<00:03:13.590> me<00:03:13.680> zoom<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.280> you

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
black route but let me zoom in so you

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.979 
black route but let me zoom in so you
can<00:03:14.550> actually<00:03:14.760> see<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.450> little<00:03:15.750> bit<00:03:15.900> of

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
can actually see that little bit of

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.360 
can actually see that little bit of
agitation<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.680> little<00:03:16.860> bit<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.070> extra

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
agitation a little bit of that extra

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.220 
agitation a little bit of that extra
chemical<00:03:17.850> how<00:03:18.420> much<00:03:18.630> dirt<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.019> actually

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
chemical how much dirt is actually

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.670 
chemical how much dirt is actually
coming<00:03:19.799> at<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.160> grout<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:22.080> concealed

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
coming at that grout it's concealed

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.509 
coming at that grout it's concealed
because<00:03:23.160> it's<00:03:23.310> black<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:25.190> little<00:03:26.190> bit<00:03:26.310> more

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
because it's black a little bit more

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.250 
because it's black a little bit more
here<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.390> can<00:03:27.540> see<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> start<00:03:28.080> come<00:03:28.350> up

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
