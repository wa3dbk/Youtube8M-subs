people I can invite will be completely

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.639 
people I can invite will be completely
random<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.170> through<00:01:55.200> all

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
random so just you know go through all

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.230 
random so just you know go through all
of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> comments<00:01:56.009> pick<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.610> random<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of the comments pick one at random and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
of the comments pick one at random and
someone<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.899> whitelisted<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> yeah

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
someone will get whitelisted so yeah

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.990 
someone will get whitelisted so yeah
it's<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.329> very<00:02:01.340> experimental<00:02:02.340> idea<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.850> don't

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it's a very experimental idea I don't

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.429 
it's a very experimental idea I don't
think<00:02:03.149> anyone's<00:02:03.420> done<00:02:03.659> saying<00:02:03.930> quite<00:02:04.229> like

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
think anyone's done saying quite like

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
think anyone's done saying quite like
this<00:02:04.560> before<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.310> probably<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:05.969> going

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
this before so it's probably not going

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
this before so it's probably not going
to<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.299> down<00:02:06.329> without<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.320> few<00:02:07.590> hiccups<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
to go down without a few hiccups but the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.460
