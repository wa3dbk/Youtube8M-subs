00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello and welcome back to the minute sense 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 from today you can find the review 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.010
 minutes also on the portal play today ha 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.410
 decided they were pretty interesting 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.570
 and to appear the articles the portal is 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.280
 in the round on the world of games and da 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.289
 today and even small ones are added 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
 reviews you are seeing 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 but let's get to the game of today the game is 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.859
 absolutely life as the mocha had 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.619
 indeed perhaps it should be in the mouth for 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.630
 be more dedicated to how maybe more 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.880
 astute they will have no insight 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.920
 nothing but referring to the neighborhood 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320
 founded by the Genoese since 800 of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.360
 buenos aires della boc has characterized 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.219
 precisely from super colored constructions 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.860
 which turned into a game thanks 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.230
 to inca and marcus brand in this game from 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 three to six players lasting 40 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.120
 minutes brought to Italy by stereo and that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.129
 the municipalities but in a world of construction 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.910
 variable pairs 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:59.579
 let's go see the killings but that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 slams the selene instructions too long 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.489
 to spend with the reviews is enough for you 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.260
 look for a few minutes and not emerge a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 game start to each player comes 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.130
 assigned a color and are given 5 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 tiles of other players' colors 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.299
 and this and will simply serve for 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 make pairs shifts in this case the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.840
 red will play the game with blue 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.119
 ends when everyone has played two 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.400
 times with all other players like 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.020
 one of these works 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 cards this is the mission deck 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 easy this is the emission master 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.960
 difficult and is placed on the board 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 as soon as the paper touches the ground it is done 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
 starting a timer already included in the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.310
 box at this point each player 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.900
 will have to present the neighborhood 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.270
 exactly as shown by this 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.399
 we then see the orthogonal projection 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.829
 solution of the example and shown vi 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.770
 point out that all the pieces must 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.470
 must use them and in 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.480
 reality 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.010
 allowed to have holes below so if 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.920
 the green in perspective was behind 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.110
 this would not be accepted 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.850
 player would seem to be okay and 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.730
 so he would like to finish the round but 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.650
 be careful because on the other side the 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.600
 vision is of a completely different kind 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.490
 a solution will have to be studied then 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.890
 brown is therefore of no use to anyone 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.240
 let's put it behind grigionera they come 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.030
 put on 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.520
 the blue here now in this case you see 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.980
 that there is low interaction everyone does 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.990
 almost his vegetable garden but I assure you 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.580
 which above all is the difficult mode 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.530
 in which this piece also enters the scene 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.180
 you will have to agree in a way to 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.190
 say let me support this no aspects 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.500
 I have to see only two in this case 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.780
 however we have finished stop the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 timers and steps 1 to 15 are taken 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.370
 second the points will be 20 and you go to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.990
 go down until you get one on 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.930
 2 minutes threshold over two minutes 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.660
 points are 0 and obviously who wins 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.850
 It does more to end game that's all the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.590
 very simple regulation the fact that 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.570
 let these be the beautiful pieces of wood 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.850
 all colored and supported 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.739
 to compose a city in crisis on 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.269
 box will definitely hold 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.550
 the attention of the whole room on the game 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.290
 of the mouth contrary to what 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.519
 you can still think of the game 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.940
 despite being supported by this 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.290
 very bad tyler is not frantic indeed 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.970
 it's a game you have to play 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.739
 reflections and talk to yours 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.930
 mate try to do it the way 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.330
 more correct because everyone's use 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.250
 the pieces will take you to have the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.900
 ready solution but still usually 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.239
 these two pieces you don't know how 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.350
 thread to hide them from the eyes 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.940
 other 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.830
 this is a positive note in my opinion 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.630
 because if it was hectic and then 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.549
 they are dexterity and speed would have 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.380
 could scare and then move away 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.390
 someone like this you can do 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.459
 play by children end up for seniors 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.440
 it's a nice game that also brings together 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.270
 the whole family 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.310
 and that can be played throughout 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.990
 the evening for this my opinion that 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.330
 it can also be expanded to two players 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.770
 simply if you want to challenge yourself 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.080
 see if in pairs and managed to do 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.610
 so many cards up to no players 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.350
 left on the table during the evening 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.050
 someone puts the card in a row e 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.060
 try a challenge with a friend 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.450
 last positive note of boca e 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.650
 the engineering of the box from 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.420
 built let's face you game there 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.370
 are the spaces to turn on a timer 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.500
 victory points etc. but under a 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.840
 this is also a practical space for 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.610
 insert the cards the cubes in short 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.100
 the statue of evil ordered and you will not have to 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.500
 look for the pieces around all over 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.760
 box with this I tell you that the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.280
 mouth and I think it is the example 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.200
 of a game to be together is not 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.390
 necessarily a game that counts 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.430
 really who wins does not win but really 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.530
 one spends the evening or a relax 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.020
 together also take a little ride and 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.510
 spend in 40 minutes or maybe even 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.340
 an hour pleasantly along with this 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.190
 point I definitely recommend the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.190
 game and I say hello and the next
