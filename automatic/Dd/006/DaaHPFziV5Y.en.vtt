00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
the quick comparison between the two

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.240 
the quick comparison between the two
alright<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> first<00:01:04.710> thing<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> notice

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
alright the first thing you notice

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.570 
alright the first thing you notice
obviously<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> size<00:01:06.630> difference

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
obviously is the size difference

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
obviously the old cave was bigger and it

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
obviously the old cave was bigger and it
had<00:01:11.159> three<00:01:11.340> sections<00:01:11.850> instead<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> two<00:01:12.570> like
