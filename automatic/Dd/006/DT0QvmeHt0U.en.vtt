00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
for that I to be there and then of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.700 
for that I to be there and then of
course<00:00:36.809> we're<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> remove<00:00:37.530> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
course we're going to remove this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.940 
course we're going to remove this
wireless<00:00:38.250> network<00:00:38.780> available<00:00:39.780> crap<00:00:40.649> that's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
wireless network available crap that's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.590 
wireless network available crap that's
there's<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.520> taking<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.850> space<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.450> it's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
there's just taking up space and it's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.470 
there's just taking up space and it's
useless<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.710> most<00:00:43.920> people<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> want

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
useless for most people so what you want

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
useless for most people so what you want
to<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.870> download<00:00:46.280> one<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> those<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:48.500> files

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to do is download one of those two files

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
to do is download one of those two files
and<00:00:49.980> we'll<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.399> ahead<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:53.120> boot<00:00:54.120> into

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and we'll go ahead and boot into

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.650 
and we'll go ahead and boot into
recovery<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> will<00:00:56.910> need<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.210> rooted

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
recovery so you will need to be rooted

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.290 
recovery so you will need to be rooted
and<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.219> custom<00:00:59.879> recovery

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and you will need a custom recovery

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.889 
and you will need a custom recovery
installed<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:02.969> course<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.359> find<00:01:03.539> each<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
installed of course you can find each of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.630 
installed of course you can find each of
those<00:01:04.049> methods<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.589> droid<00:01:04.830> forms<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.400> well

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.010 

so<00:01:08.640> once<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> device<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> powered<00:01:09.510> off<00:01:09.780> we're

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
so once the device is powered off we're

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920 
so once the device is powered off we're
going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> hold<00:01:10.350> volume<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:11.180> home<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.540> we're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
going to hold volume up home and we're

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
going to hold volume up home and we're
going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.080> press<00:01:13.260> power<00:01:13.850> until<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.970> fill<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
going to press power until we fill it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
going to press power until we fill it
Rumble<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.689> then<00:01:15.810> release<00:01:16.170> power<00:01:16.790> now<00:01:17.790> we

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
Rumble and then release power now we

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.539 
Rumble and then release power now we
should<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.210> able<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> boot<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:18.810> recovery<00:01:19.549> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
should be able to boot into recovery and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.130 
should be able to boot into recovery and
we're<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.060> flash<00:01:21.390> either<00:01:21.930> of
