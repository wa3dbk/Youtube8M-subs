machine<00:00:34.950> gun<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> recommend<00:00:36.329> using<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
machine gun so I recommend using that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.540 
machine gun so I recommend using that
that<00:00:37.140> way<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> fusion<00:00:38.010> cannon

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
that way you can have the fusion cannon

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.340 
that way you can have the fusion cannon
for<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:38.879> primary<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.170> saw

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
for your primary which was what you saw

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
for your primary which was what you saw
me<00:00:40.500> use<00:00:40.649> there<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.489> good<00:00:41.700> gun<00:00:41.910> because

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
me use there that's a good gun because

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
me use there that's a good gun because
the<00:00:42.270> splash<00:00:42.570> radius<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:43.170> hurt<00:00:43.379> people<00:00:43.590> even

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the splash radius will hurt people even

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.619 
the splash radius will hurt people even
if<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.820> hit<00:00:44.969> them<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.390> hit<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
if you don't hit them if you hit the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.150 
if you don't hit them if you hit the
ground<00:00:45.899> around<00:00:46.170> them<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.530> will<00:00:46.620> hurt<00:00:46.860> them<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
ground around them it will hurt them and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
ground around them it will hurt them and
then<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.450> heavy<00:00:48.629> machine<00:00:49.110> gun

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
then you can have the heavy machine gun

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
then you can have the heavy machine gun
as<00:00:49.469> well<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.399> overall<00:00:50.879> favorite<00:00:51.059> gun
