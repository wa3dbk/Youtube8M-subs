the science level that goes on here I

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.140 
the science level that goes on here I
mean<00:00:17.830> they<00:00:17.920> see<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.190> games<00:00:18.400> and<00:00:18.760> the<00:00:18.850> sports

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
and the stuff but to see the high level

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.390 
and the stuff but to see the high level
of<00:00:22.029> science<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:23.800> would<00:00:23.920> understand<00:00:24.310> the

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
rest which they probably would be

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.850 
rest which they probably would be

you can do these are your days these are
your<00:01:17.330> time<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.750> they<00:01:17.810> say<00:01:17.930> well<00:01:18.200> it's<00:01:18.380> their

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
bad times I should know is this your

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.810 
bad times I should know is this your
time<00:01:20.630> it's<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:20.990> only<00:01:21.140> time<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.560> got<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:22.760> know

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
time it's the only time you got you know

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.749 
time it's the only time you got you know
you<00:01:23.119> don't<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.420> any<00:01:23.570> other<00:01:23.720> time<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.759> year

you don't have any other time a year
from<00:01:25.850> now<00:01:25.940> you're<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.180> year<00:01:26.360> older<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.930> you

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
from now you're a year older you you

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.260 
from now you're a year older you you
can't<00:01:27.560> make<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:27.950> up<00:01:28.009> again<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:28.880> don't

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
can't make that up again and and don't

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.670 
can't make that up again and and don't
sit<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.660> tell<00:01:29.840> me<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.020> bad<00:01:30.170> times<00:01:30.470> and

sit and tell me it's bad times and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.840 
sit and tell me it's bad times and
therefore<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:31.100> can't<00:01:31.280> get<00:01:31.399> each<00:01:31.490> other<00:01:31.700> and

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
therefore you can't get each other and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.060 
therefore you can't get each other and
go<00:01:31.940> find<00:01:32.210> one<00:01:32.420> go<00:01:32.960> start<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.290> company<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.920> know

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
go find one go start a company you know

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.100 
go find one go start a company you know
there<00:01:34.430> are<00:01:34.640> jobs<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.300> they<00:01:35.420> don't<00:01:35.660> match<00:01:35.869> up

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
there are jobs so they don't match up

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.260 
there are jobs so they don't match up
with<00:01:36.200> what<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.500> had<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:36.800> mind<00:01:37.040> but<00:01:37.160> it's<00:01:37.850> work
