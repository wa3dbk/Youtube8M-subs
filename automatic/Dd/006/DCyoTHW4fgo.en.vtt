good<00:00:11.490> Val<00:00:11.670> kryn<00:00:12.380> after<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> rework<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.130> was<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
good Val kryn after the rework I was a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.799 
good Val kryn after the rework I was a
little<00:00:15.000> bit<00:00:15.120> skeptical<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.630> goddesses

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
little bit skeptical and goddesses

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.779 
little bit skeptical and goddesses
positioning<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.770> thought<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.490> sure<00:00:17.520> he

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
positioning I thought for sure he

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.220 
positioning I thought for sure he
wouldn't<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> good<00:00:18.240> mid<00:00:18.449> laner<00:00:18.630> anymore<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
wouldn't be a good mid laner anymore and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.370 
wouldn't be a good mid laner anymore and
maybe<00:00:19.890> his<00:00:20.130> position<00:00:20.430> would<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.910> top<00:00:21.210> lane<00:00:21.480> but

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
maybe his position would be top lane but

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.410 
maybe his position would be top lane but
after<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.920> dabbling<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.640> after<00:00:24.029> some<00:00:24.180> tests

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420

body slam is a gap closed displacement

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.630 
body slam is a gap closed displacement
and<00:03:08.370> stun<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.230> 1.1<00:03:10.830> durability<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.459> patch

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and stun it's a 1.1 durability in patch

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.390
