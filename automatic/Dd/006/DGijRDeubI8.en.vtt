00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.139 
become very different to be affordable
so<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.680> our<00:01:52.920> aim<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> markets

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so this is our aim in all the markets

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.280 
so this is our aim in all the markets
and<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.799> how<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.290> best

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.940 
and we have to know how we have the best
suppliers<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.159> terms<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.670> logistics<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.950> we

works<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.630> direction<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.649> it's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
works in and in this direction but it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
works in and in this direction but it's
something<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.849> are<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:10.020> always

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
something that we are we are always

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
something that we are we are always
