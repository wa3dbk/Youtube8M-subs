than the first music how did sexy creep

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.309 
than the first music how did sexy creep
into<00:00:04.520> Arctic<00:00:05.520> Monkeys<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:06.690> mean<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.109> always

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
into Arctic Monkeys I mean I always

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.620 
into Arctic Monkeys I mean I always
thought<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:07.859> were<00:00:07.980> pretty<00:00:08.250> sexy<00:00:08.849> like<00:00:09.120> we

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
thought we were pretty sexy like we

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.799 
thought we were pretty sexy like we
stopped<00:00:09.929> hiding<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.519> we<00:00:11.519> allowed<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.000> come

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
stopped hiding it we allowed it to come

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.890 
stopped hiding it we allowed it to come
out<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.259> think<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.519> crept<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.030> sexy<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.599> think

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
out I think we crept in sexy I think

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.470 
out I think we crept in sexy I think
rather<00:00:16.139> than<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:17.340> could<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.730> creeping<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.330> us

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
rather than it could be creeping in us

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.170 
rather than it could be creeping in us
yeah<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> thought<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.220> always<00:00:20.430> there<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.970> be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
yeah I thought it was always there to be

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
yeah I thought it was always there to be
honest<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> mean<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> guess<00:00:22.859> yeah<00:00:23.130> you

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
honest but I mean but I guess yeah you

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.670 
honest but I mean but I guess yeah you
know<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> rhythms<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.420> guess<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.410> makes

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
know the rhythms and I guess that makes

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.859 
know the rhythms and I guess that makes
you<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:27.060> maybe<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> move<00:00:27.720> around

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you you maybe want to move around

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.349 
you you maybe want to move around
differently<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.920> record<00:00:29.250> than<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.760> did

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
differently to this record than you did

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.700 
differently to this record than you did
that<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:31.380> wasn't<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.840> we<00:00:33.840> were<00:00:33.960> thinking<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that it wasn't like we were thinking of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.510 
that it wasn't like we were thinking of
a<00:00:34.800> way<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:36.649> slippery<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
a way to make it more slippery so you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.500 
a way to make it more slippery so you
didn't<00:00:38.879> make<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> ladies<00:00:41.000> now<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.329> my

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
didn't make one for the ladies now in my

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.779 
didn't make one for the ladies now in my
mind<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.290> you've<00:00:43.559> been<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.430> sort<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
mind it was that you've been you sort of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.729 
mind it was that you've been you sort of
to<00:00:45.360> some<00:00:45.600> extent<00:00:46.020> you've<00:00:46.140> been<00:00:46.260> trying<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.590> do

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to some extent you've been trying to do

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.670 
to some extent you've been trying to do
that<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:47.190> along<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:48.140> we've<00:00:49.140> never<00:00:49.350> tried

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
that all along I think we've never tried

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.279 
that all along I think we've never tried
to<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:50.039> music<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.239> boys<00:00:51.360> but

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
to make music that was just for boys but

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.020 
to make music that was just for boys but
yeah<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> mean<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> see<00:00:53.280> why<00:00:53.430> you're<00:00:53.640> asking

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
yeah I mean I can see why you're asking

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
yeah I mean I can see why you're asking
that<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.539> there's<00:00:54.989> certainly<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.850> more

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that because there's certainly a more

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.529 
that because there's certainly a more
explosive<00:00:57.420> response<00:00:58.289> from<00:00:59.160> females<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.390> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
explosive response from females to this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.399 
explosive response from females to this
latest<00:01:01.820> offering<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.210> mean<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.780> suppose<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.229> used

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
latest offering I mean I suppose we used

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.140 
latest offering I mean I suppose we used
to<00:01:04.559> play<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> bit<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.519> wanted<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> be

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to play a bit like we wanted it to be

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.969 
to play a bit like we wanted it to be
over<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.830> don't<00:01:08.220> mind<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> sort<00:01:09.840> of

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
over and now we don't mind if it sort of

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
over and now we don't mind if it sort of
goes<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> while<00:01:11.990> everything<00:01:12.990> used<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
goes on for a while everything used to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.740 
goes on for a while everything used to
be<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.770> tightly<00:01:14.369> wound<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> beginning<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
be so tightly wound in the beginning and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.530 
be so tightly wound in the beginning and
I<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.299> every

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I think that's just because it was every

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
I think that's just because it was every
you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:21.170> naivety<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.500> fact<00:01:22.950> we

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you know that naivety and the fact we

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
you know that naivety and the fact we
were<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.850> playing<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:24.840> limits

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
were kind of playing to the very limits

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.580 
were kind of playing to the very limits
of<00:01:25.560> our<00:01:25.740> ability<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.840> as<00:01:27.840> times<00:01:28.200> gone<00:01:28.530> on

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of our ability and as times gone on

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.499 
of our ability and as times gone on
we've<00:01:28.979> become<00:01:30.140> marginally<00:01:31.140> marginally<00:01:32.009> more

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
we've become marginally marginally more

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.420 
we've become marginally marginally more
accomplished<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.780> musicians<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.340> know

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
accomplished as musicians this you know

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.050 
accomplished as musicians this you know
this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.030> space<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> that

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
this is space in it that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.319 
this is space in it that
we<00:01:39.060> would<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> past<00:01:40.110> filled<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.329> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
we would have in the past filled in is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.859 
we would have in the past filled in is
it<00:01:42.509> also<00:01:42.799> sunny<00:01:43.799> la<00:01:44.159> creeping<00:01:45.030> into<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.390> music

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
it also sunny la creeping into the music

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.889 
it also sunny la creeping into the music
instead<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.320> rainy<00:01:46.649> Sheffield<00:01:47.659> being<00:01:48.659> there

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
instead of rainy Sheffield being there

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.649 
instead of rainy Sheffield being there
and<00:01:49.229> spending<00:01:49.590> time<00:01:49.830> in<00:01:50.250> Los<00:01:50.759> Angeles<00:01:51.000> may

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and spending time in Los Angeles may

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.760 
and spending time in Los Angeles may
have<00:01:53.390> probably<00:01:54.390> did<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.780> some<00:01:55.080> influence<00:01:55.380> on

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
have probably did have some influence on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.580 
have probably did have some influence on
it<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.070> I'm<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.390> exactly<00:01:57.390> sure<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.409> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it but I'm not exactly sure what it is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.719 
it but I'm not exactly sure what it is
yeah<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.549> mean<00:01:59.880> maybe<00:02:00.179> we<00:02:01.100> wanted<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.250> record

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
yeah I mean maybe we wanted this record

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.919 
yeah I mean maybe we wanted this record
to<00:02:02.939> kind<00:02:03.179> of<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.479> knock<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:05.929> like

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
to kind of really knock like like

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.830 
to kind of really knock like like
hip-hop<00:02:07.200> does<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> car<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.390> maybe<00:02:09.630> that's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
hip-hop does in the car and maybe that's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
hip-hop does in the car and maybe that's
because<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.709> town<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.220> spend<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.580> lot<00:02:11.700> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
because in that town you spend a lot of
