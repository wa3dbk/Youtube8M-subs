card is insane as constructed potential
I<00:00:56.010> don't<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:56.820> there

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
I don't think it's going to get there

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.869 
I don't think it's going to get there
but<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.199> possible<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> top<00:00:59.280> curve<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.730> like

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
but it's possible as a top curve to like

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
but it's possible as a top curve to like
a<00:00:59.910> white<00:01:00.030> weenies<00:01:00.539> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:02.039> of

haven't already seen the video

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.670 
haven't already seen the video
definitely<00:01:17.340> check<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:18.000> he's<00:01:18.210> fantastic

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
definitely check it out he's fantastic

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.950 
definitely check it out he's fantastic
but<00:01:19.680> I'll<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.759> two<00:01:20.820> cents<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.750> really

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
but I'll just my two cents it's really

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.649 
but I'll just my two cents it's really
strong<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.979> enchantment<00:01:23.240> instant<00:01:24.240> sorceries

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
strong for enchantment instant sorceries

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.740 
strong for enchantment instant sorceries
are<00:01:25.080> cheaper<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> give<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> scry<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> car

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
are cheaper and give you scry not a car

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
are cheaper and give you scry not a car
that's<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> probably<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:29.100> much

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that's going to probably see much

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.960 
that's going to probably see much

playing in a standardized environment

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.609 
playing in a standardized environment
would<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.119> interesting<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> test<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.290> modern

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
would be interesting to test in modern

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.550 
would be interesting to test in modern
just<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.430> many<00:01:35.490> storm<00:01:35.880> storm

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560

hierarch would be in the clash pack as

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.390 
hierarch would be in the clash pack as
well<00:04:45.820> so<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.420> card<00:04:46.690> which<00:04:47.350> is<00:04:47.500> likely<00:04:47.680> likely

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
well so this card which is likely likely

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.280 
well so this card which is likely likely
to<00:04:48.730> see<00:04:48.880> some<00:04:49.150> some<00:04:49.630> former<00:04:49.930> player<00:04:50.170> or

hands<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.520> copies<00:04:55.420> and<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.660> probably<00:04:55.840> will

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
hands on copies and it probably will

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.410 
hands on copies and it probably will
