00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
we started in an era at the very

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.850 
we started in an era at the very
beginning<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.570> 1970s<00:00:45.570> Sangiovese<00:00:46.410> was

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
with Sangiovese so we started to use a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.689 
with Sangiovese so we started to use a
20%<00:00:56.820> approximately<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> Cabernet<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.489> must

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
the opposite well let's talk a little

the opposite well let's talk a little
bit<00:02:31.959> about<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.319> one<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.950> 204<00:02:33.489> spectator

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
bit about this one the 204 spectator

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.599 
bit about this one the 204 spectator

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.849 
selection in the August issue 95 points
so<00:02:39.609> pretty<00:02:39.970> serious<00:02:40.329> stuff<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:41.170> one<00:02:41.410> it's<00:02:41.650> a

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
so pretty serious stuff this one it's a

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.750 
so pretty serious stuff this one it's a
classical<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.910> typical<00:02:44.069> tinea<00:02:45.069> law<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:45.639> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
classical and typical tinea law in the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.539 
classical and typical tinea law in the
sense<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.959> has<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.410> personality<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
sense that it has the personality of the

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.870 
sense that it has the personality of the
task<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.150> wine<00:02:49.359> but<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.840> style<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:51.549> bit

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
task and wine but the style is a bit

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.330 
task and wine but the style is a bit
different<00:02:52.180> from<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.690> classical<00:02:53.560> traditional

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
I think what's what's great about it is

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.559 
I think what's what's great about it is
is<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.940> has<00:03:01.230> really<00:03:02.230> beautiful<00:03:02.500> focused

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569
