00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.710 
imagine that okay look at the world you
got<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.159> mean<00:01:35.340> map<00:01:35.610> size<00:01:35.880> 36<00:01:36.540> times

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
got there if they mean map size 36 times

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.620 
got there if they mean map size 36 times
the<00:01:36.900> map<00:01:37.079> size<00:01:37.500> oh<00:01:37.680> my<00:01:38.100> freaking<00:01:38.610> guy<00:01:38.729> who

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the map size oh my freaking guy who

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
the map size oh my freaking guy who
cares<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.140> basically<00:01:40.590> infinite<00:01:41.189> chaos<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
cares it's basically infinite chaos you

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.389 
cares it's basically infinite chaos you
can<00:01:42.180> basically<00:01:42.360> put<00:01:42.810> everything<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.250> in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
can basically put everything you want in

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.380 
can basically put everything you want in
that<00:01:44.549> world<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.850> never<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that world and never have to go to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.690 
that world and never have to go to
another<00:01:45.630> map<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.200> 360<00:01:46.890> maps<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.369> hard<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
another map this 360 maps are hard to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.010 
another map this 360 maps are hard to
fill<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> almost<00:01:48.299> especially<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.899> you're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
fill up and almost especially if you're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
fill up and almost especially if you're
working<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.439> small<00:01:49.619> team<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.340> have

we're gonna have a trailer for it up
soon<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.390> anyways<00:02:06.689> love<00:02:07.619> these<00:02:07.860> pictures<00:02:08.099> are

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
soon so anyways love these pictures are

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.369 
soon so anyways love these pictures are
did<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> show<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> map<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> plus<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> what's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
did you show a map a plus the what's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.080 
did you show a map a plus the what's
code<00:02:10.530> shows

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
code shows

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.660 
code shows
now<00:02:11.750> let's<00:02:11.900> see<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.019> next<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:12.530> ps4<00:02:12.920> ps3<00:02:13.250> okay

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
now let's see the next one ps4 ps3 okay

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.089 
now let's see the next one ps4 ps3 okay
so<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.720> same<00:02:14.930> thing<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.680> distance<00:02:15.980> is

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
so it's the same thing the distance is

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.790 
so it's the same thing the distance is
fat<00:02:16.340> farther<00:02:16.940> than<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.720> ps3<00:02:17.959> which<00:02:18.650> is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
fat farther than it is on a ps3 which is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.350 
fat farther than it is on a ps3 which is
you<00:02:18.890> know<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.129> what<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.519> expect<00:02:20.000> from<00:02:20.090> it

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
you know is what you expect from it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.670 
you know is what you expect from it
because<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.110> said<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.440> previous

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
because like I said in the previous

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.009 
because like I said in the previous
pictures<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.970> distance<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.599> bigger

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
pictures is that the distance is bigger

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.530 
pictures is that the distance is bigger
and<00:02:24.349> better<00:02:24.680> hey<00:02:25.250> guys<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.879> they<00:02:26.060> said<00:02:26.239> it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
and better hey guys so they said it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.330 
and better hey guys so they said it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.220 
looks more it looks kind of the same as
a<00:02:28.370> pixelated<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:29.690> we<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:29.930> what<00:02:30.170> do

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
than maybe we're getting a texture packs

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.410 
than maybe we're getting a texture packs
that<00:02:37.129> are<00:02:37.280> way<00:02:37.730> better<00:02:37.940> than<00:02:38.120> what<00:02:38.180> they<00:02:38.390> are

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
that are way better than what they are
