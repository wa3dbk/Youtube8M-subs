00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.710
 ale hello 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.210
 beat diego then we are here again 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.550
 208 again because we have been outside 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.610
 now we are back now 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.570
 inside we take a ride in in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.070
 208 and tell a little what what 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.420
 let's see here then let's see why 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.220
 as particular as out 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.480
 especially according to while inside 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 then we start from the steering wheel one of the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.100
 more innovative features seems 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.700
 almost an exact kart reduced diameter 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.649
 raised driver's position 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 compared to the steering wheel then point of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.690
 sight that goes to strike just the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.040
 dashboard above the part for the steering wheel 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.340
 in such a way as to give it its own 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.200
 immediately below the point we say focal in 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.180
 where I look at the road I immediately have it 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.090
 under this a greater attention 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.520
 in fact it is said that it is one of the few 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.550
 car where you can see the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.260
 information above the valve above the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.300
 flying usually got us used to 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.729
 seeing him here is not half moon instead 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.450
 we see it sub above during the most 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.360
 little one 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.360
 then of course I can adjust it 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.680
 I prefer that we are there 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.090
 we can see we give of a taxa area 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.550
 what we find 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.640
 and here we have a multifunction steering wheel 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.640
 with Bluetooth remote control commands 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.430
 about automatic station change 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.369
 I find everything really within reach of 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.540
 inch and almost inaccurate well I already have that 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.940
 we see these chrome insects 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:58.520
 worst day and stuffed to finish 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.110
 always to recruit leather seams and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.630
 wanted attention to details to 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.050
 detail listens to something instead 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.570
 we see on the picture as then on 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.890
 we have temperature control panel 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.010
 odometer tachometer engines e 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.080
 fuel gauge in the middle we know 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.440
 a digital display where we can see 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.230
 digital speed e 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.740
 odometer obviously partial e 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.480
 total then pressing this button here at 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.750
 see which second when they are has 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.250
 lost almost the center display changes 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.700
 we can see the residual autonomy 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.380
 instant consumption average consumption 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.150
 in short, it is true to accomplish al 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.050
 wall or the programmed radio station 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.940
 mycelia regarding speed 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.080
 that I can see it both in analog and 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.810
 digital interesting borranea government o 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.830
 then here obviously they cannot discover 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.120
 in short, the central part that most 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.060
 interesting caritas competitions a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.350
 gelding even an ipad 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.440
 inside the car inside 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.150
 the car is in fact given to us 20 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.000
 simply floor these keys 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.300
 we can go to scroll through the various menus 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.120
 from here I can switch to functionality 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.970
 radio calls cerea choose 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.350
 abstraction 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:30.050
 I prefer you have steps automatically 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.230
 I can then also possibly record 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.880
 up to 15 stations in memory and then 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.330
 always come back anyway 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.730
 france and obviously there is the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.860
 possibility to insert is to load 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.810
 on the navigator as an optional as 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.580
 works as an option can also be 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.519
 equipped with navigator aesthetics not 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.160
 change but in addition to the loaded maps 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.550
 the inter I understood I understood 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.330
 and then like other other functions 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.340
 ah sorry I do n't want to lose you for 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.000
 as for the radio there is the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.110
 bluetooth the bluetooth radio wanders it 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.750
 let's see here 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.280
 accessing from the economic point of view and that there is not 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.650
 we have bluetooth and music radio and 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.890
 photos even photos even read 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.790
 so I can take pictures 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.240
 photo via usb input etro see 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.200
 here it is I can connect any 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.200
 type of device 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.949
 arranged both an ipod apple an ipad a 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:40.509
 iphone or any other brand now yes 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:43.330
 yes yes yes to advertising is ok though 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:50.020
 let's say I can also upload point 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:52.419
 multimedia files other others understood 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.589
 let's say so features I see that 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.770
 we find the whole climate picture 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:05:02.259
 automatic dual zone in this version here 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.629
 I with these simple women go 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.360
 to regulate the temperature, however, is one 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:12.009
 part and on the other right side left 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.460
 a born start we want ventilation 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:18.849
 or we press the auto button from 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.949
 only I understood then if you want to dwell 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.620
 also on this another feature 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.899
 which is usually found on version a 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.749
 bit higher than the interior mirror range 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:30.699
 electrochromatic that darkens on its own 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:32.949
 sharpened by the high beams 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:37.330
 a bit like the glasses lenses for 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:41.110
 the transition to not advertise a 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.770
 blow and always gave the old man with 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.800
 we cannot see the objective here 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.810
 quietly even at night 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.430
 and here instead what is not possible 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:06:01.959
 were the lights we call internal interiors a 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:05.110
 led or then the interiors clearly have 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:07.120
 aside a lacquered part is chromed which 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.770
 both the lacquered part that is chromed and 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:17.289
 in short, then we look for a drawer 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:19.209
 storage compartment here and windows in 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:27.159
 elements the window lift sorry 

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:28.779
 electric heated to heat the breads 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.270
 with the sweeping of the rear window 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:34.990
 back we also expand the 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.699
 rice mirrors regarding 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.339
 instead the fabrics finds a moment a 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:43.319
 move around look behind and see that 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:46.629
 however it is very very elegant as 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:49.300
 as a finish finish these things is a 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:51.819
 woven leather in this is a leather blend 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.699
 fabric that seriously about this type of 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.550
 version that the luhr three-door mini la 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.769
 a bit sportier version of the range 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.469
 also includes this particularity i 

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:05.979
 interior with mixed leather on woven leather 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:07.599
 obviously it seems to me that we have 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.089
 really made a nice overview 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:12.430
 on tenants 200 the other is 

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:13.860
 I forget something, let's say these 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.060
 are the main features 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.430
 groups for sure is that every now and then 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.649
 I think you don't make a fund well 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:26.919
 important that you see the car then here 

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:28.990
 we invite anyone who wanted to know about it 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:33.459
 more to visit us here with us at 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:35.800
 jesi we start in via gallodoro 63 di 

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:36.550
 in front of the shopping center of the same name 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.639
 Gallodoro 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:43.209
 is not true and there is the coop but then the 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:45.159
 most know us and here come a 

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:47.979
 discover if necessary also try it 

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:50.829
 logic if I can add if you have 

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:53.289
 also some information to ask 

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:55.449
 maybe even on the fly directly 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:57.729
 via the web there are new channels channels 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:00.610
 you can maybe try a company that 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:02.589
 ask to write what you want 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.990
 know we try we try to give you 

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:07.719
 clear answer in person and the 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.360
 what remains easier and faster for 

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:13.360
 today we also have these possibilities 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.169
 so for now I salute you and 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.169
 to the next
