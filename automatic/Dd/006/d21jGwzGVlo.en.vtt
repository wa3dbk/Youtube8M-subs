00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.399
 ok ok very good morning indeed we were 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.790
 very early here in the city of 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.550
 tlaxcala mexico I'm precisely going to 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.010
 show them today something that yesterday 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.640
 in a video that I took out really no longer 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.640
 I explained them 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.399
 if they remember, I put them about 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.009
 cuttings in water precisely that 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.800
 they were doing and root meaning 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.289
 to put it in some good way today they 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600
 I bring another thing I want to show you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.960
 this had previously shown 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.479
 in a video out there but today I want 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 show them the results of having them in 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:47.339
 water after some time if you notice 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.640
 well done and you will be seeing that already 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:53.400
 there are new roots in the bases or 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.009
 necks of these pretty violets 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.230
 African lady leaves in this 

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:02.870
 double heart case as they call it 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 I want you to see the development that has 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.930
 made precisely between the roots 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.880
 old have come new roots and the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.280
 part where something bald is 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.980
 had removed the roots at the time 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.990
 of having extracted him from the earth 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.260
 obviously it has generated new news 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.290
 this root guides that will serve us and 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.370
 will help us precisely at the moment of 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.970
 pass it to definitive substrate now this 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.970
 is one let's see the other one or is it better 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.140
 that is, if they realize this has greater 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.290
 amount of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.290
 We're going to eliminate this thing 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:56.130
 this is part of a foliage either of what 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:59.270
 what is this about the necks of the leaves 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.270
 or from some root 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:09.530
 is one of those in the good areas let's see 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.920
 evaluating you I notice that it is indeed 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 in very good condition, that's good 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.920
 only one shows guys boys and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.520
 girls 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.310
 I have had the water not up here 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.040
 obviously, I simply maintain that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 cover what is the part of the root does 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.230
 thus, precisely 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.650
 to avoid what are problems of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.650
 decay 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.790
 to this one 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.760
 now good what continues in these 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.639
 days is that I will go this one to look for a 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.129
 substrate that I'm going to use and I 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.859
 I'm going to show your planted while this 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.439
 it's a preview precisely about the 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.769
 way in which they have taken out the right root 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:59.650
 before doing it what is the pass to 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.810
 definitive substrate and subsequently 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.620
 these copies I keep showing you 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.079
 how is what the subscriber is done and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.650
 regardless of the subscriber the cut 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.959
 of sheets for what it is and to repair parts 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.540
 of the plant and in turn expect new 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.030
 blooms good anything anymore 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.019
 They know what not if they are interested in something else 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.239
 of the videos 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.469
 please ask any questions 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.669
 facebook or through an inbox if it is 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.099
 What do you think 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:33.209
 for any little thing we are pending 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.209
 chao and see you
