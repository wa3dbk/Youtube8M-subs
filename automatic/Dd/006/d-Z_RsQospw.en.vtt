so<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.870> Red<00:03:15.050> Rock<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.470> actually<00:03:16.099> three<00:03:16.490> leaves

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.130 

so<00:03:21.290> GPS<00:03:21.800> is<00:03:21.980> actually<00:03:22.310> giving<00:03:22.550> me<00:03:22.580> all<00:03:22.880> the

so GPS is actually giving me all the
statistics<00:03:24.430> runtime

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
statistics runtime

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.100

how<00:03:26.459> much<00:03:26.700> distance<00:03:26.940> higher<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.569> travel<00:03:27.989> on

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
how much distance higher to travel on

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.440 
how much distance higher to travel on
this<00:03:28.230> lane<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.310> what<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:30.030> be<00:03:30.060> near<00:03:30.299> each

this lane and what it is to be near each

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.850 
this lane and what it is to be near each
time

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
time

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.130 
time
and<00:03:32.340> where's<00:03:32.610> my<00:03:32.790> cutting<00:03:33.090> speed<00:03:33.390> as<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> city

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.820 
and where's my cutting speed as a city
this<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.680> incorrect<00:03:35.070> ask<00:03:35.460> me

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
this is incorrect ask me

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.170 
this is incorrect ask me
driving<00:03:37.460> in<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.910> they're<00:03:38.480> 65<00:03:38.930> is<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.710> mast

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
driving in and they're 65 is the mast

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.600 
driving in and they're 65 is the mast
speed<00:03:41.180> limit<00:03:41.510> on<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:41.990> highway<00:03:42.380> as<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.460> can

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
speed limit on this highway as you can

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.660 
speed limit on this highway as you can
see<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:44.000> speed<00:03:44.420> limit<00:03:44.720> go<00:03:44.900> for<00:03:45.260> 65

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
see the speed limit go for 65

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.200 
see the speed limit go for 65
so<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.450> cps<00:03:48.960> also<00:03:49.560> helps<00:03:50.010> me<00:03:50.250> identify

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
so the cps also helps me identify

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.540 
so the cps also helps me identify
alternate<00:03:52.140> routes<00:03:52.410> just<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.950> case<00:03:53.160> if<00:03:53.370> this

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
alternate routes just in case if this

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.510 
alternate routes just in case if this
route<00:03:53.910> is

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.610 

traffic<00:03:57.520> is<00:03:58.239> tight

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
traffic is tight

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.160 
traffic is tight
about<00:04:00.890> me

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.350 

reroute<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.130> another<00:04:04.400> after<00:04:04.550> network<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.330> that

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
reroute to another after network so that

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.410 
reroute to another after network so that
we<00:04:06.110> can<00:04:06.260> reach<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.740> destination

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.240 

so<00:04:09.810> right<00:04:09.930> now<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.170> hair<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.620> clear

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
so right now the hair is clear

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.340 
so right now the hair is clear
Bobby<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.940> see<00:04:13.150> us<00:04:13.330> over<00:04:13.540> again

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.060 

here's<00:04:17.350> our<00:04:17.620> traffic<00:04:19.019> slow<00:04:20.019> abandoned<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.889> for

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
here's our traffic slow abandoned so for

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.300 
here's our traffic slow abandoned so for
some<00:04:21.190> reason<00:04:21.220> when<00:04:21.880> they're<00:04:22.030> empty<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:23.310> certain

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
some reason when they're empty a certain

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.730 
some reason when they're empty a certain
kind<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.729> blockage<00:04:25.210> now<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:29.500> has<00:04:29.710> changed

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
kind of a blockage now it has changed

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.879 
kind of a blockage now it has changed
the<00:04:30.669> traffic<00:04:31.060> delay<00:04:31.300> on<00:04:31.479> their<00:04:31.660> own<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:32.050> now<00:04:32.229> 25

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
the traffic delay on their own is now 25

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.730 
the traffic delay on their own is now 25
minutes<00:04:33.280> new<00:04:33.850> arrivals<00:04:34.419> are<00:04:34.540> made<00:04:34.750> 59<00:04:35.169> a.m.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
minutes new arrivals are made 59 a.m.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.920 
minutes new arrivals are made 59 a.m.
there<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.400> another<00:04:36.669> room<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.270> 15<00:04:37.660> minutes

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
there is another room that is 15 minutes

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.479 
there is another room that is 15 minutes
faster<00:04:38.560> do<00:04:39.040> you<00:04:39.220> want<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.639> take<00:04:39.850> this<00:04:40.000> route<00:04:40.710> No

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:44.489 

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:47.469 

staying<00:04:45.489> on<00:04:45.699> current

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
staying on current

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.989 
staying on current
so<00:04:48.080> as<00:04:48.349> I<00:04:48.469> said<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:49.370> will<00:04:49.550> identify<00:04:49.669> the

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999 
so as I said it will identify the

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.499 
so as I said it will identify the
traffic<00:04:50.509> delays<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.819> prompt<00:04:52.819> me<00:04:52.999> for<00:04:53.270> an

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
traffic delays and prompt me for an

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.510 
traffic delays and prompt me for an
alternate<00:04:53.900> route<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:54.379> I<00:04:54.650> don't<00:04:54.919> want<00:04:55.219> to<00:04:55.279> go

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
alternate route so I don't want to go

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.760 
alternate route so I don't want to go
with<00:04:55.699> the<00:04:55.759> alternate<00:04:56.059> route<00:04:56.210> this<00:04:56.659> time<00:04:56.770> so

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
with the alternate route this time so

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.089 
with the alternate route this time so
I'm<00:04:58.279> continuing<00:04:59.469> so<00:05:00.469> that's<00:05:00.740> an<00:05:00.830> excellent

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
I'm continuing so that's an excellent

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.769 
I'm continuing so that's an excellent
scenario<00:05:01.819> where<00:05:02.120> we<00:05:02.150> can<00:05:02.509> able<00:05:02.599> to

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:02.779 
scenario where we can able to

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.809 
scenario where we can able to
demonstrate<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.499> GPS<00:05:03.919> functionality<00:05:04.400> for

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
demonstrate the GPS functionality for

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.200 
demonstrate the GPS functionality for
traffic<00:05:05.240> delays<00:05:05.919> so<00:05:06.919> we'll<00:05:07.069> more<00:05:07.279> so<00:05:08.059> now<00:05:08.180> I

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
traffic delays so we'll more so now I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.680 
traffic delays so we'll more so now I
think<00:05:08.330> it's<00:05:08.509> clear

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
think it's clear

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:19.420 
think it's clear
traffic<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.230> going

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.909 

so<00:05:20.430> as<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.639> mentioned<00:05:21.000> this<00:05:21.210> one<00:05:21.389> also

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
so as I mentioned this one also

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.869 
so as I mentioned this one also
practiced<00:05:22.919> Elaine's<00:05:23.280> son<00:05:23.879> was<00:05:24.180> asking<00:05:24.629> me<00:05:24.780> to

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
practiced Elaine's son was asking me to

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:31.100 
practiced Elaine's son was asking me to
be<00:05:26.879> on<00:05:27.030> my<00:05:27.060> left<00:05:28.159> here<00:05:29.159> I<00:05:29.219> see<00:05:29.550> reduced<00:05:30.150> little

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
be on my left here I see reduced little

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.730 
be on my left here I see reduced little
