that<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:30.900> could<00:05:31.080> improve<00:05:31.430> possibly<00:05:32.430> a

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
that it could improve possibly a

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.850 
that it could improve possibly a

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
side and also it's very expensive but

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.280 
side and also it's very expensive but
those<00:05:42.120> three<00:05:42.510> things<00:05:42.720> are<00:05:43.020> my<00:05:43.500> own<00:05:44.150> personal

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290
