00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi comrade, today I will talk about 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.170
 weapons that according to documents corr 5 5 6 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.820
 by patches with awards of 23 and by icon 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.219
 it seems from 21 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.380
 and in fact this is a real lawnmower and 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.240
 Brain knocked to those who took far 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.190
 create battlefield hardline left 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 several special amounts to them 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.210
 I had a whole slide of useful breaking 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.850
 the most interesting machine available 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 this corr 5 5 6 were known as galil 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.029
 from 23 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.189
 all galil rifles are made in israel 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.279
 based on Kalashnikov but with my feints 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.230
 About the series of this updated version slightly 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.420
 improved some details for more 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 ergonomics for example reloading left 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.980
 as well as more modern ones 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.010
 picatini guides and made a bias on 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.350
 durability of the materials of the model and of 21 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 22 and 23 designed under the caliber 5.56 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.969
 the length of the barrel and our weapons entirely 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.399
 option 23 is the longest of the line 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.379
 barrel four hundred sixty millimeters a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 whole design with open butt 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.699
 takes almost a meter that's why that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.100
 version of the machine that seems to be in the game 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 something different to me from 23 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.750
 it's too short card name 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.520
 56 scares the players for many incomprehensible 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 What was the question at all ? 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.720
 weapon manufacturers gave the opportunity 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 call so barrel in battlefield 4 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 but here is the battlefield hardline something is not 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.380
 it turned out the irony is that all the rewards 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 and stripes, as before, are 2 of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 23 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.780
 I broke my brain when I started to play with it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 barrel for murder marks are 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
 to corr 5 5 6 a flashing rewards 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 go for out of 23 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.520
 and this despite the fact that the trunk I learned by 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.100
 appearance but still somehow 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.689
 strange to say right away that corr 5 5 6 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.060
 is the most versatile 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.750
 machine of those that I met a series 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.700
 battlefield 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.189
 high accuracy and rate of fire and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.439
 tyazh yes and we are well corr 5 5 6 just 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.750
 huge store for 40 rounds of it on 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.939
 10 more than battlefield 4 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 so only 1 recharge is enough for 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.899
 successful killing two three enemies a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.149
 sometimes more of them if 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.100
 allow conditions such as enemies are worth 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.930
 tight group your enemy often 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.119
 has time to recharge a couple of times 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.489
 when are you still spending one store 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.200
 the same aiming speed is obtained 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.300
 only a little slower than him 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.490
 pistols machine gun 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.100
 So there are 23 characteristics 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.610
 hardline battlefield are damage 24 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.260
 Accurate 60 range 50 and stability 75 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.600
 rate of fire is consistent 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.880
 the real prototype is 700 shots in 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.370
 minute and from fire modes available 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.260
 automatic and semi-automatic separate 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.540
 There is no burst mode. 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.970
 the capacity of the store as I said is equal 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.970
 40 for 20 kill all open 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.460
 sights for 50 accessories at 70 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.680
 trunk modifications and after 90 kills 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.050
 you can select the handle after opening 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.030
 slots you have to buy a kit and before 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.500
 their installation in the purchase occurs for 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.960
 in-game dollars which 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.640
 earned for success in battle set 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.950
 any open sight can 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.440
 given the layout of the cabins in the battlefield 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.200
 hardline sight with a zoom for carp 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.540
 56 will be needed rarely and will ruin your game. 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.880
 at short and medium distances however 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.810
 there is a place in realistic fights if you 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.240
 hardcore player 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.460
 By the way, I took a cobra rds since he 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.560
 is the most open and saves 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.600
 very clear visibility as in sight so 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.330
 and there are accessories around it 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.330
 the most different beveled fly beveled 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.209
 rds is about pro even smart flashlight and 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.610
 and laser designator I took info for 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.050
 more successful shooting from the hip but something 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.600
 somehow not very helpful 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.459
 how was the correspondent 5 5 6 full crap for 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.320
 shooting from the hip remained 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.300
 if you play on realism where there is not 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.130
 highlighting enemies for you there is an option with 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.410
 installation of optics or infrared 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.110
 rds sight with front sight laterally very 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.820
 successful equipment and without realism 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.340
 this kit will be a place in the game 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.260
 the third major upgrade is the trunk 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.270
 here the sea options but the most 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.930
 universal thickened barrel in 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.209
 hardline 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.620
 he changed his role and you leads 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.390
 decrease a staci 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.820
 and is especially useful when shooting at 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.340
 long distance with a thickened barrel 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.200
 queue falls extremely close even through 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.390
 half a card if the arms are straight and 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.550
 know how to compensate for the return of a struggle 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.590
 effective at distances greater than 200 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.720
 or 300 meters after installing this 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.940
 fashion I began to steadily get rid of 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.760
 snipers wherever they seem 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.769
 Correct 5 5 6 of 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.229
 arms it is better to put the inclined or 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.180
 short slope and reduces recoil when 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.080
 first shot but here she is not particularly 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.819
 much it 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.319
 that the short grip will be more 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.689
 universal especially paired with 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.879
 thickened trunk is most effective and 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.099
 out of 23 against infantry at medium 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.840
 distances by the way I highly recommend 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.909
 use small arms against 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.159
 most types of technology for always 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.110
 it turns out a waste of a bullet or even 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.360
 life will attract some helicopter 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.120
 on his head, he quickly sets 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.800
 why do you damage him from 23 equally 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.449
 well suited for small cards 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.520
 for example quarters or hollywood 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.840
 hills and scale maps in the role 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.909
 wilderness everglades 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.009
 or city center anyway you 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.750
 need to navigate the head and neck so 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.240
 that the first shot put in the chest a 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.400
 the rest will fall just in the head from 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.199
 thighs of 23 can only be useful in 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.770
 emphasis and if in giran home on your 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.990
 to the side 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.669
 single shot does not have 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.159
 meaning even at very long distances 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.900
 manual first aid kit and work short 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.840
 bursts will give much more chances 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.430
 hits and damage per minute even in the case 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.349
 duel with a sniper on a very big 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.750
 distance you will have a chance to beat him 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.789
 ZAO couple of good turns and 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.800
 snipers most often think that hit 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.139
 according to him by chance and not even from the spot 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.110
 shift once more and when they start 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.279
 or 5 then how are you already late 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.960
 the only drawback of this weapon 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.300
 in the game can be noted the lack of ammunition 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.909
 that your teammates aren't 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.770
 especially likes to dump it though 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.839
 hardline cartridges are available on the card that 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.550
 slightly smooths this feature to 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.889
 Sorry almost always after five or six 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.870
 successful killings have to switch 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.150
 on the gun look for ammo and this 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.460
 fraught with meeting with those who are still looking for you 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.560
 for the sake of revenge, I highly recommend the trunk to everyone 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.199
 who wants to work on infantry for any 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.330
 distance weapon available for operator 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.069
 so you are in vain called medic this trunk 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.729
 available only to those who 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.020
 pre-order the game or take the creation far 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.789
 Subscribe to the game you do not put 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.360
 likes and leave comments under this 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.490
 video 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.289
 this is how you vote for games that 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.069
 We will shoot with you was Arseny 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.069
 peaceful bye
