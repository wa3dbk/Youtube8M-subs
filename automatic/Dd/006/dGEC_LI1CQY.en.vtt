let's do like this and hold down oh it
actually<00:01:20.240> did<00:01:20.770> ok<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:21.830> maybe<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.189> maybe<00:01:22.430> that

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
actually did ok so maybe it's maybe that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.219 
actually did ok so maybe it's maybe that
block<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.150> like<00:01:23.299> that's<00:01:23.750> not<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.020> problem

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
block is like that's not the problem

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.620 
block is like that's not the problem
it's<00:01:24.380> ok<00:01:24.650> out<00:01:24.920> something<00:01:25.159> fresh<00:01:25.430> see<00:01:26.390> if<00:01:26.479> that

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
it's ok out something fresh see if that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.240 
it's ok out something fresh see if that
that<00:01:27.290> doesn't<00:01:27.500> don't<00:01:28.310> make<00:01:28.369> me<00:01:28.460> my<00:01:28.700> words<00:01:28.939> game

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
that doesn't don't make me my words game

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.620 
that doesn't don't make me my words game
don't<00:01:31.250> make<00:01:31.400> me<00:01:31.460> don't<00:01:32.090> make<00:01:32.150> me<00:01:32.210> have<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:32.600> a

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
don't make me don't make me have to be a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.260 
don't make me don't make me have to be a
liar<00:01:32.869> ok<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.130> let's<00:01:34.250> try<00:01:34.400> with<00:01:34.549> this<00:01:34.640> one<00:01:34.850> we

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
liar ok so let's try with this one we

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.030 
liar ok so let's try with this one we
push<00:01:35.509> on<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.750> block<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.259> then<00:01:36.409> we<00:01:36.500> choice<00:01:36.770> one

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
push on the block and then we choice one

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.179 
push on the block and then we choice one
next<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:38.110> Oh<00:01:39.110> see<00:01:39.560> there<00:01:39.680> it's<00:01:39.979> like<00:01:40.040> it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
next to it and Oh see there it's like it

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.880 
next to it and Oh see there it's like it
throughout<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.939> last<00:01:41.210> block<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:41.869> had<00:01:42.110> so

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
throughout the last block that I had so

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.499 
throughout the last block that I had so
that's<00:01:43.040> kind<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.220> weird<00:01:43.369> but<00:01:43.909> it's<00:01:44.060> cool<00:01:44.240> I

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
that's kind of weird but it's cool I

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.880 
that's kind of weird but it's cool I
don't<00:01:44.810> think<00:01:44.869> let's<00:01:45.290> see<00:01:45.380> if<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.530> works<00:01:45.650> skin

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
don't think let's see if it works skin

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.569 
don't think let's see if it works skin
I'm<00:01:46.130> pretty<00:01:46.880> sure<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.180> doesn't<00:01:48.130> ya<00:01:49.130> know<00:01:49.369> see

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
I'm pretty sure it doesn't ya know see

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.100 
I'm pretty sure it doesn't ya know see
like<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.509> held<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.750> down<00:01:50.780> forever

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
like so then I held it down forever

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.410 
like so then I held it down forever
let's<00:01:52.040> see<00:01:52.130> if<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.340> works<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.610> time<00:01:52.670> see<00:01:53.329> like

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
let's see if it works this time see like

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.789 
let's see if it works this time see like
that<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.840> if<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.049> get<00:01:54.229> something<00:01:54.439> out<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.650> the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
that so if you get something out of the

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.859 
that so if you get something out of the
book<00:01:54.920> out<00:01:55.040> of<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.189> chest<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.720> actually

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
book out of the chest and it actually

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.870 
book out of the chest and it actually
doesn't<00:01:57.200> work<00:01:57.500> properly<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.549> let's<00:01:58.700> say<00:01:58.820> you

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
doesn't work properly so let's say you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.999 
doesn't work properly so let's say you
want<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.689> don't<00:02:00.049> know<00:02:00.110> diamonds<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:00.770> want<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:00.979> I

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
want I don't know diamonds you want do I

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.950 
want I don't know diamonds you want do I
get<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.369> work<00:02:01.460> on<00:02:01.579> or<00:02:01.939> duplicate<00:02:02.360> diamonds<00:02:02.810> I

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
get to work on or duplicate diamonds I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.810 
get to work on or duplicate diamonds I
haven't<00:02:03.649> duplicated<00:02:04.070> any<00:02:04.220> on<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.460> world<00:02:04.700> but

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
haven't duplicated any on this world but

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
haven't duplicated any on this world but
I<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:04.970> another<00:02:05.119> world<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:05.570> did

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
I have another world that I did

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.319 
I have another world that I did
duplicate<00:02:06.320> them<00:02:06.470> on<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:06.829> here<00:02:06.979> let's<00:02:07.159> see<00:02:07.329> so

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
duplicate them on so here let's see so

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:09.490 
duplicate them on so here let's see so
if<00:02:08.689> you<00:02:08.810> take<00:02:08.929> something<00:02:09.110> out<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.349> chest

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
if you take something out your chest

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.749 
if you take something out your chest
like<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.709> said<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.920> can't<00:02:10.129> duplicate<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.549> but

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
like I said you can't duplicate it but

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.940 
like I said you can't duplicate it but
if<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:11.209> mind<00:02:11.540> something<00:02:11.870> like<00:02:12.469> during<00:02:12.799> this

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
if you mind something like during this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.069 
if you mind something like during this
save<00:02:13.309> and<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.359> been<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.629> your<00:02:14.689> inventory

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
save and it's been in your inventory

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.170 
save and it's been in your inventory
then<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.379> should<00:02:15.620> work<00:02:15.799> it's<00:02:16.609> a<00:02:16.999> little<00:02:17.059> bit

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
then it should work it's a little bit

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.680 
then it should work it's a little bit
glitchy

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
glitchy

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.300 
glitchy
you<00:02:18.050> know<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.320> got<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.470> play<00:02:18.950> around<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.280> little

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
you know you got to play around a little

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.880 
you know you got to play around a little
bit<00:02:19.580> see<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.360> sort<00:02:20.570> come<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:21.770> do<00:02:21.860> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
bit see the sort come on you can do it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.400 
bit see the sort come on you can do it
for<00:02:22.070> me<00:02:22.190> there<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.490> go<00:02:22.610> look<00:02:22.880> at<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:24.350> it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
for me there you go look at that so it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.810 
for me there you go look at that so it
actually<00:02:24.560> works<00:02:24.830> with<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.070> know<00:02:25.190> trees<00:02:25.790> a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
actually works with you know trees a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.270 
actually works with you know trees a
dirt<00:02:26.360> there<00:02:27.080> are<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.440> easy<00:02:27.620> things<00:02:27.950> for<00:02:28.130> me<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
dirt there are the easy things for me to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.010 
dirt there are the easy things for me to
get<00:02:28.370> my<00:02:28.460> hands<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.790> but<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.600> know<00:02:29.690> if<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.840> had

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
get my hands on but you know if I had

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.510 
get my hands on but you know if I had
the<00:02:30.170> other<00:02:30.230> things<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.740> was<00:02:30.860> mining<00:02:31.220> you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the other things if I was mining you

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.180 
the other things if I was mining you
know<00:02:31.640> diamonds<00:02:31.910> or<00:02:32.270> iron<00:02:33.230> blocks<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:33.920> anything

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
know diamonds or iron blocks or anything

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.040 
know diamonds or iron blocks or anything
like<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.310> as<00:02:34.640> long<00:02:35.210> as<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.450> mind<00:02:35.720> them<00:02:35.840> then

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
like that as long as you mind them then

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.990 
like that as long as you mind them then
it's<00:02:36.080> like<00:02:36.380> oh<00:02:36.500> agus<00:02:36.800> an<00:02:36.890> iron<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.370> iron<00:02:37.700> block

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's like oh agus an iron and iron block

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.430 
it's like oh agus an iron and iron block
and<00:02:38.180> down<00:02:38.300> block<00:02:38.600> wouldn't<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.020> work<00:02:39.260> you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and down block wouldn't really work you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.960 
and down block wouldn't really work you
need<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.620> get<00:02:39.740> them<00:02:39.860> right<00:02:40.430> then<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.910> there

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
need to get them right then and there

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.110 
need to get them right then and there
and<00:02:41.390> then<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.080> are<00:02:42.260> good<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.470> duplicate<00:02:43.160> okay

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
and then you are good to duplicate okay

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.820 
and then you are good to duplicate okay
well<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:44.360> hope<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.780> helped<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.260> think<00:02:45.710> this<00:02:45.770> is

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
well I hope this helped I think this is
