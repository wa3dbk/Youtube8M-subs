00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.400 
disabled right now because our the
distance<00:02:37.640> parameter<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.819> uh<00:02:40.489> disabled<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:42.410> you

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
distance parameter is uh disabled so you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.400 
distance parameter is uh disabled so you
know<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.370> shouldn't<00:02:44.850> really<00:02:45.030> matter<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.110> if<00:02:46.320> I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
know it shouldn't really matter but if I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.960 
know it shouldn't really matter but if I
want<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.709> look<00:02:46.830> for<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> game<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> standard<00:02:47.880> I

but<00:02:58.709> I'm<00:02:58.800> fairly<00:02:59.069> certain<00:02:59.220> these<00:03:00.209> screens

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
but I'm fairly certain these screens

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.820 
but I'm fairly certain these screens
don't<00:03:01.050> work<00:03:01.819> yet<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.989> we<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.290> save<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
don't work yet so we can save the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.199 
don't work yet so we can save the
profile<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.850> saved<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:10.700> I'm<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.910> sure

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
profile which it saved and I'm not sure

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.009 
profile which it saved and I'm not sure
if<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.420> can<00:03:12.450> actually<00:03:14.870> find<00:03:15.870> any<00:03:16.140> uh<00:03:16.260> any<00:03:18.019> people

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
if I can actually find any uh any people

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.330 
if I can actually find any uh any people
to<00:03:19.110> meet<00:03:19.290> up<00:03:19.410> with<00:03:19.440> or<00:03:19.709> not<00:03:20.239> but<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.040> like

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
to meet up with or not but this is like

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.560 
to meet up with or not but this is like
the<00:03:23.519> first<00:03:23.730> two<00:03:24.120> screens<00:03:24.739> it's<00:03:25.739> supposed<00:03:25.920> to

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
the first two screens it's supposed to

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.180 
the first two screens it's supposed to
I'm<00:03:27.570> supposed<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.019> be<00:03:28.170> able<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.709> matches

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
I'm supposed to be able to get matches

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.660 
I'm supposed to be able to get matches
at<00:03:29.519> this<00:03:29.730> point<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.239> i<00:03:30.450> don't<00:03:30.750> think<00:03:31.670> that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
at this point but i don't think that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.420 
at this point but i don't think that
feature<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.630> enabled<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:35.370> yet<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.170> i<00:03:37.430> just

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
feature is enabled just yet so i just

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.069 
feature is enabled just yet so i just
wanted<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.150> try<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.450> get<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.840> buzz

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
wanted to you know try to get to buzz

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.810 
wanted to you know try to get to buzz
going<00:03:40.560> because<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.250> important<00:03:41.760> for

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
going because it's really important for

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.250 
going because it's really important for
this<00:03:42.030> app<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:44.400> able<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.880> have<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.930> lot<00:03:46.230> of

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
this app to be able to have a lot of

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960 
this app to be able to have a lot of
people<00:03:46.620> install<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.220> right<00:03:47.250> away<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.700> launch

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
people install it right away on launch

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.590 
people install it right away on launch
so<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.630> people<00:03:48.989> can<00:03:49.140> actually<00:03:49.290> find<00:03:49.859> games

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
so that people can actually find games

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.000 
so that people can actually find games
so<00:03:51.600> maybe<00:03:51.959> what<00:03:52.260> kind<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.500> stuff<00:03:52.739> would<00:03:52.890> you
