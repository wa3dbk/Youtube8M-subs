 in football attracts a lot of politics 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.729
 because in fact they have not even wanted to, since the World Cup 98 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.989
 in the front we will say that it is not for a policy it was not necessarily% 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.390
 in the fashionable position the football talk there is always the passionate 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.329
 but she does not show up as a football fan it was not 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.250
 necessarily the best of things and then she all the politicians have done 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.869
 a little bit their products but coming out after the world-98 but the 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:32.800
 victory of the blues 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.150
 and it became 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.320
 when we have two by the footballer it's true that the media is asking a lot 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.600
 politics is on the subject but it's a real job phenomenon 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.660
 of society is unavoidable and 6% percent sometimes 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 recoveries 1 as we saw in south africa 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.940
 initially percent behind blueprints that have traits the result on the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.620
 ground 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.840
 and this famous moral crisis related to the nature of the goal are not known 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.150
 Unfortunately, politicians thought that what needed to be done 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 but it became a real state affair to the point that the fifa 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 he called to order the French state 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.930
 one day the golden ball can not say 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.450
 almost all football without exaggerating 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.510
 so yes as required in the best of the 80s he was a business lawyer 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.590
 by client what business he belonged to the deputies ortuno world 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.170
 and percent and in fact he turned on the Portuguese was de to take over the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.780
 Valenciennes club that was at the time 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.920
 this bankruptcy filing 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.970
 he so he had made a recovery plan is there he also bought back the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.080
 club in 1987 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.990
 he took over the club he became president he presided over a few 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.729
 years and per cent is 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.539
 the swiss pays more its valencian popularity the taking of bets that do not 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.700
 did not know the region at all 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780
 it became a star in polymer that can be said a star 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.090
 of a local figure and that allowed him to get ahead of his political career of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 present at the municipal elections who won him in 4th and 8th he 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.240
 was triumphantly re-elected in 2001 and in 1995 and 2000 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.770
 he returned to politics thanks to football thanks to his success with the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.140
 club because he really straighten that club for samba then he's a little 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.150
 little less present the best but an anecdote elsewhere compared to that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.200
 a few years ago I think that in 2006 when the club went back to league 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.860
 1 he was attending the last decisive encounter for the climb he was 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.930
 acclaimed by the supporters and tightening a policy be the departure of 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.930
 deschamps wear in a football stadium 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.639
 the states-general of sarkozy lyrics launched his wheel the world of 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.129
 crisis of the team of France the company of the workshops mourning and summer 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.679
 to work at other practical work end of work anyway 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.989
 between specialists of the question this wish of people from the world of football and 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.319
 some policies in direct relation with the world of football 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.299
 so there is not really any interference whose powers involved in 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.789
 affection after that's going to bring the world not know but% the 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.749
 French football needs anyway the best stanford 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.559
 reasons to change something 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.339
 so that can be a good thing but in larger cities are 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.679
 dangerous
